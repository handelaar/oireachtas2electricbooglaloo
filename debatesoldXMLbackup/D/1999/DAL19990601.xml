    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 11 together.</P>
      <P>The Tánaiste and I met with the President designate of the European Commission, Mr. Romano Prodi in Dublin on Thursday last, 27 May.  This was the latest in a series of meetings between the President designate and Heads of State or Government.  In the light of the recent coming into force of the Amsterdam Treaty provisions, Mr. Prodi is in a significantly stronger position than his predecessors in forming a Commission.  We discussed the shape of the Commission and the need for balance in designing portfolios.  Mr. Prodi outlined his plans for reform of the Commission services and we also discussed the balance of relationships between the institutions of the EU.  I made the general point that it should be no part of the purpose or effect of Commission reform to reduce in any way the Commission's role as established under the treaty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have already indicated to the House, the Tánaiste and I did not discuss any names in regard to the Commissioner to be nominated by Ireland.  Mr. Prodi said that he was still developing his general programme and, accordingly, as regards portfolios, he indicated that he would not make a decision until after the European elections.  He pointed out that Commissioners across the range of portfolios will require key political and administrative skills.  In addition, it is his intention to match the portfolios to be distributed with the personal experience <Col N="1187" /> and attributes of individual nominees.  In this way, he hopes to form a strong Commission with a much more equally matched set of portfolios than in previous Commissions.</P>
    <P>Mr. Prodi expressed his confidence that Ireland would nominate a candidate who would be of sufficient calibre to take a high profile position.  I reminded him that Ireland has established a good tradition of nominating very able personalities who have done well in handling important portfolios in the Commission and indicated that this is a tradition we wish to uphold.  While I look forward to working with Mr. Prodi and discussing with him the wide range of issues facing the EU, on this occasion, apart from the above topics, we did not discuss any other matters.</P>
    <P>I received the letter, normally issued in advance of a European Council by the Presidency setting out its priorities, from Chancellor Schröder yesterday, 31 May.  These priorities include the situation in Kosovo, the European employment pact, institutional reform - specifically the handling of certain issues which were not resolved at Amsterdam, and common foreign and security policy, including the nomination of the high representative for CFSP.  The Chancellor indicated that the summit will review developments with regard to European security and defence.  He also proposes an exchange of views with Mr. Prodi on the future work of the Commission and the required reforms.  He has also listed duty free as a matter for discussion at Cologne.  I spoke with Chancellor Schröder by telephone last night.  Our conversation focused on the issues outlined in his letter.  I also spoke yesterday with the Austrian Chancellor, Mr. Viktor Klima, on the range of issues due to arise at the summit.</P>
    <P>I received a letter last Friday, 28 May, from the French Prime Minister, Mr. Lionel Jospin, on duty free.  In essence this called for a re-examination of the duty free issue at Cologne with a view to seeking an extension beyond the end of June.</P>
    <P>I met with the President of Portugal, Dr. Jorge Sampaio, in Government Buildings yesterday.  I also attended a State dinner held in honour of the President Sampaio last night and hosted a lunch for him today.  During our meetings, we discussed the current situation in Kosovo, Ireland's economic performance and EU issues, in particular institutional reform and enlargement.</P>
    <P>We also discussed the position of East Timor.  I commended the President for what has been achieved as a result of the agreement with Indonesia signed in New York on 5 May.  The Portuguese Government has been central in promoting the peaceful resolution of the situation in East Timor.  I expressed our full support for the proposed EU joint action and UN proposals for providing substantial humanitarian and other assistance to the Timorese people.  I look forward to the resolution of the constitutional referendum to be held on 8 August.  Finally, I will meet briefly with Prime Minister Blair in Cologne <Col N="1188" /> tomorrow evening prior to the start of the summit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach think that President Milosevic's acceptance of the G8 principles is genuine?  If so, what is his view on continued bombing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will await the reports on Wednesday from my colleagues.  I discussed this matter with Herr Schröder last night and Mr. Viktor Klima yesterday.  An effort is being made by the Finnish President, who is likely to go to Belgrade before he goes to Cologne and to report to the European Council on the situation.  It is quite clear that all three intermediaries - Mr. Chernomyrdin, Mr. Talbot and the Finnish President - are making some progress.  The exact extent of that is not clear and, from what I have been told by colleagues who are closer to this than I, it is likely that a considered effort will be made this week, but there is no certainty about the outcome.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>At this stage does the Taoiseach believe that the bombing is contributing to a diplomatic settlement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Needless to say, I would prefer if there were no bombing but I am conscious that the ethnic cleansing and atrocities required some response.  If there is a realistic chance of a resolution, NATO, the body involved in the bombing, will reflect on that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the Taoiseach's view?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not involved in the bombing campaign and I do not have any knowledge about either the intelligence behind the bombing or the state of mind of President Milosevic.  I am not in a position to make that judgment.  I am aware of the diplomatic efforts being made and will hear more about those from the President of Finland.  I would like to see the bombing stopped if there is a diplomatic solution, but if not, that is not a likely possibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>At the European Council meeting in Cologne, will the Taoiseach support a temporary cessation of the bombing to facilitate a diplomatic solution to this horrendous conflict?  Will the Government express a particular political point of view at that meeting?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be using my voice, as I did in April, to request people to do everything possible to find a diplomatic solution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Specifically, a temporary cessation of bombing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The President of Finland has taken up the mantle of the EU on this issue and <Col N="1189" /> if he believes that that would be useful, I will of course support it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach said that President designate Prodi outlined his plans for the reorganisation of the European Commission.  What form is that likely to take?  Will he reduce the number of directors general and divisions within the Commission group?  Will he reallocate responsibilities within the Commission, leaving aside the composition of the Commission and those who might be appointed to it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Most of the discussions with Mr. Prodi should be considered tentative and should not be made public.  Generally, as he told the media, he is reforming the posts to try to ensure that there is an even balance and that responsibilities are shared more equally than in the past.  That means moving a number of responsibilities around.  He also intends using two vice presidents who would not necessarily have portfolios, although that is not finalised, but who would be responsible for liaison and close co-ordination with the Parliament on one side and with internal reform on the other.  That is what he wants to do.  He wants to have a strong Commission where all the posts are as near as equal as is possible in any collegiate group.</P>
      <P>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach stated that Mr. Prodi said he was looking for people with political and administrative skills to be nominated by the various Governments.  I know that the nomination process will not take place until after 11 June but can we deduce that a person with political experience from this country will feature and not someone from the business world?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised that issue because I was anxious to know what Mr. Prodi thought but his strong reply was that the enhanced role and involvement with Parliament requires a person who has had considerable political experience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the intergovernmental conference which is likely to be launched in the next year or two in preparation for enlargement, what views on institutional reform has the Taoiseach put forward in his conversations with Chancellor Schröder and others?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Some issues remain from the Amsterdam summit which could be dealt with very speedily.  I am not in favour of making major changes in qualified majority voting or in some of the other substantive and fundamental issues which were not resolved in Amsterdam.  With many member states, I hold the view that fundamental change should not predate the enlargement summit will take place in the autumn.  That view is not shared by everybody but it is shared by a number of colleagues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1190" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach referring to treaty changes or simply administrative changes?  If he is not willing to agree to movement on qualified majority voting - and such changes should not be made in isolation if they are to be made - what changes would he be willing to accept? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of categories which come under the heading of qualified majority voting might not create difficulties.  Nor would a series of minor administrative issues which were not resolved at Amsterdam.  I would not have any difficulty in accepting those.  Treaty changes should not be considered until the autumn session when the decision on enlargement has been finalised.  That, with the debate on common security policy, will lead to more fundamental issues.  These issues will not be resolved before the period of the Portuguese presidency and Portugal will have a substantial role to play in that debate.  The debate may continue into the period of the French presidency next year. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Why does the Taoiseach need to wait for reports on Wednesday before expressing a view on the bombing of Yugoslavia?  Does he agree with the view, expressed by Mr. Gene Kerrigan in the <i>Sunday Independent, </i>that as long as the United States is in favour of bombing, the Irish Government will not express a view on it or on the wider question of Partnership for Peace and the public's wish for a referendum on that question?  Can the Taoiseach explain the reports which suggest that Shannon Airport is playing a role in conveyancing cargo and personnel involved in the conflict in Yugoslavia?  Has a decision on this matter been taken by the Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Shannon Airport has no involvement in any of these matters.  I will be very glad to see the end of the bombing campaign and of hostilities.  However, there must be a resolution to the issue and the terms of that resolution must be satisfactory for the people who have been driven from their homes and for the relatives of those who have been savagely and brutally murdered.  If even 10 per cent of intelligence reports are correct, formidable humanitarian problems remain to be dealt with.  Mr. Milosevic should not be given an easy passage out of this conflict.  That would not be right.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> What did the Taoiseach say to the President of the Commission, Mr. Prodi in response to his call for an armed wing for the EU?  Did he tell Mr. Prodi that the vast majority of the Irish people reject the militarisation of Europe and any involvement of this country with arms dealing cartels?  In  his conversation with Chancellor Schröder and other leaders, did the Taoiseach express outrage at the appalling and growing toll taken on  innocent civilians - ethnic Albanians including refugees, and innocent Serbs - by NATO bombing and, in par<Col N="1191" /> ticular, by the use of cluster bombs in residential areas?Is the Government capable of taking an independent stand on the question of bombing separate from the major military powers in NATO?  Does the Taoiseach accept that the plight of hundreds of thousands of innocent ethnic Albanians has been made worse as a result of the bombing and that they are suffering from appalling misery of which there is no let-up?  If the brutal regime of Milosevic should be punished by the boycotting of a football match between this country and Yugoslavia, which many would support, does the Taoiseach agree that the bombing of a sanitorium and an old folks home by NATO should equally draw censure from this country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not discuss with Mr. Prodi one of the suggestions he is said to have made in a recent interview with the media.  There is some discussion about the precise content.  The issue of primary importance to the European Union is the enhancement of its potential for peacekeeping in line with the Petersberg tasks.  That is what we should be concentrating on in line with the Amsterdam Treaty.  Whether it be murdering innocent people in Racak or bombing, I would like it to be brought to an end.  I hope this can be achieved by the diplomatic efforts being made.  We are not a party to decisions on the bombing campaign about which we have spoken on numerous occasions.  We would like the issue to be resolved as soon as possible and have offered advice at every European Council&mdash;</P>

Will he confirm that these proposals are to be considered at the summit in Cologne which he will attend and that they involve giving the European Union a military capacity?  What is the Government's attitude to this?  Will the Taoiseach also confirm that the proposals involve the abolition of the Western European Union and the absorption of its functions into the European <Col N="1192" /> Union and that the declaration agreed by the Foreign Ministers yesterday, which I understand is a substantial document, also commits European Governments to overhauling their defence capacities?

What form the document to the European Council should take is another matter.Yesterday I, and representatives of a number of other countries, made our views known to the Presidency that any of the matters under Article V, particularly those that relate to a common security policy and to the Western European Union moving straight into the EU, will not be discussed and certainly will not receive support from the neutral states.  That was the purpose I discussed with Viktor Klima and others.  These are matters which the Irish Government will not support.  I am not too sure what document will finally come to the European Council, but the Irish view and that of others, was certainly made known yesterday.  I do not believe many of the matters the Deputy mentioned will see the light of day in Cologne.</P>

      <P>In respect of the same matter, during the conversation he had yesterday evening with Chancellor Schröder, one of the items to which the Taoiseach referred was the appointment of a person with responsibility for articulating Europe's common foreign and security policy.  That is a decision in which the Taoiseach will have a role to play, unlike other matters such as the bombing of Kosovo.  Has the Government formed a view as to who that person will be?  Will the Taoiseach give a categoric assurance that he will not support the Secretary General of NATO as being the representative voice of a common foreign and security policy on behalf of the 15 EU nations, including the four neutral states, of which Ireland is one?</P>

The Taoiseach indicated his view that Article V issues will not be included.  Will he indicate what Article V issues are and what other issues may be included?  Does the Government have a view, for example, on a common armaments policy?  Does it have a view on the abolition of the Western European Union and its incorporation into the EU?

      <P>The first working session on Thursday morning will deal with aspects of the common foreign and security policy.  There will be a discussion on the common strategy of the Union in terms of Russia which was drawn up by the general council in accordance with the Vienna decision.  This will be followed by a discussion on European security and defence, the timetable for integration of the Western European Union into the EU and the necessary associated decisions.  We have expressed the view that Western European Union issues are not ready for that discussion, a position which will also be adopted by others.</P>

    <P>I received a letter from Chancellor Schröder yesterday and had a discussion with him last night.  His people will be working today on the document they will present, probably on Wednesday night or Thursday morning.  At this stage I do not see final decisions being made.  The chancellor will then move from this issue - he does not intend giving it much time.  I do not see how he intends to make a huge input in the time allocated from 11.00 a.m. to 12.30 p.m.  A number of countries have stated that clause 5 issues, which concern the Western European Union and the issues the Deputy raised earlier about the <Col N="1195" /> military capabilities of individual countries, will not be on the agenda.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the case that Article V relates to an automatic military alliance but that all the other clauses of the Western European Union treaty relate to other matters which do not necessarily imply an automatic coming to the aid of another state?  What is the view of the Government on whether the Western European Union should be incorporated into the EU?  Is the Taoiseach in favour of such incorporation?  I appreciate that the issue may not be ready for discussion in final form and that the Taoiseach is talking about a timetable, but regardless of a timetable and the detail, is the Taoiseach for or against subsuming the Western European Union into the EU in principle?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there would be any difficulty in subsuming many of the powers of the Western European Union into the EU.  However, the overall common and security policy powers which form the shell of the Western European Union cannot be subsumed, and there lies the difference.  Whether such powers are subsumed by NATO or remain as the shell of Western European Union is a matter for discussion.  I am against the EU subsuming all the Western European Union powers.  However, I have no difficulty with the powers which do not relate to any major change in common security policy.  The items in question have been listed previously.  For the past number of months the Government has stated that the powers which form the shell of Western European Union should remain with the Western European Union or be subsumed by NATO.</P>

We have stated categorically we are not in favour of them being discussed or debated or of those coming into the EU.  There are other effectively administrative  issues which do not create the same problems or difficulties.    They could, in time, under a timetable to be discussed next Thursday, move into the EU.  The other issues would either then have to be considered as to whether they go to NATO or whether, as some have suggested, they stay in the shell of the Western European Union.  On the other side of the discussion, I will report what happened but that is my position going into the meeting.</P>

        <b>:</b> If I understood the Taoiseach correctly in answer to my earlier question, he said  he did not comment to Mr. Prodi about Mr. Prodi's call for an EU army.  Given that the Taoiseach said to me one or two weeks ago in the Dáil that he was totally opposed to an EU army or to this country being involved in any such process, is it not astonishing that the Taoiseach did not take the opportunity to tell the President of the Commission that he disagreed with that and that this country would have nothing to do with it? When the Taoiseach constantly tries to wash his hands of any responsibility for the appalling toll of innocent casualties in Yugoslavia as a result of NATO's bombs and cluster bombing, does he not accept that he and the Government carry a responsibility?  Even though, as he says, he is not part of the day to day planning of these missions, when he, with other EU leaders, signed a statement about two months ago to the effect that the bombing campaign&mdash;</P>

    <P>We used last week's agenda, which was a single item agenda, to discuss the make up of the new Commission, the portfolios, the structures, the changes and the amendments which Mr. Prodi hopes to make and the relationships with Parliament and with Government.

He referred to this matter being discussed by him and Chancellor Schröder and that he had a telephone call from Lionel Jospin on this matter.  Does he expect an extension of time for the administration of duty free sales; and, if so, will he take steps to ensure that Stena Sealink and other companies reverse their decision to increase passenger and related fares on ferries after the end of June this year because of the proposed abolition of duty free sales?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I know an effort will be made to try to find some way of extending the date, probably based on the French proposal as it is the only one which will receive any support.  I am not overly confident, because last week the ECOFIN Council was hostile to the proposal, to say the least.  There were few supporters for any extension. Even when strong efforts were made to get everyone on side over the course of three or four meetings of the European Council, one country made its position on the matter very clear.  Unanimity is required on this issue and I would be surprised if it were achieved.  I will certainly work with the French and British Prime Ministers and any others to achieve an extension.  However, it will be difficult.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On Tuesday last, I informed the House that the projects to receive funding under the Irish Sailors and Soldiers Land Trust Act, 1988, had been agreed.  This followed an assessment process undertaken by an interdepartmental committee which was established to evaluate all the proposals submitted.</P>
      <P>The Irish Sailors and Soldiers Land Trust Act, 1988, provides for the acceptance and disposal, on behalf of the Irish Government, of money received from the trust.  The Act provides that the money be disposed of for the purposes of projects or undertakings, including the Royal National Lifeboat Institution, involving co-operation between the State and Northern Ireland or the State and Britain or relating to the island of Ireland as a whole.</P>
      <P>In November last year, my Department placed advertisements in the national press, the Northern Irish newspapers and the <i>Irish Post</i> in Britain, inviting applications for funding in respect of projects which would promote mutual understanding and reconciliation between Britain and Ireland or between the State and Northern Ireland; sustain and develop ventures and/or activities on an island of Ireland basis or relating to the island of Ireland or promote the welfare of the Irish community in Britain.</P>
      <P>In assessing submissions, priority was given to organisations which would have difficulty obtaining commercial sponsorship or where the organisation or proposal would not normally or readily be funded by other Departments, statutory agencies or other public authorities, by reference to functions discharged or services provided.  Furthermore, because of the relative availability of funding from other sources for North-South co-operation, priority was accorded to projects or undertakings between the State and Britain and relating to the island of Ireland as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All 175 submissions received were considered on the merits of their proposals and none, regardless of their funding structure, were precluded from consideration.  The task of assessing the submissions was difficult.  I am satisfied with the <Col N="1199" /> assessment committee's recommendations and I am happy that we are now in a position to provide much needed assistance to 59 worthwhile projects.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the person who drafted that wonderful parliamentary reply which successfully avoids answering the question I asked.  Will the Leopardstown Park Hospital, set up to cater for people wounded in the two world wars, Irish citizens in the main, receive funding?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The reply endeavours to outline the type of projects which can be funded.  The application made by Leopardstown Park Hospital was considered by the assessment committee which did not recommend that money be provided from the fund for a number of reasons.  Hospitals are normally funded by the Department of Health and Children and health boards, as appropriate, as they are best placed to assess priorities among health institutions.</P>
      <P>Specific reference is not made to retired veterans in the Irish Sailors and Soldiers Land Trust Act and funding can only be provided for the purposes of such projects or undertakings, including the Royal National Lifeboat Institution, which involve co-operation between the State and Northern Ireland or the State and Great Britain or relating to the island of Ireland as a whole.  These aspects of the hospital's application did not stand up to scrutiny and that is why the project was ruled out.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is the logic, will the Taoiseach give an undertaking that the Department of Health will make moneys available to enable this hospital complete its development plans as a way of compensating for arbitrarily ruling it out of qualification when perhaps it is the most uniquely qualified body to benefit from this fund?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of replies to that question.  First, I received representations over a long period about Leopardstown Park Hospital from Deputy Quinn, Deputy Bruton &ndash; certainly members of Deputy Bruton's party &ndash; and other Deputies and I have followed those up with the Department of Health and Children to <Col N="1200" /> see what the Minister can do in terms of the application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Does that mean it will get extra money?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will have to ask the Minister for Health and Children, who will decide that.  He is aware of the need for it.  Second, in assessing the submissions the considered view of the committee was that it was not covered by the legislation.  I did not interfere with the applications but because I received a number of calls from Leopardstown Park Hospital and some other areas I asked that the  areas on which I received representation be carefully examined.  The considered view of the committee was that it did not come under the legislation.  Even if it did, it would have taken all the money that was available, but that was not the reason the committee rejected it.

      <P>Will the Taoiseach consider that the criteria which ruled out veterans from benefiting from aid from the Irish Sailors and Soldiers Land Trust has to be wrong?  Will he agree that the British Legion, for example, which represents Irish people, North and South, who fought against Nazism in the last war, many of whom were injured permanently in the battle for freedom, constitutes a genuine North-South interest and a genuine reconciling force between the two traditions on this island in the sense that people from both traditions gave their lives in this struggle against Nazism?  Will he agree it is wrong that we should pass legislation to dispose of assets created originally to house veterans, that it is wrong to pass legislation which, when the lands in question come to be disposed of, would disbar the same veterans from benefiting?</P>

Does he also agree that people are still suffering from the effects of their participation, particularly in World War II? Would he further agree that this is a unique hospital which cannot be treated in the same way as every other medical facility on the waiting list for capital grants?</P>
      <P>Having been arbitrarily debarred from consideration for this fund, will the Taoiseach give an undertaking that the next Estimates for capital spending on health will give specific recognition to the unique role of this hospital, contrary to the manner in which it was excluded from the beneficiary list for these funds?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>The holding, recovery or disposal of waste is subject to a general duty of care under section 32 of the Waste Management Act, 1996, in a manner which does not cause environmental pollution. Local authorities are empowered under section 33 of the Act to collect or arrange for the collection of waste, other than household waste.</P>
      <P>Three categories of waste batteries are defined as hazardous waste under the 1996 Act, namely, lead acid, nickel cadmium and mercury dry cell batteries. The recovery or disposal of hazardous waste is licensable by the EPA under the Waste Management (Licensing) Regulations, 1997, as amended. Existing recovery facilities, which have been subject to a permit system under the local authorities under the European Communities (Waste) Regulations, 1982, will be licensable by the EPA from 1 October 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1202" /> Under the Waste Management (Permit) Regulations, 1998, specified waste activities may be exempt from waste licensing so long as certain conditions are complied with. These include a requirement that such activity is carried on in accordance with a waste permit granted by the relevant local authority. The recovery of batteries containing mercury is one of the activities which may be subject to a local authority waste permit in lieu of a waste licence granted by the EPA. I have no function in relation to the enforcement of the licensing regulations or the implementation of the permit system operated by local authorities. The EPA is currently drafting a national hazardous waste management plan which will make recommendations for hazardous waste management and it is anticipated that this will include recommendations to local authorities regarding collection and reception systems for waste batteries.</P>
    <P>A programme for the management of waste batteries was published by my Department in 1997, in compliance with the requirements of Council Directive 91/157/EEC on batteries and accumulators containing certain dangerous substances.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister of State aware that persons operating in the market who are endeavouring to observe the conditions set down in the Act and in the regulations which the Minister of State said will be implemented from 1 October 1999, are being undercut by pirates who have no regard for the conditions for the disposal of batteries? Given that Ireland put its name to these directives how can the Minister of State tell the House that he has no function in this regard? Surely it is the Government's duty to ensure that local authorities fulfil their role of overseeing the day-to-day implementation of these regulations and this legislation?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>Part IV of the Waste Management Act, 1996, provides for the holding, collection and movement of waste. Part V of that Act provides for the recovery and disposal of waste. The Waste Management (Licensing) Regulations, 1997, provide for the operation and enforcement by the EPA of a system of waste licensing. The Waste Management (Permit) Regulations, 1998, provide for local authority permits for a range of activities, including those involving the recovery of waste containing mercury.</P>
      <P>The European Communities (Waste) Regulations, 1979, provide for the operation and enforcement by local authorities of a permit system which applies to persons treating, tipping or storing waste. The Waste Management (Hazardous Waste) Regulations, 1998, prohibit the marketing of certain types of batteries and provide for the marking of batteries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1203" /> Under the Waste Management Act, 1996, I have no responsibility for the operation of the licensing systems by local authorities. We agree with the Deputy's comments about giving more power to local authorities and the Minister has gone down this road. The new local government Bill will give greater powers to local authorities but we cannot have it both ways. There must be a balance. The Government does not have responsibility for policing local authorities. We will have an opportunity to address this issue later in the year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I disregard the last part of the Minister of State's reply as a smokescreen. The Minister of State mentioned an impressive list of regulations and legislation. However, why will this list not produce a result which will be mandatory on local authorities until 1 October 1999? Given that the Minister of State has finally admitted that the Government has a duty to police the operation of these measures, what does it intend to do which has not been done to date to police their implementation?</P>
      <P>The Minister of State may have no responsibility for the day to day operation but I am delighted that he has finally admitted that the Government has a duty to police these measures. What has it been doing to police the measures since the Waste Management Act was passed in 1996?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the forecast referred to by the Deputy and, while my Department does not publish projections of future house price levels, there is strong evidence that the range of measures being taken by the Government to remove over-heating in the housing market and accelerate housing supply is working.</P>
      <P>I expect that the forecast referred to may have been prepared before the very large increase in housing output in the first quarter of 1999 was known. New house completions for the first three months of 1999 were 24 per cent higher than in the same period last year. Most significantly, there was a 28 per cent increase in output in Dublin where housing output had been relatively sluggish in recent years.</P>
      <P>House price statistics for the March quarter 1999 are currently being finalised and will be published shortly. Provisional data indicates that the average price in Dublin for the March 1999 quarter is in the region of £142,000 for new houses and £150,000 for second-hand houses. These figures are derived from all loan approvals which will include some very expensive houses in premium locations. The average price paid by first time purchasers is significantly lower.</P>
      <P>The provisional figures for the March quarter reveal some encouraging trends. In particular, Dublin secondhand house prices, which have been the leading indicator of price trends for a number of years, suggest an increase of 1 per cent and a total increase of only 2 per cent over the last six months.</P>
      <P>I am confident that the trend of house price moderation will be further reinforced as the effects of measures taken to increase the supply of housing and the availability of affordable housing, including the serviced land initiative, promotion of increased densities, the new local authority affordable housing scheme and use of temporary treatment facilities to bring forward housing development, become increasingly evident.</P>

Is the Minister of State saying his Department does not know by how much house prices will increase this year or that it has no estimate of the increase? If economists are in a position to give an estimate of the increase in house prices, it is not unreasonable to ask the Minister of State and the Department with responsibility for housing to indicate to the House by how much they expect house prices to rise this year.</P>

It is a reasonable calculation and I would expect him to have information on what income threshold would be required to enable somebody to buy a house.

    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>The recently published report on water quality in Ireland, 1995-97, concluded that the overall condition of Irish waters remains satisfactory and compares favourably with the position in other European countries. The report did, however, record further increases in the levels of eutrophication, due primarily to excessive inputs of phosphorus to rivers and lakes.</P>
      <P>While sewage and industry are significant contributors to the overall phosphorus load to freshwaters, agriculture has been identified as the single biggest contributor to the eutrophication problem. Phosphorus losses from agriculture arise from inadequate waste management at farmyard level and from leaching and run-off from land, particularly following the spreading of slurries or the use of chemical fertilisers containing phosphorus.</P>
      <P>Since 1997 my Department has been pursuing a comprehensive, integrated strategy to tackle all sources of eutrophication. This is already beginning to show evidence of some improvements in water quality. The strategy is underpinned by the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act, 1977 (Water Quality Standards for Phosphorus) Regulations, 1998, which I made in July last year. The regulations set clear targets for reducing phosphorus levels in rivers and lakes within a ten year timeframe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The strategy is being supported by the Department's major £1.5 billion programme of investment in sewage infrastructure facilities throughout the country in the ten year period to 2005. This programme lays particular emphasis on the provision of phosphorus reduction facilities where a need is indicated in this regard. My col<Col N="1207" /> league, the Minister for Agriculture and Food, has substantial initiatives under way to tackle phosphorus inputs from agriculture, including the rural environment protection scheme and the proposed new control of farm pollution scheme.</P>
    <P>Following recent initiatives by the detergent industry, it is estimated that the phosphorous load from detergents will be reduced by about 50 per cent by mid 2000 with further reductions to follow thereafter. The strategy I am pursuing is designed to reduce phosphorus inputs from all sources. In this way, I am committed to achieving the improvements in water quality which are demanded by the phosphorus regulations.</P>

Of 64 instances of serious pollution, 28 were due to sewage. Is the Minister of State aware that his colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, recently indicated in replies to questions in this House that the majority of smaller towns do not have water treatment plants? Does he agree that as long as that continues to be the case, there will be an unsatisfactory position with regard to our watercourses, increasing danger of serious pollution and a continuing trend of moderate pollution?</P>

      <P>For approximately 30 years the issue of water quality was not addressed. The recent report by the EPA identified the problems which arose between 1994 and 1997. The Government has acted since then in many areas.</P>
      <P>The catchment based strategy against eutrophication is being pursued. There is a major investment programme in upgrading sewerage treatment facilities throughout the country. The capital provision this year for the water services investment programme is £275 million, a 50 per cent increase on the provision last year and a 100 per cent increase on the provision for the year before. There are major catchment based initiatives in loughs Derg, Ree and Lene and the rivers Suir, Boyne and Liffey.</P>
      <P>There are also the phosphorus regulations which I made in July last year. These provide for a target of no further deterioration in the quality of rivers and lakes. The EPA data for the period 1995 to 1997 will be used as a general benchmark for incremental improvements which must be achieved within a ten year timeframe. Two yearly reports will be provided by the EPA.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue of social <Col N="1209" /> integration and mixed tenure developments has been an important objective of housing policy for a number of years. The instruments used by the Department and local authorities in implementing this policy include the provision of infill local authority housing, voluntary housing and the direct provision of shared ownership housing. I also envisage the new affordable housing scheme will have an important role to play regarding mixed tenure housing developments.</P>
      <P>The issue of how the planning code can facilitate the provision of a suitable mix of housing types and the provision of social and affordable housing is an issue being considered as part of my review of the planning code. My proposals in this regard will be contained in the major Bill to reform and consolidate planning law which I aim to publish in June.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister confirm that, as matters stand, the greatest impetus for a mixture of social and private housing comes in the cases where private developers want to invest in large speculative developments and allocate a part of the area for which they have control to the local authority for local authority housing as an inducement to the local authority to grant them planning permission?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree it comprises the largest part but it arises in different areas. The social housing policy operated by the Department under this and previous Governments is delivered through infill local authority housing, voluntary housing, the provision of shared ownership housing and new affordable housing. Social housing policy is generally delivered by Governments and by local authorities, although an element is also be delivered by the private sector.</P>

Efforts such as those in County Wexford and in other local authority areas are encouraged by the Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of dwellings either purchased or started by local authorities in 1998 and in the previous five years was as follows: 1998 &ndash; 3,504; 1997 &ndash; 3,606; 1996 &ndash; 3,717; 1995 &ndash; 3,699; 1994 &ndash; 3,288; 1993 &ndash; 3,845. This information is published in my Department's annual housing statistics bulletin, copies of which are available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>Local authorities have already been authorised to start or acquire a further 4,500 houses under the 1999 housing programme. I have also introduced for the first time a four year multi-annual local authority housing programme to commence next year, which provides for 22,000 additional local authority houses. I have requested local authorities to set in train the necessary preparatory work to produce a pipeline of projects which will be ready to go to construction early in the new year.</P>
      <P>My purpose in introducing a multi-annual programme is to establish a local authority housing programme which will produce a streamlined delivery of housing output over the next four years. The experience to date of having to operate on a year to year basis has not been satisfactory in terms of forward planning for housing requirements, and the multi-annual approach will provide a better and more effective mechanism for social housing delivery.</P>
      <P>The local authority housing programme is the major contributor to social housing output, but it is not the only source of social housing. The voluntary sector has the capacity to make a significantly greater contribution to meeting social housing needs and I am determined to encourage and support a ten-fold increase in output by the voluntary sector over coming years.</P>

      <P>Local authority housing is not the entire response to social housing needs. The whole picture needs to be taken into account. Total social housing output last year, taking account of new local housing, vacancies arising in existing houses and output under other social housing measures, met the housing needs of 8,500 households. This year, when account is taken of expected house completions, vacancies which arise in the normal course of events and output from other social housing sources, I confidently <Col N="1211" /> expect the needs of 10,300 households to be met. This will make a significant impact on needs and I intend to increase social housing output over the next four years to meet the needs of 60,000 households.</P>

      <P>How can the Minister of State confidently predict figures for 1999 when in each of the two years he has been in office he has produced such a woeful number of local authority houses? What confidence has the Minister of State in delivering additional housing options for people on low incomes when the Government produced just over 3,000 houses in 1998 for the 46,000 applicants on the national housing list? Will the Minister of State also confirm that the percentage of capital expenditure on local authority housing last year was 6.9 per cent and was the lowest percentage of capital expenditure over the past five years? How can the Minister of State claim the Government is dealing with the issue of social housing when the expenditure it provides is woefully inadequate?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I have introduced a number of new programmes such as the affordable housing programme, which gives local authorities the opportunity to bring forward proposals to build houses that can be sold to people with incomes of £20,000 or less. I have placed no limit on the number of affordable houses local authorities can build. When they enter office, I urge those who are elected to the councils in the forthcoming elections to take full advantage of the affordable <Col N="1212" /> housing scheme.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>As already stated, this scheme falls under the rural towns and villages initiative. This initiative, in respect of which £45 million was allocated in the budget, is designed to bring water and sewerage facilities to rural towns and villages throughout Ireland. Once a scheme has been announced and funding allocated, that funding is made available. The scheme's commencement then rests with the local authority concerned and is dependent on the speed with which it produces proposals and documents.</P>
      <P>There will be no delay in the scheme's commencement from the Department's point of view because the relevant funding has already been made available. Commencement now depends on the speed with which Waterford County Council can finalise its proposals. I understand the council is in a position to appoint consultants to prepare the contract documents. When that happens, it will be in a position to invite tenders.</P>

In this context, my Department, along with other relevant Departments, has submitted proposals to the Department of Finance for funding for a range of infrastructural measures over this period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In assessing infrastructural needs generally, my Department draws on its long experience and that of the local government sector and the National Roads Authority in managing the programmes concerned at central and local level. The Department has also been assisted by various analyses and reports including: the ESRI report, National Investment Priorities for the period 2000-2006; the National Road Needs Study prepared by the National Roads Authority; the Pavement Study &ndash; Condition of Non National Roads, prepared for my Department by Ove Arup and Partners; An Economic Assessment of Recent House Price Developments and The Housing Market: An Economic Review and Assessment <Col N="1214" /> by Peter Bacon and Associates; Housing in Dublin &ndash; A Strategic Review, by the Dublin Local Authorities; the policy statement, Waste Management &ndash; Changing our Ways, prepared by my Department; and the strategic planning guidelines for the Dublin area prepared by a consortium of consultants for my Department and certain local and regional authorities.</P>
    <P>My Department's assessment of infrastructural needs has also been informed by the views and submissions of the various social partners, including Filling the Gap &ndash; Ireland's Infrastructural Deficit, prepared by Fitzpatrick Associates for IBEC, and the reports prepared for regional authorities on development strategies for the 2000-06 period for the southern and eastern regions and the Border, midlands and western regions. Legal obligations in relation to minimum waste water treatment standards stipulated under the EU Urban Waste Water Directive are also reflected in my Department's submission to the Department of Finance for water services funding under the next national development plan.</P>
    <P>I am not in a position to indicate the resources to be provided over the 2000-06 funding period, but the Deputy may be assured that there will be an appropriate balance both within and between programmes.

      <Quest>the measures, if any, in place to modernise the administration of local authorities in ways analogous to the strategic management initiative in the Civil Service; the progress made to date; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a substantial programme in the course of implementation designed to improve all aspects of the functioning of local government. In March 1996 the strategic management initiative was launched in local government. Since then, all the major local authorities have prepared SMI statements setting out their missions, goals and objectives. I intend to have a fresh set of these statements submitted to the new councils within six months of their election and the Local Government Bill will provide for this.</P>
      <P>Side by side with this, a major programme of renewal is under way to facilitate and reinforce strategic management in local authorities. This includes expanding the sphere of influence of local government into wider public services and community development; within the system, achieving a better balance between the political and management systems; developing an element of participatory democracy alongside representative democracy; strengthening management structures; providing an adequate resource platform; developing efficiencies in the system; and developing customer service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Has every local authority submitted a statement along the lines indicated and, if not, why not? In line with the practice adopted in Departments and semi-State agencies, will the Minister consider encouraging or requiring local authorities to adopt a charter of rights for the citizens that would set out the rights of the citizen in relation to the local authority and the duties and <Col N="1217" /> obligations of the local authority towards the citizen?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>All local authorities have produced strategy statements. It is my intention that new statements will be prepared after the forthcoming election to the new councils and that the members of the new councils will have a chance to discuss that within a six month period. I am sure the Deputy has perused our policy document in great detail for the local elections. We have included the provision for a charter for citizens in that document.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy cogged enough of it.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied with the quality of service provided to the public by local authorities and with the standard of management of local authorities generally?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am reluctant to make any wild or sweeping statements on that. I would not try to improve both those areas if I was satisfied with them. Local authorities need to improve their customer service. That is why we are talking about decentralising service delivery, which is already under way in a number of local authorities. The concept of the one-stop-shop and of local authorities getting involved in local development groups through the new county development boards is designed to get local authorities back to the local communities.</P>
      <P>As in all organisations, there are some excellent managers and others not so excellent. My desire is to try to improve the quality of the service provided by local authorities to customers and to try to encourage and foster ideas and centres of excellence in local government. Many individual local authorities deliver services of excellent quality and standard and other local authorities could learn from them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it be a good idea for local authorities to carry out efficiency and value for money audits as this would be the best way to establish the type of service consumers are getting? Is the Minister aware that such a proposal was rejected by Dublin Corporation when it was first proposed by the Green Party?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is part of the programme for Government. It was also part of the previous Government's programme. My predecessor introduced and passed the Local Government (Financial Provisions) Act, 1997, which provided for changes to the audit system. Financial management in local authorities is being improved <Col N="1218" /> and enhanced by the development of new financial management systems which incorporate accrual accounting, improved costing of services, enhanced accounting for fixed assets and a review of the concept of value for money functions of the Department and local authorities. We are introducing an accounting code of practice and developing a series of performance indicators for local authorities in various areas. That agenda is continuing and is being put in place on an incremental basis.</P>

      <askee>Minister for the Environment and Local Government</askee>
      <Quest>the types of infrastructure projects falling within the ambit of his responsibilities being considered as potential areas for public or private partnership; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Following the Government's decision in August 1998 to pursue a public private partnership approach for public capital projects on a pilot basis, my Department has identified a number of areas where this approach may be appropriate. The key areas where PPP may play a role in addressing the major infrastructural investment needs are roads, water supply and waste water treatment, solid waste infrastructure and medium sized developer led projects to service land zoned for residential development. The types of public private partnership projects will vary, depending on the nature of the investment required, but will include design and build, design, build and operate, design, build, operate and finance and concession contracts.</P>
      <P> A specially dedicated unit has been established in my Department to promote and develop the approach on PPP. The National Roads Authority is developing a PPP programme in national roads projects. Some projects have already advanced on a PPP basis, such as the concession contract for vehicle testing signed last year and some design and build and design, build and operate projects in the roads and water services areas. Projects within my area of responsibility which are already under way were outlined in my reply to Question No. 275 of 9 March 1999.</P>
      <P>The process of assessing other projects suitable for a PPP approach is continuing and a series of pilot projects will be announced by the Government shortly. These projects will be monitored and evaluated to allow for the dissemination of information on best practices and the standardisation of contract documentation and procedures. In this way, further PPP projects can be advanced with greater speed and efficiency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister agrees that the PPP principle is useful and is something we need to encourage in all aspects of our infrastructure. Is he aware that earlier this year the Government promised a PPP approach to building the north Dublin interceptor for more than <Col N="1219" /> 16,000 new houses in that area. What work has been done on that project?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">

      <P>That is a specific question about a specific project and I will furnish the details to the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's reply was expressed very much in terms of general principles. Will he outline to the House two or three of the major road projects under consideration for the PPP approach?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to pre-empt any Government decisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that. I refer to those under consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Any of the major projects in the initial tranches of the NRA roads study will be included for consideration under the PPP approach. Specifically, the Government intends to run a number of pilot schemes. Obviously, we will take a number of the more urgent projects from the NRA needs study and consider whether they are suitable for the PPP approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister indicated that he felt water supply, waste water treatment and the treatment of solid wastes would be suitable as PPP projects. Does he agree that the design, build and operate formula would be most relevant for such projects? Will he indicate the type of formula he envisages for roads development, particularly given that the ESRI has made a recommendation that road use should be priced? In that context, what is his view on tolls?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Any project that we intend to advance under the PPP initiative will be considered carefully in terms of what is the best approach. Generally, we have had a positive experience in regard to waste water projects with the design, build and operate formula referred to by the Deputy and it will also be considered. A number of options could be put forward in regard to roads, such as tolling, shadow tolling and systems that operate on the basis of road usage, etc. The Government's position on tolling is the same as it was prior to the last general election. We will not introduce tolls on roads that are already in place and which were provided through taxpayers' money. However, any new projects will be open to such consideration if it will advance them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>When assessing PPPs should the Minister have regard to the national sustainability strategy and the COf7&gt;2 abatement strategy? Does he accept that it was remiss of him not to mention those in his reply on infrastructural needs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not remiss of me because Government policy clearly states that legislation <Col N="1220" /> and proposals that come before Government from all Departments must be eco-audited, environmentally proofed and comply with our national sustainable development policy. Any of those projects, whether they are PPPs or Departmental proposals, must conform with that policy. If they do not, they will not be approved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to roads projects, I understand the Minister's reply to mean that any existing roads will not be tolled. Will future road projects, such as motorways and town bypasses, be considered for tolling?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>In terms of PPPs any road project will be open to such consideration but the initial analyses of various road schemes indicate that very few could operate purely on the basis of tolls. There would not be an economic return from the majority of them.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform whether his Department has received any application for visas from members of the Yugoslav national football side; whether the Government intends to grant such visas if, and when, applications are received; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that visa applications from members of the Yugoslav football team were submitted to the Irish embassy in Athens this morning. As the Deputy will be aware, there is widespread concern at the continuation of sporting links with Yugoslavia given the present situation. The Government shares with EU countries the view that UEFA should be asked to call off sporting links with Yugoslavia.</P>
      <P>The EU General Affairs Council, at its meeting yesterday, expressed disappointment that some major sporting events are still taking place and called on international sporting organisations in Europe, notably UEFA, to reconsider decisions which would permit such sporting fixtures. This morning, following the proposal of the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy McDaid, EU Sports Ministers, meeting in Paderborn, Germany, reiterated the statement of the General Affairs Council. The Government asked the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation to bring this statement to the attention of UEFA, with particular reference to the match scheduled for Saturday next and this has been done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that UEFA will make a response in line with the wishes of the Council of Ministers and the Government. If that does not happen, my col<Col N="1221" /> leagues and I will consider what further action to take.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that, in view of the atrocities currently taking place in Yugoslavia and in the context of the decision of the International War Crimes Tribunal last week on the Yugoslav leadership, it is totally unacceptable and untenable that this match should go ahead? Will he assure the House that if UEFA does not take the courageous decision, upon which it is balking, the Government will not be found wanting and visas will not issue to Yugoslav players and officials to enter this country? Will he further assure the House that Ireland will clearly state that what is happening in Yugoslavia must come to an end and it will not help this regime, which uses football within its military establishment to promote its decadent and brutal leadership?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that everybody deplores what is happening. I hope UEFA will heed the strong call from the EU and the strong public feeling that there should not be sporting contacts with Yugoslavia because of the illegal and appalling actions of the Yugoslav regime against the people of Kosovo. We should give UEFA the opportunity to come into line on this. If it does not do so, my colleagues and I will immediately consider how to react. Naturally, I would prefer to see a sporting body like UEFA act responsibly in this kind of matter. Deputy O'Shea will understand that if I were to say at this juncture that the Government would grant the visas, that would give a very clear signal to UEFA that we did not share the views of our European colleagues, which is not the case. On the other hand, if I were to say the visas would be refused by the Government, there would be no point in asking UEFA to make a decision. Prudence and courtesy dictate that we await UEFA's decision, but I assure the Deputy that my colleagues and I will consider the matter further if UEFA decides to ignore the various international calls made on that body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>What will the Minister recommend to Government in the event of UEFA not grasping this nettle? Will he recommend that it should adopt a leadership role, whatever the consequences in a sporting sense? The team does not want to play and most people do not want the game to go ahead. Whatever the consequences, is the Minister prepared to recommend to Government that this game should not go ahead and that visas should not be provided for the players? Will he tell the House what he will recommend to the Government?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>As always, I will make my views known at the Government meeting and the Government will take a collective decision at that meeting. As I have said, the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy McDaid, has been <Col N="1222" /> in contact with UEFA. He wrote to that body's general secretary and attached an extract from the conclusions of yesterday's meeting of EU Foreign Ministers in Brussels. The Minister and others have made their views clearly known to UEFA and the preferable course of action is to await UEFA's decision. When that decision becomes clear the Government will consider the matter further. I cannot go any further than that at this time.</P>

      <P>In opening my remarks, I declare an interest in the Solicitors (Amendment) Bill, 1998. I am solicitor and it is appropriate, in these days of openness and transparency, that one should declare one's interests. I wonder if the Minister has done so because we share a common interest in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter I should declare is that I have always been against touts and ambulance chasers <Col N="1231" /> as far as the legal profession is concerned. Because I am so much against touts and ambulance chasers, I had grave reservations about the approach adopted by the Minister's Government ten years ago when, as a result of a populist movement, a huge effort was made to get the legal profession to repeal its ban on advertising. Effectively, what we are talking about in relation to this Bill is the need to restrict advertising by the legal profession, a move which has led to the development of the &ldquo;compo&rdquo;culture which afflicts this country. That came about because of the response of the Fianna Fáil Government ten years ago. It insisted on the legal profession lifting its restriction or ban on advertising.</P>
    <P>When I actively practised law I was satisfied that such a ban on advertising existed and felt there was no need to lift it. The Law Society, however, did so under the cloud of a threat from the Fianna Fáil Government ten years ago that if it did not drop the prohibition, the Government would introduce legislation to ensure it did so. That is a warning to us all and shows how dangerous it is to lead from behind with the populist view. The populist view at the time was that there should be advertising. I do not know who generated it, but it was there and the Fianna Fáil Government fell for it, led from behind, followed it through and forced the Law Society to lift the ban on advertising. If nothing else, it shows that these old traditions should not be cast aside lightly. I am not saying they should be set in stone and not changed, but the consequences of change should be thought through before pressure of the type exerted on that occasion is applied.</P>
    <P>The Bill should have been introduced a long time ago; it is much too late to try to shut the stable door. Much damage has been caused and the compensation culture about which we complain has been given a major fillip because of that ill-advised move by the Fianna Fáil Government ten years ago. I am in favour of a more restricted approach to advertising, but before I go into that in detail, I will raise something which should be included in the Bill but is not. The Law Society has 6,800 members, and we are talking about amending legislation which covers that profession. I draw to the Minister's attention the fact that his Government recently produced an advertisement headed: &ldquo;Opportunities on Equality Issues&rdquo;. The advertisement mentioned that a new infrastructure is being put in place to underpin employment equality and equal status law and for that purpose it is seeking a legal adviser. The supreme irony of the advertisement for a legal adviser to help underpin employment equality and equal status law is that the 6,800 solicitors are excluded from applying for that position. I invite the Minister to give me an explanation or excuse for that provision.</P>
    <P>If we are talking about equality and a legal adviser to deal with equality and to advise on how the Office of the Director of Equality Investigations and the Equality Authority should oper<Col N="1232" /> ate, surely, as a starting point, the position itself should spring from an equal point whereby the 80 per cent of lawyers who are members of the solicitors profession should at least be allowed to apply for that position? A complaint has been lodged about that and the Law Society has held a considered view for many years that the exclusion of solicitors from appointments as legal advisers in a number of Departments is contrary to public interest and a relic of history.</P>
    <P>To exclude solicitors from consideration for the position of legal adviser is a form of discrimination without any objective justification. I take the opportunity of dealing with this Bill to raise this issue with the Minister. It is an outrageous reflection on the branch of the profession to which we both belong. As I said, the supreme irony is that it relates to the position of legal adviser in new bodies which are supposed to underpin the approach of this Government to equality issues. It is a bad start and the Minister should put that right immediately and have this obnoxious objectionable advertisement withdrawn and the position re-advertised</P>
    <P>The background to the Bill is the pressure applied ten years ago to get the Law Society to drop its prohibition on advertising. It is quite clear that a bad job was done at that time and that what emerged from that popular movement was a hasty approach which led to the development of the compensation culture. I am not sure whether the genie can be put back in the bottle, although I am very happy to co-operate on behalf of the Opposition in the effort to try to do so.</P>
    <P>Enormous bills are arising for employers, local authorities &ndash; where the time limit under the Statute of Limitations was six months &ndash; and the State as a result of the compensation culture which has developed over recent years. This results not just from the withdrawal of the ban on advertising but also from the amendment to the Statute of Limitations in 1992. It is very easy to present a popular case for such developments, but I would have liked much more time to have been set aside to consider the effects of such legislation, which are now before us. There are claims against the State under the general heading of Army deafness which could result in a final minimum cost of £1,000 million. Was such a possibility considered when the changes I referred to were being made? I have always been opposed to rushed legislation, but am also very much opposed to legislation which is not examined in terms of its consequences in the future. The consequence of the Army deafness claims is that the 70 or 80 members of the Garda Síochána are following the same trail. This would not have happened but for the amendments to regulations and legislation introduced ten years ago.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly the fact that there are law firms which advertise in newspapers, on radio and in other ways highlighting the benefits of claiming against anyone where there is a chance of a bob has encouraged the compensation culture. Adver<Col N="1233" /> tisements which included the claim &ldquo;no foal, no fee&rdquo; clearly encouraged the compensation culture and acted as a major inducement for people to take claims which they otherwise would not have taken. If people have a just claim they should be entitled to pursue it and are entitled to the best legal advice and support in bringing a claim for personal injury. However, the problem arises in two areas. The first is where people automatically assume that because they suffer from something or have an accident they must be entitled to claim from someone. Such an assumption is not provided for in legislation, something which should be made very clear to people. The difficulty is that the type of advertising which has been evidenced over the years has encouraged people to forget about the legislation and to claim, when they clearly have no grounds for doing so, on the basis of getting a settlement for an amount of money which they are not entitled to under the law. The second problem is that people have been encouraged to unduly inflate claims and present injuries as being worse than they are. I do not approve of this and we should be prepared to curb such practice in every way we can.</P>
    <P>The Bill puts in place what will hopefully prove to be effective controls, which should have existed years ago, on the nature and extent of advertising by solicitors, particularly in the area of personal injuries. It lays down a procedure in terms of what can be included in solicitors' advertisements. As a consequence it will hopefully highlight the approach adopted by most colleagues in the profession whom I have met and the ethics of the honourable profession which goes back over the centuries, and take us away from the money grabbing, ambulance chasing touts who have despoiled the name of the profession in recent years. It will ensure that those falling into this latter category who brought the profession into disrepute will be reined in.</P>
    <P>Hopefully the kind of curbs and controls which should have been put in place ten years ago will now be effective. I am not entirely certain that the Bill will achieve the desired result, partly because of the culture and tradition which has developed over the past ten years and partly because it is very difficult to rein in an approach which has been allowed to become accepted as commonplace. However, it is the best that can be done at this time and for that reason Fine Gael, despite the damage which has been caused over the past ten years, is prepared to support the Bill.</P>
    <P>There are probably many other areas in terms of the compensation culture which need to be dealt with just as expeditiously. We hear all sorts of talk, particularly from the Minister for Defence, about the need to set up compensation tribunals etc. to deal with the enormous number of claims being made against him. However, it is a case of much talk and very little action. I hope that if such an approach is adopted there will not be the undue delay which arose in relation to the production of this Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1234" /> The Bill is an improvement on current legislation and for that reason we will support it. I do not think it will totally remedy the damage which has been done over the years. On the other hand perhaps it may help restrict the growth and development of the compensation culture. If it does so it will bring enormous benefits to the economy. I am aware of the additional costs of enormous claims to business in recent years and am cognisant of the insurance premia which have to be paid by various professions, not least the legal profession and the medical profession. In my young days as a solicitor claims were virtually unheard of. However, claims have now become commonplace and as a consequence the insurance premia paid by doctors, for example, are enormous, reaching £30,000, £40,000 or £50,000 per year for some consultants.</P>
    <P>The Bill is too late and is perhaps too little, but we are prepared to support it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not a solicitor, unlike my esteemed colleagues. I have always been impressed by the amount of study and work solicitors must undergo to qualify and it is a profession we should treat with the greatest of respect. We depend on solicitors and barristers to keep the wheels of our advanced society moving properly. Therefore, it is with a measure of regret that the Minister must introduce a Bill to regulate the actions of a small number of unscrupulous opportunists. I was amazed to see some solicitors advertise for business in doctors' surgeries. Injured people sitting in waiting rooms see these advertisements which state they have the right to claim and get a great deal of money.</P>
      <P>People refer time and again to the compensation culture in our society. As a person who worked with the youth, I know this culture is harmful to society. Some parents groups are afraid to set up playgrounds for their children. Local authorities have had to close playgrounds for fear of injury and litigation. I welcome the Bill from the point of view that I hope it will start a debate about the compensation culture. I commend the Minister on introducing it for that reason alone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill seeks to set up effective controls on the nature and extent of advertising by solicitors, especially in the area of personal injuries. People are often awarded huge damages in cases settled out of court. We know of cases where people have gone to their bank managers with letters from solicitors stating the bank should lend them money because they are going to court the following week and will receive substantial awards, that the cases will be settled out of court and the solicitors will stand over them. It is better than winning the lotto. Therefore, instead of people getting lump sums, perhaps the Minister would consider providing that such people receive monthly payments. People might then not be so quick to go to court to win the lotto, as it were. It is just a suggestion. If a person recovers from the injury, he or she might not need the money. <Col N="1235" /> Perhaps people could be assessed at a future date to see if their injuries have improved. We need to examine the outcome of litigation, the amount of money being awarded and how it is awarded. Is it right that people should receive massive lump sums at the one time? Perhaps the Minister will examine that aspect of the matter. I am sure he has already thought of this. The advertisements to which I referred stir up business in a way which, according to the Minister, is &ldquo;in your face&rdquo;. I liked that remark. That brings the whole profession into disrepute.</P>
    <P>The Bill lists a number of terms. What is meant by &ldquo;bad taste&rdquo;? Surely that is a subjective term. That which is in bad taste according to one person may not be so according to another. Who will adjudicate on whether an advertisement &ldquo;is likely to bring the solicitors' profession into disrepute&rdquo; or &ldquo;reflects unfavourably on other solicitors&rdquo;? These terms are a little ambiguous; perhaps the Bill needs to be more specific. I agree with the Minister that advertisements should not be &ldquo;false or misleading in any respect&rdquo;. With regard to an advertisement which &ldquo;is published in an inappropriate location&rdquo;, I hope the Minister will set out examples of those locations to tighten up the legislation.</P>
    <P>Some people who suffer genuine injury, loss and hurt are afraid to claim, contact a solicitor or to go to court because they do not want to be associated with the compensation culture. That is another outcome of this culture.</P>
    <P>Some solicitors are unscrupulous and opportunists. A few make mistakes and there are some, like in every profession, who are not the best. What recourse does a member of the public have to a redress of wrongs? Some Deputies suggested the appointment of an ombudsman for the legal profession. If people feel they have been wronged, that they did not get a hearing or were not treated with respect or dignity, they should be able to make a complaint which will be followed up for the good of the majority of people in the profession. Perhaps the Minister will consider that, if not in this Bill, at a later stage. It is important that ordinary people have recourse to such a facility.</P>
    <P>How will we inform people with genuine cases of their right to seek compensation if we restrict advertising? We must be careful in that regard. Is there a danger that the Bill might prevent people from being informed that they may take their cases to court? That might seem strange in the culture in which we operate but, if we restrict advertising, honest people who suffer injury, hurt or damage may not even know they may seek compensation.</P>
    <P>For many people, going to court is a daunting prospect. Perhaps we should make the family courts and other courts more user-friendly. I know moves are being made at present whereby people may discuss and debate with their solicitors in privacy and comfort. That is the least we can provide in this day and age.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1236" /> In the Cork East constituency there are great moves afoot to upgrade the courthouse in Youghal which has been in a deplorable condition for years. I commend those involved on the work they are doing because it is badly needed. The judge had to move out of the court for a number of months because of the condition of the courthouse. I encourage the departmental officials to make sure that work progresses as speedily as possible.</P>
    <P>Some people's knowledge of the legal profession is limited to what is happening at the tribunals and the massive fees of a small number of people there. It is the taxpayers who are paying that money. Why should people who may have done great wrong in the past cost the State millions of pounds when, for example, there are hospital waiting lists and 8,000 people waiting for orthodontic treatment at St. Finbarr's Hospital in Cork? Perhaps we should consider a cheaper and more effective way of dealing with these issues in the future.</P>
    <P>The whole area of insurance and claims impinges greatly on car drivers, particularly young drivers. Many young people cannot afford car insurance as it is very costly. We await constructive Government measures to assist in reducing car insurance costs for young drivers. That should be done. Cars are essential nowadays to travel to and from work and so on.</P>
    <P>High insurance costs are linked to compensation payments. I wonder whether it is proper to pay out large sums of money at one time. Perhaps payments could be staggered over a number of months or years, together with ongoing assessments. That might limit the amount of money paid out and the number of claims made.</P>
    <P>Another area which gives great cause for concern is the cost of fire insurance for houses. Although I am moving away slightly from the content of the Bill, all of these matters are linked to claims, compensation and insurance. If a house burns down, it may not be adequately covered by insurance and the occupants may not be able to rebuild it. People cannot afford the high cost of house insurance which arises as a result of current spiralling, unprecedented house prices. Higher housing costs are a measure of success in our society but we must manage that success. Deputies on all sides of the House have alluded to the problem of high house prices, especially as they affect young people.</P>
    <P>While we welcome the Bill, we must do everything we can to tackle the compensation culture. That is not to say we should excuse shoddy workmanship or negligence. It is no longer acceptable to say &ldquo;it will be all right on the night&rdquo;. We must ensure high standards across the board. Local authorities must ensure that footpaths are properly maintained in order to prevent people falling on them. If we do not tackle the compensation culture, the introduction of this Bill will be akin to closing the door after the horse has bolted.</P>
    <P>The Bill needs to be tidied up somewhat. I do not know how some of the terms such as &ldquo;in bad <Col N="1237" /> taste&rdquo; will be pinned down. I suggested that an ombudsman be appointed for the legal profession, and perhaps the Minister will consider that at a later stage.</P>
    <P>The compensation culture affects schools, youth clubs and others and is costing a great deal of money. People cannot afford to turn around without incurring huge insurance costs. I welcome the Bill to which the Fine Gael Party will table amendments on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies who contributed to the debate and appreciate the general welcome given to the Bill from all sides of the House. The debate has been a wide-ranging one which centred on the primary focus of the Bill, namely, the need for better control of particular types of advertising by solicitors. It also touched on a variety of issues such as the compensation culture and the difficulties that culture causes for local authorities, insurance companies, the medical profession and others.</P>
      <P>The content of particular advertisements read into the record by Deputies Higgins, McGrath and Foley and the further references to such advertisements by Deputies Roche and Hanafin provide classic examples of the &ldquo;in your face&rdquo; and sometimes personalised advertising to which I referred earlier in the debate. Deputies readily identified with the sentiments I expressed about those advertisements.</P>
      <P>When the Bill becomes law, that type of advertising will no longer be permissible. The Bill aims to ensure that the nature of any advertising engaged in by solicitors is appropriate and is not in bad taste, objectionable or of a nature which induces people to engage in unnecessary litigation. At the same time, I am conscious of the need to ensure that members of the public who may wish to obtain the services of a solicitor are in a position to make informed choices on the basis of accurate, factual information on the range of services available to them.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides that the information contained in solicitors' advertisements may include basic material such as name, address, telephone and facsimile numbers, place of business, academic and professional qualifications and legal experience, factual information on the legal services provided and particulars of any charge or fee payable for the provision of any specified legal advice. In addition, the Bill allows the use of the words &ldquo;personal injuries&rdquo; in an advertisement as part of the factual information contained therein.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that the Bill's provisions will succeed in controlling the kind of brash publicity, including personal publicity and touting for business, which has become evident in recent years. The Bill is designed in the public interest and will lead to a stricter code of advertising for solicitors. A good deal of that code will now be enshrined in primary legislation. Some of the details will continue to be supplemented by way of secondary <Col N="1238" /> legislation, namely through regulations made by the Law Society with the concurrence of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
    <P>Deputies raised a number of issues in the course of a very interesting debate. Deputy Higgins expressed the view that the 'saver' in section 3 of the Bill, under which the Bill would not apply to advertisements which are published within three months of the date of the Bill's commencement, should be deleted. If we were to remove this three month period of grace, one possible effect is that advertising restrictions would become effective immediately upon commencement of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 8(2) of the Bill is also relevant in this regard. The effect of section 3 and section 8(2) is that the legislation would begin to apply to advertisements published at a maximum of six months after the passing of the Bill. Section 8(2) provides that the Bill should come into operation three months after its passing or on such earlier day as may be appointed by ministerial order. My intention is to bring the Bill into operation as soon as the regulations which the Law Society is required to make are ready and as soon as I am in a position to consent to them. It is certain, therefore, that a maximum three month time limit has been placed on this stage of the process. The relevant commencement order will be made as quickly as possible within that time period.</P>
    <P>Any person affected by the provisions of the Bill is entitled to be given notice which is both adequate and definitive, of a change of this importance. For that reason, section 3 provides for the second stage of the process, that is, that the Bill shall apply to advertisements published three months after the date of its commencement. Thus, those who are affected by its provisions will be able to make their arrangements within that three month period in the certain knowledge that the Bill will take effect in relation to advertisements published as and from a particular date. I am satisfied this is a reasonable basis on which to proceed and it will help to remove grounds for any challenge to the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Higgins also referred to the need to urgently amend the Statute of Limitations (Amendment) Act, 1991, to reduce the limitation period for personal injury actions against public authorities. The Statute of Limitations, 1957, provides a period of three years for the commencement of personal injuries proceedings, beyond which the proceedings may be struck out because they were not commenced in time. The statute also provides that the three year period shall not be regarded as starting to run where the plaintiff is under a legal disability, for example, not of full age. These provisions are by way of exception to the general rule relating to periods of limitation for actions founded on tort which is six years from the date on which the cause of action accrued.</P>
    <P>The Statute of Limitations (Amendment) Act, 1991, amended the law so that the three year limitation period runs from the date on which the <Col N="1239" /> person injured discovers, or could reasonably have discovered, that the injury occurred, if this date is later than the act or omission leading to the injury.</P>
    <P>The policy considerations which gave rise to the discoverability rule in the 1991 Act was that there could be an injustice which could, in certain cases, result in a person losing his or her right of action for personal injuries before that person was in a position to learn that such a course of action existed. The Act removed constitutional doubts at the time about existing law and it substantially implemented the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission regarding claims in respect of latent personal injuries. If the law in 1991 had not been enacted, cases such as the recent hepatitis C cases would have been statute barred.</P>
    <P>While I have no proposals to change the law relating to personal injuries claims against public authorities, the law is kept under review on an ongoing basis.</P>
    <P>Deputy Higgins also referred to the Incorporated Law Society's new requirement that law graduates must pass the law society's entrance examination prior to being admitted to the professional training system. The matter raised by the Deputy does not come within the scope of the provisions of the Bill. By way of information to the Deputy, however, it was in the light of the High Court decision in the Bloomer case which was upheld by the Supreme Court in 1996 that the Law Society decided to require persons to sit its entrance examination and to abolish the system of exemption which had applied to graduates of certain colleges.</P>
    <P>The Law Society has informed me that, as a consequence of the Bloomer judgment, it would not be possible to reintroduce the old exemption system and that an entrance examination must be in place to meet the practical considerations arising from that judgment.</P>
    <P>Making regulations in the education and training of solicitors is a matter for the Law Society. My predecessor as Minister for Justice concurred in making regulations in June 1997, and it is those regulations which currently apply. As I understand it, the regulations already make certain allowances for the position of graduates but not to the extent of exempting them from the entrance examination.</P>
    <P>There is further litigation pending before the courts which relates to the examination, and the outcome of that case may have a further bearing on the issue.</P>
    <P>I was asked in the course of the debate whether I had any plans to regulate advertising by para-legals. I am pleased to inform the House that section 2 covers such cases. That section provides that a person who is not a solicitor should not publish or cause to be published an advertisement relating to claims for personal injuries which expressly or impliedly undertakes to provide a specified service of a legal nature for a fee, gain <Col N="1240" /> or reward which is directly related to the provision of that service, and where the service could otherwise be provided by a solicitor. The advertising controls provided for in section 1 in relation to personal injuries apply, therefore, by virtue of section 2 to non-solicitors. Given the extent to which some people who are not solicitors advertise services of a legal nature in the area of personal injuries, it is only reasonable that statutory controls which apply to solicitors in this area should also apply to people who are not solicitors.</P>
    <P>Any such person who breaches these provisions may be the subject of an application by the law society to the High Court under section 7 for an order of prohibition.</P>
    <P>Deputy McManus expressed concern that the definition of the words &ldquo;inappropriate location&rdquo; contained in the new subsection (10) of section 71 of the Solicitors Act, 1954, as proposed to be inserted by section 1 of the Bill, may be too restrictive. She suggested that what is at issue is the content of the advertisements, not their location. She also indicated that the definition of &ldquo;inappropriate location&rdquo; might prohibit local bodies such as schools from seeking advertisements from solicitors in school journals and the like.</P>
    <P>The position under the Bill is that a solicitor will be prohibited from publishing or otherwise promoting his or her practice in an inappropriate location. An inappropriate location is defined to include a hospital, clinic, doctor's surgery, funeral home or cemetery. The Bill, as framed, will allow advertising in school magazines or journals produced by local organisations provided it complies with the requirements of the Bill.</P>
    <P>In so far as location is concerned, however, I wish to emphasise that any form of promotion of or touting for business by solicitors in the vicinity of, say, a funeral home would be prohibited under the Bill. The question as to whether a funeral home could give general information on the desirability of persons settling their affairs by way of taking out probate is a separate matter and does not come within the scope of the Bill. I suppose the fact that solicitors will be prohibited from advertising in a cemetery will give a whole new resonance to the phrase that nobody wants to be the richest man in the graveyard.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGrath referred to section 71 (8) of the Solicitors Act, 1954, that is proposed to be inserted by section 1 of the Bill. The subsection would, subject to conditions, allow a solicitor who has a specialist knowledge in a prescribed area of law or practice to advertise that specialist knowledge. The Deputy wishes to know how the Law Society will decide on such expertise. He indicated that queries were brought to his attention by some solicitors who believe too much control may be given to the Law Society in this area.</P>
    <P>The Bill in this instance simply repeals and re-enacts a provision in the law that already exists. It will be open to the Law Society to spell out the details in this area. Subsection (8) will operate if the Law Society makes regulations on the precise <Col N="1241" /> manner in which a solicitor may satisfy the society of specialist knowledge. In spelling out those details, the society will have to take account of other provisions in section 71 which constrain advertising in general.</P>
    <P>Deputies queried the Government's proposals to tackle the mounting legal costs involved in personal injuries cases against the State. The Government's legislative programme, as announced by the Chief Whip on 15 April 1999, contains a commitment to bring forward a Bill to handle claims for compensation for personal injury and property damage against the State. The heads of that Bill have been prepared in the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>In so far as Army deafness cases are concerned, the Minister for Defence has indicated that he favours an out of court settlement procedure and that he has asked his Department to prepare proposals for Government for such a scheme, taking into account levels of compensation being awarded by the courts in such cases. The Minister has indicated that the work is in full progress and will be influenced by the outcome of pending legislation before the courts.</P>
    <P>In so far as levels of insurance costs are concerned, some Deputies will be aware of ongoing work in this area. The Minister with responsibility for science, technology and commerce has asked a special working group, established in 1997 on foot of a consultancy report on the evaluation of insurance costs, to continue its work on the alternative methods of delivering personal injury compensation. This is a matter to which Deputy Stanton referred in his contribution. The working group is currently researching and evaluating alternative systems for compensating accident victims in other countries and aims to submit its report to the Minister in July.</P>
    <P>Deputy Jim O'Keeffe referred to the number of gardaí making claims for hearing loss. Eighty six gardaí and retired members of the Force have lodged claims for hearing loss against the State since 1982. Seventy two of these cases were lodged since March 1996, two were withdrawn and nine have been settled. One of the cases concerned an incident in which mortars found in a bunker were detonated. The remainder concerned members who underwent firearms training and practice some time ago. These cases have been settled at an average cost of £29,000.</P>
    <P>Gardaí are not exposed to gunfire to the same extent as soldiers and only members of specialist units would have any appreciable exposure to it. Even this exposure would be low compared with soldiers. Estimates of the risk of damage to hearing are generally based on average exposure over a period of weeks and years. Reports commissioned by the Garda indicate that the necessary hearing protection is in existence to protect against the possibility of hearing loss to members of the Force who would be exposed to noise, and also complies with legislation concerning the protection of workers from risks related to the exposure to noise at work.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1242" /> The requirement for gardaí to wear adequate protection when undergoing firearms training has been rigidly enforced since the early 1980s. While the scale of the problem is not anything like in the Defence Forces, officials in the Department have been in discussions with the Garda Síochána, the Attorney General's office, the Chief State Solicitor's office and the Department of Defence on this issue. The problem is being monitored carefully and arrangements are in place to ensure that every claim is thoroughly investigated.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe also referred to an advertisement for a post on the Equality Authority. The legal advisers to be recruited from the competitions recently advertised by the Civil Service Commission will be the primary source, similar to the situation regarding legal assistants in the office of the Attorney General, for in-house legal opinion and advisory work relating to the interpretation of the new equality legislation as well as case law. As such, the work for which the legal advisers are sought is in the domain of activity normally reserved for barristers and for which they are suitable because of their training and work experience. In the circumstances I consider the qualifications sought for the post in question to be appropriate.</P>
    <P>Deputy Stanton referred to the issue of what constitutes bad taste. Existing regulations made by the law society prohibit advertising which is in bad taste and the Bill enshrines that prohibition in primary legislation. The ultimate arbiter of what constitutes bad taste in these cases will be the disciplinary tribunal appointed by the President of the High Court which considers complaints of misconduct against solicitors.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also referred to the possibility of an ombudsman for the legal profession. Under regulations made in 1997 the Law Society established the scheme for the examination of investigations by an adjudicator of written complaints concerning the handling by the society of complaints concerning solicitors. The adjudicator has furnished his first annual report which I welcome and which comments favourably on the level of co-operation afforded to the adjudicator by the Law Society. The society has indicated that it intends to use the recommendations in the report to further improve the quality of its complaints handling procedures.</P>
    <P>During the period under consideration the adjudicator reviewed 59 cases, of which he referred nine to the society's professional practice directorate for the purposes of seeking additional information at the specific request of complainants. These reviews were expeditiously handled by the directorate and responses to the queries were furnished in writing to complainants. A small number of these cases are ongoing.</P>
    <P>Following a redirection by the adjudicator's office, one case was the subject of a referral of a solicitor to the disciplinary tribunal appointed by the President of the High Court. The adjudicator pointed out that, in a number of cases, he was <Col N="1243" /> being asked to decide on two absolutely contradictory positions. Many of these cases are not documented and, therefore, render him powerless to determine fault.</P>
    <P>Twenty five cases were outside the adjudicator's remit, mainly because they were not made within three years of the Law Society's determination on the matter. Other cases were the subject of a court determination or have been referred to the disciplinary tribunal.</P>
    <P>One of the most striking aspects of the report is the number of solicitors, more than one third, who failed to attend meetings of the registrar's committee, despite having been requested to do so in advance. The registrar's committee of the Law Society indicated that it intends to adopt new procedures to deal with this difficulty. It has decided that a failure to attend before a committee meeting without reasonable excuse will be regarded as <i>prima facie</i> misconduct and render the solicitor liable to be referred to the disciplinary tribunal on this ground alone.</P>
    <P>In addition, I intend to introduce an amendment to the Bill on Committee Stage to address this problem. The amendment follows consultations on the matter between my Department and the society. The failure of a solicitor to attend a registrar's committee does not preclude the committee from taking further action, such as, for example, referring the matter to the disciplinary tribunal but it indicates, as the adjudicator points out, that some solicitors have scant regard for the authority of the society and the rights of clients.</P>
    <P>The procedures which have been put in place by the society achieve the objective of independent adjudication but I will keep the matter under review in light of further experience of their operation. The procedures are new and it is reasonable to monitor how they operate over a fair period of time.</P>
    <P>It is important to recognise, as many Deputies have done, that since the Law Society allowed advertising by solicitors in 1988 for the first time, it is the exception rather than the rule that solicitors engage in forms of advertising which are clearly unacceptable. Nevertheless, the perception is that large numbers of cases in the personal injuries area are driven by over-the-top advertising. While the conduct of many solicitors in so far as advertising is concerned has been, and continues to be, above reproach, it is evident that a better code on advertising should exist. The Bill is a reasonable response that is in keeping with the need to protect the overall integrity of the solicitors' profession among the public they serve.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputies for their contributions to what has been a valuable and informed debate and look forward to discussing the Bill further on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am pleased to open this debate. It provides an opportunity for the House to consider the important issues in this Bill which relate to the broadcasting of cultural and sports events of major importance to the people. Deputies will have the opportunity to express their views on these issues and I am very interested in hearing them.</P>
      <P>In recent years the pace of technological change in the area of broadcasting has been truly breathtaking and the broadcasting scene has changed radically over the past 30 years or so. As a society we have moved from having one national television broadcaster, RTE, showing programmes in black and white, to where RTE, Teilifís na Gaeilge and TV3 operate 4 television channels. In addition, a large and growing number of television channels broadcast from countries overseas are available here on cable systems and <i>via</i> satellite dishes. The advent of digital television will lead to an even greater number of television channels becoming available over the next few years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The transmission of hundreds of channels by numerous broadcasters, some of which operate on a global scale across national boundaries, has changed forever the broadcasting scene throughout the world. Some of these companies have financial resources which far exceed the resources available to many public service broadcasters in <Col N="1245" /> Europe. There is a danger that, if market forces are left to themselves without some level of co-ordinated control by the member states of the European Union, a small number of companies will dominate the market for major sports and cultural events that are of interest to the general public, leading to restrictions on access to television coverage of such events on those who cannot afford to pay.</P>
    <P>The growth in the number of broadcasting channels has changed the relationship between sports organisations and broadcasters. In the past, the number of broadcasters was relatively limited due to radio frequency availability. Accordingly, the opportunity to provide coverage of sporting activities was limited if broadcasters wished to retain a wide audience. It may seem amazing now, but there was a time when some sporting organisations did not want certain events to be covered live because they felt it might reduce the number of people who would otherwise attend at a particular event.</P>
    <P>The increase in broadcasting services which has come about through the introduction of satellite television and the emergence of dedicated sports channels has resulted in a huge increase in demand and intense competition for popular sporting programmes. While the explosion in the number of channels available can represent a greater choice for consumers, much of this programme choice is only available on a subscription or pay per view basis.</P>
    <P>Arising from these changes, concerns have arisen throughout the European Union that certain major events, in particular sports events, will migrate from free television &ndash; that is, without direct payment by the viewer to a broadcaster &ndash; to subscription or pay per view channels. Given the important role that sports, in particular, play in the life of our country, I am concerned to ensure as far as is practicable that those who cannot afford to pay subscription or pay per view fees will not be excluded from this participation in our major events.</P>
    <P>These concerns took shape during the debate preceding the amendment of the Television Without Frontiers Directive in 1997. Under article 3a of the directive, each member state may take measures in accordance with Community law to ensure that broadcasters under its jurisdiction do not broadcast on an exclusive basis, events which are regarded by that member state as being of major importance for society, in such a way as to deprive a substantial proportion of the public in that member state of the possibility of following such events <i>via</i> live coverage or deferred coverage on free television.</P>
    <P>Member states may draw up a list of designated events which they consider to be of major importance to society and notify the European Commission accordingly. Within a period of three months from the notification, the Commission shall verify that the measures are compatible with Community law and communicate them to the <Col N="1246" /> other member states. The Commission is required to publish the measures taken in the Official Journal of the European Communities and, at least once a year, publish the consolidated list of the measures taken by member states. Under article 3a of the directive, each member state must recognise the lists of designated events drawn up by other member states and ensure that no broadcaster under its jurisdiction operates in such a way as to deprive a substantial proportion of the population of other member states seeing events on free television which those other member states have designated.</P>
    <P>Sport plays an important part in our lives. There have been numerous success stories involving Irish teams and individuals. Nobody will ever forget the great excitement in recent years when the Irish soccer team, under Jack Charlton's stewardship, achieved a level of success never before achieved. Let us remember, too, the great achievements of John Treacy, Sonia O'Sullivan and Catherina McKiernan in athletics. At home, gaelic football and hurling matches, which are unique to our culture, have a treasured place in our shared memories and stories.</P>
    <P>Clearly, sport has played and will continue to pay a major role in our culture. Without our sporting heroes, life would be much poorer. It should be remembered, too, that the successful achievements of our sportsmen and women abroad reflect a positive image of Ireland throughout the world. Success at county level in gaelic games and at international level in other disciplines contributes greatly to local and national self confidence and to our quality of life. Success at national or international level also encourages youngsters to take up and become involved in sports and sporting activities and to engage in the social life which surrounds such activities.</P>
    <P>The massive influx of money from TV stations for broadcasting rights has revolutionised European sport. In many ways, sport in itself is becoming a huge and complex business. One could be forgiven for saying that sport is now part of the transnational entertainment business. The sale of exclusive broadcasting rights has become sport's largest source of income ahead of ticket sales, particularly in respect of the Olympic Games and World Cup soccer. Closely linked to the sale of television rights is the question of sponsorship. Sporting events with guaranteed TV coverage quickly find backing from sponsors. World sporting events are now timed to take account of time zones and international audience interest.</P>
    <P>Football matches are the television programmes which attract the biggest audiences throughout Europe. This demonstrates the importance of relations between sport and television. Sports organisations realise the importance of their sport being shown on television and also realise the importance to television of sports coverage. Television is a very powerful medium which has a major influence on society.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1247" /> A recent and, to me, a worrying trend in soccer has been attempts to purchase clubs by large powerful audio-visual companies. Recently, the British Government blocked the purchase by an audio-visual company of Manchester United. Other European Governments have adopted a different policy. In France, Canal Plus controls clubs not only in France but elsewhere. Also, major European soccer clubs such as Inter Milan and Paris St. Germain are backed by media groups.</P>
    <P>Everybody is aware that sport now involves huge amounts of money. To be successful in sport today means not only commitment and dedication, whether by a team or an individual, but in most cases significant financial resources. The sale by event organisers to broadcasters of the rights to broadcast sports events, such as the Olympic Games or the World Cup soccer matches, involves billions of dollars worth of business. The Olympic Games and World Cup soccer matches have huge audiences across all continents and this is reflected in the huge amounts of money broadcasters are prepared to pay for the rights to transmit them.</P>
    <P>Many broadcasters today operate in the private sector. Some of them operate on a global scale. They are answerable not to governments or to the general public but to their shareholders. I recognise that sports organisers wish to generate the maximum amount of income from the sale of broadcast rights to the events which they organise. This income is vital to event organisers and can be used, for example, to recruit new talent, undertake improvements to facilities at sports grounds, such as new stands, or to improve coaching and training facilities.</P>
    <P>I assure event organisers that this Bill does not propose to interfere on a broad scale with the commercial marketing of sports events, to distort competition or to interfere to an undue extent with the rights of event organisers to sell the commercial rights of sports events. What is required is a balance between the rights of event organisers to sell the broadcast rights to sports events and the rights of the general public to continue to see major events that have, as the Bill states, a special general resonance for the people of Ireland, on free television with near universal coverage. It must be recognised that the citizen has rights too and these must be safeguarded.</P>
    <P> There is widespread interest among our people that certain events, which are of such importance to our way of life and culture, must continue to be seen on free television with near universal coverage. Therefore, I have no doubt that they will welcome and support the provisions in this Bill.</P>
    <P>At European level, the European Commission recently organised the first European conference on sport in Olympia in Greece. The conference was attended by participants from a wide variety of sports organisations, government departments and public and private sector broadcasters from <Col N="1248" /> many countries throughout Europe, including countries which are not member states of the European Union.</P>
    <P>One of the issues addressed at the conference was the issue of relations between sport and television. The Commission identified a number of issues under this topic which needed to be addressed. These included television's role in broadcasting sport and its impact on the development of sport as a spectacle; the concept of solidarity applied to sports and relations between inter-club competitions and international competitions; individual or collective selling of television rights, the ownership of rights and the redistribution of money from television rights; the conditions for awarding contracts, the lack of transparency and publicity, the duration of exclusive contracts and equal opportunity for operators; the problems inherent in the growing interpenetration of the sporting world and the audio-visual sector; sports ethics, including the possible manipulation of competitions; the ethics of journalism, including the independence of journalists of a television channel which owns sports teams; the national lists of major sports events and the Television Without Frontiers Directive; the citizen's right to information; and the emergence of pay television channels and the survival of a sport linked to presence on television and ratings.</P>
    <P>The main conclusions about television and sport were that participants agreed on the recognition of intensified relationships between broadcasters and sports organisations in a competitive market characterised by a growing number of distribution channels and diversification of television services favoured by digital technology. This intensified relationship requires sports organisations, broadcasters and public authorities to pay renewed attention to the need to preserve the values, autonomy and specificity of sport.</P>
    <P>Although the presence of sports on television is desired by the sports movement, especially for promotional and educational reasons, the constraints of television broadcasting in a competitive environment may negatively affect the nature of sport disciplines and bring about changes in the organisation of sports activities. The integrity and autonomy of sport must be preserved and there must be no confusion of roles between broadcasters and the sports movement nor must the media directly or indirectly exercise control of the organisation and schedules of sports competitions. In this regard, hesitation and even outright opposition was expressed by some participants to the acquisition of sports clubs by broadcasters.</P>
    <P>The majority of the working group considered that the interests of sport are best served by a system of collective sale of rights, especially by federations. This collective sale system is deemed a necessary condition for the functioning of the redistribution and solidarity mechanisms which must characterise European sport whereby redis<Col N="1249" /> tribution occurs within each discipline in favour of less wealthy clubs and amateur clubs.</P>
    <P>On the issue of the duration of exclusive broadcasting rights to sports competitions, the majority of participants accepted the need for limiting the duration of such contracts for obvious reasons related to competition but considered that such duration must be sufficient, especially in respect of the investments needed for producing and programming such events. It was the generally held view of participants that it was undesirable for a single rule to apply to all sports disciplines and that the maximum duration must be adapted to the characteristics of each discipline, taking into account the diversity of sport and the impact on the sports rights market.</P>
    <P>The working group recognised the importance of measures aimed at ensuring access by the public to information on sports events of major importance for society, taking into account the influence exercised by such events on sport practice and social cohesion. In this context the necessity to strike a balance between the protection of public interest and the development needs of clubs and federations was underlined. Participants expressed their desire to advance the dialogue between the sports movement and broadcasters, together with representatives of EU member states and the European Commission.</P>
    <P>The Commission will prepare a report for the European Council meeting in Helsinki in December 1999. It believes the report will offer a unique opportunity to put the relationship between sport and the European Union on a satisfactory footing. The Commission considers the time has come to reflect together on a new type of relationship guided by dialogue and the search for solutions to the problems and challenges facing European sport.</P>
    <P>Deputies will appreciate from the foregoing that the world of sport is full of complex relationships between participants, event organisers, broadcasters and sponsors. We must be careful that the measures we take now in the public interest serve that interest and do not have a negative effect on the events on which we place the most value.</P>
    <P>The Bill will give the Minister the power to draw up a list of designated events following consultation with the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation. In deciding which events should be designated, the Bill stipulates certain criteria which must be taken into account, but does not identify which events will be designated by ministerial order. It envisages a wide ranging consultation process being undertaken to ascertain the views of event organisers, broadcasters in the State and the general public before any order is made. I intend for the public to be afforded the opportunity to air its views as to which events it would like to see listed. While some sports events readily spring to mind, I intend to enter the consultation process with an open mind and without prejudice to any sport.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1250" /> I will now deal briefly with the main provisions of the Bill. Section 1 deals with definitions, the most significant of which are &ldquo;near universal coverage&rdquo;, &ldquo;qualifying broadcaster&rdquo; and &ldquo;free television service&rdquo;. Until 31 December 2001, a broadcaster in the State who provides a free television service with 85 per cent coverage of the population will be considered as a &ldquo;qualifying broadcaster&rdquo; under the Bill. Thereafter a &ldquo;qualifying broadcaster&rdquo; will be a broadcaster who provides near universal coverage as defined in the Bill. &ldquo;Near universal coverage&rdquo; is defined as a free television service available to 95 per cent of the population. However, in a situation where, at any time, only two broadcasters are capable of providing such coverage, a broadcaster who provides 90 per cent coverage will be considered to provide near universal coverage. &ldquo;Free television service&rdquo; is defined as a television service which is free at the point of reception.</P>
    <P>Section 2 provides that, following consultation with the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, the Minister may designate by order events as being of major importance to society. In drawing up the list of designated events, the Minister will be required to take certain criteria into account. Section 2(1)(a) provides that the Minister will have the basic power to designate certain events as being of major importance to society. Broadcasters who are qualifying broadcasters under the Bill will have the right to cover such events. Section 2(1)(b) provides that, when exercising the power to designate events, the Minister will determine whether such events should be available on free television on a live, deferred, or both live and deferred basis, and whether such events should be available in its entirety or on a partial basis. This enables the Minister to take account of situations where a designated event takes place in a different time zone or where a number of different events take place at the same time.</P>
    <P>Section 2(2) requires the Minister to have regard to certain criteria when designating an event under section 2(1). The Minister must have regard to the extent to which the event in question has a special general resonance and a generally recognised distinct cultural importance for the people. The intention is to designate only events of an outstanding nature. Section 2(3) provides that, to determine whether these criteria have been met, the Minister may take into account whether the event involves participation by a national or non-national team or by Irish persons. Past practice with regard to television coverage of the event or similar events may also be taken into account. Section 2(4) provides matters to be considered by the Minister in making a determination as to whether a designated event should be available on free television on a live or deferred basis or in whole or partial form.</P>
    <P>Section 2(5) provides that I may by order revoke or amend and order under this section. Section 2(6) provides that I must consult the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation <Col N="1251" /> before making, amending or revoking an order under this section. Section 2(7) provides that an order under this section shall be a positive order, namely, that the order shall not come into force until a resolution approving the draft of the order has been passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Section 3 provides that before making an order I shall consult with the organisers of events and with broadcasters under the jurisdiction of the State, publish a notice of the event I intend to designate in at least one national newspaper circulating in the State and invite comments on the intended designation from members of the public. Section 3(2) provides that where it is not possible to establish the identity of the organiser of an event or if an organiser or broadcaster fails to respond to efforts to consult, I am not precluded from proceeding to make an order under section 2. This is to ensure that the process cannot be delayed indefinitely by the failure of an event organiser to respond to attempts at consultation.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides the following: that a broadcaster under the jurisdiction of the State who acquires exclusive rights to broadcast a designated event shall make the event available to another broadcaster on request and the payment of reasonable market rates by that other broadcaster; that where a broadcaster under the jurisdiction of the State who is not a qualifying broadcaster and acquires exclusive rights to broadcast a designated event, that broadcaster shall not broadcast that event unless the event has been made available to a qualifying broadcaster, in accordance with the order under section 2, on request and the payment of reasonable market rates by the qualifying broadcaster; and that where a qualifying broadcaster acquires the right to broadcast a designated event, the qualifying broadcaster shall broadcast the event on a free television service providing near universal coverage.</P>
    <P>Section 5 transposes the mandatory provisions of Article 3a of the Television Without Frontiers Directive to ensure that no broadcaster in our jurisdiction operates in such a way as to deprive a substantial proportion of the population in another member state of the opportunity of following events designated by that member state on free television.</P>
    <P>Section 6 provides that where a broadcaster alleges that an activity or conduct prohibited by section 4 or 5 is being, has been or is about to be carried out by one or more broadcasters, the broadcaster shall be entitled to apply to the High Court for civil remedies such as a restraining order or damages from another broadcaster.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides that if broadcasters are unable to agree on what constitutes reasonable market rates with respect to television coverage of an event, either of the broadcasters may apply to the High Court for an order determining reasonable market rates for an event. Section 8 contains the Short Title to the Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1252" /> I cannot conclude without acknowledging the debt we owe to those who organise and administer sports in this country. By and large we have been well served by those who give of their time to ensure that sport at every level is organised and that participation for both participants and spectators alike is possible. These organisations have the primary purpose of developing the sports with which they are concerned and they fully appreciate the cultural value which their premier events represent. This is why I have proposed such a significant consultation process. I wish to emphasise that this will be a meaningful and thoughtful process in which the views of all will be given the respect they deserve. The objective of this Bill is to protect the public interest in ensuring continued access to all to television coverage of outstanding events. I am well aware that there is a strong public interest in ensuring that our sports organisations can continue to manage and administer our various sporting disciplines.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the introduction of the Major Events Television Coverage Bill, 1999. I strongly support the concept behind the Bill, which is necessary and somewhat overdue.</P>
      <P>Article 3a of the EU directive which was accepted in June 1997 states:</P>
      <P>1. Each member state may take measures in accordance with Community law to ensure that broadcasters under its jurisdiction do not broadcast on an exclusive basis events which are regarded by that member state as being of major importance for society in such a way as to deprive a substantial proportion of the public in that member state of the possibility of following such events <i>via</i> live coverage or deferred coverage on free television. If it does so, the member state concerned shall draw up a list of designated events, national or non-national, which it considers to be of major importance for society. It shall do so in a clear and transparent manner in due and effective time. In so doing the member state concerned shall also determine whether these events should be available <i>via </i>whole or partial live coverage, or where necessary or appropriate for objective reasons in the public interest, whole or partial deferred coverage.</P>
      <P>2. Member states shall immediately notify to the Commission any measures taken or to be taken pursuant to paragraph 1. Within a period of three months from the notification, the Commission shall verify that such measures are compatible with Community law and communicate them to the other member states. It shall seek the opinion of the Committee established pursuant to Article 23a. It shall forthwith publish the measures taken in the Official Journal of the European Communities and at least once a year the consolidated list of measures taken by member states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1253" /> I passed a public premises at the conclusion of the European cup final last Wednesday evening. I had forgotten that the match was taking place, but my experience showed me the phenomenal impact sport has had on people in Ireland and throughout the world. If one travels around the country as summer begins, one can see the interest people have in looking after their well-being by means of their engaging in various exercises and sports such as walking, cycling, etc.</P>
    <P>The Minister made the important point that there was a time when sporting organisations held the opinion that coverage of an event on television would detract from the prospective attendance and adversely affect gate receipts. Her point is particularly relevant to the Gaelic Athletic Association. When sport becomes disciplined and, for want of a better word, professional, it holds an attraction for a greater number of people. This becomes evident if one considers the attendance figures for Munster football and hurling finals and the All-Ireland series, events which have created enormous interest in Gaelic sports. Coverage of these events by RTE has allowed younger people to see the creation of new heroes they wish to emulate. Coverage of sporting events has had a major impact on Irish people in terms of what it means to be involved, to aspire to greatness and the limits of physical achievement and to win. This is fundamental to our identity as a people.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to John Treacy, Sonia O'Sullivan and Catherina McKiernan but she neglected to mention Michelle de Bruin because of the circumstances in which that good lady finds herself.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I only gave a selection of names. There are many people to whom I could have referred but I did not have time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that. I recall attending a Council of Ministers meeting in Brussels when Michelle de Bruin won her first Olympic gold medal and watching the event late into the night. I was justly proud of her victory and I hope the difficulties in which she is currently embroiled can be resolved by the international groups which heard her appeal recently.</P>
      <P>The Minister has set out what she wishes to achieve in the Bill. The Private Members' Bill introduced by Deputy Michael D. Higgins last year set out a number of criteria to deal with the convergence of technology, ideas, information, etc. I listened recently to a so-called expert on technology who said his only regret was that he was not 11 years of age and able to absorb all the things which will happen in the next ten to 15 years, which we do not understand now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ability to broadcast major sporting events world-wide has had enormous consequences for sports men and women. Tony Ward, an international rugby player of the highest calibre, said that when he was a player the Irish team travelled economy class to Australia because the IRFU did <Col N="1254" /> not pay them but that players now travel business class and are paid professionals. This is due to the international coverage of sport which has created more competition and generated money.</P>
    <P>Sports men and women at the top of their profession are in a position to demand appearance fees and huge salaries for their skill and performance. In some cases this has led to pressure being applied to hundreds of thousands of younger athletes and sports participants of a slightly lesser class to boost their performance by taking drugs. Because of the international coverage of major events, young athletes, who want to aspire to that level of adulation and acclaim, resort to the use of drugs and steroids, to their detriment and to the disgrace of international teams.</P>
    <P>When I was privileged to be in Cabinet we went to great lengths to bring to Ireland the Tour de France, which is the third major sporting event in the world after the World Cup and the Olympics. However, on that occasion members of the teams involved in the race subsequently admitted to using banned substances to enhance their performances. The use of performance enhancing drugs brought the sport into disrepute.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the advances made over the past 30 years. In the 1950s people gathered in houses to listen to Micheál O'Hehir on wet battery radios describe the heroic achievements of their stars from various counties. There will be major changes in the next ten years in the broadcasting of major events. A person, for example, will be able to watch on his television screen one end of the tennis court during the Wimbledon tennis final or will be able to follow one golfer during the Ryder Cup or the British Open. The range will be phenomenal so this is an important Bill.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed we still do not know what the Minister considers to be important major sporting events for the people. When a Private Members' Bill on this issue was introduced by Deputy Michael Higgins almost a year ago, we mentioned six or seven major sporting events which are of importance to the people, including the hurling and football finals. Whether handball qualifies as a Gaelic game or as being of major importance to the people is another matter.</P>
    <P>The Aintree Grand National is a major international sporting event. Horse racing is important to our economy as it attracts large investment and it is avidly followed by hundreds of thousands of people every year. If BSkyB buys exclusive rights to the Aintree Grand National, which is important to this country, as Irish trainers, jockeys and horses participate in it, will the Minister be able to guarantee the viewers they will be able to see it free to air without having to pay at the point of reception? Television viewers, who may not be television zombies but who may like to watch certain sporting events in which they are interested, are concerned about this issue.</P>
    <P>Some people may watch 20 television channels. The sports covered on some of these television <Col N="1255" /> channels are unknown to me and I have a wide interest in many sports. As time goes by, more of these lesser known sports will become part of the Olympic Games, which will make them farcical. I am not sure if any of these new fangled sports are important to Ireland.</P>
    <P>Heavyweight boxing, such as the Holyfield vs. Lewis fight which ended in a draw but which has been rescheduled for September, has always been of major interest in Ireland. However, I object to being forced to go into a public house or a golf club to watch a sporting event because it is not available in my home. I know it is important from a commercial point of view to attract viewers to these establishments where there is a good atmosphere as people share a drink and a chat and build up a team spirit. However, people might want to watch it in their homes and they should not be denied the opportunity to do so for commercial reasons. This Bill is important in that regard.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that the 85 per cent coverage requirement of the population, which has to be met by 2001, has already been met by RTE 1, Network 2 and Teilifís na Gaeilge. While TV3 may not be at that level yet, it will reach it now that it has purchased various programmes and acquired major sporting rights. I am led to believe that it has a unique advantage in that it has what is called the &ldquo;must carry&rdquo; status on all the MMDS systems in Ireland as a result of a specific statutory provision under section 17 of the Radio and Television Act, 1988. This section is anomalous and inequitable in the context of other carriers. It affords one national television service a major advantage over others. TnaG, for instance, does not have &ldquo;must carry&rdquo; status on MMDS systems and as a result it is not carried on them. It is clearly placed at a disadvantage.</P>
    <P>TnaG, with a relatively limited number of cameras, covers club football and hurling championship matches, including Gaeltacht competitions, etc., and while the games might not attract huge numbers of viewers, they are still important. The rights may not be bought by Rupert Murdoch for dissemination on Sky Sports but TnaG is providing a service in this regard. If the Bill is to be fair and equitable, all television carriers should have the same distribution and transmission rights. Perhaps, when the Minister replies she will deal with the lack of &ldquo;must carry&rdquo; status for TnaG on MMDS.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Public Enterprise clearly stated in reply to Parliamentary Question No. 104 on 30 March 1999 that &ldquo;the question of the TV channels to be carried by MMDS systems is a matter for my colleague the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands&rdquo;. If the Bill is not fair, it must be amended to be such, otherwise the Minister will be in breach of EU policy as expressed in a number of agreements and directives, the most recent of which was in paragraph 4 of resolution 1999/C30/01 of the EU Council of Ministers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1256" /> I accept the principles set down by the Minister. It is necessary to do so but I am disappointed that she has not outlined a list of sporting events which she considers important, such as the all-Ireland hurling and football championships, the pitch and toss in Barefield, County Clare, the Olympic Games, the World Cup, the Tour De France, the Kentucky Derby, the Superbowl, the Commonwealth Games and the World Athletics Championships. These events attract enormous attention and, while they might not be of relevance to everybody, somewhere along the line a young man or woman may be inspired to lift himself or herself to greater performance which is good for himself or herself and national morale.</P>
    <P>I was interested in the Minister's report on the meeting in Olympia, Greece, at which various European people gave their views on television's role in broadcasting sport and its impact on the development of sport as a spectacle. It is certainly worthy of deep consideration. The concept of solidarity applied to sports in relations between inter-club competition and international competition is also of importance. When American athletes are invited to compete in international events in Europe and are offered £500,000 in appearance money to do so, it gives one an idea of the monetary value attached to athletes performing at the height of their abilities in certain sports. The concept of sports ethics, including the possible manipulation of competition, also deserves serious consideration.</P>
    <P>We discussed previously the question of cross-ownership of broadcasting and communications facilities in terms of the influence of Murdoch and BSkyB as an international communicator. He influences the lives of millions of people. The point was made during the debate on the Private Members' Bill that one could watch movies, buy magazines and rent videos from the same source. The determination of cross-ownership of media outlets is of great interest to all of us.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that the Commission will prepare a report for the European Council meeting in Helsinki in December 1999 but did not say how long the public consultation process will take to complete. I do not know whether she intends to wait beyond 1999 but I would not if I were her. I would conduct the public consultation process as quickly and as openly as possible. The Minister should outline a list of sports because she will immediately elicit a response from those around the country who wish to have other sports included. If she does list a range of sports, public discussion will not take place. There is no point in having secret meetings in Tipperary to ask people whether there are sports which they wish to see covered by the Bill.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach is the best supporter Manchester United, Glasgow Celtic and Dublin ever had. I recall competing against him in <Col N="1257" />&ldquo;Superstars&rdquo; in 1979 in various disciplines. The Minister should publish a list of events in order to initiate public discussion. It would be to her benefit because such a list can always be amended by statutory order in consultation with the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation of the day.</P>
      <P>Technical details will be debated on Committee Stage. I welcome the Bill even though it is overdue and I am disappointed that the Minister has not outlined a list of events. I agree with her that those who involve themselves in sport in a voluntary capacity deserve credit. Every Saturday morning at thousands of venues throughout the country, hundreds of children are ferried forward and back for training, games, etc., by their parents and others involved in various sports.</P>
      <P>Discipline has become very strict because of all the scandals which have been rightly exposed; people have been punished. Movement of children is regarded seriously among GAA teams. When dropping children to their homes, the organisers must ensure that a number of them are present so that there will not be any allegations of sexual abuse, etc. I trained football teams and on occasion might have dropped eight or ten children at their homes. However, one cannot do that anymore because of events which have taken place in various sports.</P>
      <P>The Minister's understanding of the engagement of people from many walks of life in many sports is well merited and I support that. That concept of voluntary involvement is self-evident when one travels around the country and sees thousands of adults cycling, walking and so on. That is good for the national mentality. We have lagged behind in providing physical education for youngsters and it is time this was changed. That change is happening as a result of major sporting events being beamed into our homes by television. Youngsters worship their heroes and aspire to emulating them.</P>
      <P>I look forward to the commencement of the public debate. I am prepared to give the Minister a list of sporting events that are important to Irish people. The Minister should start this debate now because summer makes people more outgoing and sports minded. Their personalities change for the better and it would be timely to have this debate now. The Minister could come back after the summer with a list of events and she will have the full support of this side of the House, though it may have to be amended after consultation with the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation. I welcome the Bill and wish to see the list produced and the public debate commence. This Bill can be related to the Broadcasting Bill published last week and both are very important. To use a technological term, I hope they provide a platform for the benefit of everyone in the country over the next 20 years, as the world is driven by commercial technology. The time spent acquiring skill for a particular sport can be wasted as the emphasis may change as time goes on.</P>

      <P>Fáiltím roimh an Bhille seo. Tá sé thar a bheith tábhachtach go mbeadh gach duine sa Stát seo in ann tuairisciú teilifíse ar mhórócáidí a fheiscint gan costas breise. Beidh Páirtí an Lucht Oibre ag cabhrú leis an Aire an Bille a sheoladh tríd an Oireachtas chomh tapaidh agus is féidir é. Tá point anseo agus ansiúd go mbeimid ag iarraidh míniú a fháil fúthú agus beimid ag smaoineamh ar leasaithe a chur síos más gá leasaithe a chur síos.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Bill. I compliment Deputy Michael D. Higgins, who, while Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, spearheaded the movement towards article 3a being introduced. That was in place before he left office in June 1997 and it has taken this long for the Minister to introduce this legislation. As Deputy Kenny said, the Minister rejected a Private Members' Bill from Deputy Higgins which sought the implementation of the directive and to have it incorporated into Irish law as well as placing limits on cross-media ownership. The Minister has not given a solid indication that there is legislation pending in the area of cross-media ownership. She referred to the integrity of sport in the context of the European conference on sport in Olympia recently.</P>
      <P>Sport now involves great sums of money. However, some of the footballers in England who retired before the abolition of the maximum wage had little enough to show for their careers. It is important that athletes who perform at the highest level get a worthwhile return for their talent and skill. However, I am worried that there is too much money coming into this area.</P>
      <P>We talk of society now being divided into two groups, the IT rich and the IT poor, or the communications rich and the communications poor. The Minister will embark on a consultation process after this Bill passes and I welcome her indication to the House that this will be a worthwhile consultation process. The Minister should bear in mind that that consultation process should be aimed at giving a sense of ownership of the television service in the State to the public at large. Those who are made most vulnerable by our movement down the road of subscription are those with low incomes and in disadvantaged areas, be those areas in urban or rural regions. It is very important that those people are welcomed into the consultation process, the narrow focus of this Bill notwithstanding. Their views must be taken into consideration when the Minister draws up a list of events to be sent to Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like the Minister to expand in some detail on events other than sporting occasions she envisages coming within the remit of the Bill. There are certain events covered by television that come to mind but I would like to hear the <Col N="1259" /> Minister's views on this. What events in an Irish context come within the remit of this Bill?</P>
    <P>Earlier today we debated the forthcoming football game with Yugoslavia. Sport is a huge part of virtually everybody's life in Ireland and that is true throughout Europe. However, it alarms me that the Yugoslavian team is being used politically and that there are links between that team and the military and some thugs who are probably operating as paramilitaries in Yugoslavia. I look to our sporting organisations to ensure that certain basic standards are brought to bear on all countries we enter into competition with. Broadcasting organisations also have a part to play in this regard. Terrible things are happening in Kosovo. I made my position on this matter clear in the House this afternoon. The match between the Republic of Ireland and Yugoslavia should be cancelled, but one wonders who will take the lead in cancelling it.</P>
    <P>Sport has often been misused. The government of the Third Reich, for example, used the Berlin Olympic Games in 1936 for propaganda purposes. There is potential also, to misuse sport for commercial purposes. I am pleased that the European Union is taking a keen interest in the question of integrity in sport. I do not like the increasingly frequent practice of holding sporting events at times which suit commercial sponsors. Sporting events should be held at the time best suited for the participants and spectators and not the dictates of commercial sponsors. The yielding of control by sporting governing bodies to commercial interests is dangerous and detrimental to sport. The relationship between money and sport needs to be carefully policed and integrity in sport must be nurtured and protected.</P>
    <P>Sport plays a major role in the formation of young people. It is important that sportsmen and sportswomen, particularly those who perform at the highest level, should behave as suitable role models for young people. This is not always the case. I was surprised when, some weeks ago, the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation referred to the use of performance enhancing substances in Irish secondary schools. The essence of sport is competition but it must be fair and equal. The prospect of earning large sums of money makes the use of performance enhancing drugs very tempting to a young and talented sports person. We must be vigilant with regard to drug taking of this sort. These issues should form part of the consultative process which will follow the passage of the Bill.</P>
    <P>We all agree that certain sporting events should be included on the special list. These would include the Aintree Grand National, the Epsom Derby, the FA Cup Final, the Olympic Games, the British Open, Wimbledon and the US Masters. These should be available to all television viewers irrespective of means. The essence of sport is sharing, whether by participants or spectators. It would be inequitable if certain sections <Col N="1260" /> of society did not have access to prestige sporting events. Discussion of this Bill helps us to identify the priorities of our society. In examining all aspects of sport and the influence of commercial interests on it, we must consider the negative influence which the leading participants in certain sports may have on our young people. Responsibility in this matter must be taken by broadcasters and sporting organisations. We constantly hear of sportsmen and sportswomen using not only performance enhancing drugs, but what are euphemistically called recreational drugs. It is important that the culture of sport is monitored. Irish television stations should take a responsible attitude to the broadcasting of sports whose participants are not good role models for our children. Many people who live in my area can receive four television channels and deflector licences will soon be issued more widely so that more and more Irish people will be watching foreign television stations.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill although I wish it had been published sooner. I have no serious reservations about its provisions. I hope the Minister will clarify which events, other than sporting events, will be covered by the Bill. I support the principle of protecting access, free to air, to prestigious national and international sporting events. I compliment my colleague, Deputy Michael D. Higgins, who realised that people such as Rupert Murdoch and bodies such as the Football Association could only be dealt with in a European context. The Labour Party will assist in the early passage of the Bill and I look forward to the worthwhile consultation process which the Minister has promised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Despite the existence of an impressive array of legislation, some of which was mentioned at Question Time, there is an enormous problem in the handling and management of waste. There is not yet a culture of waste mini<Col N="1261" /> misation and the Government is not giving the leadership required to bring about a significant and lasting shift in behaviour. As a matter of common observation, private, collective and corporate behaviours are still vastly different from what is required if we are to begin to make headway against the problem of waste.</P>
      <P>Examples abound. When Kildare County Council cuts the grass in the median of the Naas and Newbridge bypass and South Dublin County Council cuts the grass in the median of the Naas dual carriageway the mowers throw up an assortment of waste thrown from passing vehicles or blown off uncovered or carelessly covered loads. When groups of residents organise a clean-up in the green areas of estates or along roadways in the vicinity of towns they regularly cart away huge volumes of waste ranging from packaging, plastic and glass bottles, cardboard packaging to household durable goods.</P>
      <P>It is a common sight to find fridges dumped in ditches. Abandoned car wrecks are still not an uncommon sight in bogs throughout the country or in forestry areas open to the public. The streets of our towns and cities are regularly carpeted in rubbish. The countryside abounds in unofficial dump sites. One would be tempted to think that the erection of a &ldquo;No Dumping&rdquo; sign by a local authority is taken an invitation to start an informal rubbish dump.</P>
      <P>We are given to sticking out our chests and talking about how green and clean an island this is. There is a series of advertisements on television in which this country is referred to as the cleanest country in Europe. Most observers, including a great many tourists, would quickly come to the conclusion that, in terms of litter and rubbish, this is one of the dirtiest countries in Europe. We have some of the dirtiest towns and cities in the European Union in spite of a far lower population density.</P>
      <P>In October last year the Government launched a policy statement on waste management with considerable fanfare Waste Management, Changing our Ways. It is a nice glossy document and contains the following apparently impressive targets to be achieved over a 15 year timescale: a diversion of 50 per cent of overall household waste away from landfill; a minimum 65 per cent reduction in biodegradable wastes consigned to landfill; the development of waste recovery facilities employing environmentally-beneficial technologies as an alternative to landfill; recycling 35 per cent of municipal waste; recycling at least 50 per cent of construction and demolition waste within a five year period with a progressive increase to at least 85 per cent over 15 years; rationalisation of municipal waste landfills with progressive and sustained reductions in numbers leading to an integrated network of some 20 state-of-the-art facilities, and an 80 per cent reduction in methane emissions from landfill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a wish-list, that would be hard to beat. I cannot find anything wrong with it as a set of tar<Col N="1262" /> gets and objectives. The Minister of State will probably tell me that, as it was only published in October last year, it is idle to be looking for progress at this point. It is impossible, however, to detect any movement in the direction of those targets. There is no sign of what is referred to in the document as the rationalisation of municipal waste landfills with progressive and sustained reductions to about 20 state-of-the-art sites. What we have instead is a series of proposals for new super dumps at various locations throughout the country.</P>
    <P>There is a proposal for Loughrea, County Galway, which has been a source of contention for some considerable time. A series of sites are being prospected in County Clare. I do not know when this will come to an end. There is a proposal for a super dump in the Slievefelim Mountains which is justified on the spurious grounds that it is in a remote area. Siting a dump high up in the hills at a watershed makes no sense. There is a proposal for a major landfill dump at Silvermines, County Tipperary to which I will return. Similar proposals were made in the past. I understand there was a proposal by Limerick Corporation to site a landfill dump in the Clare hills, north of the city. I suppose we should be grateful that some of the planners of these monstrosities listen to some of what people have to say. People do not want landfill sites on their doorstep, but to site them in areas of natural beauty where they could pollute an entire river catchment area is not the answer.</P>
    <P>There is a fear in some parts of the country that almost any hole in the ground or disused quarry will eventually become a landfill site, and this is not idle talk. Some years ago when Dublin Corporation indicated that it would have to cease dumping sewage sludge at sea there was great worry in the area of County Kildare between Naas and Kilcullen, where there are a great many disused sand and gravel pits, that they would be candidates for the dumping of sewage sludge. This did not enthuse the people of the area.</P>
    <P>It will be argued that state-of-the-art landfill sites are different. &ldquo;State-of-the-art&rdquo; is taken to mean that rubbish will not be blowing around, that everything will arrive in sealed containers and will be covered. I do not believe that any state of any art can make a landfill dump an environmentally friendly operation. Apart from anything else, one cannot keep covering as one dumps. Inevitably, in any landfill site, no matter how well managed, there will be loose rubbish blowing around, scavengers, including birds and animals, odour and general inconvenience to the public in the surrounding area.</P>
    <P>Neither, Sir, can I see any discernible progress in diverting construction and demolition waste away from landfill. In 1995, the last time a survey was done &ndash; although the Minister may say there is a newer one than the most recent to which I have access &ndash; approximately 1.5 million tonnes of construction and demolition waste was produced in this country. Over one third of that waste was recovered leaving one million tonnes to be disposed of in landfill. If I understood the <Col N="1263" /> Dublin Corporation plan correctly, 50 per cent by value of what goes into landfill dumps around Dublin is construction and demolition waste. It is a fair guess that the total value of construction waste now being disposed of in landfill sites is considerably greater than in 1995, despite the Government's targets. That seems to follow logically given the increase in the volume of construction activity and the lack of any sign of an increase in the rate at which construction and demolition waste is being recovered and used for other purposes.</P>
    <P>We have regulations to reduce and deal with packaging waste. As far as I can determine, these regulations are more honoured in the breach than in the observance. A survey carried out by Repak at the end of last year showed just how little progress has been made. It showed also that most local authorities were doing little, if anything, to enforce those regulations. Many local authorities knew very little about the regulations and, in most cases, they had no administrative machinery to do anything about implementing them.</P>
    <P>An examination of the Repak survey and the replies of the local authorities, most of which replied, is very interesting. The level of knowledge of what the packaging waste regulations require local authorities to do is minimal, the level of enforcement is minimal and, apparently, the level of knowledge among the firms which should be concerned as being targets, so to speak, of the regulations was minimal. There did not seem to be any great appetite to do much about it because there was no pressure on anybody. The local authorities did not seem to feel any great pressure on them to implement the regulations and the firms which produce and handle large volumes of packaging waste then felt there was no particular pressure on them either to do anything about achieving the objectives set out in the regulations.</P>
    <P>We have regulations to deal with toxic and hazardous waste but, notwithstanding the fact some of the regulations have been in existence for some years, the Minister of State informed me today at Question Time in response to a parliamentary question that the Environmental Protection Agency is currently drafting a national hazardous waste management plan which will make recommendations for hazardous waste management. He informed me that it is anticipated this will include recommendations to local authorities regarding collection and reception systems for waste batteries. This is an implementation of regulations which have been there for some time. It is an implementation of regulations to deal with a problem, the existence of which has been known for some considerable time.</P>
    <P>These measures should have been in place long ago. There are some operators who endeavour to work in accordance with the regulations, as they stand, but they find their position is undermined by pirate operators who have no regard whatever for the regulations. An operator who goes to the <Col N="1264" /> trouble of getting the necessary authorisations from a local authority and making the necessary connections with a firm in the UK for a proper place in which to dispose of used batteries, has to make a charge for this, but now finds he is being upscuttled at every hand's turn by pirate operators who collect used batteries, make no charge for them and do God knows what with them. They are certainly not disposing of them in any of the ways contemplated in the regulations.</P>
    <P>Unless I am seriously mistaken, and I do not believe I am, it was only very recently that the Houses of the Oireachtas got around to the simple matter of having a system for the recovery of used batteries from the various bits of small electrical equipment we use. I have been unable to find out, because nobody seems to know the answer, whether there is a system for the recovery of used fluorescent light bulbs from Government and public offices, even in Dublin. Such bulbs contain some dangerous material, for example mercury, not at levels which make it toxic but certainly dangerous. As far as I have been able to find out, nobody knows whether there is a system in place even for recovering that material from Government offices. I have asked in all the places where it seemed appropriate but there was no answer.</P>
    <P>There is one operator who currently offers a system for the disposal of fluorescent light tubes. As far as I can determine, the Environmental Protection Agency is not sure whether this is dangerous or hazardous waste. Up to recent weeks, there was protracted correspondence between the Environmental Protection Agency, which is the licensing authority, and the proposed operator. They could not agree on what was the appropriate system to deal with these bulbs.</P>
    <P>That does not suggest we are serious about the implementation of regulations which are already on the Statute Book. There is no evidence to suggest we are moving away from landfill as the principle method of waste disposal. Some of the measures now proposed, as I already indicated, are based on various spurious grounds. The Slievefelim Mountains proposal is a case in point. Another such case is the proposal for Silvermines which is apparently being justified, at least in part, on the grounds that a railway spur, which originally served the mines at that location, is still in place. It has been suggested that this could be used to bring large volumes of waste to the site without putting a burden on our roads. On the surface, that has a certain plausibility but it disappears on closer examination.</P>
    <P>Is our railway system really capable of carrying a substantial extra volume of traffic in the form of wagon loads of waste? We already have substantial safety problems to confront on our railways. The Minister for Public Enterprise recently announced a substantial investment programme to deal with safety problems on the railways. Until those problems are resolved, I do not believe any of us could be confident that the system could carry a large extra volume of waste.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1265" /> The Silvermines proposal is based on the idea that it can take waste from a large number of counties around it. Unfortunately, between Silvermines and most of the adjoining counties, there is no rail link without taking a very long roundabout trip over our fairly thin railway system to get there. That would not make sense. I suspect the real essence of that proposal is rather different and that in reality the Silvermines proposal, like most other proposals, will require a large volume of road transported waste being brought to the site. I have no doubt &ndash; I may be a little ahead of the posse, though I see encouraging signs of change &ndash; that the thermal treatment of waste will have to be a very important part of our action in the future. However, I am not confident this is being handled properly. There is a proposal for a thermal waste treatment facility to deal with toxic waste beside Kilcock, County Kildare, on the border with County Meath. This is being justified on the basis of there being a nearby rail link. The proposal is that large tonnages of waste will be brought to the site by rail. However, the same or even bigger questions arise about the capacity of our rail system in this case. It is true that there are proposals to double track the railway line between Connolly Station and Kilcock, but that extra capacity is necessary to deal with the volume of commuter traffic on the line. The double tracking of the line is some years away and even when it is done there will be a serious doubt about the capacity of the line to handle large tonnages of waste for the proposed thermal treatment site.</P>
    <P>The reality is that thermal treatment of waste using today's technology can offer a viable and environmentally acceptable alternative to our current over-reliance on landfill. Much opposition to thermal treatment of waste ignores technological developments in recent years and is based on the &ldquo;not in my back yard&rdquo; principle. Most of it could be dealt with if there was rational planning for the provision of a limited number of thermal treatment plants, which is all that is required. Technology is capable of handling a huge part of our waste problem, given some progress on minimisation etc. in perhaps half a dozen plants throughout the country.</P>
    <P>To be effective, waste management policy, be it waste minimisation, recycling, landfill disposal or thermal treatment, must be driven by the Government. Given the technology now available and the particular dispersal of our population, we do not need a waste treatment facility in every local authority area. What is necessary is a small number of proper waste treatment facilities reasonably near major population centres on carefully chosen sites. This is where we encounter a problem. It is idle to expect that local authorities will readily volunteer to provide sites for that limited number of waste treatment facilities. Strategic decisions must be made at a different level on the basis of regional consultation. The Minister of State will probably say, as he did earlier this afternoon, that this is inconsistent with my <Col N="1266" /> principled position of giving more power to local authorities. However, it is not inconsistent. There are some areas of policy which will not be handled at individual local authority level. We accept this in relation to national roads and sometimes in the case of major water supply schemes and we must also accept it in relation to rational waste management policy. In short, it is time for the Government to start driving this process rather than reacting to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Dukes for affording me the opportunity of contributing to this debate. I wish to underline some of the points made by him. We lack a clearly defined policy in relation to waste management. It appears as though the issue is being postponed again and again in the hope that something might happen, that somebody will break or blink and that as a result there will be a general acquiescence in dealing with the issue. The need for waste disposal and management is greater now than ever before. The population is set to increase fairly dramatically over the coming years. It is no harm to remember that the people we used to export on an annual basis are no longer going abroad to the same extent which means we must make greater provision for them at home. Part of that provision relates to services and the provision of infrastructure in general. This is one sector where provision should be made at an early stage, something which has not yet been done. The Government is shirking its responsibilities, hiving them off to the local authorities on the one hand and hoping that through entrepreneurial skills of one kind or other somebody will break through the maze and provide a facility which will meet today's requirements.</P>
      <P>I wish for a moment to look back at the recent history of waste disposal in my constituency and in County Meath, the constituency of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. There was a very substantial plan in County Meath to locate a landfill facility on a greenfield site between two urban population centres. The issue was pursued over the past couple of years with strong local opposition. I do not know why people pursued that proposal which never had a chance of being permitted and which would have been totally grotesque given the planning history of the area. Yet it was pursued vigorously and, in my mind, wrongly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most recent intrusion in that area is the proposal referred to by Deputy Dukes for an incinerator at Kilcock. We accept that this issue will have to be tackled at some stage. However, the current proposal is to site an incinerator adjacent to the village. Some experts will say such a facility must be located adjacent to a town. However, Kilcock is recovering from job losses in the 1980s and is trying to reconstruct and rebuild itself by putting in place the necessary facilities to meet today's demands. The village is less than 25 miles from Dublin city and is an attractive area for residential development. Some genius decided <Col N="1267" /> that an incinerator should be located 200 yards from the village, 250 yards from a food processing plant and adjacent to the railway station and the national primary road network, namely, the N4-M4. No reference was made to the fact that since the motorway was opened the village has been completely bypassed and is isolated from the rest of civilisation. Nobody cared a whit for the village or thought the unfortunate people of the town would have any need to get onto the motorway or travel outside their immediate area. No interchange to the motorway was provided resulting in residents having to travel parallel to the motorway for four or five miles and get onto it somewhere else. I mention this to show the insensitivity of this proposal. I cannot understand how anybody thought the siting of an incinerator in the proposed area was a great idea.</P>
    <P>The greatest demand in the area in the past few years has been for commuter rail services to alleviate the traffic congestion on the roads. However, somebody has now decided this would be a great location for an incinerator and that waste can be carried on the rail line. That was not the idea behind the development plan for the rail services or what people in the region thought would result from the plan. The people have been suffering long enough from road traffic congestion and the last thing they want is somebody saying that as the rail services have been upgraded and given the proposal for a second track it is time they were used to transport refuse to an incinerator.</P>
    <P>The other issue is the proximity of the proposed site to the national primary road network. Of course it will be fine for people in other parts of the country, but I do not understand the logic of somebody suggesting that the hard pressed road network system in the area should be utilised by this facility which will serve the rest of the country. Neither do I understand how anybody came up with the proposal in the first place or thought it feasible or viable, particularly given that the site will in future be in the centre of a developing village. I cannot understand how anybody would have thought that would be a suitable location for something which is the equivalent of a 17 or 18 storey modern skyscraper, which will sit in a green field on the edge of the town on the horizon for all to see. Presumably somebody decided that this was the optimum location for such a proposal. I cannot understand the logic which led to that decision.</P>
    <P>I make those points simply to underline the worry on two counts: first, there is little or no regard for the increased demand for the provision of facilities to deal with waste management and refuse disposal in general; and second, there is obviously no regard for where such facilities might be located. Certainly there is little regard for the aesthetics of and the visual impact on the area. There is little regard for the utilisation and erosion of the hard pressed services which are already in existence in such places by such facili<Col N="1268" /> ties in the event of them going ahead. Unlike many other people in my area, I would have to voice strong opposition to this proposal.</P>
    <P>I know there will be those, including perhaps the Minister, who will say that here again is the NIMBY factor. In answer I would say that somebody should stand up with a proposal for a national waste management plan, put the proposals on the table and let us all have an input into the process. Until that is done, let us cut out this surreptitious nonsense where somebody sneaks in with a proposal in one county one day and in another the next. To go around in circles like that is not acceptable. This policy is unlikely to be successful and will very likely meet with stiff opposition.</P>
    <P>If the Government is serious about plans in this area, it is high time it looked at it in a realistic fashion and laid down proper guidelines whereby people will recognise what is likely to happen. The Government should have a worthwhile plan which will ensure that somebody is not just going over the map with a pin and deciding a certain location looks good because it is near a town which has road, rail, telecommunications and other services and serves the rest of the country. As long as that kind of policy continues there will be no agreement on and acceptance of such proposals.</P>
    <P>I support the motion as outlined by my colleague, Deputy Dukes. It is ironic that this is almost the week of the local elections. As we talk about all the things which local authorities should do, could do and have the powers to do and how local government will be enhanced for the future, nothing is said about this issue.</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny)</i>
        <b>:</b> A few Sundays ago my wife and I went for a drive. We parked the car close to a forestry plantation and went for a walk along a lovely picturesque road. As we walked along I saw what appeared to be a sofa on the edge of the plantation a few feet from the road. I do not know whether the person who left it there thought what they did would come under the heading of waste disposal or if they left it there for weary people to rest on, but that is not the kind of waste disposal anyone wants. It is incredible in this day and age that there are people who have no respect for the countryside or the environment and who dump things wherever it suits them as long as it is some distance from their own place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the roadside one will always find the unwelcome plastic bag of rubbish, which some fool decided to pack into the boot of the car when he or she went on a scenic Sunday drive. I am a firm believer in fining people for littering. There are <Col N="1269" /> not half enough litter wardens. Without wishing to get into any difficulty with people about fines for speeding, I would prefer to see somebody fined £50 for dumping plastic bags on the roadside or a sofa on the edge of a plantation than to see a decent citizen fined for driving at 42 miles per hour in a 30 mile per hour zone. I know it is far easier to catch the people who break speed limits but if we are serious, we must do something about catching those who dump and litter.</P>
    <P>On the spot fines will put manners on some people who seem to be devoid of even the basic manners. Such people would throw things in front of you as you walk along. I find it totally unacceptable that, despite all the training children receive from teachers to dispose of their plastic Tayto crisp bags, etc., in boscaí bruscar, we, as adults, seem to forget there are standards of cleanliness and neatness. I have the utmost sympathy for those in tidy towns who year after year get up early in the morning to collect garbage thrown around the previous night by louts.</P>
    <P>We expect urban councils, town commissions and county councils to ensure that every town is clean and neat and they do their work well. I was happy to hear that Carlow town, for example, came fifth when it came to cleanliness in the last tidy towns' competition, but the town is only tidy because the urban council workers are out early in the morning collecting garbage which should not be there. We must catch the culprits, those who dispose of waste illegally.</P>
    <P>We should make a greater effort to recycle waste. It is hard to figure out why we have so much difficulty separating glass, plastic and paper and why it must all go into one big waste container. If recycling can work in other countries, it should work here.</P>
    <P>Having collected the waste, we must be careful to dispose of it properly. Landfill sites are becoming less popular, despite the fact that there are stringent regulations about sealing the base of the site. These regulations are no harm because we must protect the water supply. If we contaminate it, we will be in trouble.</P>
    <P>The incineration system is one which must be tackled seriously. I know that every aspect of waste disposal falls prey to the NIMBY factor. We are all in favour of incinerators and suitable landfill sites as long as they are not located near us. They are not altogether a welcome sight. I am sure that in this day and age incinerators are less harmful than they were in the past.</P>
    <P>We must be careful about the collection of garbage in towns and cities. If we opt to privatise services, we must ensure that we do not create a monopoly where charges could get out of control and where, as in the past, people receive waivers. That system should not be forgotten because old age pensioners must still be looked after.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1270" /> To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann welcomes the major efforts by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to ensure full and effective implementation, by local authorities and relevant interests as appropriate, of the Waste Management Act, 1996, the Waste Management (Packaging) Regulations, 1997, and the Litter Pollution Act, 1997, through:</P>
    <P>&ndash;policy development and clear policy direction on waste management, as outlined in the Minister's waste policy statement, Changing our Ways (1998) and on waste recycling where he will issue a further policy statement this year;</P>
    <P>&ndash;extensive strategic study and progress in waste management planning;</P>

    <P>&ndash;initiatives and grant aid to raise awareness and support education on litter prevention; and</P>
    <P>&ndash;a planned new National Anti-Litter Forum.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The motion tabled by the Opposition is opportunistic and cynical. It takes no account of, and does not accord recognition to, the substantial efforts which have been made by Government, local authorities and other agencies in pursuing and implementing progressive waste and litter management policies. It does not recognise the complexity and wide scope of the issues which are being tackled at present. It does not reflect the concrete progress which has been achieved to date in these areas and the ongoing nature of the work in hand. It does not even seem to take account of relevant functional responsibilities underlying EU policy principles applying to waste <Col N="1271" /> and the civic and moral responsibilities of the public in relation to litter. Accordingly, I must firmly reject the terms of the motion as proposed.</P>
    <P>To date, the primary focus in relation to the operation and implementation of the Waste Management Act has been: the development and improvement of our waste management planning system as a basis for radical improvements in waste management practice and infrastructure; the implementation of an effective and comprehensive waste licensing and permitting system which ensures that waste recovery and disposal activities comply with high standards of environmental protection; the development of producer responsibility initiatives aimed at improved waste recovery performance; and the introduction of secondary legislation in response to EU and national requirements reflected in the Act. This work has been underpinned by clear policy direction, in particular the 1998 policy statement on waste management, Changing Our Ways.</P>
    <P>The 1996 Act recognises that meaningful and comprehensive waste management planning is a key prerequisite to improved waste management performance and much effort has been devoted at national, regional and local level to delivering effective results in this regard. Local authorities are required to make waste management plans in respect of their functional areas, and the Environmental Protection Agency is required to make a national hazardous waste management plan.</P>
    <P>Detailed requirements in relation to the preparation and content of local authority waste management plans were set out in the Waste Management (Planning) Regulations, 1997. From the outset, local authorities were encouraged by my Department to adopt a regional approach to this planning process with a view to the more efficient provision of services and infrastructure and to carry out preliminary waste management strategy studies to provide a context for evaluating available options and for identifying the measures, or combination of measures, most likely to optimise waste management.</P>
    <P>The response of local authorities has been very positive. Some 32 authorities are involved in or have adopted detailed regional waste management strategy studies or are otherwise committed to the making of regional waste management plans. Grant assistance of more than £1.5 million has been allocated under the EU-funded Operational Programme for Environmental Services 1994-99 in respect of a number of these strategy studies.</P>
    <P>The October 1998 policy statement on waste management, Changing Our Ways, is addressed chiefly to local authorities and is intended to provide a national policy framework for the adoption and implementation by local authorities of strategic waste management plans under which national objectives and targets will be attained. The statement outlines the Government's policy objectives in relation to waste management and suggests some key issues and considerations <Col N="1272" /> which must be addressed in order to achieve these objectives. In particular, it focuses on the need to give clear and practical expression to the requirements of the waste hierarchy by developing and pursuing integrated solutions which combine progressive policies with a sustainable and cost effective waste infrastructure.</P>
    <P>The policy statement strongly endorsed meaningful strategic planning on a regionalised basis; a dramatic reduction in reliance on landfill in favour of an integrated waste management approach which utilises a range of waste treatment options to deliver effective and efficient waste services and ambitious recycling and recovery targets; greater participation by the private sector in the provision of waste management services; a more effective and equitable system of waste charging which provides incentives for waste minimisation and recovery; greater utilisation of legislative instruments extending the scope of producer responsibility initiatives; and the mobilisation of public support and participation.</P>
    <P>Various ambitious targets were set for achievement over a 15 year timescale as outlined by Deputy Dukes. It is our intention to expand upon the policy issues and guidance outlined in Changing Our Ways with the publication later this year of another policy statement focusing on recycling and waste recovery generally. This policy document will address the factors and practical considerations which are relevant to the achievement of Government policy objectives and targets in this area. A number of relevant initiatives are already in place or in development and we are determined that the systematic approach being taken successfully in regard to strategic waste planning will also be pursued in the whole area of waste recovery and recycling. The new policy statement will provide firm leadership in this area and will outline the scope of measures which will be undertaken in the interests of a sustained expansion in recycling performance.</P>
    <P>It is evident that, in their strategic planning exercise, which is well advanced, local authorities are being guided by Changing Our Ways and that regional waste management plans will seek to give effect to the policy objectives and targets outlined in that statement. In particular, the emerging regional strategy studies address the scope for, and make recommendations regarding the provision of, an integrated waste management infrastructure, including kerbside collection of recyclable materials in urban areas; bringing facilities for recyclable materials in rural areas; civic amenity sites and waste transfer stations; biological treatment of green and organic household waste, materials recovery facilities; recycling capacity for construction and demolition waste; thermal treatment facilities; and residual landfill requirements. The formal adoption of statutory waste management plans should be substantively completed by mid-autumn.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased to acknowledge that local authorities have, in this planning process, demonstrated a willingness to embrace change and <Col N="1273" /> address sensitive issues in a realistic manner and I am confident that this positive approach will continue as they address the implementation of their plans. My Department will continue to liaise closely with local authorities as this planning process is brought to a conclusion and we will endeavour to provide ongoing support, advice and guidance to local authorities in regard to their development programmes.</P>
    <P>It is evident that the development of requisite infrastructure within the seven year timescale envisaged in Changing Our Ways will represent a major undertaking, requiring wholehearted commitment on the part of Government and local authorities and active participation of the private sector. Significant capital investment will be necessary.</P>
    <P>Support has already been provided for the expansion of waste recycling and other necessary infrastructure. Under the Operational Programme for Environmental Services 1994-99 an EU-funded programme of grant assistance in respect of local authority and private waste recycling infrastructure is currently under way, involving grant expenditure of more than £7.7 million in respect of some 70 individual projects. Grant assistance of more than £2.5 million has also been approved in respect of 11 projects involving hazardous waste management infrastructure. However, the scale of investment now required is of a completely different order. Based on the strategy studies and plans which have been completed to date, it is estimated that total capital investment required to meet projected infrastructural requirements in the solid waste area will exceed £600 million.</P>
    <P>These infrastructural requirements can be best achieved through the establishment of public-private partnerships delivering integrated regional solutions. As outlined in Changing Our Ways, there is considerable scope for increased participation by the private sector in all areas of waste management in Ireland, including the establishment and operation of waste recovery and disposal facilities. Private participation can contribute not just capital investment in infrastructure but specialist expertise in the application of alternative and emerging technologies, a better understanding of the dynamics of the marketplace, especially in relation to recyclables, and, in some cases, greater operational efficiency and flexibility. It can also release local authority staff and resources for other productive uses.</P>
    <P>Public-private partnerships are very well established in other EU countries and there is now considerable interest by the private sector in investment opportunities in waste management in Ireland. The potential for partnership arrangements is now being explored. A specially resourced unit has been set up in my Department to pursue the implementation of public-private partnership arrangements and will provide advice to local authorities with regard to procurement of necessary waste management infrastructure. This approach is fully consistent with the legal obli<Col N="1274" /> gations imposed on local authorities under the Waste Management Act, 1996, and will facilitate implementation of the &lsquo;polluter pays' principle. Having regard to this principle and the need for meaningful waste charges which provide incentives for waste prevention and minimisation, Exchequer funding for requisite waste infrastructure would not generally be appropriate.</P>
    <P>Part III of the 1996 Act provides for measures to reduce production and promote recovery of waste and, in particular, for the introduction of producer responsibility obligations in respect of individual waste streams. Significant producer responsibility obligations have been introduced in relation to packaging waste and farm plastic waste, and further such initiatives are under consideration.</P>
    <P>In a voluntary agreement with Government, Repak Limited was established by Irish industry to promote, co-ordinate and finance the collection and recovery of packaging waste so as to achieve national recycling-recovery targets imposed under EU legislation. Repak Limited is an approved body under the Waste Management (Packaging) Regulations, 1997, and businesses participating in its waste recovery scheme are exempt from obligations which would otherwise apply under the regulations.</P>
    <P>Repak Limited's activities are financed by fees from these member businesses. To date, the income generated has been applied mainly to support the collection and recovery of packaging waste from the domestic waste stream.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that useful progress has been made by Repak Limited since it became operational in July 1997 but there is considerable scope for further expansion of its packaging waste recovery activities. The company has indicated that it will develop its operations substantially during 1999. In addition to providing ongoing support for the recovery of domestic packaging waste, Repak Limited has set out to arrange for the free collection of up to nearly 90,000 tonnes of in-house packaging waste generated by members, to enter into contractual arrangements for the recycling of up to 112,000 tonnes of packaging waste and to support the development by an appropriate urban authority of an integrated &ldquo;kerbside&rdquo; collection scheme for domestic packaging waste. My Department will closely monitor the progress being made by Repak Limited in this regard.</P>
    <P>An equivalent recovery scheme for farm plastic waste is being operated by the Irish Farm Films Producers Group and good progress has been made to date in the collection from farms and recovery of used silage wrap and other farm plastic wastes. During 1998, approximately 15,000 tonnes of farm plastics were sold subject to a voluntary levy, which funded the collection and recycling of nearly 1,900 tonnes of plastic waste. Work is ongoing on the development of further producer responsibility initiatives in relation to specific waste streams, including construction and demolition waste.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1275" /> New waste management facilities are generally unwelcome to the public and invariably generate vigorous local opposition. In part, this is a legacy of past poor performance, particularly in relation to municipal waste landfills, which were perceived by the public to be a source of nuisance and environmental pollution, and were not subject to external regulation. It is essential that the general public has confidence that waste activities, which can have significant potential for environmental impact, are subject to rigorous and independent environmental control. Accordingly, Part IV of the 1996 Act provides for a stringent system of integrated waste licensing by the EPA in respect of all significant waste recovery and disposal activities. This is intended to ensure that high environmental standards apply in relation to the establishment, management, operation, closure and aftercare of licensable waste facilities. Licensing obligations are being imposed on a phased basis since May 1997 and will apply universally from 1 October 1999.</P>
    <P>The licensing process is necessarily intensive. To date, the EPA has received 100 waste licence applications, granted ten licences and given notice of three proposed licensing decisions. Regulations have also been introduced providing for the grant of waste permits by local authorities in respect of specified waste recovery and disposal activities which need not warrant integrated licensing by the EPA.</P>
    <P>An intensive programme of regulatory updating has been carried out under the 1996 Act and further new regulatory measures will be put in place during 1999. To date, 14 sets of regulations have been made under the 1996 Act addressing matters such as waste planning, producer responsibility obligations, the movement, transhipment and general control of hazardous wastes and public access to information, as well as waste licensing and granting permits. These regulations replace and, where appropriate, modify and update pre-1996 regulations which were revoked with effect from May 1998 and transpose all relevant requirements of EU waste legislation into Irish law.</P>
    <P>Each local authority is generally responsible for the supervision and enforcement of the relevant provisions of the 1996 Act in relation to the holding, recovery and disposal of waste within its functional area. In order to facilitate authorities in the discharge of this function the Act provides local authorities with a wide range of enforcement powers and specifically provides for cost recovery in relation to monitoring, inspection and enforcement generally.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that there should be effective implementation and enforcement by local authorities of relevant provisions of the 1996 Act, and of subordinate regulations. In this regard I consider that local authorities should maintain a strong and continuing focus on the implementation of environmental legislation generally.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1276" /> Resource limitation cannot be considered an obstacle. The new local government funding system which came into effect on 1 January 1999 is providing substantial extra resources for local authorities to assist them in meeting their current expenditure needs. The local government fund will ring-fence about £600 million for local authorities' general purpose needs and to finance non-national roads. This is an increase of about £125 million on the equivalent provisions before this Government took office. The extra resources which the new funding system delivers will assist local authorities in addressing their responsibilities under the Waste Management Act, 1996, and other environmental legislation.</P>
    <P>The Opposition motion focuses specifically on the enforcement of the Waste Management (Packaging) Regulations, 1997. Article 19 of these regulations provides that each local authority is responsible for the enforcement of the regulations within its functional area and requires authorities to take such steps as are necessary for this purpose. In addition to the general powers available to local authorities under the Waste Management Act, 1996, the 1997 regulations include a number of provisions intended specifically to facilitate the effective implementation and enforcement of the regulations.</P>
    <P>I have no direct function in relation to the enforcement of the 1997 regulations by local authorities. Nevertheless, as these regulations are designed to ensure that responsibility for recycling packaging waste is spread equitably among packaging producers, I am concerned that producers who are compliant members of the packaging waste recovery scheme operated by Repak Limited are not placed at a commercial disadvantage by free-riders who evade their obligations under the regulations. Accordingly, my Department has, where possible, endeavoured to facilitate the effective implementation and enforcement of the regulations by local authorities generally, and the Minister for the Environment and Local Government has on several occasions underlined to local authorities the importance we attach to the success of this important recycling initiative.</P>
    <P>On the basis of the information available to my Department, a considerable improvement for the future in the performance of local authorities is required.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I consider that many local authorities must show greater practical commitment to the enforcement of the 1997 regulations and I hope that a more high profile enforcement effort will be apparent in the very near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Litter is a pervasive form of pollution which continues to attract the critical attention of our own people and visitors alike. It is a direct consequence of widespread anti-social behaviour by <Col N="1277" /> a significant minority of the public. It is essentially a local and individual problem requiring responses from local authorities, businesses, community groups and individual citizens. The role of Government is to motivate and energise those responses.</P>
    <P>The Government has discharged part of its responsibilities by providing local authorities with an adequate legislative framework to combat litter. The Litter Pollution Act, 1997, which came into effect on 1 July 1997, provides local authorities with the range of powers necessary to tackle litter pollution more effectively and requires a new and more structured approach to litter management planning. The Act's provisions are extensive and cover a wide range of visually polluting activities.</P>
    <P>The primary management and enforcement response to the litter problem must come from local authorities. They are in the best position to encourage and co-ordinate action across all sectors at local level to eradicate litter. While in the past a lack of resources was often cited as a reason for poor enforcement action, local authorities are now able to use some of the substantial extra funding under the local government fund to take a more active approach to their functions under the Litter Pollution Act, including the recruitment of additional litter wardens. My Department and I regularly urge them to do so.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that local authorities are stepping up their anti-litter operations. Local authority statistical returns provide suitable performance indicators. Local authority enforcement figures for the second half of 1998, the latest statistics available, show continuing increases in the number of litter wardens employed &ndash; 205 &ndash; and on the spot fines imposed &ndash; over 4,300. The latter figure, in particular, represents a substantial improvement of over 36 per cent on the corresponding figure for the first six months of 1998, which, in turn, showed a similar percentage improvement on the 1997 figures. Clearly, local authorities are using their extensive management and enforcement powers under the Litter Pollution Act, 1997, more actively to combat litter. Nevertheless, I would be the first to admit that much remains to be done to eradicate litter pollution.</P>
    <P>Since taking office, I have made litter eradication a priority. I wish local authorities to take the strongest possible action to curb litter. I am especially keen that local authorities are seen to take the lead role at local level and to co-ordinate community-wide strategies to tackle litter in the context of their powers and duties under the Litter Pollution Act.</P>
    <P>I see litter management plans as a key element in the local authority response to litter. The Litter Pollution Act requires elected members of local authorities to adopt a litter management plan. The Act specifies the format for those plans but the Minister has no direct role in their formulation or review. For that reason, a new independent moni<Col N="1278" /> toring system is being asked to review them so as to promote a high and even standard across local authorities and ensure that models of good practice are properly disseminated. There is no statutory obligation on local authorities to provide the Minister with copies of their litter management plans or to notify him of their adoption. However, the information available to the Department indicates that most, if not all, local authorities have now adopted plans and the majority have made copies available to me.</P>
    <P>It is against such a background that I took the decision to introduce a national litter pollution monitoring system. I see the introduction of a national monitoring system as one of the most important components in our efforts to combat litter. Litter is a pollutant &ndash; if you can measure it, you can manage it. The development of an effective litter measurement system is necessary to monitor the litter problem and local authority progress in tackling it.</P>
    <P>On 18 May 1999, I announced the awarding of the contract for the monitoring body under the national monitoring system to the successful consultants, Tobin Environmental Services Limited. The system will be fully operational by the autumn. A technical group representative of my Department and the local authorities will liaise with the monitoring body on an ongoing basis; agree the timetable for the work programme proposed by the monitoring body; and ensure that the results of the monitoring system are made available quickly to local authorities as a basis for targeted local action.</P>
    <P>Under the national monitoring system local authorities will carry out local litter surveys to systematically identify the extent of litter pollution in their areas and prepare a report of each survey for submission to the monitoring body. The monitoring body will determine the methodology for the local litter surveys; obtain and review local authority litter survey reports to assess their effectiveness and report back to local authorities with the results of such assessments; assess each local authority's litter management plan; establish and regularly review best practices for the prevention and control of litter and circulate such knowledge to all local authorities; carry out random surveys to assess the general effectiveness of local authority anti-litter operations; and submit an annual report to the Department on its activities.</P>
    <P>The national monitoring system will ensure that we have accurate information on a continuing basis regarding the nature and extent of the litter problem. A key feature of the system will be an independent review and assessment of local authority litter management plans to ensure that they are relevant, focused and appropriate to local circumstances. The monitoring system will bring greater transparency to the work of local authorities and assist them in identifying models of good practice and innovative strategies to combat litter. The monitoring body will liaise regularly with the local authorities and my Depart<Col N="1279" /> ment about the findings and conclusions of its monitoring and assessment activities.</P>
    <P>The monitoring system will rightly highlight those local authorities taking the necessary steps to combat litter. There is an evident and compelling need to further step up enforcement action. Properly used, the national litter monitoring system will assist this process and be an effective management tool for local authorities to end the blight of litter pollution.</P>
    <P>The Government is also pursuing a number of other measures to support local authority action on litter. One of these initiatives is National Spring Clean, which ran nationwide during April 1999. The campaign was organised by An Taisce with financial support of £90,000 from my Department and commercial sponsorship from Coca-Cola Bottlers and Wrigleys Limited. During April, more than 1,700 groups and organisations representing in excess of 150,000 people across the country took part in anti-litter initiatives to clean up their local environment and heighten awareness of the litter problem. Local authorities played a major role in assisting and co-ordinating events at local level. Every county council and county borough corporation and about half the urban district councils participated. This level of participation confirms National Spring Clean in only its first year of operation as a very effective vehicle to foster public awareness of the litter problem and harness public commitment to protecting the environment. National Spring Clean has become a key element in our programme to combat litter and will lead to greater successes in the years ahead. Its ongoing nature will give a particular profile to litter pollution and how it can be successfully tackled by local communities.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, recently invited representatives of local authorities, the business community, the educational and tourism sectors, environmental NGOs, and community and tidy towns groups to participate in a National Anti-Litter Forum to review existing actions targeting litter and to develop a programme of measures to expand and enhance those responses. This new initiative will harness the support and energy of key stakeholders in tackling litter pollution. Its terms of reference will require it to identify further measures which would bring added value to the initiatives which we are already taking; define targets which the additional measures might achieve; quantify the cost of such actions; identify the sources, public and private, from which the actions might be funded; and recommend a programme for the implementation of these actions. We intend that the forum will present a report within six months of its establishment.</P>
    <P>My Department's provision for litter awareness activities for 1999 has increased to £526,000 and we will be working with local authorities, business and the educational sector to secure effective implementation of the range of ongoing measures <Col N="1280" /> and to develop new initiatives. From this, a sum of approximately £300,000 is available to me this year to make grant allocations to county councils and county borough corporations to co-fund selected local authority public education and awareness initiatives on litter. The grants will cover up to 50 per cent of project costs, the balance being met by local contributions. I expect to notify individual local authorities of their allocations within the next few weeks.</P>
    <P>I do not accept that there has been any failure on the Government's part to implement waste and litter legislation. By any objective standard, a tremendous amount of progress has been made on waste and litter management over the past two years. In terms of policy and legislative development, planning, public awareness and involvement, support for local authorities, waste licensing and implementation of producer responsibility initiatives, we are already light years removed from the situation which previously prevailed. Much remains to be done but we have put in place a solid foundation for future development and, in co-operation with local authorities and other public bodies, will pursue ongoing radical improvement in these important aspects of national environmental performance.</P>

      <P>The Labour Party supports the motion tabled by Deputy Dukes and I compliment him on bringing this matter to the floor of the House. We have a self image of Ireland as a clear and environmentally pristine country. Unfortunately the reality belies this image. Ireland is probably the dirtiest country in Europe because our streets and public spaces are blighted with litter. We have become a throwaway society and in every part of the country cigarette papers, cans, sweet wrappers and plastic bags blight what would otherwise be a beautiful landscape and environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The littering of this country is a disgrace. Litter is dirty and it is damaging our environment and our economy, particularly our tourism industry. Visitors find it difficult to understand why the country is in such an unkempt state. Unfortunately, despite having the excellent legislation introduced by Deputy Howlin available to it, the Government is doing little or nothing to stamp <Col N="1281" /> out the litter problem. I will later deal in greater detail with the Minister of State's contribution.</P>
    <P>We are also the dirtiest country in Europe because we have the worst, most outdated and environmentally unsustainable approach of any country in Europe to waste management. Like most other European countries, we are producing too much waste. Our growing economy is giving rise to additional waste from industry, agriculture, construction and general consumer activity.</P>
    <P>It is the practice in this country to dispose of waste by dumping it in a hole in the ground. Over 90 per cent of municipal waste is put into landfill sites. In doing that, Ireland is totally out of line with the rest of Europe. The European average for the disposal of similar waste by landfill is approximately 60 per cent and in more advanced countries where waste management is concerned, such as Holland and Denmark, the corresponding figures are 40 per cent and 20 per cent. In other words, this country dumps 4.5 times more waste into landfill sites than is the case in Denmark.</P>
    <P>Ireland now has a major waste problem, first, because of what it does with its waste and what that, in turn, is doing to the environment, and, second, because it is becoming increasingly clear that Ireland cannot continue to treat its waste in this manner. No real alternative has yet been developed in practical terms. Given what the dumping of waste into a hole in the ground does to our environment, people are becoming increasingly opposed to the use of landfill as the major solution to our waste problem.</P>
    <P>In many parts of the country people are opposing proposals to locate superdumps in their locality. A group from Silvermines demonstrated outside the Dáil a couple of weeks ago. Another group in Ballinasloe, County Galway, has expressed its opposition to a superdump in the locality. In my constituency, Dún Laoghaire, there is opposition to the overuse of the dump at Ballyogan in Carrickmines. No community is prepared to solely shoulder the burden for bad waste management practices.</P>
    <P>What is wrong with our waste management strategy? Unlike other problems, we cannot say in this case that there is no legislation or that policy does not exist or has not been formulated. We have the legislation and the policy, at least on paper. The Waste Management Act, 1996, which was introduced by Deputy Howlin, established a framework for waste management. It is excellent legislation but is not being implemented by the present Government. The Litter Pollution Act, 1997, potentially effective legislation to deal with the litter problem, is not being enforced.</P>
    <P>I deeply regret the standing back approach adopted by the Minister of State in relation to the enforcement&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">

      <P>There is such a thing as political leadership. Unfortunately, that is not being shown on this issue and, as a consequence, our streets, cities and towns are a disgrace with litter.</P>
      <P>There is plenty of policy. If documents could solve the waste and litter problems, they would be solved by now. Probably no other area of public policy has generated more documents, plans and studies than waste management. The Department's document, Waste Management, Changing our Ways, is excellent. It sets down a coherent policy for dealing with waste. It sets out targets which, if achieved, would be extremely encouraging. We might argue about points of detail in the Department's policy statement but the approach is right. It is based on the hierarchy of principles in waste management &ndash; prevention of waste occurring, minimising the amount of waste, reusing, recovery or recycling waste and using energy recovery strategies. Ultimately, the amount of waste which must be disposed of in a carefully managed way is minimised and reduced.</P>
      <P>Stated policy, therefore, is about the reduction of the amount of waste which must be disposed of. Unfortunately, however, practice at every level, from Government to local authority, is based on the assumption that disposal, particularly landfill disposal, will be continued in practice. The national approach to waste management is schizoid. Policy statements on paper go in one direction while practice goes in the opposite direction.</P>
      <P>The practical framework for the management of waste is based on disposal, not on minimisation, reuse, recovery and recycling. Local authority engineers, who have responsibility for managing waste in practice, are working on the assumption that we will continue to dump waste in the ground, that landfill will continue in practice to be the method of managing waste. The current drive to identify large dumps at various locations throughout the country is based on the assumption that dumping is the way we will deal with waste. It is, essentially, a way of buying time. If we can identify, locate and get the superdumps into operation, we will get another ten or 15 years of waste management by landfill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The better practices and the policy which is formally stated on paper &ndash; reuse, recycling, conversion to energy and recovery of waste &ndash; are seen in practical terms as fringe activities. That must be the case so they can be included in the documents. Every local authority and Department produces waste management documents and all <Col N="1283" /> of them must say something is being done and push the right buttons regarding reuse, recovery and recycling. In order to justify pushing those buttons, the bodies concerned must be able to point to a FÁS scheme which is engaged in recycling activity in a corner of some council yard. The document produced by the local authorities, therefore, can say &ldquo;we are committed to recycling, it is in our waste management plan and we are doing something about it&rdquo;. However, in practice it is no more than a marginal activity still being carried out on a pilot or experimental basis with no serious intention that I can discern to mainstream it.</P>
    <P>I was in Nenagh in County Tipperary last week with my colleague, Senator O'Meara, and I saw an excellent recycling scheme in operation which recycled trees, paper, plastics, bottles and so forth. It is operated by a committed group of people working under a FÁS scheme in the corner of a public yard. They expect the operation to be closed down at the end of the year but they are seeking to have it mainstreamed.</P>
    <P>I can offer another example from my own constituency. If I wish to recycle paper, I have two options: a paper bank is located at the back of a supermarket &ndash; I am not sure how much longer it will remain there because it is usually full &ndash; and another is located in the council's refuse tip, and one must pay to get admission to it. If I want to recycle bottles, I go to the bottle bank located beside my nearest supermarket. When I went there on the last bank holiday weekend, it was full and many bottles were left around it because there was nowhere to put them. Most people who want to recycle cannot get access to recycling facilities. There is a public demand for recycling but the facilities are not being made available.</P>
    <P>I recently paid a visit to County Tipperary, visited the Silvermines area and met the local group opposed to the super dump. These are not recent converts to the environment. The village in which the local community has taken great pride is in a beautiful setting. It was afflicted with the rape of the natural resources of the area through the mining activity in the 1970s and 1980s. Now it will be afflicted with the residual waste problem of a number of counties.</P>
    <P>One of the interesting points is the proposal that a private company will develop the dump. The issue which must be addressed is not whether there should be private sector involvement in waste management but at what stage in the cycle it should be encouraged to become involved. If it is encouraged to become involved at the end, at the disposal stage, it will encourage an increase in waste production. If the private sector is to be involved in waste management, it is preferable that it be encouraged to become involved at an earlier stage in the waste management cycle, either in the recovery or recycling stages.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1284" /> The legislation and policy are in place and waste management plans are being drawn up by most local authorities. However, there is a lack of action. The Waste Management Act is not being implemented by the Government. On the question of reduction and minimisation, for example, the Waste Management Act allows the Minister to make regulations banning certain materials or forcing a reduction in their use. I have in mind materials such as plastics. There are fiscal means open to the Government to encourage the reduction in the production of waste. Such measures are not happening. The Waste Management Act has not been used to insist upon the re-use of materials where possible.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State mentioned the Government's attempt to reach a voluntary code with the construction industry on the re-use and recycling of construction materials. One thing we know is that voluntary codes are not very successful where the building industry is concerned. Up to 50 per cent of the material in many landfill dumps operated by local authorities is construction waste, builders' rubble, and so on, most of which can be recovered, re-used and recycled, as happens in most other European countries. It is dreadful that so much construction material becomes landfill waste and adds to the overall problem. There should be a mandatory code for the recovery and re-use of construction waste.</P>
    <P>We must become serious about recycling. It will not work if it continues to be left as a marginal activity run through FÁS schemes dispersed throughout the country. It must become mainstream and, for that to happen, there must be serious investment in a different approach to waste management. That investment must come from the Government and from the private sector if the right incentives are provided. The Government should change to that position rather than maintain its lethargic approach.</P>
    <P>I was fascinated by the Minister of State's speech on the subject of litter. I almost had to pinch myself a number of times to be sure he was saying some of what he said. To judge from his speech, one would think that tackling litter was a complicated problem requiring a sophisticated response involving litter management plans, a national litter pollution monitoring system, local authorities conducting surveys to systematically identify the extent of litter, the preparation by them of a report for each survey which will have to be submitted to the monitoring body, the appointment of a firm of consultants to undertake the monitoring of litter and the establishment of a national anti-litter forum. This is all so much talk and reports. All this activity is probably doing more to add to the litter problem in terms of the amount of paper it will generate than it is doing to deal with the problem.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1285" /> The litter problem is simple and the solutions are simple if they are effected. The first solution is that people stop throwing litter away.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing complicated about it. To achieve that objective, people can do it voluntarily on the basis of good citizenship, and I encourage the use of the education system to bring about that desired code of behaviour. If that does not happen, and it is manifestly clear it is not happening, then the Litter Act must be enforced. That means more litter wardens, fines being imposed, people being brought to court and named and shamed, and a cultural change about throwing things away. To do that, instead of creating this extensive bureaucracy, with meetings, plans and documents to deal with litter, there must be a concerted effort for a period of time to enforce the new litter legislation. The Litter Act is relatively new and most people do not know what it contains and will not know until they are confronted with it.</P>
      <P>If the strategy had not been adopted around Christmas each year for a number of years to enforce on a concerted basis the laws governing drinking and driving, the penny would not have dropped as it has now to a significant extent. The same must be done with litter. In addition to the litter wardens, local authorities will have to redeploy resources to enforce the Litter Act vigorously, without exception and in a concerted way over a certain period. If that is done, the message will get through.</P>
      <P>In addition, people must understand the new provisions in the Litter Act with which they are not familiar. Most householders do not know they are responsible under the Litter Act for ensuring there is no litter outside their homes.</P>

      <P>At the outset, I wish to express my deepest sympathy and that of my colleagues in Fine Gael to the parents of the late Private William Kedian, Bill and Doris, his sisters, Mary and Anne-Marie, and their relatives and friends. At all times in the debate about international relations we should recognise that above all this is a family tragedy. In December 1996 Bill and Doris Kedian celebrated with their son Billy the realisation of his boyhood dream of becoming a member of the Defence Forces. Early yesterday morning they experienced every parent's worst nightmare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1286" /> I would also like to express my sympathy and that of my party to Private Kedian's colleagues in the Defence Forces, particularly the members of the 85th Irish Battalion on UN peacekeeping duties in Lebanon under the command of Lieutenant Pat Nash and those in Renmore Barracks in Galway under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Martin Coughlan. While they are all professional soldiers and used to tragedy, they too are grieving the loss of one of their own. My thoughts are also with Privates Ronnie Rushe and Darren Clarke, who were in the same attack, and their families. I wish them a full and speedy recovery.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate that the Ceann Comhairle permitted me to raise this issue. Much of the work of the Defence Forces is done effectively, quietly and in the background. A traumatic event such as this puts the spotlight, albeit in a tragic way, on this valuable work. It is deeply ironic that the Israeli-backed South Lebanese Army, which was directly responsible for yesterday's attacks, has announced the withdrawal of its forces from Jezzine, a town it has occupied for 14 years. The new Israeli Prime Minister, Mr. Barak, has also revealed plans of his intention to withdraw Israeli troops from Lebanon.</P>
    <P>This changed political situation may pose some new dangers for the UNIFIL force in Lebanon. I welcome the steps the Minister for Defence has taken to make known this country's outrage at this incident, during which, it appears, the Irish battalion was directly targeted. In recent weeks there have been an increasing number of &ldquo;firing close&rdquo; incidents where mortar or heavy machine gun fire impacted near Irish posts. I witnessed this at first hand some weeks ago in Lebanon and appreciated then the huge professionalism and calm shown by the Irish troops in very difficult circumstances. It was clear that the regularity of &ldquo;firing close&rdquo; incidents was causing extreme concern to Irish commanders in the battalion area and were increasing the risks for Defence Forces personnel.</P>
    <P>It is clear from reports of the incident that none of the fire concentrated on the SLA compound had come from positions close to Irish post 6-42. Why then was it shelled? There is potential for a more dangerous and volatile period in this area of Lebanon. Without wishing to cause undue alarm, it is critical that the Government takes every possible action at political and diplomatic level to ensure, in so far as possible, that such incidents are not repeated.</P>
    <P>A direct attack of this kind on Irish UNIFIL forces is absolutely unacceptable. It is an undermining of the valuable peacekeeping role carried out by the Irish battalion in the area. This attack was perpetrated in a very dangerous manner and it must be condemned &ndash; I accept that the Government has taken action in this regard &ndash; and dealt with in the most decisive manner.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1287" /> Our primary concern must be the safety of Irish personnel serving abroad. It is the duty of everyone in this House to ensure that, in so far as possible, no other family will undergo the same suffering as that being endured by the families of the personnel who died and were injured in this incident. I ask the Minister to accept the Fine Gael Private Members' Bill, the Protection of UN and Associated Personnel Bill, 1998, tabled by Deputy Gay Mitchell. This Bill would allow some legal protection under international law for Irish peacekeeping forces around the world.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to give details to the House of his protest in relation to this incident, the diplomatic action which has been undertaken by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the contacts he has had with the Israeli Ambassador. I thank the Minister for coming before the House to respond to this matter and the Chair for allowing me to raise it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>The raising by Deputy Fitzgerald of this issue gives me the opportunity to speak about the tragic event involving our troops in Lebanon which occurred yesterday morning. I would like at the outset to express my most sincere sympathy and that of my colleagues in Government to the family of Private Billy Kedian who so tragically lost his life in the early hours of yesterday morning while serving with the 85th Irish Battalion in Lebanon. I would also like to express my sympathy to Private Ronnie Rushe who is seriously injured and to Private Darren Clarke who, thankfully, is less seriously injured. I understand that Private Rushe's condition is critical but stable. He is at present in Rambam Hospital, Haifa, Israel. I speak for all Irish people when I talk of the sorrow which tragedies such as this bring to all concerned, families, colleagues and the country as a whole.</P>
      <P>I met the parents and sisters of Private Billy Kedian this morning and personally expressed to them my sorrow and that of the Government in their great loss. I also spoke on the telephone today to Mr. Michael Rushe, father of Private Ronnie Rushe. I have arranged that Private Rushe's father, partner and other family members will travel today to visit him in hospital.</P>
      <P>The circumstances relating to the incident in which the death and injuries occurred are as follows. In the early morning of Monday, 31 May, IRISHBATT sustained two firings close to its position 6-42 &ndash; BRASHIT. One of the firings impacted within the post. It resulted in the death of Private Billy Kedian, critical injuries to Private Ronnie Rushe and superficial injuries to Private Darren Clarke. The personnel involved were proceeding to take shelter in the bunkers when the hits occurred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An explosive ordnance team which immediately carried out crater analysis found that the <Col N="1288" /> debris collected from the site of the mortar impacts, the first of which was 15 metres outside the post and the second of which impacted within the post causing the death and injuries, was consistent with that from 81mm mortars. The markings on the percussion caps indicate that they were Israeli. There were indications that the mortar rounds were fired from a position with a magnetic bearing of 188 degrees from the impact site, namely, the general direction of the Israeli Defence Forces-De Facto Force Compound W144. However. I understand that, to date, the Israeli authorities have not admitted responsibility for the incident.</P>
    <P>The death of Private Kedian and the injuries to Privates Rushe and Clarke were the subject of immediate protest by UNIFIL headquarters, Naquora, to the Israeli Defence Forces who undertook to conduct an investigation at the highest level. I am informed that at a meeting to be held tomorrow a formal letter of protest will be lodged by UNIFIL headquarters with the Israeli Defence Forces. A preliminary report was also forwarded immediately by UNIFIL headquarters to United Nations headquarters, New York. I understand that UN headquarters intends to shortly convey strong protest to the Israeli Ambassador to the United Nations and to issue a press statement in the matter.</P>
    <P>At my request, the Minister for Foreign Affairs summoned the Israeli Ambassador to Ireland to Leinster House today to protest the matter in the strongest possible manner to the Israeli authorities. He expressed great concern at the loss of life and serious injury to Irish peacekeeping personnel and, on behalf of the Government, protested yesterday's incident in the strongest possible terms. He also expressed the Government's grave concern at the pattern of recent incidents involving firings close to and at IRISHBATT positions. He insisted that there must be an immediate cessation of such incidents and demanded that the Israeli Government take firm action to prevent such indiscriminate targeting of the UNIFIL contingent. In response, the Ambassador regretted the loss of life and injury and undertook to report to his authorities.</P>
    <P>The safety of Irish personnel serving overseas is always of paramount concern to me, as Minister for Defence, and to the Government. While no absolute guarantees can be given with regard to the safety of troops serving in missions such as UNIFIL it is my policy to ensure that the Defence Forces personnel are adequately trained, resourced and equipped to carry out their mission.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputy Fitzgerald for her expression of sympathy in relation to this tragic incident which has resulted in the death of Private Billy Kedian and the serious injuries suffered by Private Ronnie Rushe, as well as the injuries sustained by Private Darren Clarke. The other matters to <Col N="1289" /> which she referred are under consideration. I will be reporting to the House as progress is made on this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise the need for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to approve the connection of Balla water scheme, to be connected to the Lough Mask regional water scheme. Balla is a small village seven miles from Castlebar. The general area comprises approximately 400 houses which require connection to the regional water scheme. A preliminary report prepared by P. J. Tobin and Co., Consulting Engineers, put forward proposals for an extension of the Lough Mask scheme to serve both Balla and Kiltimagh. The new scheme would run from Ballyheane, through Belcarra, to Balla and on to Kiltimagh. The report was submitted to the Department of the Environment for approval in 1990 together with an estimated cost of approximately £5 million. The proposed scheme provided for the construction of a new 400 millimetre diameter trunk main from Ballyheane to Balla and Kiltimagh and the construction of a new 4,500 cubic metre storage reservoir at Craggagh. Provision was also made for a distribution main for Balla and connections to a number of group water schemes in the region to be served.</P>
      <P>Since 1990 the water supply in Balla in particular has deteriorated. The Balla well source has been abandoned because of contamination and Balla is now supplied from the Prison group water scheme. The source of this private group water scheme is Carrowmore Lake and no treatment is provided other than chlorination. Water quality is variable and there have been numerous complaints from consumers about taste and odour. Similar problems arise in the nearby Manulla group scheme which is also sourced from Carrowmore Lake. The nearby Belcarra group scheme is supplied from Welshpool Lake and water quality fails to meet the requirements of the drinking water regulations.</P>
      <P>Because of the seriousness of the water quality problem generally and particularly in the case of Balla's public supply, it was intended to proceed with the 1990 scheme in two phases with priority being given to the Balla connection. The proposed route of the pipeline was through Belcarra, Manulla and Prison and it could also supply a number of other private group water schemes to the south and east of Balla. The proposed extension to Balla would cost approximately £3 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of the schemes which could be connected to the Balla scheme are Garnahan, a public supply with poor water quality and supply capacity, Ardboley, a public supply, Ballymackeogh, which has poor water quality and supply capacity which was upgraded, Belcarra, Derryvohy, Keeloges, <Col N="1290" /> Manulla, Monard, Pollavaddy, Prison and Rathduff. These are all private water schemes with poor water quality. The Minister is presiding over a situation where more than 400 houses are, by the Department's regulations, seriously in need of attention.</P>
    <P>In reply to a recent parliamentary question about the Ardboley group water scheme, the Department of the Environment and Local Government indicated it had requested Mayo County Council by circular letter L9/98 to restructure its priorities and to contact the Department so it could consider it when framing the National Development Plan, 2000-06. The council responded to the Department and gave the Balla scheme a high priority. Two councillors responsible for that area, Councillors Kenny and Burke, also raised this matter with Mayo County Council.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed the Minister did not sanction this scheme when he visited Castlebar last Friday. Many promises have been made by enthusiastic candidates. I do not want the Minister to be in breach of the drinking water regulations for the sake of £3 million. I ask him to formally sanction this scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter. On behalf of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, I want to comment briefly on the extent of the Government's commitment to the water services area generally, a commitment that has been firmly underlined by the unprecedented level of investment set out in the 1999 water and sewerage services investment programme which was published last January.</P>
      <P>The 1999 programme is by far the largest. At £275 million, investment in water and sewerage services this year will be 50 per cent greater than last year and no less than double the size of the 1996 spend. Funding of this order will impact positively and substantially on our environmental infrastructure and the ability of that infrastructure to meet current and projected development needs from residential, industrial and other forms of economic activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>County Mayo is a significant beneficiary under the 1999 programme which includes schemes in Mayo worth almost £84 million. Listed to start construction are the Ballina regional water supply scheme, Crossmolina sewerage scheme and an advance section of the Westport sewerage scheme. The Achill, phase IV, water scheme, the Claremorris sewerage scheme, the Castlebar environs and Newport Road sewerage scheme and the Ballyhaunis sewerage scheme are included to continue construction. Provision has also been made for a significant number of schemes to advance through planning. These <Col N="1291" /> include the Lough Mask regional water supply, the Knock to Ballyhaunis scheme, Ballyhaunis town water, Erris regional water supply, extension to Mullet Peninsula, the Knock, Killala and Achill Sound sewerage schemes, the Ballina main drainage scheme and the main elements of the Castlebar environs and Westport sewerage schemes.</P>
    <P>Funding has also been approved under the serviced land initiative for schemes worth over £3.2 million at Ballina, Ballinrobe, Newport and Mulranny. This is designed to bring additional serviced residential sites on stream as rapidly as possible to ease pressures on the housing market. In addition, three sewerage schemes &ndash; Bonniconlon, Turlough, and Cong &ndash; have been recently approved under the rural towns and villages initiative for which overall funding of £80 million is being provided over the next four years. It is clear that Mayo is getting a fair share of the available funding and that the schemes which have been approved will greatly contribute to removing development constraints and to creating the infrastructure needed to support and expand tourism and other important economic activities in the county.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1292" /> As regards the Balla water supply, while the source can suffer from quality variations, it is understood that the source provides generally drinkable water. A preliminary report for the Lough Mask regional water supply scheme, extension to Balla and Kiltimagh, was submitted to the Department of the Environment in 1990 but has not been approved. A revised proposal relating to the phasing of the scheme, with the initial phase serving Balla and a number of group schemes, was submitted to the Department on 27 April last. However, as the scheme is not included in this year's water and sewerage services investment programme, it comes within the terms of the Department's Circular letter L9/98 of 22 October 1998. This circular asked each local authority to undertake a fresh assessment of the needs for capital works in its area and to prepare a prioritised list of projects based on the assessment. The priority lists will be taken into consideration by the Department of the Environment and Local Government in framing future water and sewerage services investment programmes under the next National Development Plan, 2000-06.</P>

      <P>Between 1994 and the end of this year over £960 million will have been spent on water and sewerage services which, even allowing for adjustments for inflation, is well in excess of the £605 million envisaged in the National Development Plan 1994-99.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding the extent of the investment under the current national development plan, there is still a major infrastructural deficit to be made up to provide the level of services required to support economic development and protect our environment. Addressing this infrastructural deficit is a key priority for the next National Development Plan 2000-06. My Department invited all local authorities in October 1998 to prepare and submit a prioritised assessment of needs by the end of June this year for water and sewerage services capital works. The needs assessments will have a medium term horizon to the end of 2006 and a longer term horizon covering the 20 year period commencing in 1999. These assessments, together with the findings of the national water study which is currently under way, the strategic rural water plans being prepared to map out priorities for the rural water programme and strategic planning guidelines will be used to establish investment priorities at a county, regional and national level over the period of the next national development plan and beyond.</P>
      <P>Finally, I should point out that the new rural towns and villages initiative announced in the last budget represents a special measure by the Government to remedy water and sewerage serviced deficiencies in places which were not been catered for under existing priorities. Following an initial assessment of the schemes eligible under this initiative, I secured the agreement of the Minister for Finance to increase the capital allocation for this purpose from £45 million to £80 million.</P>

      <P>Monitoring of bathing water quality is undertaken in accordance with national regulations implementing the European Council Directive on quality of bathing waters (76/160/EEC). The annual report on the quality of bathing water in Ireland is prepared by the EPA using the results of monitoring undertaken by local authorities. An EU-wide report is published annually by the European Commission.</P>
      <P>The 1998 EU Bathing Water report commented that Irish bathing waters had kept their excellent rating. The 1998 EPA bathing water report, to be published shortly, has found that in 1998 most bathing areas complied with the minimum EU mandatory standards and that there was an improvement on the 1997 results.</P>
      <P>In 1998 the compliance of bathing areas with EU guide values decreased slightly on the 1997 result. However the EPA report concludes that this is accounted for by higher than normal rainfall, and less sunshine, in Ireland during the 1998 bathing season. Higher rainfall increases run-off from land which affects water quality. Less sunshine can lead to higher levels of bacteria due to reduced breakdown of bacteria by ultra-violet rays.</P>
      <P>Where bathing waters do not comply with the specified standards, local authorities are required to undertake the necessary measures to ensure compliance. My Department is financing, with Cohesion Fund support, major investment by local authorities nationwide to upgrade sewerage networks and waste-water treatment facilities. The main impact of this investment will be on estuarine and coastal areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The total level of housing need throughout the country has been forecast in a number of Government commissioned reports. The Economic and Social Research Institute in its national investment priorities report forecast total housing demand at an average of 38,000 units per annum <Col N="1295" /> between 1996 and 2006 and 40,000 units per annum between 2006 and 2011. The first Bacon report forecast annual private housing output increasing from 37,000 in 1998 to 46,000 units by 2003 to meet increased housing demand which implies a need for total housing output of over 50,000 units by 2003. In both cases the likely scenario of substantial net inward migration was considered a significant factor in increasing housing demand.</P>
      <P>These projected housing needs have been met and exceeded in 1998 with total housing output of 42,350 units. This Government has put in place a series of measures to ensure a continued increase in supply to meet housing need. Output so far for 1999 is well ahead of projections with a 24 per cent increase in output for the first quarter over the same period last year. This is a firm indication that the Government measures to increase housing supply have been effective in a relatively short time span. This significant increase in housing output strongly indicates another record-breaking year in 1999. I am particularly pleased that housing output in Dublin, which has been sluggish in recent years, was up 28 per cent on the first quarter of 1998.</P>

      <P>The recent report of the Environmental Protection Agency on water quality in Ireland indicates that there was no widespread pollution of particular aquifers in the period 1995-97. Pollution by ammonia and nitrates, for example, was a local, rather than an aquifer-wide, problem. Bacteriological contamination was detected by the presence of faecal coliforms in 34 per cent of samples. The report emphasised the importance of disinfection of drinking water drawn from groundwater sources and the need for better borehole construction techniques and source protection measures in the vicinity of boreholes.</P>
      <P>I refer to the reply to Priority Questions Nos. 30 and 32 on 27 April 1999 which outlined a wide range of measures being taken under the rural water programme to address quality deficiencies in group water schemes, including schemes sourced from groundwaters. A total of £28 million has been allocated to the programme in 1999, an increase of £7 million over 1999. In recent days my colleague the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, announced an additional £6 million allocation to county councils in response to excellent progress achieved so far on implementation of this year's programme. In addition, the Minister launched a step-by-step guide to local authorities on the development of strategic rural water plans for their counties. The objective will be to rationalise and improve the quality of water supply to rural communities. My Department and the local authorities are committed to working in close co-operation with the private group scheme sector to ensure that the deficiencies identified in recent EPA reports are tackled in a properly planned and efficient manner.</P>
      <P>Additional protection is provided for groundwaters by regulations which I made in February this year to control discharges to aquifers by sanitary authorities. Guidelines were also issued to local authorities in May to develop groundwater protection schemes to assist decision-making in relation to land-use planning and related matters. These schemes provide a systematic framework for the incorporation of groundwater protection considerations into decision making by planning and regulatory authorities.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 30 and 199 together.</P>
      <P>The Government strategy for road safety 1998 &ndash; 2002 has set out specific targets for improving road safety in Ireland, notably the objective of reducing deaths and serious injuries by at least 20 per cent by 2002 relative to 1997. This target will be achieved by a number of key new initiatives and by enhancing and intensifying existing road safety measures.</P>
      <P>As indicated in the strategy its planning horizon is the five year period to 2002. This term was adopted so as to allow trends to be identified and monitored with reasonable accuracy, and because a number of key measures would take some time to mobilise fully. The high level group on road safety was mandated by Government to monitor the progress of the strategy and to make recommendations to the Government for updating and adjustment. This task is being carried out independently by the group who will also publish their assessments: the first of these is expected in the coming weeks.</P>
      <P>In the meantime good progress is being made with implementing the strategy in accordance with its timetable for key actions: the gardaí have deployed additional mobile speed detection units; in co-operation with the Department of the Environment in Northern Ireland and Shell, the National Safety Council has developed a new media campaign, titled Crush and targeting all road users;the National Roads Authority are on target in implementing their low cost remedial measures and traffic calming programmes on national roads; regulations were made earlier this year to widen the scope of the on-the-spot fines system to include stop and yield sign infringements, traffic light infringements, defective tyres and non-wearing of seat belts; preparations by the Garda and the medical bureau of road safety for the operation of evidential breath testing for drink driving are at an advanced stage; mandatory roadworthiness testing for cars will commence in January 2000; and significant extra resources have been assigned to my DepartmentWP extended char 4,28s driver testing service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Certain measures will require legislative change, in particular the proposal for a penalty <Col N="1298" /> points system. This is now being developed by my Department with a view to enactment in 1999.</P>

Part II will be held on 3 June 1999. The consultation debate is being managed by an independent and distinguished chairing panel who will report to me on the outcome. On receipt of the panel's report, and having regard to the written responses to the consultation paper, I will complete the review of national environmental policy in this area as quickly as possible and issue a statement on the outcome.</P>
      <P>Issues in relation to prohibiting or delaying the deliberate release of GMOs to the environment have been raised in the context of the consultation and will be discussed in Part II of the debate later this week. In the circumstances, any comment by me on the British Medical Association report could be interpreted as prejudging the debate or, potentially influencing the report of the independent chairing panel, and would therefore be inappropriate at this stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 39 and 185 together.</P>
      <P>The DTI strategy, which was published in 1995 with a planning horizon to 2011, provides the framework for a wide range of initiatives to respond to Dublin's transportation needs. These include major infrastructure projects such as LUAS, the Dublin Port Tunnel and completion of the Dublin C-Ring; other improvements in public transport such as quality bus corridors; and traffic and parking management measures. Progress with the construction and planning of these infrastructural projects is indicated in current work being undertaken on the DART extensions and the Southern Cross motorway, and ministerial approvals to the Tallaght/Abbey Street link of the LUAS and to the south-eastern and northern motorways.</P>
      <P>The DTO Short-Term Action Plan, published last September, is designed to advance and accelerate a set of measures, consistent with the DTI strategy, which can be completed in the period to end 2000. Detailed objectives include: completion of 12 QBCs and 180 kms of cycle tracks by end 2000; provision by end 1999 of an additional 150 buses by Dublin Bus; additional rolling stock for DART; lengthening of outer suburban and key DART station platforms, and upgrading by end 2000 of the Maynooth-Clonsilla rail line. It is estimated that expenditure totalling £160 million, detailed in a tabular statement, will be undertaken within the framework of the plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1303" /> Good progress is being made with implementation of the Short-Term Action Plan. For example, orders have been placed for the new buses with delivery of the first batch expected to be completed by end June; work is proceeding on the planning, design and implementation of the QBC network; the programme of platform lengthening has commenced; and contracts have been entered into for the additional DART rolling stock.</P>
    <P>Since the publication of the Short-Term Action Plan, the Minister for Finance has also announced: the removal of Benefit in Kind taxation from public transport passes provided by employers for their employees; tax incentives to promote park and ride facilities, and a review of the potential for benefit in kind taxation of workplace parking.</P>
    <P>For the longer-term, the DTO are currently updating the original DTI strategy; this will lead to the publication by end 1999 of an updated strategy for the period 2000-16. An investment programme will be finalised by DTO shortly to assist the preparation of the new national development plan.</P>

      <P>There is a general consensus that Government action in response to the consultants' reports on the housing market in 1998 and 1999 has had, and will continue to have very positive effects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been moderation generally in house prices in recent months, which is particularly positive in view of continuing strong economic <Col N="1304" /> growth and very low interest rates. It is not just my Department that has come to this conclusion. The First Active house price figures show increases of just 2 per cent nationally and 1.7 per cent in Dublin in the first quarter of 1999. Second hand house prices in Dublin, which have tended to be a leading indicator of market trends, have eased significantly over the past six months, with an estimated increase of only around 2 per cent during that period.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the fact that, following four successive years of record output, there was a 24 per cent increase in new house completions nationally in the first quarter of 1999 compared with the same period in 1998 and, most significantly, a 28 per cent increase in completions in Dublin where housing output had been relatively sluggish.</P>
    <P>Progress towards house price stabilisation will be increasingly reinforced by the effects of measures taken to accelerate housing supply, including the serviced land initiative, the use of temporary treatment facilities for land servicing, promotion of increased housing density and the new local authority affordable housing scheme.</P>
    <P>Queues are, of course, sometimes used as a marketing strategy and I understand that the houses in Dundalk were competitively priced from under £80,000.</P>

      <P>Primary responsibility for the provision of drinking water supplies and for upholding the prescribed quality standards rests with sanitary authorities, under the general supervision of the Environmental Protection Agency. The required standards for drinking water are prescribed in the European Communities (Quality of Water Intended for Human Consumption) Regulations, 1988. Exceeding the quality standards does not automatically mean there is a risk to public health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Aluminium sulphate is widely used in Ireland and internationally in the treatment of drinking water, primarily to remove colour and particulate matter. In terms of the health implications of aluminium, the most recent assessment by the World Health Organisation (WHO) indicates that the present epidemiological evidence does not support a causal association between Alzheimer's disease and aluminium in drinking water. As a consequence, the guideline value recommended by WHO in respect of aluminium in drinking water is based on aesthetic, rather than health, considerations. This assessment has been reflected in the recently adopted revised Directive on Drinking Water (98/83/EC) where alu<Col N="1306" /> minium has been included as an indicator, rather than a health-based, parameter.</P>
    <P>However, in view of my concern to ensure that all water treatment plants are operated to the highest standard, I have asked sanitary authorities to examine all aspects of the operation of treatment plants, in the light of the recommendations set out in the EPA report, with a view to optimising treatment processes generally. In this connection, I have again emphasised the importance of ensuring that relevant personnel involved in the operation of water treatment plants participate in the caretaker development course which has been developed by the national training committee.</P>

      <P>I have increased the limits of assistance available under the capital assistance scheme twice within a one year period. These increases represented the most significant increase &ndash; up to 67 per cent &ndash; made in the level of funding since the inception of the scheme. While output has fallen back in recent years because of increased building and land costs, these improvements will boost output this year.</P>
      <P>I have indicated that I intend to put in place measures to ensure that the voluntary housing sector is in a position to deliver annual output of 4,000 to 5,000 additional units of accommodation over the coming years. I have written to the Irish Council for Social Housing and a number of the organisations active in the provision of housing specifically seeking proposals in respect of increasing the output from the voluntary and non-profit housing sector. I believe that the voluntary housing bodies themselves are best placed to develop proposals on how significantly increased output from the sector can be achieved. The Irish Council for Social Housing has recently made a very comprehensive submission to me on how the voluntary housing movement could increase output to 4,000 dwellings a year. While the submission is, at present, being examined in my Department I can say that many of the recommendations would command my support.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The interest rate of 12.5 per cent which applies to some local authority fixed rate house purchase loans issued before 31 October 1985 is related to the cost of long-term funds prevailing at the time the loans were advanced and is fixed for the life of the loan.  While these fixed interest rate loans of up to 12.5 per cent look expensive today, they were in fact very favourable at the time they were advanced in the late 1970s and early 1980s when commercial lending rates ranged anything up to 16.25 per cent. In addition, the loans involved in any case typically ranged from £9,000 to, at most, £16,000 and the average price of houses purchased with the aid of these loans was generally between £16,000 to £25,000. The cost of refinancing these mortgages today would be substantial and would have to be borne by either the Exchequer, the Housing Finance Agency or the local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, a special concession has been introduced whereby any person with fixed rate local authority repayments is free to redeem without penalty and refinance, if necessary, in the private sector at current interest rates. The removal of penalties for early redemption in the case of local <Col N="1308" /> authority fixed rate loans is a unique and valuable concession to local authority borrowers and I understand that over £50 million in local authority housing loans were redeemed last year. Persons with fixed rate loans from banks or building societies are, on the other hand, required to pay penalties of up to six months interest or more if they want to redeem their loans. I do not consider that the introduction of any further subsidy to reduce the interest rates on pre-1986 loans would be warranted having regard to other pressing priorities in the housing area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Work is well under way on the preparation of a major local government bill to modernise and consolidate local Government law and to implement a range of reform measures. This Bill is an important element of the overall programme for the renewal of local government currently being implemented. As part of the formal consultation process I have had meetings with the Joint Committee on the Environment and Local Government and with the local government representative associations; my Department has also met with local authority managers. There has been discussion on many issues arising in the context of the Bill. In the context of an assessment of the amount of work now remaining to be done, I have, following my meeting with the joint committee, been considering the most useful format in which material relating to the Bill might best be made available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current position is that four out of five tranches have been prepared and reviewed by the Attorney General's office with which my Department is in contact, as ongoing work by both parties on these drafts proceeds. The preparation of the final tranche will of course have implications <Col N="1309" /> for the earlier tranches with inevitable consequential and other changes; some indeed arising from the consultation process. The Planning Bill too, on which work is proceeding separately, also has knock-on implications for the Local Government Bill. The preparation of any such major legislation is an ongoing process which can be subject to fairly significant change along the way.</P>
    <P>To allow for a more productive input by all concerned and to avoid loss of time it would be best if the version circulated were a more finished and coherent product. When work is further advanced therefore, I will consider making available the proposals for the Bill, or if at that stage this might lead to unnecessary delays, my aim would be to publish the Bill but with ample time for its consideration by the committee. This matter will be kept under review in the light of progress.</P>
    <P>Finally I should say that quite independently of the Bill, I am pressing ahead with a whole series of initiatives designed to transform local government. Many of these measures do not require legislation; practical steps or other measures with which the Bill will deal are already under way.</P>

      <P>The compliance of so called &ldquo;embedded systems&rdquo; which are used in water supply, sewage treatment and traffic control systems has been identified as critical to the continued supply of these services. In order to assist local authorities in this area, a firm of consultants, specialising in the compliance of embedded systems has been engaged. These consultants are now visiting local authorities, providing technical assistance and monitoring progress with their remedial programmes. Having recently completed an assessment of all local authorities the consultants are firmly of the view that there is no increased threat to these critical services as a result of Year 2000 compliance issues.</P>
      <P>Taking this into account and the other vigorous efforts being made by local authorities throughout the country, I am satisfied that all necessary steps are being taken to ensure that remedial work will be completed in the time remaining.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated in my replies to Question No. 685 of 27 January and Question No. 19 of 3 March 1999, I have taken a number of measures which I believe will help to facilitate a high turnout at this year's local and European elections. With a view to maximising turnout, I announced in 1998 that the local elections would be held in conjunction with the European elections on Friday, 11 June 1999. By giving advance notice of the polling day, greater awareness of the elections has been generated. The electorate will also vote on the 11 June in a referendum to decide whether or not to give constitutional recognition to local government and on the 4 May last, I established a referendum commission whose principal functions are to explain the subject matter of the referendum and to promote and facilitate debate and discussion on the proposal.</P>
      <P>A publicity campaign on voter registration has also been undertaken by my Department and local authorities. It began in November 1998 by advising persons to check the draft 1999-2000 register of electors and highlighting the fact the register will be used for this year's elections. Newspaper articles were also placed to promote the supplement to the register, the supplement to the postal and special voters list and arrangements for voters with physical disabilities. In addition, my Department, in co-operation with the Union of Students in Ireland, published an information brochure on the registration process in January of this year targeted specifically at students. Copies of the leaflet have been distributed by USI to every college and institute of technology in the State.</P>
      <P>I have attended a number of conferences this year, organised by the European Parliament office, where I have stressed the importance of increased voter turnout. In January, I attended a media seminar to publicise the European elections at which I emphasised the critical role the television, radio and print media would play in informing the public. More recently in April, I spoke at a conference on European democracy about the importance of the Parliament getting their message across to the general public about the relevance of the Parliament and the importance of the elections.</P>
      <P>I am hopeful that a vigorous campaign by the political parties and the candidates, a well informed media debate on the issues together with the work of the referendum commission and the measures that I have taken will all go some way towards facilitating a good turnout in both elections and the referendum on the 11 June.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 56 and 64 together.</P>
      <P>Every person seeking a job can access the employment service either through FÁS, which has a countrywide presence, or the local employment service, which operates in 25 areas of designated disadvantage.</P>
      <P>With regard to training, priority access is accorded to persons who are long-term unemployed or socially excluded. Systematic referrals to training are also taking place on foot of the implementation of the Employment Action Plan. Beyond these priority categories, persons in receipt of widows or widowers pension can access training courses on the same basis as anyone else.</P>
      <P>FÁS also operate return to work courses for persons who have spent time out of the labour force working in the home.</P>
      <P>Employment programmes such as community employment are targeted at the most marginalised of the unemployed and disadvantaged: those whose principal or only source of income is an unemployment compensation payment or certain other means tested social welfare payments. This targeting helps maximise the availability of places by part financing the programme from savings in social welfare payments. Widowed persons in receipt of a means tested payment are eligible to participate in community employment.</P>
      <P>In principle, a person in receipt of a non means tested survivors contributory pension can instead opt for payment of a social assistance payment such as one-parent family payment or unemployment assistance and thus establish eligibility to participate in community employment or other employment programme. However, as a general rule the long-term balance of advantage lies in retaining pension entitlement.</P>

      <P>The job initiative is a temporary employment programme for older very long-term unemployed, persons on the live register for five years or more and aged 35 or over. It is full-time and of three years duration. Job Initiative has 2,875 places available, in total, in 1999. These places are concentrated in partnership areas. The programme overall is supervised by FÁS but is managed locally by managing agents who have a community focus. The fundamental objective of the programme is to facilitate participants reintegration into the open labour market.</P>
      <P>The first 1,000 job initiative participants are in the third and final year of the programme. Understandably, there is a considerable amount of lobbying on their part to stay on the programme, but from a policy point of view it is an employment programme of limited duration and not intended to provide permanent public sector posts for the individuals in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1315" /> An independent review of the pilot programme has been commissioned and any policy decisions regarding the future of the programme will be deferred until this report is to hand, which should be later this month. On the question of a further extension for the current participants, I have to stress that the fundamental objective of the programme is to facilitate their reintegration into the open labour market. As a general principle it also would not be fair to other very long-term unemployed persons who might avail of this programme. On the positive side, I understand that a number of participants have already left the programme prior to completing three years in order to take up jobs. This is an encouraging sign of the programme's efficacy and of the motivation of participants.</P>
    <P>On the basis of experience gained a significant number of participants should be able to get jobs in the open labour market on completion of the programme and FÁS and the local employment service network will provide progression advice and support to all participants in the lead up to completion. The managing agents for the programme also have obligations in this regard. I accept that there may be some participants who face particular problems in taking this final step and can assure the Deputy that we will seek to deal with such issues in a sympathetic way. To this end my Department is discussing the issues arising with the social partners and other interested stakeholders.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 60 and 66 together.</P>
      <P>While there is no specific information on the extent of worksharing in Ireland, worksharing offers a number of advantages for society and the economy through job creation, greater workplace flexibility and more equitable distribution of work. Worksharing is a well established facet of the public sector. Worksharing in the private sector is, of course, first and foremost a matter to be advanced by the parties concerned. I have no immediate plans to introduce legislation on this issue.</P>
      <P>On the wider issue of atypical work, the EU Council has adopted a directive concerning a framework agreement on part-time work which must be implemented in all member states by January, 2000. The purpose of the directive is to prevent part-time workers from being treated less favourably than full-time workers, to provide for the removal of discrimination against part-time workers and to improve the quality of part-time work.</P>

      <P>At my request, the Health and Safety Authority, which is the statutory body responsible for the promotion of occupational health and safety and the enforcement of national legislation in this area, produced an awareness-raising booklet on the subject of bullying at work. The booklet is available from the health and safety authority at 10 Hogan Place, Dublin 2. I have also raised this matter on a number of occasions with the Chairman and the Director-General of the health and safety authority. The board of the authority, as the Deputy is no doubt aware, is a tripartite board with equal representation from both the trade union movement and employer bodies and <Col N="1317" /> will also have discussed the question of bullying in the workplace.</P>
      <P>The Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, sets out the duties of employers with regard to protecting the safety, health and welfare of their employees at work. In this context it is incumbent upon employers to ensure that any work practices, such as bullying, which are detrimental to the safety, health and welfare of employees are not tolerated within the workplace. Employers should ensure that anti-bullying policies, including procedures for dealing with bullying, are put in place. Such policies should be specified in the safety statement which all employers are legally required to prepare under the 1989 Act.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Employment Equality Act, 1998, for which my colleague, Deputy Mary Wallace, Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, is responsible, prohibits discrimination in employment on nine grounds. These grounds are gender, marital status, family status, age, sexual orientation, disability, race and religion or membership of the travelling community.</P>
      <P>For my part, I assure the Deputy that I am continuing to assess and review what further initiatives can be taken to deal with the serious and important issue of bullying in the workplace.</P>

This was an increase of 72,000 on the corresponding quarter in 1997 and continues the strong upward trend in employment provided by the economy in the five years to 1998.

      <P>I have been advised by the Southern Regional Fisheries Board that they have authorised eel fishermen to use baited eel pots since 1980 but that the final procedure required to recognise these as scheduled engines, by way of Public Notice under Section 69 (3) of the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1959, has not yet been completed. The view of the board is therefore that these fishermen cannot vote in board elections.</P>
      <P>The board have also informed me that they are working on an eel policy statement, in consultation with the eel fishermen in the Waterford estuary. I understand that this policy will include proposals for the setting of a licence fee for baited eel pots, a maximum number of licences to be allocated each year and the entitlement to vote in elections for the eel representative on the Southern Regional Fisheries Board.</P>

      <P>I will not tolerate illegal interference with the legitimate activities of Irish fishermen. Irish fishing boats must be able to go about their business without having their safety put at risk by acts of harassment or intimidation, and I will take all steps necessary to ensure that they are able to do so.</P>
      <P>At my request, a rapid reporting and response system for incidents between fishing boats was instituted by my Department, in co-operation with the Department of Defence, last year. This system, which is based on the notification of incidents to the Marine Emergency Service (IMES) of my Department, facilitates a rapid and appropriate response by mobilising available air or sea resources to the scene very quickly. My Department is also engaged in ongoing liaison with the Department of Defence, the Naval Service and the Air Corps with a view to ensuring the most effective surveillance and control of the activities of all fishing vessels in these waters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1321" /> Work is in progress also to prevent incidents between fishing vessels. At my request, and following meetings with the French Fisheries Ministry, representatives of the Irish and French fishing industries have been meeting to develop codes of practice which would facilitate peaceful co-existence in fishing grounds off our coast. I will be urging all concerned to bring this work to finality as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>The position in relation to incidents between fishing vessels which occur outside Irish territorial waters is being examined also. The Attorney General's office has been asked to advise definitely, as soon as possible, as to the powers of the Irish authorities in respect of such incidents, and on the possibilities within the framework of international law for adopting new powers for dealing with occurrences of this nature.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 75, 76, 77 and 78 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In January of this year the French authorities instituted a health alert arising from two alleged outbreaks of illness in September 1998 in which the symptoms were reported as being consistent with those caused by diarrhetic shellfish poisoning (DSP). The French authorities reported that the alleged incidents were associated with the. consumption of mussels exported from Ireland, <Col N="1322" /> and indicated also that a number of positive results had been obtained from testing of Irish product for DSP.</P>
    <P>My Department, in association with other relevant State agencies, followed up immediately on the alleged incidents with the French authorities and the European Commission, with a view to establishing conclusively the association, if any, of Irish product with the alleged outbreaks of food poisoning. Despite numerous requests, in EU fora and in direct communications with the French authorities, the French authorities have not to date furnished any epidemiological reports on the events of September 1998. It is vitally important for the Irish authorities to have this information, and the matter will continue to be pursued vigorously with the French authorities.</P>
    <P>Following the alleged incidents in France, and as a precautionary measure in accordance with normal practice, frozen Irish mussels produced between June and September, 1998 were temporarily withdrawn from the market. I understand that the amount of product held, primarily in Ireland and France, was some 600 tonnes. Irish mussel exports in live or processed form were not affected.</P>
    <P>As a result of an inter-calibration exercise between Irish and French laboratories conducted by the EU reference laboratory in Vigo, Spain, it was agreed that batches of the withheld product would be released where the Irish reference lab or an approved French laboratory obtained five negative results in testing for DSP. This testing process is under way, and I understand that more than 100 tonnes have been released to date. The Irish authorities will press for sampling of the remaining stocks to be completed as quickly as possible, so that decisions on its release can be made without delay.</P>
    <P>My Department has given considerable time and attention to dealing with this matter and there has been no delay in responding to the situation.</P>
    <P>It is not accepted that any liability attaches to the State arising out of, or in connection with, this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 81 and 82 together.</P>
      <P>Ireland is a candidate for election to non-permanent membership of the United Nations Security Council for the two-year term 2001-2002 in elections which will take place at the 55th Session of the UN General Assembly in the latter part of 2000. As a member of the Western European and Other Group of States (WEOG), Ireland is seeking election to one of the two seats on the Council which are designated for that group. Ireland declared its candidacy in April 1996. To date, three other WEOG states have declared their candidacy for the same election: Norway, Turkey and Italy.</P>
      <P>Ireland's candidacy is based on this country's longstanding commitment to the work of the United Nations in all fields, including peacekeeping where Ireland currently ranks sixth among the states which provide personnel to UN peacekeeping operations), disarmament, where Ireland continues to play a prominent role at the UN, four decades after this country was the first to propose a Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, development, where, in contrast to a disturbing international trend, our development co-operation expenditure continues to be one of the fastest growing in the world and human rights, where this country currently holds the chair of the UN Commission on Human Rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland's candidacy also draws support from the principle that small and medium sized mem<Col N="1324" /> ber states of the United Nations should have the opportunity, at reasonable intervals, to serve as members of the security council. This underlines the right and responsibility of member states, small as well as large, to contribute to the work of the organisation and the realisation of its purposes. It also highlights the global character of the United Nations and the need for the security council to be representative in its composition of the views and concerns of the wider membership.</P>
    <P>If given the privilege to do so, Ireland would bring to membership of the security council the perspective of a small country with a national historical experience that we share to a significant extent with small and medium sized states in all regions of the world. We would bring our experience of peace-building on our own island, our track record of commitment to the work of the United Nations and a deeply held conviction that there can be no real security without economic and social development. Above all, we would bring our promise to work tirelessly to ensure that the security council remains the ultimate embodiment of international co-operation in the cause of peace and advancing the rights and dignity of all peoples.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Foreign Affairs, I have sought support for Ireland's candidacy on all appropriate occasions. The Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and other members of the Government have also promoted the candidacy in their contacts with other administrations, where this has been appropriate. These efforts will continue apace.</P>
    <P>Successful candidates will need to receive the support of two-thirds of the votes cast. The election will be by secret ballot. Since elections to membership of the security council are highly competitive in their nature, I am reluctant to enter into the details of Irelands efforts to lobby other member states. However, I can tell the House that the candidacy is being well received among the broad membership of the United Nations.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 83, 84 and 85 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1325" /> The charter of the United Nations provides, in order to ensure prompt and effective action by the organisation, that its member states confer on the Security Council primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security, and agree that in carrying out its duties under this responsibility the Security Council acts on their behalf.</P>
    <P>The Security Council's effectiveness must be judged against the background of the political and global realities in which it operates. Although the Security Council acts on behalf of the entire membership, it is regrettable that certain member states have failed over the years to abide by its binding resolutions. However, in many conflicts since 1945, the efforts of the council have played an important role in restoring and maintaining the peace. Having said this, I am strongly of the view that changes are required to the composition and functioning of the council to enable it to discharge its charter responsibilities more effectively.</P>
    <P>Following the end of the Cold War, the early 1990s saw the council asserting its charter role in a newly vigorous manner and the international community commenced consideration of how to make the council more representative of changed global realities and more transparent in its work. In 1993, the General Assembly decided to establish a working group open to all UN member states to consider all aspects of the question of an increase in the membership of the Security Council and other matters related to the council. The issues involved are enlargement of Security Council membership, the council's working methods and its decision-making procedures including, crucially, the use of the veto. The Government believes that a Security Council of 15 members for a United Nations of 185 member states does not reflect the institutional balance which the council must have if it is to carry out its charter duties effectively. Indeed most member states are agreed that the council should be enlarged to make it more representative of the wider membership. However, there is disagreement on how this should be achieved. Some favour a limited expansion of both permanent and non-permanent membership, while others are opposed to new permanent members of the council. The Government supports a small regionally balanced increase in both permanent and non-permanent seats to create an enlarged council of between 20 and 25 members. The Government strongly believes that any agreement on enlargement should not diminish the possibility for smaller UN member states to serve on the council as non-permanent members. As the Deputy is aware, Ireland is a candidate for membership of the council for 2001-2.</P>
    <P>On Security Council working methods, there appears to be fairly wide consensus that these should be more formalised and transparent, involving greater consultation by the council with other UN organs, including the General Assembly and Secretary-General, and, in peace<Col N="1326" /> keeping matters, with troop contributing countries.</P>
    <P>However, progress on the foregoing is linked to the vexed question of the decision-making procedures of the council, specifically the veto power of permanent members. Some member states wish to see it abolished or not extended to any new permanent members; others wish to see its use greatly restricted; while the five permanent members have been opposed to any change in their veto prerogatives. Ireland would like to see the veto eliminated altogether but, recognising the strong opposition of the permanent five, has proposed that they be invited to accept a limitation of the veto, and to exercise it only when they consider the question of vital national importance, taking into account the interests of the United Nations as a whole. At the same time any new permanent members of the council would declare that they would never exercise the veto.</P>
    <P>I regret that the working group has not yet been able to report any consensual progress to the General Assembly. Hopes for progress on the 50th anniversary of the organisation in 1995 were disappointed. There must be a renewed effort, as we approach the Millennium Assembly of the United Nations next year, to mobilise the political will to achieve meaningful reform. A revitalised Security Council is essential to confront the challenges, including those of the ethnic conflicts which have blighted the last decade of the twentieth century.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that Ireland will continue to play an active role in the negotiations to strengthen the council's capacity to fulfil its charter responsibilities. A larger and more transparent council, less wedded to the negative use of the veto, could contribute more effectively to international peace and security.</P>

      <P>Cyprus presented its application for membership of the EC in July 1990. The formal accession process was launched by the 15 member states of the EU, the ten central and eastern European applicants and Cyprus on 30 March 1998. Bilateral intergovernmental conferences to begin accession negotiations with Cyprus along with Hungary, Poland, Estonia, the Czech Republic and Slovenia were held the following day. Those negotiations currently cover 15 chapters of the acquis and it is anticipated that a further eight chapters will be opened under the incoming Presidency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In agreeing to open formal membership negotiations with Cyprus, the Luxembourg European <Col N="1327" /> Council of December 1997 requested that the willingness of the Government of Cyprus to include representatives of the Turkish Cypriot community be acted upon. The Turkish Cypriot authorities have, however, declined to take up this invitation to date. The Union believes the prospect of accession by Cyprus provides both the incentive and the opportunity for serious efforts to find a comprehensive settlement to the Cyprus question.</P>
    <P>Together with our partners in the Union, Ireland fully supports the efforts of the United Nations to achieve a political solution to the Cyprus question. We believe the UN framework of a bi-zonal bi-communal federal approach remains the appropriate one for an eventual settlement. Since September of last year, the UN Secretary-General's Deputy special representative for Cyprus, Dame Ann Hercus, has been conducting on-island contacts with both parties, with the goal of reducing tensions and promoting progress towards a just and lasting settlement.</P>
    <P>The efforts of the EU, in support of the UN, have been concentrated on reducing tensions on the island, encouraging wider contacts between both communities at all levels, and using special envoys to seek to encourage and prepare the ground for a direct talks process between the two leaders on an overall political settlement. During Ireland's EU Presidency we appointed Ambassador Kester Heaslip as the Presidency's special representative for Cyprus. He retained this position under the subsequent Dutch and Luxembourg Presidencies. The current special representative is Ambassador zu Rantzau of Germany who has visited Turkey, Greece and Cyprus itself in recent weeks.</P>
    <P>Together with our European partners, Ireland will continue to give every support to the efforts of the UN to advance the process towards a political settlement and to encourage Cyprus on its path towards EU accession.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated in my reply on this matter to Deputy Rabbitte on 11 May, following the arrest of Abdullah Ocalan, the EU General Affairs Council issued a declaration on 22 February which took note of the assurance of the Turkish Government that Mr. Ocalan would receive a fair trial. We emphasised, however, that we expected this to mean fair and correct treatment and an open trial according to the rule of law before an independent court, with access to legal counsel of his choice and with international observers admit<Col N="1328" /> ted to the trial. We also reiterated our strong opposition to the death penalty. I communicated these views directly to the then speaker of the Turkish Grand National Assembly during his visit to Dublin in early March and he responded to my concerns positively.</P>
      <P>Mr. Ocalan appointed a team of lawyers who met with him at the island prison of Imrali on a regular basis. A preliminary hearing of the Ocalan case was held in the Ankara State Security Court on 30 April. Subsequently, Mr. Ocalan's lawyers threatened to withdraw from the case citing allegations of harassment by the authorities including an assault following the preliminary hearing. They also complained that they were denied private access to him during their visits.</P>
      <P>On 3 March the Turkish authorities granted unrestricted access to Mr. Ocalan in Imrali prison to representatives of the Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly. In their report, they described the material conditions of his detention as of a high standard but they recommended that he be provided with a radio, newspapers and books. With regard to his outdoor exercise facility, they recommended that he be permitted from time to time access to a larger area. They also expressed some unease about his psychological health due to his solitary detention in a remote location under a high security regime. However, the delegation declared itself satisfied that Mr. Ocalan was not at risk of physical ill treatment and from interviews with Mr. Ocalan and the three doctors attending him was satisfied that his physical health was good. Following their visit, a number of their recommendations were accepted by the Turkish authorities including the provision of access to radio and newspapers.</P>
      <P>Mr. Ocalan's trial which is taking place before a State Security Court comprising two civilian judges and one military officer opened Monday 31 May with a reading by the prosecution of a 139 page indictment accusing Mr. Ocalan of treason and separatist activities. The incoming Turkish government has announced its intention to amend the law to remove the military officer from the Security Court. However, demands by Mr. Ocalan's defence team to have the case adjourned to allow implementation of the governments commitment were rejected by the court. As a result of this, two members of Mr. Ocalan's defence team withdrew from the case.</P>
      <P>Space at the trial venue is restricted and seats have been allocated to a representative body of foreign and Turkish citizens including journalists. It is understood that at the opening session 20 journalists and 12 foreign nationals were permitted to attend. On my instructions the Embassy in Ankara made application to attend the trial and like our EU partners, we have been allocated a place at the trial for portions of the proceedings. The Embassy also processed the application to attend the trial of an Irish member of the Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly, Deputy Enright.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1329" /> The Government has strongly emphasised in its bilateral contacts with the Turkish authorities the importance of a free and fair trial for Mr. Ocalan and I will be following proceedings in the case with the closest attention.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government warmly welcomed the agreement signed in New York on 5 May between Portugal and Indonesia on the future of East Timor. Central to the terms of this agreement was provision for a ballot to be held on 8 August by means of which the people of East Timor would be able to decide in a democratic manner on proposals formulated by the Indonesian Government to grant autonomy status to the territory.</P>
      <P>During my recent visit to East Timor, I saw at first hand the intimidation and violence that were taking place. I immediately raised at the highest level with the Indonesian authorities and I also took steps to ensure that the UN Secretary General and other governments were fully informed.</P>
      <P>It is a matter of deep concern to me and to our EU partners that armed militias are currently being permitted to intimidate the population of East Timor and may be attempting thereby to influence the outcome of the ballot or to have it cancelled altogether. Many killings and other acts of wanton violence against innocent civilians are known to have taken place in recent months. In these circumstances it may indeed prove difficult to hold the consultative process as scheduled on 8 August in a free and fair manner. I have therefore availed of every opportunity, as have my EU colleagues, to impress upon the Indonesian Government its primary responsibility for curbing the activities of the militias and for the maintenance of peace and security in the territory.</P>
      <P>The operational aspects of the consultative process to be held in East Timor are now the responsibility of the United Nations and it will be for that body to decide if conditions are suitable for a democratic ballot to be held. The UN Mission in East Timor &ndash; UNAMET &ndash; comprising up to 280 civilian police officers and several hundred other UN officials is to be established with the task of organising and conducting the ballot. It is hoped that UNAMET will be deployed in the near future and that Irish personnel will be available to play an appropriate part in the operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1330" /> The Government sincerely hopes that it will be possible for the voting process in East Timor to proceed as scheduled. Unless the violence and intimidation which is currently taking place is quickly ended, it is difficult to see how the people of East Timor will be able to exercise their right to self-determination in a free, fair and transparent manner.</P>

      <P>The regulations which apply in Ireland to aircraft noise levels are contained in the European Communities (Restriction of Civil sub-sonic Jet Aeroplane Operations) Regulations, 1993 (S.I. No. 130 of 1993). These regulations give effect to the provisions of EU Council Directive 92/14/EEC affecting the operation of certain categories of sub-sonic jet aeroplanes within the territories of the member states. Council Directive 98/20/EC which amends Directive 92/14/EEC is currently being transposed into Irish law.</P>
      <P>The combined effect of Council Directives 92/14/EEC and 98/20/EC means that aircraft are not permitted to operate at an airport within the state as from 1 April 1995, unless there is in force in respect of that aeroplane a noise certificate, certifying that the noise made by that aeroplane is not greater than the noise levels specified in Part II, Chapter 3, volume 1 of Annex 16 (2nd Edition, 1988) to the Chicago Convention.</P>
      <P>EC Council Regulation 925/1999 on the registration and operation within the Community of certain types of civil subsonic jet aeroplanes which have been modified and recertificated as meeting the standards of volume 1, Part II, Chapter 3 of Annex 16 to the Convention on International Civil Aviation was adopted on 29 April 1999. The effect of this regulation is to restrict the operation within the European Union of hush-kitted aircraft which meet ICAO Chapter III noise levels.</P>
      <P>The EU Council decided to delay the application of this regulation by one year from 29 April 1999. This delay is to facilitate the continuation and conclusion of consultations between the EU and the US with a view to establishing a joint EU/US position on noise rules.</P>

      <P>In a report I made to Government last March on the future development of suburban rail in Dublin and Cork, I suggested that the re-opening of the Cork to Midleton rail link could be considered, not on the basis of current passenger demand, but in anticipation of future developments, such as population and industrial growth along the rail corridor and changing commuter patterns.</P>
      <P>The Government agreed that I should arrange for detailed costing and feasibility work on various suburban rail proposals in Dublin and Cork. The evaluation of the Cork to Midleton rail link should establish whether there is a basis for re-opening the line. If the analysis supports the re-opening of the line, I will then give urgent consideration to appropriate funding arrangements for the project.</P>

      <P>Under the Transport Acts, the question of assessing and meeting demands for public transport services is a matter for Córas Iompair Éireann and its operating subsidiaries. I have no statutory function with regard to approving the purchase of rolling stock.</P>
      <P>However, £40.4 million of Exchequer and EU funds, was approved in June 1998 to enable Iarnród Éireann purchase 20 extra suburban railcars and 16 new DART carriages. It is hoped that the new rolling stock will be delivered to the company next year. This is in addition to an earlier order of 27 railcars and ten DART carriages, which is already being delivered.</P>
      <P>In addition to the rolling stock already on order, CIE and the Dublin Transportation Office have identified a requirement for approximately 124 additional units of rolling stock in the period 2000 to 2006, comprising inter city carriages, DART units and diesel railcars. This is being considered as part of the preparation of the National Development Plan.</P>

      <P>The most significant Mycoplasma species which has been identified in Irish cattle in the last 12 months has been Mycoplasma Bovis. Last year there were 31 such cases confirmed by my Department's regional veterinary laboratories. Where an outbreak occurs the advice in general is to immediately identify infected animals and then segregate these animals. The support of the laboratory service of my Department is available to provide back-up laboratory diagnosis, advice and assistance with control of the disease in individual herds.</P>
      <P>Herdowners are strongly advised to isolate purchased animals, particularly imported stock for as long as possible &ndash; a minimum of four weeks is recommended &ndash; during which time they should be closely monitored for clinical signs of the disease. If any clinical disease is present they should continue to isolate all the purchased animals and consult their veterinary surgeon immediately for advice.</P>
      <P>The disease is relatively common in Ireland, as is the case throughout the EU, as is borne out by the fact over the last four years approximately 18 per cent of total bovine pneumonia cases presented to the regional veterinary laboratories were diagnosed as Mycoplasma Bovis positive.</P>
      <P>Mycoplasma is not a notifiable disease and, therefore, my Department is not involved in any depopulation or eradication scheme. This also applies in all other EU member states. There are no funds available at my Department's disposal to pay direct compensation in respect of herds affected by the disease nor are there proposals that compensation should be paid.</P>

      <P>An essential prerequisite for eligibility under the TB and brucellosis eradication hardship arrangements is that the holding of the herdowner in question remains restricted following a full herd retest. The eligibility period for the 1998-99 hardship grant scheme was 1 November 1998 to 30 April 1999.</P>
      <P>Following the disclosure of a TB lesion on 11 December 1998, the holding of the person named was restricted on 15 December 1998. The herd was scheduled for a balance of herd test on 21 February 1999 with a full herd re-test at a later date. However the herdowner deferred the balance of herd test scheduled for 21 February 1999 until 18 May 1999, which is outside the eligibility period of the 1998-99 hardship grant scheme. The herdowner concerned is not, therefore, entitled to any hardship grant payment as a key payment criterion was not met.</P>

      <P>In general civil servants above clerical officer level, excluding personal assistants and special advisers whose terms of appointment are co-terminous with the appointing Minister, are totally debarred from engaging in politics. The exception is where a civil servant, who holds a position which had been within the clerical officer threshold, has been upgraded through the general restructuring of his or her grade and as a result of which such upgraded position now carries a salary maximum above that of clerical officer.</P>
      <P>The policy in this area is based on the need to strike an appropriate balance between the benefits of having as many citizens as possible play an active part in the affairs of the State while at the same time ensuring public confidence in the political impartiality of civil servants. Political impartiality is considered to be at the core of an effective and efficient civil service. In particular, an involvement in political activity could lead to a public perception that civil servants were compromised in the performance of their official duties.</P>
      <P>Regarding grades above the present level of responsibility at which the ban becomes effective, in general the duties and responsibilities of these grades would be such that it is imperative that the public retain absolute confidence in their impartiality in the performance of their official duties. Such absolute confidence requires that these grades be excluded from engaging in political activity.</P>

Hotels and holiday cottages are accordingly not included for the purpose of the rural renewal scheme as qualifying buildings. In addition, hotels in County Sligo and in six other counties in the north-west with the exception of the area designated under the seaside resort scheme, are not subject to the capital allowances restrictions introduced in the 1998 budget and Finance Act, for individual passive investors.</P>
      <P>Buildings providing bed and breakfast accommodation are considered as commercial buildings for tax treatment purposes under the rural renewal scheme and qualify for capital allowances of 50 per cent of relevant expenditure on construction or refurbishment work carried out in the qualifying period. An initial allowance of 25 per cent may be claimed by both owner occupiers and lessors with annual allowances of 2 per cent for the balance up to a maximum of 50 per cent. Alternatively an accelerated allowance known as free depreciation of up to 50 per cent is also available to owner-occupiers. Lessees of qualified commercial buildings can also qualify for a double rent allowance for tax purposes in respect of rent paid under a bona fide commercial letting, subject to EU commission approval.</P>

      <P>It most certainly is not Government policy to reduce public service pensions.</P>
      <P>In June 1997, in An Action Programme for the Millennium, the Government undertook to protect public service pensions. In November 1997, the Government announced that the benefit of the restructuring pay deals under the programme for competitiveness and work would apply on the basis of parity to public servants who had retired before the commencement dates; however, in order to protect those retired public servants who would have received less than 3 per cent had parity been applied in the normal way, the Government decided that pensioners should be guaranteed a minimum increase of 3 per cent &ndash; or 2 per cent in the case of any pensioners who have already received an advance payment of 1 per cent. It also indicated that the decision to apply parity with a floor of 3 per cent in respect of the PCW restructuring deals was a once-off measure and that the policy in relation to any future restructuring deals will be determined in the light of the recommendations in the final report of the commission on public service pensions. I look forward to receiving that report in the coming months.</P>
      <P>Officials of my Department have met representatives of the national association of retired public service employees, formerly the public service pensions action group, on a number of occasions, most recently in March 1999. The issues being pursued by that association and other pensioner groups dispute aspects of settled pensions parity policy. For example, they want personal long service increments paid to certain serving staff on a personal basis under their PCW restructuring pay deals to be passed on to retired personnel. My Department has made it clear from the beginning that it is a core element of pensions parity policy that such payments are not passed on to pensioners because they are not a permanent feature of the pay scale.</P>

      <P>Under EU VAT law, with which Irish VAT law must comply, member states can retain the zero rates which were in place prior to 1 January 1991 but <Col N="1346" /> they are prohibited from introducing new ones. Animal feed which includes feed for horses, but excludes feeding stuff which is packaged, sold or otherwise designated for the use of dogs, cats, cage birds or domestic pets was zero rated prior to 1991 and therefore retains that VAT treatment.</P>
      <P>Greyhound feed on the other hand was standard rated prior to 1991. To assist the industry, my predecessor availed of a provision in EU law which allows member states the option of introducing reduced rates for certain goods and services to reduce the rate of VAT on greyhound feed in the Finance Act, 1995. Since 1 July 1995, greyhound feed which is packaged, advertised or held out for sale solely as greyhound feed and which is supplied in units of not less than ten kilograms can benefit from the reduced rate of 12.5 per cent.</P>
      <P>I am fully aware of the economic contribution made by the greyhound industry.</P>

      <P>My attention has been drawn to the delays experienced by potential applicants for tax relief under the rural renewal scheme. I have made arrangements with the Revenue Commissioners for the publication of a explanatory leaflet covering both the tax reliefs available under the scheme and the application process to be adhered to by applicants. The Revenue Commissioners have assured me that the explanatory leaflet will be published and distributed in the very near future. There are no application forms as such for the drawing down of the rural renewal scheme tax incentives, however to claim the relief individuals must have received either a certificate of reasonable cost or a certificate of compliance from the Department of the Environment and Local Government in respect of the project. The preparation and publication of application forms for these certificates is a matter for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government and I am informed that, with regard to the rural renewal scheme, these application forms are being prepared and will be available early next week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>At its meeting on the 25 of May 1999, the Government approved the text of a draft order providing for the establishment of a tribunal of inquiry to investigate the infection with HIV and hepatitis C of persons with haemophilia. The main issues to be examined by the tribunal are as follows: which products caused, or probably caused, the infection; the role of the Blood Transfusion Service Board &ndash; BTSB &ndash; medical consultants and others in product selection; the pre<Col N="1350" /> vailing state of medical and scientific knowledge; implementation of self sufficiency policy by the BTSB; selection procedures with regard to manufacturers and fractionators; donor selection; donor testing; donor screening; plasma quarantine criteria; viral inactivation procedures; follow-up measures in respect of tracing, offering testing and minimising risk of infection; response to discovery that persons had been infected; role of the National Drugs Advisory Board, NDAB, and supervision of the NDAB and the BTSB by the Department of Health and Children.</P>
      <P>The tribunal will also investigate the circumstances of the infection with HIV of the person known as &ldquo;the Kilkenny health worker&rdquo; following a blood transfusion in July 1985 and the circumstances surrounding the issue of untested platelet concentrate in December 1985, the donor of which was subsequently diagnosed as HIV positive.</P>
      <P>Because of the special position held by the Irish Haemophilia Society in that it represents persons directly affected by the HIV and hepatitis C contamination of blood products, my officials and I have been in consultation with the society on the issues to be examined by the tribunal. It appears that most blood products implicated in the infection of haemophiliacs with hepatitis C and HIV were manufactured by pharmaceutical companies in the USA, some based on blood donated there and some based on blood donated in Ireland and sent for processing. To fully investigate the source of the infections, therefore, the IHS felt that the tribunal should, if possible, inquire into the relevant operations of the pharmaceutical companies concerned.</P>
      <P>The proposed terms of reference include a provision which would enable the tribunal to investigate anything arising outside the State that it considers relevant in so far as the tribunal considers it practicable, appropriate and reasonable to do so and considers that the procedures adopted for the purpose can be carried out without unduly delaying the completion of the inquiry and with a substantial expectation of being able to obtain the evidence necessary for the investigation.</P>
      <P>The Attorney General and I met representatives of the society and its legal advisers on Friday 21 May. At that meeting, the IHS indicated that they were satisfied that the proposed terms of reference comprised all the issues which they wish to have examined by the tribunal. The IHS also indicated their support for the provision relating to the international aspect of the tribunal.</P>
      <P>At its meeting on 25 May, the Government also approved the moving of the necessary motion in the Dáil and Seanad to establish the tribunal. I have made arrangements to have the motion before both Houses of the Oireachtas tomorrow, Wednesday, 2 June 1999.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 143, 144 and 145 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision of speech and language therapy services is a matter for the relevant health board. Speech and language therapy services in all areas are in need of development. Health boards regard this as a priority and 31 additional posts of speech and language therapists were created in the health boards in the four years between 1995 and 1998. The report of the Review Group on Health and Personal Social Services for People with Physical and Sensory Disabilities, Towards an Independent Future, published in 1996, sets out the requirements for the development of services in that sector, including speech and language therapy services. As recommended in the report, regional co-ordinating committees, representative of the voluntary and statutory service providers, have been established in each health board. One of the functions of the committees is to advise the chief executive officer of the health board on the priorities for the investment of fund<Col N="1352" /> ing made available for the development of services.</P>
    <P>This year, £3 million, rising to £6 million on a full year cost basis in 2000, has been made available for the development of services for people with physical and sensory disabilities. I understand that the Western Health Board has allocated £40,000 from its development funding this year to enable additional speech and language therapists to be appointed in Mayo and Roscommon and for the appointment of a locum in Roscommon to ensure continuity of service.</P>
    <P>The recruitment of paramedical staff generally is presenting problems throughout the health board regions. Following a labour court recommendation in 1997, an expert group was established to examine and report on various issues relating to paramedical grades, including speech and language therapists. One of the issues to be examined by this group is the problems which arise in relation to the recruitment and the retention of various paramedical grades. It is anticipated that the report of this group will be completed later this year.</P>

      <P>I have had inquiries made of the Children's Hospital, Temple Street, regarding ENT waiting lists and have been advised that at the end of March 1999, the most recent period for which information is available, there was a total of 628 children awaiting ENT procedures. I have been further advised that 401 of these patients have been waiting over 12 months, and that the annual throughput activity for 1998 for ENT cases was 1,589 cases.</P>
      <P>Since coming into office, I am acutely aware of the importance of reducing waiting lists and waiting times, particularly for children. To this end my Department has allocated £150,000 in 1999 to Temple Street Hospital under the waiting list initiative for the provision of treatment to children on waiting lists. The hospital, conscious of the delays experienced by patients awaiting ENT procedures, has earmarked £81,250 of its total waiting list initiative funding for additional ENT work in 1999. I am confident that the additional funding and revised arrangements for the management of waiting lists will have a significant impact on waiting lists and more importantly waiting times this year.</P>

Decisions on the timing of phase II, which will include the relocation of the Children's Hospital, Temple Street, are dependent upon a range of complex planning and technical considerations and in particular on the availability of the necessary capital resources for the planning and construction of the project, having regard to the many competing demands on my Department.</P>
      <P>In the interim, it is vital that existing services for children on the north side of the city are maintained to a high standard and I have approved funding in the region of £1.6 million for the refurbishment of the accident and emergency department and the new day ward at the Children's Hospital, Temple Street. My Department has recently conveyed approval to the hospital to proceed with the tendering process. The estimated timeframe for the construction of this development is between nine and 12 months. I am confident that this accident and emergency development will bring a much needed improvement to this critical service for children in the north side of Dublin.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Health and Children</askee>
      <Quest>the consideration, if any, he has given to allocating medical cards to everybody over 66 years of age; and the estimated cost implications.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government identified in its programme An Action Programme for the Millennium the need to review medical card eligibility for the elderly <Col N="1354" /> and large families. The Government has decided that the income guidelines for entitlement to medical cards for persons aged 70 years or over should be doubled. This improvement which is being introduced over a three year period, began on 1 March. The income guidelines for those aged 70 to 79 and 80 years and over, which are already higher than the normal guidelines, have increased by one-third and there will be similar increases in 2000 and 2001.</P>
      <P>Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on means. Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board. Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.</P>
      <P>Income guidelines are drawn up by the chief executive officers, to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these are revised annually in line with the consumer price index. However, the guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that his or her medical needs or other circumstances would justify this.</P>
      <P>In view of this special provision I do not feel it justifiable, nor did previous governments, on health policy grounds, to extend an automatic entitlement to a medical card to any specific group without any reference to their means, as a general rule. It is open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board for health services if they are unable to provide these services for themselves or their dependants without hardship.</P>
      <P>Non-medical card holders are entitled to a broad range of health services including an entitlement to public hospital and public consultant treatment subject only to modest statutory charges and out-patient services free of charge. There are a number of schemes which provide assistance towards the cost of medication.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to state precisely the cost of extending the medical card to all persons aged 65 years and over. However, it is now estimated that it would cost about £17 million to extend medical card eligibility to such persons. This figure does not take account of the costs involved in the drug refund scheme attributed to persons in this age category who do not currently hold a medical card. Such costs, which are based on expenditure by individuals or families and do not relate to the age of a person, would have to be offset against the above figure. Similarly costs of other health and social services which may be made available without charge to medical card holders are not included in the estimate above. Loss of income from public hospital statutory charges, from which medical holders are exempt, would also have to be taken into account.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 151, 152 and 159 together.</P>
      <P>Epilepsy is treated at primary, secondary and tertiary care levels and a broad range of services exist to cater for persons with this condition. Highly specialised care is available in major acute hospitals with neurology departments or from visiting neurologists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>General practitioners and public health nurses are available to provide information, guidance and counselling for people with epilepsy and people who suffer from epilepsy are entitled to a <Col N="1356" /> long-term illness card to pay for medication relative to this condition.</P>
    <P>The funding of voluntary agencies, such as brainwave &ndash; and the Irish Epilepsy Association, for the provision of health services to people with physical and sensory disabilities is a matter for the relevant health boards in whose functional area the services are being provided. Brainwave has in the past, received funding from each of the health boards for the provision of its services, including the provision of information packs for general practitioners. As recommended in the report of the review group on health and personal social services for people with physical and sensory disabilities, Towards an Independent Future, published in December 1996, regional co-ordinating committees for services for people with physical and sensory disabilities have been set up in each health board area. These bring together health boards, voluntary sector service providers and consumers. One of the primary functions of the co-ordinating committee is to advise on priorities for the allocation of funds available for the development of the services. The allocation of funding to services specific to persons with epilepsy will be considered by boards in this context. This year £3 million &ndash; £6 million full year cost in the year 2000 &ndash; has been provided for the development of services.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Health and Children</askee>
      <Quest>the reason the number of beds in the intensive care unit of the Mater Hospital in Dublin was reduced from 17 to 12; if this decision will be reversed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[14305/99]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had inquiries made of the Mater Hospital regarding this matter and have been informed that the numbers of beds in the intensive care unit have been reduced due to a shortage in <Col N="1357" /> speciality nurses. The hospital is actively involved in trying to recruit specialist nurses for this area and these beds will reopen as soon as the trained staff are in place.</P>
      <P>This shortage of specialist nursing staff is being experienced on a nationwide basis. While the recruitment of nurses is primarily a matter for individual employers, the overall issue of the availability of nurses is being kept under review by the Health Service Employers' Agency &ndash; HSEA. The HSEA established a task group in 1998 to examine the full nature of the difficulties in recruiting nursing staff and to make recommendations on appropriate action.</P>
      <P>A HSEA survey of Dublin hospitals showed 448 vacant staff nurse posts on 15 January 1999. However, a survey of the same hospitals carried out one week later by my Department revealed a significant reduction in the number of vacant posts &ndash; down to 384 on the 22nd January 1999. A further survey carried out during the week ending 5 February 1999 provided an almost identical result &ndash; 384.9 vacancies.</P>
      <P>This downward trend is consistent with the increase in the number of nurses applying to An Bord Altranais for registration. The returns indicate that there is a particular difficulty in recruiting nurses for specialist areas such as theatre, intensive care, coronary care, accident and emergency and paediatrics. The survey returns reinforce the indications given to the HSEA by hospital management that nurses are leaving Dublin and taking up positions in rural areas. The cost of housing and traffic problems are seen as disincentives to taking up nursing posts in Dublin.</P>
      <P>A further survey of nursing vacancies in the Dublin area is currently being undertaken by the HSEA. The results of this survey will be available shortly and will be submitted to the Joint Committee on Health and Children, which is considering nursing shortages. Representatives of my Department and the HSEA have been invited to appear before the committee on 17 June next.</P>
      <P>The strength of the economy is also having an impact on the availability of nurses. Nurses have enhanced mobility by virtue of their education, training and skills. In the current economic boom, they are much sought after by pharmaceutical and related companies in the private health sector, as well as by commercial concerns in other sectors.</P>
      <P>Arising from the work of the task group, the HSEA outlined to the nursing unions in November 1998 a number of initiatives to address the shortage, including the standardisation of overtime rates and full incremental credit on permanent appointment for relevant previous nursing experience both at home and abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, the HSEA is committed to the introduction of more flexible working arrangements for nursing staff. At present, the only options for permanent employment are full-time work or jobsharing. The absence of more flexible attendance patterns has been identified as a major obstacle to attracting nurses and midwives <Col N="1358" /> with family responsibilities back to work. The HSEA recently circulated a discussion document on a revised scheme of working arrangements to the nursing unions. A meeting between the HSEA and the nursing unions to discuss the proposals contained in the document is expected to take place shortly. This initiative is being undertaken under the programme for partnership.</P>
    <P>My Department has engaged a nurse researcher to specifically study nursing needs for the coming years and to carry out research on the reasons nurses are leaving their profession. When this research has been completed, my Department will be in a better position to further address the issue of nursing shortages.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 7 and 42 on Thursday, 27 May, in which I gave details of initiatives being undertaken by the Health Service Employers' Agency &ndash; HSEA &ndash; to address the current difficulties being experienced by health agencies in recruiting nurses.</P>
      <P>In tandem with the initiatives undertaken by the HSEA to encourage more registered nurses back to nursing, important measures have also been taken to attract more young people to nursing training.</P>
      <P>The future demographics indicate that the recruitment of school leavers into nursing will become increasingly difficult. There are currently 340,000 in the 15-19 age group. It is projected that this will reduce to 245,000 by the 2011. This means that number of school leavers available for the labour market and education will be declining progressively over the next ten years.</P>
      <P>A primary aim of the nursing careers centre, which is now managed by An Bord Altranais, is to ensure that nursing is vigorously promoted as a career choice in its own right for Irish school-leavers.</P>
      <P>This year it is expected that there will be some 1,192 training places available on the nursing diploma programmes &ndash; 831 in general nursing, 201 in psychiatric nursing and 160 in mental handicap nursing. The Government has provided additional funding of £7.5 million this year, bringing to some £32 million the amount that will be spent on the programmes in 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am conscious of the need to increase the number of training places in general nursing. In 1998 a new school of general nursing was established in the Midland Health Board area with an annual intake of 20 places. The combined annual intake of the two schools attached to the new hospital in <Col N="1359" /> Tallaght was also increased by 33 places in 1998. This year it is hoped to provide an extra 50 places, which will be offered to applicants who successfully come through this year's competition.</P>
    <P>The total number of training places in psychiatric nursing and mental handicap nursing has been substantially increased in recent years, but unfortunately it has not been possible to fill all of these places because of the lower level of interest in these particular streams. In 1998 only 92 of the 201 psychiatric places and 117 of the 175 mental handicap places were filled.</P>
    <P>I made funding available to each of the schools of psychiatric and mental handicap nursing to undertake a marketing campaign aimed at secondary schools within their catchment areas. The Eastern Health Board received special funding for the production of a video on psychiatric nursing. A sum of £150,000 was provided to An Bord Altranais specifically for promotional materials. Almost £400,000 in total has been invested in a concerted recruitment campaign, at both local and national level.</P>
    <P>Nursing students on the diploma programmes receive an annual maintenance grant as well as other financial supports. The value of this grant was £2,500 when it was first introduced in 1994. It remained at this level until 1998, when I increased it by 20 per cent to £3,000. I further increased it by £250 to £3,250 with effect from 1 April 1999. This maintenance grant, which is not subject to a means test, has, therefore, been increased by 30 per cent since I took up office as Minister for Health and Children.</P>
    <P>As part of the preparations for this year's competitions, An Bord Altranais, with my approval, amended its own rules to revise the minimum educational requirements for entry to nursing training. The effect of this rule change was to expand the range of leaving certificate subjects that may be presented by an applicant for admission to the nursing diploma programmes. In particular, it removed the requirement for a foreign language in the case of the non-NUI third level institutions involved in the operation of the programmes. In the context of attracting more entrants to nursing, a positive consequence of the rule change is to increase the pool of school leavers and others who are eligible for places on the nursing diploma programmes.</P>
    <P>The initiatives undertaken in advance of this year's competitions were designed to stimulate interest in nursing as a career and increase the number of applications for training places. The response to this year's integrated competition for places on the general and psychiatric nursing diploma programmes has been very positive. More than 5,550 applications were received by the nursing careers centre, an increase of over 40 per cent <Col N="1360" /> on last year's figures. This year there are six applicants for every general nursing place, compared with four in 1998. Some 718 applicants expressed a first preference for psychiatric nursing, which is a most encouraging development. Some 3,400 applicants have passed the written assessment test, and all of these will be called for interview.</P>

      <Quest>if he will meet a delegation of Cork Oireachtas Members and representatives of Cork hospital consultants to discuss the future of the Blood Transfusion Service Board in Cork.</Quest>
      <QRef>[14342/99]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Responsibility for the organisation and management of the national blood transfusion service rests with the Blood Transfusion Service Board, BTSB. Following the report of the Finlay tribunal of inquiry, the BTSB is implementing a wide-ranging programme of modernisation in order to adapt to emerging developments in transfusion medicine.</P>
      <P>The closure of the BTSB Cork centre is not on the agenda of the BTSB or my Department. All that is being considered is a possible change in one aspect of the Cork operation, <i>vis-à-vis</i> donation testing. There is no suggestion of any change in relation to the other scientific and technical services currently carried out at the Cork centre, such as blood grouping, components processing, compatibility testing and ante-natal screening.</P>
      <P>In February 1998, the board of the BTSB decided that having regard to international practice PCR testing, which is the most sensitive way of detecting viruses, should be carried out at the new national headquarters which is under construction. The proposal which is now being assessed by the BTSB is whether all serological testing, not only PCR, should be performed at the national headquarters. A consultancy project commissioned with the approval of the previous Government recommended that the BTSB should develop a strategy to consolidate donor testing to a single location.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The board of the BTSB has asked the chief executive officer and the national medical director to prepare a report on the practical implications for patient services of developing a single site for donation testing in Ireland. Among the issues being addressed are: how best to provide a transfusion service in the light of the rapidly changing environment in transfusion medicine; the application of accepted international standards of practice in leading centres and blood services; the achievement of the goal of supplying 100 per cent of blood components on time and without fail; the likelihood of a substantial <Col N="1363" /> reduction in the use of blood components given the alternatives to blood transfusion which are currently available or being developed; the concerns of health boards and hospitals, including their concerns about the substantial increase in the costs of BTSB products; and the achievement of a service that is efficient and effective.</P>
    <P>As part of this process, the chief executive officer and the national medical director of the BTSB are consulting with international transfusion experts. Consultation is also taking place with BTSB staff, relevant hospitals and blood users to brief them on the emerging developments, fully explain the BTSB's enhanced blood safety programme and address the needs and concerns of medical and scientific staff. A meeting has already taken place with members and staff of the Southern Health Board. The BTSB has advised the Southern Health Board that the BTSB is committed to working with all hospitals to ensure it meets their blood component needs in a speedy, efficient and cost-effective manner consistent with the essential requirement of blood safety. The newly appointed chairman of the BTSB has also offered an opportunity to the Southern Health Board to make a presentation. The BTSB has also invited scientific and medical input from hospital consultants in Cork to inform its considerations. Medical consultants who wish to make a written or oral submission to the BTSB should respond to this invitation. Should the Deputy or other Oireachtas Members wish to discuss operational matters involving the BTSB they might contact the chief executive officer who would welcome such discussion.</P>
    <P>The board of the BTSB will consider the outcome of the current assessment at its meeting in July.</P>

      <P>The provision of a back-to-nursing course at Tralee General Hospital is a matter for the Southern Health Board. The board has such a course available at Cork University Hospital which is offered to applicants twice a year. According to the board, the low level of inquiries from persons in the Kerry area would not justify the provision of a course in Tralee at present.</P>

      <P>Gender mixing occurs in high dependency units <Col N="1364" /> such as intensive care, coronary care and accident and emergency departments as well as in small geriatric assessment units. Outside of these areas, gender mixing may occur as a result of emergency medical need where no alternative accommodation can be found at the time of admission. It is not possible to re-organise the accommodation arrangements for male and female patients on a day to day basis to correspond with the varied demand for male and female beds. Some flexibility is therefore required occasionally in order to ensure that patients who need to be admitted can be. In such circumstances patients are usually only mixed for short periods until alternative accommodation can be found. On such occasions it would be normal practice that patients would be screened off by the use of curtains etc. to ensure that a degree of privacy can be maintained.</P>

      <P>The Health Act, 1970, provides at section 59(3) that a health board may make arrangements for the supply, without charge, of drugs, medicines or <Col N="1366" /> medical and surgical appliances to persons suffering from a prescribed disease or disability of a permanent or long-term nature. These arrangements are known as the long-term illness scheme. There are 15 specified illnesses covered under the long-term illness scheme and the scheme has not been extended since 1975 having regard to the fact the needs of individuals with significant or ongoing medical expenses are met by a range of other schemes which provide assistance towards the cost of prescribed drugs and medicines.</P>
      <P>Persons suffering from an on-going medical condition can avail of the drug cost subsidisation scheme which caters for people who do not have a medical card or a long-term illness book and are certified as having a medical condition with a regular and on-going requirement for prescribed drugs and medicines. Persons who qualify for inclusion in this scheme do not have to spend more than £32 in any month on prescribed medication.</P>
      <P>Under the drug refund scheme, families and individuals pay the full cost of their prescription medicines and may, at the end of the quarter, claim reimbursement from their health board of expenditure over £90 in that calendar quarter. The new drug payment scheme will replace the drug cost subsidisation scheme and the drug refund scheme, with effect from 1 July 1999, with a monthly threshold of £42.</P>
      <P>The new drug payment scheme will effectively merge the best elements of the two existing schemes and is designed to significantly improve the cash flow situation for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.</P>
      <P>The fact that the drug payment scheme will operate on a monthly basis has distinct advantages over the current drug refund scheme. Under the drug refund scheme, a family or an individual could, for example, in one month have expenditure of say £80 but no expenditure in the other two months. They would not have been entitled to a refund. Under the new scheme, they will only have to pay £42 in that month.</P>
      <P>There are no qualifying criteria for inclusion in the new drug payment scheme. This is in contrast to the old drug cost subsidisation scheme where patients had to be certified by their doctor as suffering from a condition requiring ongoing expenditure on medicines in excess of £32 per month.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied the new scheme will be easier to use than the drug refund scheme and will be more inclusive than the drug cost subsidisation scheme, bringing overall benefits to a greater number of people.</P>

      <P>The provision of drug treatment services for the eastern region is the statutory responisibility of the Eastern Health Board in the first instance. However, I understand from the board that its policy in relation to drug treatment is to cater for clients with drug addiction problems within its region to the maximum extent possible. If, however suitable programmes are available outside their region and a consultant psychiatrist recommends this treatment as the most beneficial for a patient, consideration on an individual basis is given to funding such treatment.</P>
      <P>The Eastern Health Board has developed a comprehensive range of services for drug addiction in its own region. These consist of addiction centres, satellite clinics, detoxification programmes both in-patient and out-patient. Some rehabilitation services are provided directly by the board and grants are also provided to voluntary organisations to provide similar services. It is the board's priority to develop further rehabilitation services in 1999. During this period the Eastern Health Board will spend over £400,000 on establishing additional rehabilitation projects.</P>
      <P>The board also funds programmes outside its region, for instance, the Cavan Centre, an activity centre for young children at risk in the north inner city received funding of £90,000. This year the board is providing a grant to the Merchant's Quay Project for its rehabilitation programme in the Tullow Centre in Carlow. The amount of this funding is being finalised by the board.</P>

      <P>The principal criterion applied to the admission of clients to the health boards' units for the elderly is the presence of a high level of dependency which can only be met by such admission.</P>
      <P>As the demand for admission exceeds the available resources, it is necessary to give priority to those most in need. In doing so, the ability of the client to fund his-her own care in the private nursing home sector, with or without the support of the nursing home subvention, is one of the factors taken into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am conscious of the need to increase the availability of long-term care facilities for our older people. This Government has more than doubled the level of capital resources for such facilities. The investment will accelerate the provision of additional residential care units, rehabilitation, respite care and day care facilities <Col N="1368" /> for older people throughout the country, as well as enhancing existing services, so that older people will have better facilities closer to where they live. The construction or planning of new community nursing units is under way in places such as Ballyconnell, Virginia, Clonmel, Killybegs, Birr, Achill, Thurles and Enniscorthy. A range of further capital developments are under consideration and it is my intention to make further significant improvements to the range of services provided for older people during the lifetime of this Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>In March 1997, my predecessor gave the go ahead for the introduction of phase 1 of the national breast screening programme for the target population of women aged 50-64, in the Eastern, North-Eastern and Midland Health Board areas. There will be two central units located at St. Vincent's Hospital, Dublin, and at the Mater Hospital, Dublin, where the screening, assessment and treatment of women will be carried out using a multi-disciplinary approach. In addition, the use of mobile units by BreastCheck, the National Breast Screening Board, will ensure that the screening service is accessible to all women in the target age group in these areas.</P>
      <P>In March 1999, I announced that phase 1 of the national breast screening programme would commence in October 1999. A key element in meeting this target date was the provision of appropriate physical facilities for the screening programme. My Department has now approved the acceptance of tenders in relation to the development of the Eccles unit at the Mater Hospital where refurbishment work can commence immediately.</P>
      <P>In addition, the planning for the development of the Merrion unit at St. Vincent's Hospital is at an advanced stage and I expect to be in a position shortly to approve the acceptance of tenders in this regard. It is planned that the necessary works for both units will be completed to facilitate the commencement of screening in October 1999.</P>
      <P>My intention is to provide a top quality service which meets best international standards. I am satisfied that the careful planning and deliberation by the national breast screening committee over the past two years in relation to all aspects of the programme will ensure that we can offer a service which is underpinned by standards of excellence and one which will ultimately pay dividends in terms of reductions in mortality among women in the target population.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The current situation at St. Vincent's Hospital regarding women seeking screening and routine mammography is that when a request is received the X-ray department write to both the patient and their general practitioner informing them that all appointments for mammograms are filled by patients with symptomatic breast disease or with a high risk of developing breast cancer. If a patient is concerned with regard to the length of waiting times they are advised to contact their general practitioner who will then discuss their case with the relevant consultant radiologist at the hospital.</P>
      <P>I have been informed by the hospital authorities that at present waiting times for routine new appointments at the clinic are approximately four weeks. However, cases classified as urgent are seen at the next clinic in that week. Due to the introduction last year of a computerised appointments system at the breast clinic all patients receive appointment times. While up to 200 patients attended the Friday clinic at the hospital last year, this number has been reduced this year to 160 patients. The average waiting time for patients presenting at the clinic would be approximately one hour, although this can increase depending on the length of consultation time needed to satisfactorily deal with each patient. In addition, the hospital also has a registrar, specialising in breast diseases, in place who carries out a number of clinics on a pilot basis during the week.</P>
      <P>The existing breast clinic at St. Vincent's is due to be upgraded as part of phase 1 of a major capital development programme approved for the hospital. Planning work on this development is now at an advanced stage.</P>
      <P>My Department is very conscious of the importance of early access to symptomatic mammography services and of the provision of an equivalent standard of excellence in both symptomatic and screening mammography services. For this reason, I have requested the National Cancer Forum to undertake a review of symptomatic breast cancer services at national level prior to the commencement of phase I of the national breast screening programme and to report back to my Department as soon as possible in the matter.</P>
      <P>In tandem with this, my Department recently raised the issue of mammography referral practices with the health boards. The Department's key concern is to ensure that all women, irrespective of age or where they live, have timely access to symptomatic services. A critical factor in this regard is referral by GPs to local diagnostic mammography services in the first instance. This should result in a reduction in average waiting times at all mammographic units, thereby improving access for women and at the same time ensuring that expertise levels are maintained and developed in diagnostic units around the country.</P>

      <Quest>the reason there is a two year delay in the South Eastern Health Board area for assessment for adoption purposes; if he will fund extra staff to deal with tracing assessment and bi-monthly reports; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the excessive delay prevents couples from adopting a second child for periods up to two years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 177 and 178 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Adoption services in the South-Eastern Health Board area are provided by SEEK Regional Adoption Services which forms part of the board's community care programme. There are 38 applicants currently on the waiting list for adoption assessment in the South-Eastern Health Board area and the waiting period varies from approximately one year in the South Tipperary area, where there are five applicants on the waiting list, to three years in the Carlow-Kilkenny area where there are 15 applicants on the waiting list. In appointing additional social workers the <Col N="1372" /> board gives priority to its child protection and foster care services in the first instance.</P>
    <P>The South-Eastern Health Board considers it advisable for couples who wish to adopt a second child to wait for at least a year before making a second application for assessment as this allows the first child to settle into the new family and the couple to adjust to their changed circumstances. The second assessment carried out by the board is not as lengthy as the first and the board does not apply an upper age limit on applicants.</P>
    <P>The issues raised by the Deputies are common to a number of health boards at present. As I have stated previously in the House, a consultancy report on the assessment procedures in inter-country adoption was commissioned at my request in order to examine these matters. I received the consultants' report on 28 April 1999 and I will be submitting it to Government in the very near future for a decision on publication and funding. The report contains many recommendations which will have the effect of streamlining and standardising the assessment process thus achieving greater efficiencies and a much higher output of assessments.</P>

      <P>The need for further places for the young chronic sick is part of the overall picture in relation to pressures on acute hospital beds and the service needs of people with severe physical disabilities. This need has been adverted to in the report of the review group on health and personal social services for people with physical and sensory disabilities, Towards an Independent Future, published in December 1996. The Government is committed to the implementation of the report's recommendations as funding becomes available.</P>
      <P>With the exception of one private institution in the Dublin area, there are no specialised residential facilities for people with Alzheimer's disease. Because of the wide range in the effects of the disease, people with Alzheimer's disease avail of a variety of health services, from supports in the community to residential care. I have no proposals before me to develop a specialised unit for people with the disease.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the persistently long queues at the casualty unit at Beaumont Hospital; the reason in this regard; the steps, if any, he is taking to deal with this problem; if he will intervene in the case of a person (details supplied) in Dublin 11 who has had to endure this problem three times in 1999; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The levels of attendance at accident and emergency departments are complex and difficult to predict and in this regard all accident and emergency departments experience periods of exceptional demand which can result in delays for patients. However, it is important to note that appropriate medical treatment is provided at all times and that waiting periods are kept to an absolute minimum.</P>
      <P>In 1998, I made an additional £2.3 million available for the development of accident and emergency services across the acute sector and in 1999, a further sum of £2 million was provided for this purpose. Included in this was the provision of funding to the Eastern Health Board for a national public education campaign aimed at persuading people with minor ailments to attend their family doctor rather than a hospital accident and emergency department, and also the development of a range of initiatives in major accident and emergency departments.</P>
      <P>As part of this overall funding, £200,000 was allocated to Beaumont Hospital in 1998 and a further £200,000 was made available to the hospital in 1999 for accident and emergency improvements. Within this funding, the hospital has undertaken a number of measures to improve systems for dealing with patients attending the accident and emergency department. A 24 hour triage system has been introduced to ensure that patients are seen in order of clinical need rather than in order of attendance. A GP liaison sister has been appointed to ensure a good quality integrated hospital-community service to patients who present in the accident and emergency department.</P>
      <P>I have also published the report of the review group on the waiting list initiative. The report makes a number of recommendations aimed at freeing up acute facilities for more elective work and I am committed to ensuring that its recommended approach is implemented. The report is one of a number of measures which I have taken to address the question of long waiting lists and waiting times. I have provided a total of £20 million for waiting list activity in 1999. This is a 66 per cent increase over the amount provided in 1998 and is two and a half times higher than the sum of £8 million provided by the previous Government in 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have provided extra funding in 1999 of £9 million for services for older people. This funding will help to free up acute hospital beds which are currently occupied by patients who could be accommodated in more appropriate convalescent <Col N="1374" /> or extended care facilities or discharged home if adequate community supports were available. I am confident that the measures I have outlined will contribute to improvements in availability of beds in the acute sector and ease pressures in accident and emergency departments in Dublin.</P>
    <P>With regard to this patient, I have asked the chief executive officer of Beaumont Hospital to investigate the position in this case and, given the particular circumstances, I have requested that he reply to the Deputy directly as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <P>I am conscious of the importance of ensuring an effective, patient friendly approach to arranging the discharge of people who have received treatment in hospital. In the case of older or vulnerable people, I would regard it as standard good practice for hospitals to contact an appropriate relative in advance of the patient's discharge.</P>
      <P>My Department issued a policy circular and guidelines on 7 January 1999 in relation to waiting lists, in which the importance of making proper arrangements for post-hospital care was emphasised to all agencies. This included ensuring that acute hospitals would arrange for the provision of convalescent care for older persons, and for other patients who require it, following discharge from an acute hospital.</P>
      <P>I have allocated a total of £9 million this year to services for older persons to enable acute hospitals to discharge older patients to appropriate step-down and other sub-acute facilities where these are needed.</P>

      <P>Activity at accident and emergency departments in the Dublin area is monitored by the Eastern Health Board's accident and emergency steering group. This group compiles and submits a report to my Department on the activity levels in accident and emergency departments on a weekly basis.</P>
      <P>Considerable financial resources have been provided to eastern region hospitals to enable enhanced accident and emergency services to be provided. I have provided additional funding of £1.65 million this year to enable the hospitals to implement various initiatives aimed at addressing difficulties experienced by accident and emergency departments, particularly during periods of peak demand. These initiatives will include measures to free up beds for emergency admissions through the provision of alternative step-down facilities for patients occupying beds in acute hospitals for lengthy periods. They will allow for the provision of enhanced staffing levels, the development of rapid diagnostic systems for common emergency presentations, continued development of treatment-observation areas in accident and emergency departments and an improved access for general practitioners to urgent specialist opinion.</P>
      <P>Part of the additional funding is also being used to fund a public education campaign aimed at increasing general awareness regarding the appropriate use of accident and emergency Departments with particular emphasis on persuading persons with minor ailments to attend their general practitioner rather than an accident and emergency department in an acute hospital.</P>

      <P>The tax incentive based urban renewal schemes have made a major contribution to the revitalisation and regeneration of inner core areas of Ireland's cities and major towns which for decades had suffered the blight of dereliction and urban decay. Many flagship projects have been developed in the areas designated for urban renewal incentives &ndash; the International Financial Services Centre located in the Custom House Docks area, the development of a cultural quarter in the Temple Bar area and the HARP initiative in the Smithfield area are just some examples. The five county boroughs and over 50 provincial towns have benefited under the three urban renewal schemes.</P>
      <P>A study of the urban renewal schemes, compiled by a team of specially commissioned consultants, led by KPMG, was published in December 1996 &ndash; copies were lodged in the Oireachtas Library. The study analysed investment and concluded that the schemes have been highly successful as a mechanism for leveraging private sector investment into areas of dereliction and decline.</P>
      <P>In architecture/urban design terms and in social terms, the schemes were considered to have had mixed success. The latest urban renewal scheme which commenced on 1 March last is based on a new integrated approach to urban renewal which dealt with issues not only of physical renewal but also addressed issues central to the wider social and economic regeneration of the area.</P>
      <P>I have also announced my intention to introduce a tax incentive based scheme aimed at restoring the built fabric of smaller towns. Detailed guidelines for this scheme will be circulated to county councils in the next few weeks who will then submit renewal plans in accordance with these guidelines. I hope to introduce the new scheme later in the year.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>While average waiting periods have not been compiled for individual test centres due to limi<Col N="1378" /> tations in the IT systems involved, the national average waiting time for a test is now 31 weeks. However, applicants who require a test for urgent reasons are being given early appointments &ndash; about 30 per cent of applicants are tested within 15 weeks. Only 5 per cent of applicants would have to wait longer than 56 weeks, while less than 10 per cent would have to wait between 51 and 55 weeks.</P>
    <P>With the increased resources now being made available to the driver testing service, improvements in waiting times are beginning to be realised in most test centres. The task now is to continue and accelerate this process, and to extend its benefits to the Dublin area where waiting times remain particularly high.</P>

      <P>The free travel scheme is available to all people living in the State aged 66 years, or over, as well as certain people with disabilities under that age who are in receipt of certain social welfare type payments. It is also available to carers in receipt of carer's allowance and since last April, free travel will be available to carers of people in receipt of a constant attendance allowance or prescribed relatives allowance. The scheme provides free travel, primarily at off-peak periods, to eligible people on the main public and private transport services. The full year cost of the free travel scheme for 1999 is approximately £34.5 million and at the end of March 1999, over 537,000 free travel passes had been issued.</P>
      <P>Time restrictions have been a feature of the free travel scheme since its inception. They do not, however, apply in the case of mentally-handicapped people, people attending long-term rehabilitation courses or certain work experience programmes and certain other disabled or blind people. These people are issued with an unrestricted free travel pass which enables them to travel during the normally restricted travel times. Geographical location is not a factor taken into account in establishing time restrictions.</P>
      <P>The central issue in regard to time restrictions relates to capacity constraints. Where restrictions apply it is at the request of the transport companies because the transport system is under severe pressure from commuters travelling to and from work and school in the morning and evening. There are no peak time travel restrictions on DART, suburban rail services, and on services provided by private transport operators in other parts of the country. The free schemes were originally designed to benefit mainly older people in receipt of a social welfare type payment who were living alone and required additional assistance. However, over the years, additional categories of people have been included. A fundamental review of the free schemes, including the free travel scheme, has commenced to assess whether the objectives of these schemes are being achieved in the most effective and efficient manner. The time restrictions which apply in some areas will be examined as part of this review process.</P>

      <P>Child dependant allowances are payable to recipients of social welfare payments in respect of all children up to the age of 18 years. Where a claimant is in receipt of a long-term social welfare payment, child depend<Col N="1385" /> ant allowances are payable where children are in full-time education up to the age of 22 years, or up to the end of the academic year after the 22nd birthday. However, those receiving short-term unemployment assistance, unemployment benefit or other short-term payments do not receive child dependant allowance for children over 18 years. This differentiation is in recognition of the fact that families with children on long-term payments face a higher risk of poverty.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that, in the area of income support for children, available resources have in recent years been channelled towards providing substantial improvements in child benefit. This represents one of the most effective means of tackling poverty, as it channels resources directly to families most in need. Child benefit is of particular importance to families on low incomes as it is not taxable, is not withdrawn when an unemployed parent takes up employment and is not assessed as means for other secondary benefits such as differential rents, medical cards, etc. Therefore, it does not act as a disincentive to taking up employment or improving wages.</P>
      <P>Further enhancements of the system of income support for children are a matter for consideration in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>Staff officer is a promotion grade. There are two methods of promotion, direct internal promotion within the Department and assignment by the Civil Service Commission from an interdepartmental panel. In accordance with arrangements agreed with the staff side at general council, there is a series to be followed between internal promotions and assignments from the interdepartmental panel. One in every four appointments to staff officer in individual locations in the Department, including Sligo, falls to be made from the Civil Service Commission interdepartmental panel, set up on the basis of a competitive process. The other three appointments are made by direct promotion within the Department, based on seniority and suitability and taking account of location preferences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, in a situation where the Civil Service Commission is not in a position to make an assignment for a particular location, for example, <Col N="1386" /> where the panel for that location is exhausted, the normal practice is to fill the vacancy by direct internal promotion, thus incurring a liability to the interdepartmental panel which must be met at the earliest opportunity.</P>
    <P>The most recent interdepartmental confined competition for promotion to staff officer was announced in July 1997 for which individual Departments held preliminary interviews from which candidates were selected to go forward to central interviews, which were held in 1998.</P>
    <P>In the period before the results of the competition became available a number of vacancies arising at staff officer level in Sligo, which would have been due to the interdepartmental panel in order to maintain the series, were in fact filled by direct internal promotion pending the setting up of the interdepartmental panel, thus incurring debts to the panel. This accounts for the fact that a number of the most recent vacancies at staff officer level in Sligo have been filled by assignment from the interdepartmental panel. While a number of clerical officers have been appointed from that panel, only those assigned to this Department's Sligo offices reckon for the series maintained for that location. Future vacancies at staff officer level will continue to be filled in accordance with these arrangements.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 212 and 216 together.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the students summer jobs scheme is to provide income support during the summer holiday period for less well-off third level students who are disqualified from receiving unemployment assistance and who are unable to obtain summer work. This year's scheme, which was advertised extensively, will operate from 1 June 1999 to 31 August 1999. Students will be allowed to undertake 200 hours work at £3 per hour. The closing date for applications is 25 June 1999. Some 9,700 applications from students have been received to date and each applicant is notified individually as to the outcome of their application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The wider availability of summer jobs in other areas in recent years has meant that there is less <Col N="1387" /> recourse to the scheme and this trend is likely to continue. In the case of primary schools recourse to the scheme has tended to be during July and August when schools are closed. It is not intended to extend the scheme to cover the month of September in the improved environment for summer work generally.</P>

      <P>The terms of reference for the review are to: examine the rationale for benefit-in-kind schemes; establish the correct charging mechanism for the services provided; identify the objectives of the free schemes; evaluate the extent to which those objectives have been achieved and remain valid; comment on how effectively and efficiently the free schemes have achieved their objectives; evaluate the extent to which the objectives warrant the allocation of public resources and if so, whether the current allocation is appropriate; examine the scope for alternative policy arrangements; and specify suitable performance indicators which can be used to monitor and evaluate these schemes in the future.</P>
      <P>The research conducted will be published in the &ldquo;Trinity Studies in Public Policy&rdquo; series. It is expected that the review will be published by the Policy Institute in October/November 1999.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that regulations were introduced in November 1997 to provide for the tapered withdrawal of the qualified adult allowance for people claiming unemployment benefit, unemployment assistance, disability benefit, disability allowance, pre-retirement allowance, injury benefit and unemployability supplement. Prior to the introduction of those regulations, the qualified adult allowance was withdrawn completely once the income of the <Col N="1388" /> spouse or partner of the social welfare claimant exceeded £60 per week. This measure represented the first step towards alleviating the poverty trap associated with the previous arrangements.</P>
      <P>Under the revised arrangements, where the spouse or partner is earning between £60 and £90, a reduced rate qualified adult allowance continues to be payable. In the 1999 budget, provision has been made to extend the upper limit of the income range from £90 to £105, in order to further enhance the incentive for people to avail of employment opportunities. Notwithstanding these improvements, I am aware that in some very unusual cases, such as that described by the Deputy, the poverty trap still exists. I will be considering the scope for introducing further improvements to the tapering arrangements in the context of the next budget, having regard to the resources available and in the light of other priorities.</P>

      <Quest>the reason his Department has not acknowledged or processed a claim for a non-contributory old age pension in November 1998 by a person (details supplied) in County Meath; if he will ensure that this person's entitlements are granted without further delay; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>When a claim for pension is received by the Department it is standard practice to acknowledge the claim in all cases, immediately following claim registration on the Department's computer system. In the case of old age non-contributory pensions, the standard acknowledgement informs applicants that their claims have been received and registered and forwarded to the relevant local officer who will be in contact in due course.</P>
      <P>The person concerned applied for a pension in November 1998 and was visited in her home by a social welfare inspector in February 1999. During the course of the interview the inspector was informed that the applicant owned land but that she was uncertain of the extent of her ownership or involvement in the farm business. It appears that other family members are also involved in this business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Due to the lack of clarity relating to the farm, inquiries were made by the inspector with the Land Registry. The inspector considered that in the light of this a further interview with the person concerned was required. The inspector tried repeatedly to contact the applicant to arrange for an interview but without success. Finally she succeeded in contacting the applicant's son and arranged through him to obtain the information required to process the claim. The necessary inquiries have now been completed and, as soon as the report on the investigations is received a <Col N="1389" /> decision will be made on the claim and the person concerned will be informed of the outcome.</P>
    <P>The Department makes every effort to process claims as quickly as possible, with due regard to the need to obtain the fullest information in any case.</P>

      <P>The free telephone rental allowance is aimed mainly at people over 66 years age and at those under that age who suffer from disabilities. In order to qualify for the allowance an applicant must be in receipt of a particular social welfare payment and be living alone or with someone who would not be able to summon help in the event of an emergency. The purpose of the allowance is to provide an element of protection and security for older and disabled people in their homes by ensuring that they are in a position to summon help in the event of an accident or an emergency in the home.</P>
      <P>A fundamental review of the free schemes, including the free telephone rental allowance scheme, has commenced to assess whether the objectives of these schemes are being achieved in the most effective and efficient manner. The review, will examine, <i>inter alia</i>, the question of extending the allowance to cover mobile phones. Any extension of the current arrangements could only be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the pro<Col N="1390" /> posal to establish an archive at Kilkenny Castle. In 1996 my Department conveyed its agreement to the provision of the archive in the parade wing of the castle, subject to compliance with certain conditions, one of which was a contribution of £50,000. In this regard, I have to inform the Deputy that the amount of the contribution was kept to an artificially low level in the interest of facilitating the promoters and is very much a nominal figure.</P>
      <P>I am advised that formal commitment to the conditions laid down by my Department was to be received by 1 January 1997 at the latest and that the contribution of £50,000 was to be received by 1 January 1998 at the latest. These deadlines were not met by the promoters and my Department was lenient in extending the deadlines. However, in May 1998, it had to advise the promoters that the deadline could not be extended indefinitely and that a conclusion had to be reached in the matter given that the scheme for the restoration of the south tower and parade wing of Kilkenny Castle was commencing in June 1998.</P>
      <P>The restoration works commenced in June 1998 and are due for completion this autumn. On the basis of the responses received from the promoters, my Department had to conclude that they were not in a position to comply with the conditions, to which they had agreed as far back as 1996.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware the substantial contribution made by local authorities and business interests to the current programme of works at Kilkenny Castle relates solely to the provision of a multi functional facility for cultural and other purposes, whereas the archive proposal is a totally separate issue. My Department is, of course, willing to review the matter even at this late stage subject to compliance in full with the criteria discussed and agreed with the promoters at the outset, provided the local authority who have a statutory function as regards archives accede to their request.</P>

This means that if the present trend continues crime will have fallen by 25 per cent since the Government came to office by the end of this year. This is continued evidence that the Government is delivering on its commitments and that its policies are working. The 1998 crime figures were the second lowest since 1987 and if the trend set by the first quarter of 1999 continues then 1999 <Col N="1394" /> could see the national total dropping below 80,000 crimes which would be very significant as it would be the first time this happened for almost 20 years.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to note that this downward trend can be observed across a wide range of crimes. To choose some examples for 1998 burglary, aggravated burglary with firearms, robbery with firearms and robbery as a group of offences dropped by almost 9 per cent. I am also pleased to say that larceny from the person is down by 16 per cent and larceny from vehicles is also down by 8 per cent. I am sure the Deputy will join me in congratulating the Garda Commissioner and the Force for once again increasing the detection rate, which at 44 per cent represents a 1 per cent increase on last year. This is a high figure by international standards, and is evidence of the professionalism and dedication of the Garda.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government, in line with the commitment given in the joint programme, An Action Plan for the Millennium, decided in November 1997 to initiate a tender procedure to invite proposals for a national 50 metre swimming pool. The tender procedure is being conducted in accordance with EU Council Directive 93/37/EEC, concerning the co-ordination of procedures for the award of public works contracts. A project team was established by the Department to assist with the preparation of invitation to tender documentation and to oversee the tendering process. This team comprises representatives of a number of Departments and other organisations.</P>
      <P>The tender procedure notice for the project was published in the Official Journal of the European Communities and in the Irish media in January 1998, and was open to both the public and private sectors. Developers were requested to come forward with proposals for the design, construction, financing and management of a 50 metre swimming pool, capable of meeting the training requirements of Ireland's high-performance swimmers for international competition. Such developers were required to demonstrate that they had the necessary financial status, technical knowledge and experience to undertake the development.</P>
      <P>The Government have agreed to provide capital assistance, up to a maximum of £6 million, and annual operational assistance up to a maximum of £250,000, for a maximum period of 20 years, towards the cost of implementation of the successful tender. The deadline for submission of full tenders from qualified candidates was 27 November 1998, and three tender proposals were received on that date. Two tender proposals, one with a location in Dublin and the other in Limerick, were deemed by the project team on the advice of independent professional consultants, to have met the qualification criteria and these proposals have proceeded to the evaluation and assessment phase of the project. The third tenderer was disqualified on the basis of its ineligibility in terms of its compatibility with a fundamental element of the tender framework: the capital grant limits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 18 January 1999 the third tenderer applied for and was given leave by the High Court to seek to have its disqualification set aside and its tender considered. After several adjournments, this case was heard in the High Court between 12 and 14 May last, with judgment being reserved. Meanwhile, the detailed evaluation of the two remaining tenders is well advanced, but effectively <Col N="1396" /> stalled pending the outcome of the High Court proceedings. The evaluation is being undertaken by an independent multi-disciplinary consultancy team which will produce a full technical assessment and evaluation report for the project team. The team will then report its findings and recommendations, following which I will present a memorandum to the Government on the matter. I am not in a position, however, to give a timetable for the final decision and public announcement until the High Court's decision is made known.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 253 and 254 together.</P>
      <P>For infant classes in primary schools, the main emphasis in Curaclam na Bunscoile is on the teaching of spoken Irish. It is recommended that only an informal approach to the development of pre-reading skills in Irish be attempted with these classes. When pupils enter first class, if their mastery of spoken Irish and their reading skills in English are sufficiently advanced, they are introduced to formal reading in Irish. Writing in Irish is introduced when the pupils are ready, after they have made a reasonable amount of progress in Irish reading and their writing skills in English are sufficiently developed. This generally happens during their year in first class but sometimes not until they have reached second class.</P>
      <P>Irish writing is closely based on the material being read by the pupils. Teachers are advised that they should give as much assistance as pupils may need with the spelling of the Irish words which the pupils need for their writing. Words taken from the reading book, work-book, wall charts, word-lists or simple dictionaries are suggested. A more formal approach to the learning of Irish spellings is postponed until pupils have at least reached third class. By the time pupils have completed the sixth class programme, they are expected to be able to spell from memory the majority of the Irish words more commonly used in their writing.</P>
      <P>The policy of the Department is that which is set down in Curaclam na Bunscoile. All schools are required to base their work closely on this, while making due allowances for individual differences in ability and attainment among pupils. In the revised Curaclam na Bunscoile, 1999, shortly to be implemented in schools, it is recommended that formal reading in Irish should be postponed until pupils reach second class. This will mean that the introduction of Irish writing and spelling will also be postponed by a further year.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the demands for increased funding by voluntary secondary schools. There are also demands for increased funding in the other sectors of education, as well as demands for increased spending on other public expenditure programmes. Notwithstanding the many competing demands on budgetary resources, the levels of support for voluntary secondary schools have been increased since 1997. The standard <i>per capita</i> grant payable to voluntary secondary schools has been increased to £184 from £177 and assistance towards the provision of secretarial services in schools has been increased from £25 per pupil to £30 per pupil, thereby increasing the maximum annual grant from £8,750 to £10,500 per eligible school. In addition, these schools have benefited under the IT 2000 initiative and the school library books initiative. Schools have welcomed these improvements. It is my intention to improve further the financial position of second-level schools to the extent that the availability of resources permits.</P>

      <P>One of the psychologists employed by my Department provides a psychological service to all second level schools in County Donegal. As <Col N="1416" /> yet, my Department does not provide a psychological service to primary schools in the county.</P>
      <P>However, expansion of the psychological service of my Department has now begun. The Department of Finance has given sanction for the Civil Service Commission to advertise for additional psychologists and the advertisements were placed during May. It is intended to appoint 25 psychologists during 1999. The implementation plan for the new National Educational Psychological Service Agency provides for the appointment of additional psychologists during the year 2000. It is envisaged that all schools will have access to the psychological service at the end of a five-year period, and it is hoped that there will be the nucleus of a psychological service in every county by the end of 1999.</P>
      <P>Decisions on the assignments of the additional psychologists will be made later in the year. Priority for the expansion of the psychological service will be given to those areas with a high incidence of educational disadvantage and with little access to other psychological services. My Department is, therefore, currently examining the needs and resources in all areas, including County Donegal, in order to set priorities.</P>
