      <P>The Government announced on 13 October last that it had agreed to commission a feasibility study for the development of a stadium for the new century. The concept for the stadium involves a design and quality that will make an inspirational statement about Ireland and its people as we enter the new century.</P>
      <P>A consortium of consultants led by Price Waterhouse Coopers has been appointed to conduct the feasibility study. The study, which will be completed by mid-September, will assess the likely demand for and benefit of a major new sports stadium seating up to 80,000 people and catering for a wide range of sports and entertainment events.</P>
      <P>I am delighted that we are getting this feasibility study under way. As we move into a new century, and at a time of improved economic prosperity, it is right that world class sports and entertainment facilities are available to our citizens. The nature of this high prestige initiative is such that it will require cross-departmental and cross-organisational co-ordination and my Department is best placed to do that. A significant time commitment is involved and the official who acts as secretary of the stadium steering committee has undertaken this task in addition to his normal duties. In addition to the administrative costs arising from the work of the steering committee, the main cost to my Department will be that of the feasibility study, which will be IR£380,033 or 485,542 euros.</P>

      <P>Given that Croke Park is being developed with public and private funds and the <Col N="1214" /> FAI is going to develop another national stadium at Newlands Cross without the aid of public funds, what is the need for a third national stadium?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The feasibility study will show whether there is a requirement. Deputy Bruton knows that Croke Park is for one sport. It has neither indoor capacity, training areas or warm-up facilities, nor does its overall plan envisage such features. The model which the FAI has shown me concentrates on the concert area and its proposal has not yet been brought to completion. Unfortunately, we have no major stadium to compare with those elsewhere in the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that the two most popular field sports, Gaelic games and soccer, both have a national stadium either in place or at an advanced stage of planning, what major sports does the Taoiseach expect to use this third stadium, on which he has already spent almost £500,000 in consultation fees?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be a fine stadium but it is only for one sport. It does not even have a running track.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen the costings of the FAI proposal. When the association met me it mentioned its difficulties in raising the money but I hope it can do so. It is encountering those difficulties because its estimate of £45 million for the construction of the stadium represents only the basic cost. I understand the capacity of the stadium will be approximately 35,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be 40,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not have a national stadium. For many years we have used Santry Stadium, Tolka Park and Dalymount Park, but none of these venues is suitable for national events. Having played rugby, Deputy Bruton will be aware that the IRFU is also experiencing major difficulties.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Since his proposal predated that of the FAI and given that he has had meetings with that organisation, does the Taoiseach envisage that public funds will be made available to the FAI to bring its Newlands Cross proposal to fruition? With regard to his inspirational statement for the new century, when is it proposed to begin construction at Newlands Cross?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The feasibility study is due to be completed on 18 September. I had a meeting with representatives of the FAI some time ago and we agreed to keep in touch. There is not much point in having further meetings until the feasibility study is completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Is funding being made available by the Government in respect of the FAI proposal? Is such funding contingent on whether, in light of the completion of the Government's feasibility study, there is a need for a third stadium? In other words, will no money be made available to the FAI if a third stadium is to be constructed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We will wait until the feasibility study is completed before making a decision in respect of the FAI proposal. I believe the FAI will seek funding, on a <i>pro rata</i> basis, in line with that given to the GAA for the development of Croke Park. However, the FAI is not seeking money in respect of its current proposal which deals only with basic costs and does not refer to ancillary facilities. I have seen different reports in the newspapers regarding the cost of such facilities and the FAI provided me with its estimate of the costs involved. However, it is the responsibility of that organisation to place that figure in the public domain. The proposal only contains plans for the basic stadium structure, the pitch and the roll-in centre. It would cost substantially more for the organisation to build the kind of stadium it desires.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach is misinformed if he believes the FAI proposal concerns only a basic structure &ndash; it involves the construction of an ultra-modern, state of the art, building, the prototype of which is in Holland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is only one other of its kind in Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that it is wrong to spend £400,000 on a feasibility study when organisations throughout the country are crying out for resources to develop basic facilities? In light of the GAA's rights as the owner of Croke Park, did the Taoiseach engage in discussions with that organisation regarding the <Col N="1216" /> possible multi-functional use of Croke Park? Surely this possibility should have been explored before any commitments were given because time, effort and resources would have been saved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy served in a ministerial capacity in this area and he is aware that ten years ago I, among others, tried to convince the three major sporting bodies to go down that road&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>They never gave me &ldquo;no&rdquo; for an answer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not invest £20 million unconditionally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a pathetic response. Obviously the Taoiseach is under pressure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Nothing was done for the FAI, the GAA, the IRFU or the national athletics body. At least we will have a good GAA stadium.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked a serious question and I would like a serious answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The serious answer is that far more money than ever before is being invested in sport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Was it explored before the money was spent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It was considered, explored and rejected many times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Why do we need to spend £380,000 to find out these things? If the Taoiseach knows as much as he says he does, surely he could find these answers without giving £380,000 to a firm of accountants. Is there a fixation in Government on the need to have somebody with an important sounding name under the guise of a consultant to tell it what it knows already? What is the point of spending £380,000 on this feasibility study? Is it not the case that the information is available, that the obstacles are political &ndash; not party-political &ndash; in an organisational sense and that this feasibility study will not throw any light on whether the GAA is willing to change its mind because it does not have the competence to do so? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The work of the feasibility study consists of examining the financial and procurement arrangements of building a national stadium. We must take account of what already exists, what is needed, the cost and how it would develop and be used. All those matters have to <Col N="1217" /> be worked out. A proper study on a national stadium has not been undertaken since the foundation of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach confirm that money will not be available to the FAI for its project until the feasibility study is completed? Has it asked for money to date? What is the Government's attitude to it? Regarding the proposal for a third stadium, or the Taoiseach's inspirational statement for the new century proposal, have moneys been committed from any individual that would form the bedrock of funding for that proposal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The FAI's proposal was received after the Government's announcement. The FAI is continuing to develop its proposal. It has not sought any money. I understand it will not require money for the first phase, the basic stadium, but it will require money if work is advanced in line with its model and plans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If the State were not to go ahead with that, it would probably be entitled to argue it should get the same percentage input as other sports, mainly the GAA, have got. That is the case it has put forward and, if that were the case, it should be considered. What was the Deputy's other question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that raising money for the FAI project, in terms of the money being made available, will depend on whether it assumes the third stadium will go ahead? Obviously, the three stadia would compete with one another for a limited number for mobile events. Is the Taoiseach's feasibility study <Col N="1218" /> based on an assumption that the FAI is or is not going ahead with its project? Will he accept that if it assumes it is going ahead, that will reduce the amount of business that will be available for the national stadium and <i>vice versa?</i> Will the Taoiseach agree it would have been better to undertake a study which included the FAI rather than have independent studies carried out?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to interfere with the consultants in this matter, but they will probably have to consider it both ways. It might be their view that if we were to have a soccer stadium and a Gaelic stadium, there would not be room for another one. That might well be their view. Traditionally, the FAI was anxious to work with other sporting bodies, including the IRFU. The FAI worked for a long time on the proposal for the Phoenix Park racecourse. It came in several months after the Government announced its proposal and I asked the FAI about that. Because so much time has been lost on this matter over the years and there has been so much inaction, the FAI had not been able to reach agreement with other bodies and so it wanted to move forward. My personal view is that if all the sports were acting together it would be far better, but that is not easy to achieve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>If this new proposed stadium is not linked to any particular sport, what type of management does the Taoiseach envisage it will have? Who will be responsible for its year to year running and who would pick up the tab if there was a deficit? I think the Taoiseach will agree, from his own experience, it is better to have a linkage with particular sports organisations which can organise and manage such things as stadia.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with that and they are precisely the kind of people who are involved in this consortium. We will work all that out. All domestic and international sports &ndash; including the GAA, the FAI, the IRFU and athletics &ndash; are represented on the committee to make sure all those matters are examined. The issue has to be thought out properly by experts who know the business and who will provide a truthful assessment of whether it can be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that the site selected by the FAI is an excellent one? Does he also agree that no feasibility study is necessary to establish what is the conventional wisdom, that a city with one million people does not require three national stadia? Would it not be better to spend £40, £50, £60 or £70 million on the provision of badly needed facilities along the lines the Minister of State, Deputy Flood, announced on a smaller scale yesterday?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a national stadium for 3.8 million people and, hopefully, over the next 20 years, more than four million. It is not for Dublin alone. We will see from the results of the study <Col N="1219" /> whether it stands up. That is the benefit of undertaking such a study. As regards the use of stadia nowadays, we increasingly see Croke Park being used from the period Easter to September. While I know there is a museum and other facilities there, effectively, the pitch it is not used at other times. Wembley and other stadia tend to be used for many different purposes. That is what we should be trying to do in this country.</P>

      <QRef>[9580/99]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 and 5 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the strategic management initiative sets out a wide ranging programme for change in the Civil Service. It is based on a number of key elements including regulatory reform, financial management changes and changes in information technology. Working groups were established in respect of those issues and those groups have now reported. Their recommendations have been considered by the implementation group which is responsible for developing an integrated programme of change.</P>
      <P>The report of the working group on regulatory reform has now been considered by the implementation group, which has set out a programme of action to help ensure that the level of regulation in the economy is appropriate. A draft memorandum for Government setting out the detailed proposals in this area has been prepared and circulated to Government Departments. Their observations have now been received and I am currently finalising detailed proposals which I expect to be able to put to my colleagues in Government for decision in the near future.</P>
      <P>Changes to our financial management systems are an important part of the overall SMI process. The recommendations of the financial management working group were considered by the implementation group at its meeting in March. The implementation group is preparing a report for Government, setting out a programme of action to put in place improved financial management systems. I envisage Government consideration shortly. As I indicated in my reply to questions on 16 December last, changes have already been introduced in the multi-annual budgeting and administrative budget aspects of financial management.</P>
      <P>A number of the recommendations in the SMI working group report on information technology have already been taken up in the work of the interdepartmental implementation group on the information society. The action plan on implementing the information society has now been adopted and implementation of that plan will result in progress being made on a number of the issues identified in the SMI working group report, principally in relation to quality service delivery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1222" /> In addition, the IT working group report contains a number of recommendations on the acquisition and retention of skilled IT staff. In December 1998 the Department of Finance reached agreement with the unions on a set of once-off exceptional measures to retain skilled IT staff engaged in Year 2000 work until that work is completed. This includes scope for reassignment of suitable administrative staff to IT work and, where it is deemed appropriate, payment of a loyalty bonus in April 2000 to skilled IT staff.</P>
    <P>The remaining recommendations will be considered by the implementation group in May. They relate primarily to management and financial issues and need to be integrated with the other programmes of action under SMI. I expect that the report of the implementation group will be submitted to Government shortly thereafter.</P>
    <P>With regard to Deputy Bruton's question about cross-departmental issues involving the use of section 12 of the Public Service Management Act, 1997, orders have not so far been made under this section. As the Deputy will be aware from my reply to a similar question on 8 December last, the purpose of section 12 of the Act is to provide, as necessary, for the assignment by Ministers or Ministers of State of responsibility to civil servants for cross-departmental issues and the associated accountability arrangements. The Act also requires, under section 4, that the heads of Departments and offices ensure that appropriate arrangements are put in place to facilitate an effective response to these issues. Ministers are aware of these provisions to which I have previously drawn their attention.</P>
    <P>Issues of policy cross departmental boundaries and there is a need to identify new ways of managing such issues more effectively in the future. Already some experiments in cross-departmental boundaries have been undertaken, including the drugs strategy team and the cross-departmental team on SMI. The departmental strategy statements approved by Ministers last year and laid before the House set out the foundations for future work in this area. The SMI implementation group is considering appropriate approaches to cross-departmental issues in the light of the experiences being gained. I expect that such consideration will address the use of section 12 of the 1997 Act as a means of underpinning progress on these matters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that it is disappointing, despite the work done passing the Act, that two years after its passing, the public service has not made use of the legislative powers given to it in section 12 to provide for a structure of co-operation between Departments? Does he regard this as a failure on the part of the public administration to use means given to it by this House to address a genuine problem of cross-departmental functioning? It is well known to anyone who has served in Government that getting Departments to co-operate is one of the greatest difficulties of government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1223" />
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very important area. The Act giving the legal basis for the assignment did not come into effect until September 1997. Since then the SMI, in conjunction with Departments, have been identifying areas for co-operation and some pilot work has been done, for example the establishment of the drugs strategy team. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has also done some work on drafting legislation to establish a regulatory framework for the private security industry. Other Departments have done similar work. In its report of 1998, the implementation group identified the areas for cross-departmental co-operation. It is important that this should be done. The officials and committees involved are working their way through the process. The sooner it is done the better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the public service not ignoring the Oireachtas? The Oireachtas passed legislation to give Departments the legal power to co-operate with each other but departmental empires are still being presrved and public servants are refusing to use the legislation. Does the Taoiseach agree that he should intervene in this matter? He should convene a meeting of Secretaries General and ask them, one by one, why they have not used section 12 to deal with known areas of lack of co-ordination between Departments. The Taoiseach could list those areas without difficulty, as could anyone who has served in Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The public service is not ignoring the Oireachtas. The officials involved in SMI have put a great effort into the process, in addition to their other work. It would be unfair to say otherwise. Some experimentation has already been done. Cross-departmental teams have been set up in a number of areas and these has been successful. Last year, the implementation group asked Departments to identify areas where they could use cross-departmental strategies and ways to do so. The group has worked on the development of strategic results areas and has put a framework for that in place. The implementation group is anxious that the Departments operate the system and it is now necessary that they do so but they have already done a great deal of work. Establishing a legal base was one step in the process. Areas where the process could be implemented had to be identified, pilot schemes initiated and a framework for the process constructed. These things have been done.</P>
      <P>Section 4 of the Act places the responsibility on Secretaries General to ensure that appropriate arrangements are in place to facilitate an effective response to cross-departmental issues. Deputy Bruton is right in saying that. Areas for co-operation within Departments and across Departments have been identified. The Act must now be implemented. Much work had to be done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that it is a characteristic response of a Secretary Gen<Col N="1224" /> eral to say that action is impossible because delays in the parliamentary draftsman's office are holding up legislation? In this case, legislation was passed two years ago, giving Departments the power to do something which will achieve what everyone knows is necessary &ndash; structured co-operation between Departments. Two years after this House and the parliamentary draftsmen worked extremely hard to have legislation enacted, it has not been used once. Does the Taoiseach regard that as a clear failure on the part of the public administration to use powers given by the Oireachtas for a real purpose?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In the 18 months since the Act was introduced the framework has been put in place by the implementation group. The Oireachtas was not in a position to do this. The arrangements have worked well in the pilot areas. There is a legal requirement to use the powers and I expect them to be used more to deal with what is a big issue. It is a new departure across the Civil Service. It was done on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis but it did not work well. With political and Civil Service leadership, the various organisations will work together to change financial accountability arrangements. This has taken some time to organise. Let us see how it works.</P>

      <P>The National Economic and Social Council has been asked to prepare a new strategy report which will form the basis for a successor to Partnership 2000. Work on that report is well advanced and is likely to be completed before this summer. It is envisaged at this stage that substantive negotiations on a new partnership agreement will get under way towards the end of the year, probably September or October.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Department of Finance and other public service employer organisations are continuing their discussions with the public services committee of ICTU. The key aims of these discussions are to explore the position on public service pay policy and to devise a new approach to determine public service pay in the period following Partnership 2000.</P>
      <P>As regards the prospects for a successful outcome to negotiations on a new agreement, all the social partners share a firm belief in the enormous contribution which social partnership has made to the transformation of the economy. Against that background, there is every reason to be confident that negotiations on a successor to Partnership 2000 will yield a positive outcome.</P>
      <P>On the issue of representation in those negotiations, no application of the precise type inquired about has been received.</P>
      <P>In response to Deputy John Bruton's question, a plenary meeting of Partnership 2000 is taking place this morning. The main themes for discussion are modernising the public service, enterprise, jobs and small business. The next meeting, which I will chair in accordance will paragraph 11.7 of the agreement, will take place on 27 July and the main theme will be social inclusion and equality.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree our economic success is somewhat at risk in light of some of the extravagant demands being made? I refer, in particular, to the scaffolding workers' demand for a 200 per cent increase. Some extravagant demands are being made which could entirely derail our process of economic growth. Does the Taoiseach agree there is need to have <Col N="1228" /> discussions with the trade union movement on how best to deal with this situation, particularly in the case of unofficial disputes?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Unofficial disputes are always the most difficult and cause great difficulty for the economy. While it would not be appropriate for me to comment on the specifics of any particular dispute, I urge the scaffolders' representatives and those of the construction industry employers to engage with the labour relations machinery of the State as a matter of urgency to try to resolve this matter. The resolution of this or any other dispute can only be achieved through dialogue and negotiation. I am confident that, with the determination of both sides, a satisfactory outcome can be achieved.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Bruton's comments; there is no doubt that a major industrial dispute in the construction industry affects output, investment and the perception of our ability to perform properly and deliver on target &ndash; something we have been doing successfully. It would be very damaging to all sectors if the perception developed that any one area of industry was not performing properly. I hope those involved in this case can see the bigger picture.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach be more specific about what he had in mind when he informed the IMI conference that the prospect of a succeeding agreement to Partnership 2000 would be put at risk by what he called &ldquo;ridiculous demands&ldquo;? Will he outline some instances of such demands?</P>
      <P>On the scaffolding dispute, was the Taoiseach aware that one of the parties to the review &ndash; the CIF &ndash; announced last night that it would raise the dispute in the context of this morning's discussions with the review committee? What is the Government's position on that issue? Does the Taoiseach accept that in an industry which is booming, other grades, particularly the craft grades, used the local bargaining clause and won some concessions as a result? Does he accept, without commenting in any way on the actual claim as phrased, that scaffolders have a real grievance and that a facility should be available to them, through the normal industrial relations machinery, to negotiate on it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not go into the specifics of this dispute. I have said I hope it can be resolved through dialogue and negotiation using the State's industrial relations machinery. That is the only way by which these matters can be resolved.</P>
      <P>On the issue of a reply I gave during a question and answer session at the IMI conference, I was referring to cases where demands for 100, 150, 200 or 250 per cent increases are made. No economy could sustain those. I was not referring to any particular case but I am sure the Deputy is familiar with the kind of people who have talked about such claims.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>Compliance with and enforcement of the provisions of the Litter Pollution Act, 1997 are matters for each local authority. With the co-operation of local authorities I am taking steps to ensure transparency in the operation of the Act at local level by improving the statistical information on enforcement made available to my Department by local authorities and introducing a new independent mechanism to monitor litter pollution and local authority action under the Litter Pollution Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to enforcement, details of the individual local authority returns for the first half of 1998 and for 1997 are available in the Oireachtas Library. They reveal a significant increase in the numbers of litter wardens employed, prosecutions taken and on-the-spot fines imposed. Much more needs to be done. The figures for the second half of 1998 are currently being compiled and will be placed in the Library as soon as they are available. I have increased the frequency of these returns from an annual to a six monthly basis. In future, local authorities will also be <Col N="1231" /> asked to provide details of expenditure on litter pollution control and income from enforcement. This will assist in developing an accurate picture of the true cost to society of the irresponsible behaviour which the majority of us deplore.</P>
    <P>I will shortly award a contract for the provision of a national litter pollution monitoring system to monitor and assess local authority litter management and enforcement action. The system will be overseen by a steering group representative of local authorities and my Department. I regard this as a very significant development in bringing greater transparency to the work of local authorities and assisting them in identifying models of good practice and innovative strategies to combat litter pollution. A key feature of the system will be the review of the litter management plans which local authorities are required to adopt under the Litter Pollution Act. These plans provide a crucial mechanism within which each local authority can identify the scale and nature of its litter pollution problem and set out responses tailored to local circumstances. The independent review of these plans will assist local authorities in making them as relevant, focused and effective as possible. In addition, the independent litter monitoring aspect of the new system will assist local authorities in identifying and targeting action at particular litter black spots.</P>
    <P>While improved performance generally can be attributed to the flexible and extensive powers available to local authorities under the 1997 Act, there is a continuing need for more responsible behaviour by the public as well as rigorous enforcement of the law by local authorities. For this reason, my initiatives in support of litter pollution control address public education and awareness as well as performance on the enforcement of the Litter Pollution Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>How many local authorities have adopted a litter management plan? How many are implementing a litter management plan and how many employ litter wardens?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>The vast majority of local authorities have submitted and adopted litter management plans and have put them before their councils. I am certainly not satisfied with the approach to the unnecessary and expensive scourge of litter. It is unacceptable that in excess of £20 million per annum has to be spent by local authorities in combating litter. Litter is created at local level and must be resolved at local level. Some local authorities are very pro-active, although there is a lack of uniformity. I am endeavouring to ensure all local authorities carry out their function under the Litter Management Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been an improvement. In 1998, 199 litter wardens were employed, an increase from 131 in the first six months of 1997. We are making progress, but much more must be done. I am endeavouring at every opportunity to ensure <Col N="1232" /> local authorities carry out their function and enforce the law where necessary.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to An Taisce which has worked very closely with the Department of the Environment and Local Government and the private sector. National spring clean, which has been a tremendous success, is taking place this month. There are in excess of 1,500 projects throughout the country with community groups at local level working with local authorities in cleaning up areas. I and the Minister have travelled around the country and attended many such projects. It is very encouraging to see people participating at local level in such projects.</P>
    <P>The issue is about enforcement, awareness and information. We are working very closely with the Department of Education and Science. ENFO, the information section of the Department of the Environment and Local Government, is regularly in contact with the Department of Education and Science about sending literature to schools throughout the country.</P>
    <P>We are making progress, but have a long way to go. A culture cannot be changed overnight, but by working together we can make an impact. It is unsatisfactory that people repeatedly complain about litter. Tourists complain and say they cannot understand our ongoing litter problem in the context of the natural beauty of the country with which they are very impressed. The litter problem is unnecessary and we all have a role to play in solving it. I strongly appeal to local authority members to play their part in ensuring their litter management plans are being implemented. Some local authorities are very pro-active in this. It is very impressive when local authorities, from the manager down, take a genuine interest in this problem which is very costly. While progress is being made we have a long way to go and I look forward to the support of everybody in the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>It is unsatisfactory for the Minister to say the vast majority of local authorities have litter management plans. How many local authorities have such plans? Does the Minister agree it is scandalous that almost two years after the passage of the Act there are still some local authorities which do not have a litter management plan? Does he agree that far too often when local authorities have a litter management plan and employ litter wardens we still see the place festooned with litter? Is the Minister aware that every time South Dublin County Council cuts the grass in the middle of the dual carriageway to Naas, we see more litter? Does the Minister agree that, having gone through a six month reporting and monitoring system, he now admits the system was unsatisfactory? What new measures does he intend to take to ensure local authorities live up to their obligations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied progress is being made. Local authorities employed 191 litter wardens in the first six months of 1998 and that was <Col N="1233" /> a significant improvement on the 138 employed in the second half of 1997. The number of prosecutions in the first six months of 1998 was 507 on the spot fines and 3,175 notices issued. That was an increase of 175 per cent and 39 per cent, respectively, on the figures for the second half of 1997.</P>
      <P>The National Litter Monitoring Agency, which I will announce shortly, will conduct assessments at local level and identify blackspots. It will work closely with local authorities to identify their problems, and conduct an assessment and analysis of the situation nationally and report on it. Most local authorities have submitted management plans but we are unhappy with a few. This is an ongoing process and I will continue to work on this area to ensure local authorities are more proactive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>We are in regular contact with local authorities on this matter. Some are not as active as others. We are pursuing them. The legislation does not give us the power to deal with them in the manner the Deputy proposes, but I am anxious to ensure local authorities fulfil their functions.</P>
      <P>I met every county manager last year and pointed out to them their responsibilities under the Litter Management Act, that new local funding made available to them meant more resources should be diverted to litter management and that, where litter wardens are in place, the revenue they bring in means they are self-financing. Local authorities make the case that they do not have the finances for litter wardens. I do not accept that. It has been proven in other areas that litter wardens will be self-financing if they implement the law. Not alone do they provide revenue, they also fulfil their function.</P>
      <P>There has been progress. We must acknowledge the local authorities that are fulfilling their functions and endeavouring to deal with the problem. Every citizen has a responsibility. There is no point in me blaming the next person or saying the Minister should give money to local authorities and let them deal with the problem. It will not be solved that way. It will be solved only by education, awareness and enforcement of the law. I will endeavour to ensure local authorities continue to give this area priority because of its concern to all Members.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Local authorities carried out their statutory assessments of housing needs on 31 March last and they have been asked to forward a full analysis of their assessments to my Department by 31 May. It will take some time to obtain returns from all 90 local authorities and to ensure they are comprehensive and complete. However, I expect the results to be published in my Department's housing statistics bulletin for the September quarter, as has been the practice with previous assessments.</P>
      <P>The last statutory assessment of local authority housing needs was carried out on 29 March 1996 and the number of households assessed as being in need of local authority housing at the time was 27,400. Recent contacts with local authorities suggest a significantly higher number of households seeking local authority accommodation, and the Government's expansion of the local authority programme in 1999 to its highest level for many years is an immediate response to increasing needs in advance of the results of the assessment.</P>
      <P>We intend to go further. I am delighted to inform Deputies that the Government has agreed to my proposal to introduce for the first time a multi-annual local authority housing programme. The new programme will be resourced to deliver 22,000 additional local authority dwellings over four years. This is equivalent to an increase of over a fifth in the number of local authority rented houses. There will be strong support from local authorities for the introduction of a multi-annual programme which should lead to a more efficient and streamlined delivery of local authority housing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The local authority housing programme is not the only instrument of housing policy to meet social housing needs and it is supplemented by a range of other social housing measures under the aegis of my Department. The new multi-annual programme, the new affordable housing scheme and the improvements I made during 1998 in the voluntary housing capital assistance and shared ownership schemes will result in increased output from all these schemes in 1999. In addition, I intend to increase output under the voluntary housing schemes to 4,000 houses per annum over the coming years and will be shortly discussing <Col N="1235" /> ways of achieving this target with key representatives of the voluntary housing sector. I expect the local authority housing programme, together with the output from the complementary social housing measures and vacancies occurring in the existing housing stock, will enable the housing needs of more than 10,300 households to be catered for in 1999.</P>
    <P>Comprehensive information on house prices for the first quarter of 1999 will be provided in my Department's housing statistics bulletin for the March quarter of 1999 due to be published around the end of May. In addition, my Department has recently put in place new arrangements for monitoring house price trends on a monthly basis based on provisional returns from the mortgage lending institutions. This preliminary data in respect of January and February indicate further easing in the house price situation and lend further support to the view that the rate of house price increase has peaked and should moderate significantly this year.</P>
    <P>I have no proposals to attempt to impose artificial administrative control on house prices which was attempted in the past and proved largely ineffective. A range of further measures for the housing market were announced in the Government's statement of 9 March 1999 in response to the consultants' report The Housing Market &ndash; An Economic Review and Assessment. The key objective is to maximise and accelerate the supply of housing. These further measures, in conjunction with initiatives already under way, will reinforce the progress being made to ensure price stabilisation and balance in the housing market.</P>

What is the explanation for this extraordinary length of time in producing the figures? Does the Minister of State agree with the estimate the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, gave to the Joint Committee on the Environment and Local Government last week that there are 42,000 people on local authority waiting lists? Does the Minister of State's announcement at the weekend of 22,000 local authority houses mean half those on council waiting lists will still not be housed in four years' time?

      <P>I want to ensure we have a figure because the last time the assessment was undertaken in 1996 the number of applicants on the housing authority lists was higher than the assessment made of the number in need of local authority houses. It was established that the needs of some of those on the housing list could be met under aspects of the local authority housing programme other than the provision of a local authority house <i>per se. </i>That type of assessment and checking of the needs and circumstances of applicants is extensive. It is expected the Department will have the information by the end of May.</P>
      <P>The Deputy would know if he had experience of dealing with these matters that, unfortunately, one cannot anticipate that each of the 90 housing authorities will have its results in by 30 May. From my nearly two years experience as Minister of State, I know it will be necessary to chase up the information. The only explanation I can offer as to why it should take so long is the need for accurate information.</P>
      <P>With regard to the figure of 42,000, I have used a figure of over 40,000. I do not know the exact number on the local authority waiting lists and I would not be in a position to assess how many are in need of local authority housing or whether their needs could be met by another aspect of the social housing programme. That assessment must be undertaken by local authority housing officials in the 90 different authorities.</P>
      <P>I made reference to the construction of 22,000 local authority houses in the context of a multi-annual local authority house building programme. This is the first time a Government has decided to introduce a multi-annual construction programme for the local authorities. The figure of 5,500 local authority houses each year over a four year period from 2000-3, inclusive, will result in 22,000 houses being built.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the number of people whose needs will be catered for under some of the other aspects of the Government's social housing programme is included, the figure for households will rise very substantially, possibly to around 60,000. When all benefits are taken into account, approximately 60,000 households will, in some form or other, benefit from the social housing programme during this four year period. The Deputy is making a major error to assume that the needs of only a <Col N="1237" /> half of the people on the list of approximately 40,000 will be met. The figure will be very much greater.</P>

      <P>Is the Minster of State telling the House that after almost two years in office he does not know how many people are on local authority waiting lists and that it will take nine months to count them, yet he expects us to believe figures for the numbers of houses that are to be provided over the next four years? A Minister of State who cannot count the number of people waiting for houses can hardly be believed when he puts forward fictitious figures for the next four years.</P>

      <P>I do not understand why the Deputy is getting so excited. I am not changing the method. I have already informed him that the multi-annual programme we have introduced is intended to apply a more efficient way of producing local authority houses in that the local authorities will be informed before the commencement of the four year period of their allocation for each year. They are expected to enter into advance planning arrangements with regard to sites, land, serviced land and the seeking of tenders over longer periods in respect of larger amounts so that we can achieve greater cost efficiencies in the method of construction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All of these elements will help in the speedier production of the 22,000 houses than would <Col N="1238" /> otherwise be the case if I were to follow the traditional method, employed in the Department for many years. That consisted of an annual allocation of housing starts announced around January each year following which each local authority had to prepare documents and arrange for tenders.

      <P>The average waiting time for a driving test is at present 31 weeks; the average longest waiting period per test centre is 40 weeks. However, applicants who require a test for urgent reasons are being given earlier appointments: approximately 28 per cent of applicants are tested within 15 weeks.</P>
      <P>Some 97,000 applicants are at present awaiting driving tests. Of these, approximately 26,000 have been given test appointments and a further 10,000 have indicated that they are not currently available to be tested. Applications for driving tests are now running at 36 per cent above earlier levels, driven by exceptional conditions of economic growth. In 1998 an all-time record of nearly 150,000 test applications were made to my Department.</P>
      <P>Significant additional resources are now being allocated to the driver testing service, which will shortly comprise 103 testers compared to 66 in 1998. Together with recent productivity agreements and Saturday working, this will increase the testing capacity of the service by over 90,000 tests to 202,000 driving tests annually. Through these actions, I am determined to bring progressive and substantial improvements to the quality of service provided to the public and to end present excessive and unacceptable waiting times.</P>

      <P>On a number of occasions I explained to the House the difficulties involved. I referred to the long ongoing negotiations with the trade unions in regard to productivity and arrangements for the introduction of additional contract testers. I could not determine in advance how long those discussions would take.</P>
      <P>I apologised to people who were waiting for tests &ndash; I said that it was most unsatisfactory &ndash; and who were inconvenienced by it. I assured people, who were dependent on a driving licence and, therefore, needed a test for employment purposes or other urgent purposes, that we would do everything possible to arrange for that. Deputies will be aware that an extensive number of people are availing of that offer.</P>
      <P>The Deputy knows the position from previous answers to parliamentary questions. It arises out of the difficulties in resolving the issue with the testers' trade union. Happily, those issues are resolved. I indicated the number of additional testers who are being appointed. All of this does not happen instantly because new testers must be trained, but they are all about to be put in place. In addition, there has been some illness within the existing tester cadre which also affected output. If the Deputy wants me to go through all the various measures which we have taken, I can do so.</P>

      <P>The current waiting time problem started in 1996, when greatly increased numbers of driving test applications were made to the Department of the Environment and Local Government. In 1996, applications rose by 20 per cent on the previous year to 120,000. It was not until 1998, partly in response to tighter regulations about the renewal of provisional driving licences, that the trend towards a greatly increased number of driving tests became established. In 1998, there was an increase of 23 per cent on the number in 1997, resulting in an all time record of 146,000 test applicants. Between 1995 and 1998 the level of applicants rose by 36 per cent.</P>
      <P>We are dealing with another result of the change in the economy where people are coming back from abroad and there has been a huge increase in the number of people at work. Consequently people have a better standard of living and there has been a big increase in the number of cars.</P>

      <P>Saturday testing was introduced and it is turning out about 12,600 tests per annum. The productivity agreement under the PCW, to which I referred, was concluded and gave an 8 per cent increase which resulted in about an additional 9,000 tests per annum. A further productivity agreement was entered into on 16 April 1999. That will deliver an additional 3,500 tests per annum.</P>
      <P>With regard to permanent testers, a competition has qualified 33, eight of whom have taken up duty. We are in the process of recruiting four additional permanent testers. These will fill four vacancies, increasing the corps of permanent testers from 70 to 78. However, as I said, two are on long-term sick leave. There will be 21,600 additional tests as a result of those arrangements.</P>
      <P>Contract testers are being taken on. Nine have commenced testing and 11 more commenced training on 19 April. We are in the process of recruiting five more contract testers. The total number of contract testers will be 25. That will result in about 45,000 tests per annum.</P>
      <P>Therefore, the total additional tests arising from the measures I have taken is 91,700. The previous capacity in November 1998, based on 64 effective testers at 1,760 tests per annum and the PCW improvement, would give about 110,700. When one takes that into consideration, the present total potential capacity is 202,500 tests per annum to cater for the high level of applicants with whom we are dealing.</P>

      <P>The EPA's recently published report on drinking water quality in 1997 indicates that overall quality continues to be satisfactory in public supplies. Apart from coliforms and fluoride, compliance levels were above 98 per cent in 1997 in respect of strictly health related parameters for all supplies. In the case of coliforms and fluoride, the compliance levels were 87 per cent and 91 per cent, respectively, representing a slight improvement on the 1996 position in respect of fluoride and a marginal disimprovement in respect of coliforms.</P>
      <P>While non-compliance on health related parameters is unacceptable, the overall results are encouraging, reflecting the major investment in public water supply infrastructure in recent years and the commitment of local authorities to provide a high quality water supply. The report acknowledges that the rate of improvement in water quality has reached, or is rapidly approaching, a plateau and that expectations of further significant improvements may not be warranted in regard to public supplies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a significant improvement in 1997 in the number of group schemes complying with the <Col N="1244" /> required standards and a 38 per cent increase in the extent of monitoring of these supplies by local authorities. However, there are no grounds for complacency given that 36 per cent of group schemes recorded exceedances in coliforms. We must continue to address this sector with vigour. In the case of rural water supplies, water quality problems are most acute in group water schemes which are dependent on private sources, many of which are vulnerable to organic pollution. Some 5 per cent of households are served by these privately sourced group schemes.</P>
    <P>In response to the findings of the EPA report, I have asked sanitary authorities to ensure that every effort is made to identify and focus on problem aspects of their water supply programmes and to examine all aspects of the operation of treatment plants in the light of the recommendations set out in the report. I have asked for a special report, to be presented before 31 May 1999, from certain authorities in regard to areas where the level of exceedances was high.</P>
    <P>A comprehensive range of targeted initiatives together with significantly increased capital resources are being provided under my Department's rural water programme with the objective of improving the quality, reliability and efficiency of rural water supplies. Overall capital expenditure on the programme will exceed £28 million this year, an increase of £7 million on 1998 and £12 million on 1997. A special £3 million allocation has been made available this year to develop solutions to water quality problems which particularly affect privately sourced group schemes. This will be used to fund intensive testing to identify factors influencing water quality; research new technologies for treating small scale supplies and pay for installation and practical pilot testing of new treatment packages.</P>
    <P>My Department and local authorities will continue to work in close partnership with the private group scheme sector to ensure water supplies are planned and developed to the best advantage of rural communities. A national rural water monitoring committee was set up last year to monitor the implementation of the rural water programme by local authorities. The committee is also overseeing the development of a model strategic rural water plan, which will form a blueprint for the planning of rural water supplies in the future.</P>
    <P>The capital provision for water and sewerage services in my Department's Vote amounts to £275 million this year, an increase of 50 per cent on expenditure in 1998, 70 per cent on 1997 and more than double the expenditure in 1996. Overall, between 1994 and the end of this year, more than £960 million of capital funding will have been invested in water and sewerage services with a strong emphasis on additional water treatment in accordance with the requirements of the drinking water and urban waste water treatment directives. This investment directly addresses the drinking water quality issues raised in the EPA report. It provides for enhanced water supply ser<Col N="1245" /> vices and protects the sources from which drinking water is obtained. My Department, the social partners, regional and local authorities and the ESRI have been at one in identifying the water services sector as a major priority for funding under the forthcoming National Development Plan &ndash; 2000 to 2006.</P>

      <P>A total of 5,500 group water schemes are in operation serving 150,000 people. I am concerned that 36 per cent of the samples taken from those schemes contain excessive levels of coliforms. This could be a serious public health issue, particularly when we read so much about the presence of E-coli 0157. Who is to say that it is not present in these samples? I am also concerned that there is an increased level of coliform contamination, particularly since the Minister said that he expects the quality of water to plateau and that we will not see the significant improvements which we have seen in recent years. The level of coliform exceedances is increasing.</P>
      <P>How does he propose to address the fact that coliform contamination in public water supplies is alarming given that we will not see further significant improvements in water quality? Ireland is being taken to task by the European Commission over its failure to adhere to the EU water quality directive. How will this impinge on the EPA quality directive?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is making the same mistake as other people in Cork, based on newspaper reports. I have tried to correct the impression created by<i> The Examiner</i> on a number of occasions and am delighted to have the opportunity again to state that the 36 per cent of schemes referred to in the EPA report does not relate to the 5,500 group water schemes in place. It refers to 5 per cent of group schemes which have private water sources rather than public ones. Many group water schemes tap into public water supplies. All the indications we have, which were confirmed in the EPA report, show high levels of compliance by public water schemes.</P>
      <P>However, whether the figure is 5 per cent or more, any coliform exceedances are unacceptable. I agree with the Deputy that we should endeavour to ensure that all water supplied to group water schemes is top quality and all water which people get from such schemes, whether from private or public sources, should be top quality. That is what we are trying to do in the programme that I outlined.</P>
      <P>The EU directive is the subject of a separate question. However, the EU is pursuing us in regard to group water schemes. Our defence is that the directive does not and should not apply to such schemes.</P>

I am not trying to pretend that the 36 per cent of cases, which we mentioned, were in private wells &ndash; they were in group water schemes. The reference to private wells was incidental to another question. I am always careful when answering questions from Deputy Dukes because I am wary of telling him all the things we are doing and the extra money we are providing &ndash; an increase of 100 per cent for water services since 1996, which we hope to increase substantially again.

      <P>In response to Deputy Clune, the information I have to hand is that some of the health fears relating to aluminium in water have been greatly exaggerated. There is no conclusive link between the levels of those elements and risk to health.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>This year marks the one hundredth anniversary of the local government system which has served this country well. Local authority members have always given their time, energy and efforts in a voluntary capacity in the interests of local democracy. As a result of what is taking place at certain tribunals, emphasis is now being placed on the performance of some members of local authorities and on officials also.</P>
      <P>With the development of urban areas and the need for development land, the issue of rezoning has come to the fore in no uncertain terms. It is amazing that, on the one hand, people want more development land for housing, yet on the other hand, when land is rezoned the question is always asked as to who voted for rezoning. That dilemma has existed over the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1260" /> The Minister has been prompted to introduce the Bill, providing for the disclosure of what each candidate spends at local election time. It is an amazing comparison that there is a cap on expenditure in Dáil elections, yet there is no such cap in local elections. I hope the Minister will explain that.</P>
    <P>He should also explain his remarks over the past 12 months concerning his plan for the revolutionary reform of local government. He said he would not allow people to hold a dual mandate in the Oireachtas and in a local authority. That idea was put to bed, however, and various theories have been suggested to explain why the Minister did not follow through on his original proposal. If local authority members are allowed a salary, which they should get, the Minister may find himself in a dilemma with regard to Members of the Oireachtas who are also members of local authorities. What will be their position in such circumstances? The Minister may find himself caught between wishful thinking and having to deal with the political reality of his own backbenchers. He probably had good intentions and that is nothing new for politicians, but it is a question of completing the course. In this case the Minister did not do so.</P>
    <P>We will create a two-tier approach to local and national elections. It is not good enough and the arguments in favour of it must be faced down. If Dáil election candidates can make their declaration statements to the Public Offices Commission, so should local election candidates. The Minister maintained that the arrangements proposed were in the context of giving more powers and functions to local government. That does not make sense. It gives more work to local government when an independent body, the Public Offices Commission, is functioning well. The Government must think again about this.</P>
    <P>A student survey published last week showed that 15 per cent of students are not registered to vote, and I suspect that figure could be applied across the board to that age group. The figure is amazing but is one I have no reason to doubt. In reforming any voting or electoral system, the first thing a Minister should do is introduce a system whereby when people come of age they are automatically placed on the voting register. We have all heard stories over the years of people being taken off the register and political activists of one party or another being blamed. That kind of system should be long gone. We are debating a new system of counting votes but should ensure that every person over the age of 18 is entitled to vote. That should be the first priority.</P>
    <P>We are beginning to get used to the capping of expenditure in general elections and Members experienced this in the recent by-elections. Why have local elections been overlooked? We know that a small minority of local election candidates spend considerable sums of money. If the Minister wanted to create a level playing field he should have capped expenditure for local elec<Col N="1261" /> tions as well, or left well enough alone. However, the Minister has a habit of meddling and getting involved in matters that end up worse than when he started. This is what he is doing in parts of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Candidates have to disclose subscriptions and donations they receive at election time. Politics is very local and donations at this level are equivalent to people making donations to the local football team, as Members are aware, and the parish element comes into play. If people in a parish or area want a person to represent their area at local level, it is understandable that they get together and make a donation towards their candidate or candidates. Local pride comes into this and there is no other reason for it. Rushing to ensure that local election donations are declared is an over-reaction.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State and I have both had the experience of parents ringing us to say that their child is over 18 but is not on the register. The parents may tell the child to vote and the child may have little interest in doing so, but if he or she is not on the register, that kills the initiative.</P>
    <P>Not enough thought has been put into this Bill. It is a hotchpotch, though its intentions seem good.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" hpid="Mr. Timmins Mr. Timmins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is in many respects an extension of the Electoral Act, 1997, with one glaring difference: the absence of Exchequer funding. We are now familiar with the concept of candidates in a general election receiving a vouched refund if they obtain a certain percentage of the votes but those participating in the forthcoming local election will not be able to do so. In addition, there is no cap on the amount of money that can be spent on a campaign. One wonders what the purpose is in bringing forward a Bill that is more renowned for what it excludes than what it includes. Nevertheless, the basic concept is to make the funding of parties and individuals more transparent and it is welcome from that point of view.</P>
      <P>However, it does not place a great restraint on candidates, and thus nothing other than perhaps embarrassment will prohibit a candidate from putting a great deal of money into his or her campaign. It is true that the more money one puts into a campaign the greater the chance of election. The argument is often made that posters, one of the more expensive items in an election, are not effective. However, we all know what a can of Coke and a pint of Guinness looks like, yet how often do we see their images on billboards? This Bill should have addressed the capping of expenditure, as we should place as many obstacles as possible in the way of wealth playing a role in electoral success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since my election I have heard many discussions of the 1997 Electoral Act and the answers to many of the questions it raises are still hazy. The situation is almost on a par with the Good Friday Agreement as parties continue to seek clarification. When informed that the provision of a sit down meal would have to be <Col N="1262" /> included in election expenses, one experienced politician remarked that he would have to examine the feasibility of feeding people while they stood. No doubt the provisions of this Bill and the 1997 Act will put many sharp minds to work on how best to sidestep one's obligations.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister produces a small booklet to outline simply the requirements of this Bill. Irish people in general do not like to fill out forms or make out returns and prospective councillors will not be any different. It might save many difficulties if candidates were provided with a sample return on producing their deposits. The Minister should look into giving a booklet and sample return to those paying deposits to stand in the local elections. I understand that some candidates did not furnish returns after the 1997 election. How is this problem being addressed? Can we learn any lessons from it?</P>
    <P>Section 6(7) deals with a case where a person other than a national agent, designated person or candidate, or a person authorised by them, proposes to incur election expenditure. The person must notify the local authority concerned of the nature, purpose and extent of the proposed expenditure. Following the election, he or she must furnish a statement to the local authority. I fail to see the purpose of the initial part of this requirement and I see grave difficulties in trying to implement it in the forthcoming election, when many people will not be aware of the provisions of the Bill. It is not uncommon for companies to wish their local candidates well in the body of their own newspaper advertising. How will the Minister address this? Will he consider dropping the requirement to inform the local authority beforehand? This would make the Bill easier to comply with and I see no downside to such a change.</P>
    <P>Section 13 addresses the statement of donations and election expenses as well as the source of any donation of more than £500. Where a person makes more than one donation to a candidate in the same election, all such donations shall be aggregated and treated as a single donation. Most political parties are organised for local elections on an electoral area level. It is unclear what the situation will be if an individual makes a donation of £2,000 to an area organisation and this is subsequently spent on a candidate in the election campaign. Does the ceiling of £4,000 referred to in the 1997 Act come into play in such a situation? The Minister must clarify these questions to avoid a repeat of the debate which followed the enactment of the 1997 Act.</P>
    <P>A much publicised scheme is in place for councillors who have decided not to contest the next election. It also extends to personnel who have already stood down and to their next of kin and is unflatteringly referred to as the scrappage scheme. Its purpose appears to be to bring new faces into local politics but if this is so, the scheme is misplaced. Most political parties realise that it is not an easy task to entice new candidates into the electoral fray <Col N="1263" /> and it is not commendable to put a scheme in place for the sole purpose of enticing experienced personnel to leave local politics. In our efforts to involve young people in politics we should not exclude their elders. A form of retirement scheme should be put in place so that all councillors receive a gratuity on retirement and not merely as an incentive to clear the decks on this occasion. Local representatives work very long hours and make many sacrifices for no real remuneration. When they claim expenses or avail of what their critics call junkets, they are ridiculed. During the past eight years,councillors have listened to many people telling them how to do their jobs but when one looks for people to stand in local elections, the solution experts scatter like autumn leaves. I have no doubt that by next July or August they will have returned.</P>
    <P>The job of a local representative is a thankless one and the pressures associated with it have increased in recent years as our economy places an unprecedented strain on the development of services and a culture of greed and opportunism takes root. In conjunction with the retirement scheme, the Minister should have addressed the issue of councillors' allowances and expenses. He has not done so because, if he did, many of those he hopes will retire from local government might stay on. Had the details of such a scheme been put in place in time, more new candidates might have been encouraged to come forward.</P>
    <P>Local government decisions impact greatly on our daily lives. Local representatives must often make unpopular decisions and do not always adopt the populist line. The unpopular decisions of local representatives are often more visible than those of central Government and with the increasing advent of pressure groups it is important that public representatives have the necessary moral courage to make decisions that are for the general good and not merely populist or politically motivated. The same group of local representatives often make all the hard decisions while a minority cash in on populist policies. The general public do not have access to records of decision making at local level. We could improve this situation by providing more accommodation in the public galleries of county council buildings and making available the record of meetings. Generally, the only record of local authority meetings is the account in the local newspaper and this often consists of no more than a vague reference.</P>
    <P>It is essential that local representatives put aside party politics in the interest of the well being of the area they represent. There has been a move away from this practice in recent times. Reading a history of local government in Wicklow between 1899 and 1999, I came across a speech by the late James Everett in which he complimented members of the council for not bringing party allegiance to the table.</P>
    <P>With the increased competitiveness of Oireachtas elections, some TDs have brought a <Col N="1264" /> form of paralysis to local government. I am aware the Minister is addressing this matter. To debar Oireachtas Members from local representation may impact negatively on them but that is a risk we must take and, if necessary, amend the electoral system accordingly. A few weeks ago I received an acknowledgement of a planning application from my local county council, copies of which were sent to 11 politicians. Officials and politicians spend too much time and energy on such activity which is making the system hopelessly inefficient.</P>
    <P>Under the terms of section 83 of the Local Government Act, 1946, industrial sites could be sold by local authorities below market value, to indigenous people who would provide employment locally. Officials in some councils are reluctant to do this because of their obsession with value for money. I hope officials of local authorities will look again at this practice.</P>
    <P>I welcome section 24 of the Bill which refers to the electronic counting of votes. Voters can be intimidated if they believe that tallymen can identify the ballot papers of individual voters. As the initial of my name is T, I hope the Minister might consider placing the names of candidates on ballot papers randomly rather than alphabetically.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to provide for a statutory scheme of disclosure of election expenses of candidates, political parties and third parties at local elections. I am glad that disclosure is an integral part of the Bill and that donations over £500 must now be disclosed.</P>
      <P>Many have asked why there is no expenditure limit on spending at local elections. Local elections are not comparable with Dáil elections. The Minister has referred to the very large number of local electoral areas, the varied membership of local authorities and the varied populations within local authority areas. An expenditure limit would have to treat all candidates equally and this would cause great difficulty.</P>
      <P>We learn from our experience of previous elections but as county council elections have not been held since 1991 &ndash; urban council and town commissioners elections were held in 1994 &ndash; no information is available on past election expenditure. This presents a difficulty as we debate this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad the Minister promised that, after the election, an analysis of the effect of the legislation would be carried out to see if the advantage of imposing expenditure limits would outweigh the added bureaucracy it would cause for candidates and parties. The Minister stated that all documentation of local interest only would be sent to Dublin. This would not facilitate local access to such documents. He also mentioned the extra <Col N="1265" /> cost of £300,000 for eight extra staff in the Public Offices Commission. We do not know the extra cost for candidates and political parties but parties will be obliged to make two declarations of information, to the local authority and the designated authority in Dublin.</P>
    <P>The scheme would involve much bureaucracy and would add to the cost of elections. It is hoped that expenditure on local elections would not be so great as on Dáil or European elections. The Minister has referred to the principle of disclosure which is contained in the 1997 Electoral Act. All candidates will be obliged to disclose the sources of their funding for election expenses. Most European Union countries do not impose election expenditure limits in local elections. The threshold in respect of donations to political parties is too high. Perhaps the Minister will consider this in other legislation.</P>
    <P>The Bill removes the disqualification from membership of a local authority of a chairperson of a joint or standing committee. Although Deputy Healy-Rae has received much publicity, many Deputies will be affected. There are 14 joint committees and five standing committees.</P>
    <P>Much of the legislation passed in the last ten to 15 years has more to do with Members of the Oireachtas than with improving local democracy. In 1989 the then Government decided that, on appointment, Ministers of State should resign their local authority seats. Chairpersons of committees cannot chair their local authorities or be lord mayor. I can envisage difficulties in 2004 when members of local authorities elected to the Dáil or Seanad will not be allowed to contest local elections. Although I am not in favour of the dual mandate, I can envisage this decision being the subject of a legal challenge.</P>
    <P>It is eight years since the last local elections were held. This is bad for democracy. I know of many individuals in my constituency who are committed to local government and who were anxious to contest again, but because of the delay are not in a position to do so. On the last occasion a colleague of mine lost out by 38 votes. Six months later in a co-option he lost out by three votes. This is repeated in many local authorities. I would be the first to admit Fianna Fáil has not always been a saint when it comes to co-option &ndash; there has been much talk of gentlemen's agreements &ndash; but it should be provided for in legislation that there should be a substitute list of candidates, similar to that in European Parliament elections, ensuring that, when a person resigns or dies, the party or Independent grouping concerned retains the seat. Following co-option, a party or grouping which received 10 per cent of the vote may end up with half of the seats in an electoral area. This is a negation of democracy. It has been suggested that, to avoid by-elections, there should be a substitute list for Dáil elections.</P>
    <P>The provision under which local elections will be held at five year intervals is welcome. It has been suggested that there should be a fixed term <Col N="1266" /> for Dáil elections, as is the case in many European countries and in the United States. Perhaps the Minister will consider this in other legislation.</P>
    <P>On the PRSTV system, political parties and candidates like to have a tally to identify their support base and to determine the number of candidates they should put forward for election when constituency boundaries are redrawn. Is the day of the tallyman over?</P>
    <P>On electronic voting, it has been suggested that persons who have emigrated within the last five or ten years should be entitled to vote. This is being considered by the committee on the Constitution whose proposals are awaited. In the event of a snap election, the necessary technology might not be available immediately to allow them cast their votes. This supports the case for a fixed term for Dáil elections. It has been suggested that emigrants should be entitled to vote by fax. Whatever system is chosen, it will have to be supervised at an embassy or consulate, as is the case in most European countries and in the United States. There have been huge leaps forward in computer hardware and software.</P>
    <P>I compliment the large number of local authority members who are resigning under the scheme introduced by the Minister. They are entitled to their gratuity which has been under attack from certain sections of the media. A former colleague of ours, Councillor Martin O'Toole said recently his gratuity for 42 years service works out at £1.70 per day. This represents good value for money. I wish him and all those who are retiring well.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on introducing the scheme. While some have said it should be improved, others have said it should be revised. I advocate one change. I know of a number of public representatives who are members of a county council and a corporation. Under the regulations they are not entitled to the gratuity if they resign from the county council and contest the corporation elections. They have a very good case for being paid a gratuity. A large number, some of whom were featured on Marion Finucane's radio programme, will not get this gratuity.</P>
    <P>Many members have not had the benefit of the new facilities in council offices which are very much part of the history of the centenary of local government. The Minister was in Galway last Thursday to officially open the new county hall there. It is symbolic of the new thinking in local government and newly elected members will have better facilities. I expect our new councillors to be very busy with more and longer meetings. The SPC initiatives are also in place and were started in Galway County Council as a pilot programme.</P>
    <P>Deputy Timmins and Deputy Belton spoke about the compilation of the electoral register. It is an important point and I would like the electoral register to be complied in the same way as the population census in that every household should receive an application form and detail the number of eligible people in it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1267" /> Another worry is the number of polling stations being closed. If the Department of the Environment and Local Government continues to suggest, as it has done in the past, that 1,000 people should vote at every polling station, people in rural areas such as Connemara may have to travel more than 25 miles to go to their local polling stations. That is something I would not like to see happen. At present people are driving past their local polling stations to vote at other polling stations. Every local authority should ensure a revised scheme will be put in place so that people will be able to vote at their local polling stations. There should be access for the disabled if they wish to vote and people should have to travel only a reasonable distance.</P>
    <P>The question of posters at polling stations has come up. At present they must be placed 100 metres from the polling station. I am conscious people can be impeded going into a polling station, and that should not happen. However, posters at a polling station create an atmosphere of political activity and it will indicate to people where the station is located especially if polling stations are relocated under the revised scheme. The Minister should not worry too much about posters because the litter legislation covers taking them down immediately after the election. There is a need for some posters around a polling station to create a buzz at election time.</P>
    <P>In the run up to the June elections, I have been taken aback by what I would call unauthorised planning where posters seem to have been posted before Christmas at roundabouts and in prominent places along our county roads. Are local authorities taking any action to stop people putting up these posters? The place for posters is at polling stations at election time.</P>
    <P>Another issue which arose at recent elections concerns voting for people on the islands. There has been a strong lobby that people on the islands should vote at the same time as everybody else. In the past, early voting has been organised for them which does not please them. There is a problem in that if the islanders vote on the same day as everybody else and we cannot get the votes because of bad weather, the count will be delayed. When talking about electronic methods of voting and recording, perhaps the Minister might look at the position of island communities.</P>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity given to people to correct the register or to include names that have been omitted. The Department and local authorities should advertise more that corrections can be made up to shortly before polling. When Telecom Éireann recently contacted everybody on the register about share options, many people were amazed at their addresses and the spelling of their names. This shows there can be mistakes on the register despite the best will in the world. There is an opportunity for people to make corrections and to add names left off the register. This should be done and every effort should be made to pub<Col N="1268" /> licise the fact corrections can be made under legislation and regulations passed by this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I join Deputy Kitt in expressing thanks to serving members of local authorities who have decided not to contest the election in June. Like all politicians, they are frequently lampooned and often maligned. I suppose it is something we should all get used to and about which we should not worry too much, although very often county councillors come in for an undue share of it. There is a fund of wisdom among those members of local authorities which we ignore at our peril and to our disadvantage. It is only fair this House should recognise the debt it and the public owe to the work done by members of local authorities of all parties and by independent members.</P>
      <P>It is a measure of our sensitivity that people get a little vexed from time to time at the nickname which has been given to the gratuity scheme. If I am properly informed, a member of a local authority first dubbed it the scrappage scheme. I found more members of local authorities who were amused by it rather than annoyed. They have a far more robust and resilient sense of humour than that which many of the pundits who comment on these matters tend to have.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Kitt in his observation that the role of members of local authorities is changing. I agree with his view that members who will be elected to local authorities next June will, in many ways, have a more onerous role than current members. Members of local authorities, who have been members for the past eight years, have been under substantially increased pressure by the changing demands of life as a member of a local authority. I hope that continues because I believe a number of functions currently exercised by the managers of local authorities should be handed back to its democratically elected members. That is perhaps a little outside the scope of the Bill so I will not go into it too much at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an odd Bill which is, in some ways, as remarkable for what it does not contain as for what it does. It does not, for example, carry through the provision that Members of this House who chair committees of this Houses or joint committees would be disbarred from being members of local authorities. I was never sure that a very good legal or constitutional basis existed for that particular bar. It seems to me that any Member elected to this House should be eligible to fulfil any function which can carried out by such a person. Equally, anyone elected to a local authority should be entitled to carry out any function proper to local authority members. There is a difference between someone who chairs an Oireachtas committee being a local authority member and someone who is a Minister or Minister of State holding such a position. The provision that local authority members who are appointed to office should resign their local authority membership is a perfectly proper and pru<Col N="1269" /> dential one. I cannot imagine how a Cabinet Minister or a Minister of State could hope to combine ministerial or Oireachtas functions with local authority ones. That would be impossible.</P>
    <P>In some countries, the functions of parliamentarian and minister do not go together. In some of our fellow EU member states, one does not have to be a member of Parliament to be appointed a member of Government. In others, members of Parliament who are appointed to Government positions are obliged to give up their parliamentary seats and have them filled by substitutes. We have not yet reached the point here where we need to consider those measures. Although I can see their validity, I do not believe they should apply to the duality of functions between Oireachtas committee chairpersons and local authority members.</P>
    <P>This Bill does not bring an end to the dual mandate of being a member of a local authority and of this House which the Minister has so often spoken about. I agree with the Minister that it is undesirable to try to combine both functions as each could suffer in certain circumstances. I am aware, however, that many Oireachtas Members do not experience any particular difficulty in combining both functions. I cannot imagine there is any constitutional basis on which Oireachtas Members could be debarred from being candidates for local authority membership. My own view is that Oireachtas Members should not be candidates for local authority membership but that local authority members should be entitled to be candidates in general elections. It is a rather idealistic point of view.</P>
    <P>I have never been a member of a local authority myself but I am aware that many Members of this House who are also local authority members would, if they could get away with it, prefer not to be local authority members. I cannot see any constitutional way in which such a bar could be introduced. It would be open to challenge; the decision must be left to the good sense of Members themselves and perhaps to a question of party discipline. If parties decide they are opposed to the dual mandate in practice, perhaps they could ask their members to abide by rules in that regard.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the disclosure of donations and expenditure in local elections although it does not provide for any ceiling on expenditure by candidates in such elections. Nothing I have read or heard constitutes a good reason for not imposing a ceiling on expenditure. We have a ceiling on expenditure in general elections, by-elections and European elections and I cannot see any reason if we believe such a ceiling is appropriate in regard to those elections, it cannot be imposed in regard to local elections. The Minister has stated it would cost a lot of money to supervise such a provision and that it would require a significant increase in local authority staffing levels. I do not find that argument at all convincing and even if it is true, it is not a sufficiently good reason to depart from the pro<Col N="1270" /> cedures adopted in general and European elections.</P>
    <P>Objections have been made to the absence of a cap on expenditure. It seems nonsensical to me that, as one of two general election candidates running for the same party in a two seater constituency, my party could spend of the order of £16,000 or £17,000 on my election campaign. However, if I decided I wanted to be a candidate in a local election, I could spend that much myself as long as I accounted for its origins. I could spend £1 million in a bid for a local authority seat if I were so inclined and nobody could say 'boo' to me as long as I conformed with the Bill's provisions and declared all donations in excess of £500.</P>
    <P>I cannot see the logic of departing from a practice which exists in regard to other elections. If the Minister feels it would be administratively difficult to implement a ceiling, there is another option. We could provide for a series of random checks rather than inspecting individual candidate's expenditure. It would not be beyond the bounds of the ingenuity of the Department of Environment and Local Government to devise a system where the possibility of random checks would be a sufficient deterrent to prevent candidates exceeding expenditure limits.</P>
    <P>I have heard Members of this House say that the current situation is unfair in so far as well heeled candidates are at an advantage over those who do not have much money. If we were to look at the composition of local authorities, I am not sure we would find any direct correlation between success in local elections and the amount of money a candidate spends. Nor do I believe an inordinately high proportion of fairly rich people are members of local authorities. In fact &ndash; although I am open to correction &ndash; I would imagine the proportion of wealthy people who are members of local authorities is smaller than the proportion of wealthy people in the population as a whole.</P>
    <P>I have heard colleagues complain that, in the absence of a cap on local election expenditure, prospective candidates in the upcoming by-elections might gain an unfair advantage. I do not know when the two by-elections will be although I suspect they will not be held until after the local elections in June. I see the Minister smiling so I am probably correct. It could be argued that someone who stands in the local elections who may also be a by-election candidate could, by spending a lot of money, build up a good position in advance of that election. That has always been the case. I do not believe that argument is relevant but it is relevant to state that, since we have decided it is appropriate to cap expenditure in general and European elections, we should follow the same logic in regard to local elections. We should not avoid doing so because it might prove too inconvenient. There are ways through which an effective system could be put in place to cap expenditure by local election candidates.</P>
    <P>What is involved in the system of disclosure? <Col N="1271" /> The system outlined in the Bill is a very strange one. The Minister issued a summary statement on the Bill on 23 February which provides the best summary I can find on what must be declared and the form declarations must take. It states: &ldquo;The Bill provides that each candidate will submit a one page income and expenditure statement to the local authority for which he or she is a candidate for election.&rdquo; It goes on to say &ldquo; . . . political parties likewise will submit a one page statement of their total headquarters' expenditure at the local elections to a specified local authority in the Dublin area&rdquo;. I imagine all principal parties will be sending statements of expenditure to some happy and fortunate local authority in the Dublin area. Perhaps the Minister will tell us which local authority will be the fortunate repository of this information. The statement also says &ldquo;Finally, expenditure by a political party at a local electoral area level will have to be disclosed by a designated person of the political party to the local authority concerned&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Therefore, three statements must be made, namely, one by a candidate to the local authority in the functional area in which he or she is standing, one by the political party of that candidate to that same local authority and one by the political party concerning overall electoral expenditure by headquarters to the specified local authority in the Dublin area. What will happen all this information? There has been some discussion on where the information will be kept and it has a wonderful air of unreality about it. My colleague, Deputy Hayes, asked last week why all this could not be dealt with by the Public Offices Commission, which we went to some trouble to set up in order to supervise and invigilate the activities of politicians in various ways. Why is all the invigilation not being done by this agency? The Minister said that would take functions away from local authorities. However, as far as I know local authorities are not demanding that they be given this job.</P>
    <P>To my knowledge it does not matter where the information is kept once it is clear that it is held in a form which is easily accessible and transmissible and once the general public is told how and when they can access it. In this era of information technology it is not necessary to ensure that information concerning expenditure by candidates in the Kildare electoral area is held only in Naas. It is perfectly possible for that information to be made available to an elector in Tully West in County Kildare by the Public Offices Commission in Dublin through the use of modern information technology or even by sending letters in envelopes with postage stamps. What we have heard about convenience and requirements of access to this information is absolute balderdash. We live in a time when there is no difficulty in ensuring information is readily accessible.</P>
    <P>The Bill includes provisions whereby local authorities must announce in a newspaper circulating in their area that people can have access <Col N="1272" /> to this information after a certain period. This is rubbish &ndash; there is no need for such detail of announcement. We could tell the public through the numerous ways we have of getting information to them that all this information is obtainable from the Public Offices Commission if that is what we decided to do. We could decide to do this as it would make much more sense for the Public Offices Commission, which exists to invigilate certain kinds of conduct, to do the same job in relation to local elections as it will be doing in relation to general elections. I see no reason for doing things differently in local elections.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for an examination of electronic recording and counting of votes. I thank the Minister and the Minister of State for inviting me a couple of weeks ago to see a demonstration of this in action. Unfortunately, I was unable to attend and my colleague, Deputy Hayes, went instead. I am interested to see the results of this examination. I have every confidence that the Minister, the Minister of State &ndash; they will be surprised to hear me say this &ndash; and the Department will use properly and for the purposes set out in the Bill the information they will collect from the local elections and I have no doubt that the necessary norms of confidentiality, etc., will be properly observed. I look forward to seeing the results. The electronic recording and counting of votes would greatly facilitate voters and candidates who would not have to wait so long biting their nails. It would also remove from the counting of votes in general and local elections the randomness which is endemic in the current system.</P>
    <P>The Bill is defective as it does not provide for a cap on expenditure. I intend proposing amendments on Committee Stage providing for a cap and for the information to be collected in a way which is different from that set out in the Bill as published. I do not think the course being taken by the Labour Party of tabling a reasoned amendment on Second Stage and voting against Second Stage is the way to improve the Bill. It is far more efficient to propose and I hope the Minister will be far more open to accept amendments on Committee Stage which would bring the Bill into line with what we have provided for in relation to other elections.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelOFlynn" hpid="Mr. O'Flynn Mr. O'Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to express support for the Minister in his presentation of the Bill. It was important that the issue of clarification of existing legislation would be addressed in light of the current and understandable public scrutiny of financial matters in the political arena. It was inevitable that a demand for this Bill would arise. The public wants its elected representatives to be squeaky clean. They must be seen to be whiter than white in line with the public's expectation and entitlement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister must be complimented for the lucid layout of the Bill which is a model of its kind. It amends sections of the Electoral Act, 1997, and has been inspired by the growing public <Col N="1273" /> insistence on ethical behaviour by all those elected to represent them and who hold public office. It seeks to make the Electoral Act more workable in its interpretation and operation. It evolved following consultation with the party Whips. The amendments were acceptable to all parties, except the Green Party, during the debate in the Seanad. However, it now seems the other Opposition parties are opposed to certain aspects of the Bill. They are entitled to their opinions &ndash; this is what democracy is about &ndash; but I find their stated reservations difficult to understand. There is widespread cross-party support for the Bill and it is a pity we could not have a unanimous viewpoint on such a straightforward matter.</P>
    <P>The sections of the Bill opposed by the Opposition are those which refer specifically to the disclosure of donations for political purposes and the regulation of expenditure in elections. Disclosure of donations over £500 is desirable and necessary, but in today's climate I do not think we will have too many problems with amounts over £500. It is nearly impossible to collect £50 because nobody wants to be involved with politicians, irrespective of what side of the House they are on. The disclosure provisions safeguard the integrity of the democratic system. Undisclosed or hidden donations of large amounts must inspire doubt in the public mind if they are exposed subsequently. It is a natural reaction for people to wonder why such donations were made and concealed.</P>
    <P>The Bill addresses matters arising from the knowledge gained since the coming into operation of the Electoral Act. It allows the chairpersons of Oireachtas committees to be members of local authorities, a decision which has unanimous support. The Bill comprehensively addresses the requirement for accountability and transparency in sources of funding for local elections. It provides a statutory scheme for the introduction of standards of integrity in the preparation of accounts for all expenses incurred during election campaigns.</P>
    <P>Section 24 provides for research into electronic methods of recording and counting votes under the proportional representation and single transferable vote system. I am sure this proposal will be welcomed by the public. I was delighted to hear Deputy Dukes warmly welcome it. The experiments will be conducted on ballot papers from the local elections on 11 June. It is planned to conduct an experiment on the presidential election campaign in 2004. A demonstration of this was given to journalists. It involves a touch screen process using a specially programmed smart card. I am concerned about one aspect. The card will not release unless the entire ballot paper is filled in, but people may not want to do that. I hope this will be examined. Much of the economic boom has been brought about by our use and investment in technological expertise. We sell ourselves as the base for information technology in Europe. It is important we are seen to use this <Col N="1274" /> expertise, of which we are so proud, in the running of our State apparatus. This will be seen as further evidence of the commitment of the Celtic tiger economy to technological excellence.</P>
    <P>Electronic voting will have the additional bonus of early election results. I am concerned about tallymen who count box by box and produce important information for political parties on electoral strength area by area. Will they be redundant when electronic voting is introduced? Its introduction will eliminate the wait for a result from long drawn-out manual counts. I sat through such a count until the early hours of the morning not so long ago. I do not want to relive that experience and I hope the voters will be kinder to me next time.</P>
    <P>The Bill requires each candidate to submit an income and expenditure account to the relevant local authority within 90 days after polling day. A statement in writing must be furnished itemising all election expenses incurred by the candidate in the election, whether paid or not, and the matter to which they relate and giving details of donations. Failure to observe the guidelines will result in legal proceedings by the State. There are named exceptions to the above, such as the failure to observe the law in circumstances where illness, death or reasonable cause not involving negligence is proved. The Bill requires political parties to submit a statement of headquarters expenditure at local elections and the submission to the local authority of a statement by a person in the local electoral area designated by the political party.</P>
    <P>In section 2, the Minister clearly defines donations in wording which cannot be misinterpreted. The terms &ldquo;donation&rdquo; and &ldquo;election expense&rdquo; are clearly defined. A donation is a sum of money, property or goods, the conferring of the right to use goods or property without payment, the supply of free services, the supply of goods or services at less than the commercial rate and contributions made to events which benefit candidates. I am delighted the Minister has clarified that because we experienced untold difficulty seeking clarification from the Public Offices Commission on a number of aspects of the 1997 Act. In addition, multiple contributions amounting to more than £4,000 by an individual to several party members must be covered by a donation statement which must be submitted to the Public Offices Commission and must be completed by the donor.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that certain expenses will not be taken into account within the terms laid down by the Bill and these are outlined under several headings. The Minister excludes such items as the payment of deposits, purchase of registers and the reasonable expenses of voluntary workers. I do not expect people to canvass for me from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. without offering them lunch and tea and, on a cold evening, a drink in the pub before they go home. People may not expect it, but it is what they richly deserve if they voluntarily spend their time work<Col N="1275" /> ing for a TD. Minor expenses incurred in the election are not included and neither are payments of services provided from public funds or institutions of the EU by virtue of the candidate being a member of a local authority. Other items excluded are any gratuitous service provided by an individual, such as the use of a motor car on behalf of a political party, newspaper publication where a newspaper is not published solely in a candidate's interest, normal political party broadcasts and expenses incurred relating to property, goods or services, where such items were previously provided in respect of an election and were included in the statement of election expenses at the time. An example of the reasonable thrust of the Bill is that it excludes the expenses of an elected representative's normal constituency expenses from being listed as an election expense. I welcome that. It is welcome that the Public Offices Commission accepted this view in recent by-elections. The language used in the definition of what constitutes a donation is unambiguous and not open to misinterpretation.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister has also seen fit to define the differences between local and Dáil elections in the Bill. It would be farcical at this stage to ask all local elections candidates to appoint election agents as laid down in the procedures for election to Dáil Éireann. It would be impossible to introduce limits on spending for them in light of the variance in the type of local authority, the vast number of candidates' agents who would have to make returns, the mathematics of 1,627 elected members making annual returns each year, the mass of documentation, all of which would has to be sent to Dublin, the cost to the candidates, successful and unsuccessful, of meeting their requirements and the additional heavy expense incurred by the Public Offices Commission in enforcing the requirements of section 72 of the Electoral Act, 1997.</P>
    <P>There is a compelling logic in the Minister's down to earth approach. Local elections are a small scale operation and the expenditure normally falls within certain predictable limits, but there is a still a requirement that all candidates disclose the sources of their funding. This is in line with the general principles laid down in the 1997 Act. The Minister, Deputy Dempsey, has given an undertaking that he will analyse the levels of expenditure to determine if, in future, spending limits should be set at varying levels for different sizes of authority. That is fair and acceptable and I do not understand why the Opposition takes a different view. It is normal practice to do this because there is no history of expenditure in such elections. Most EU states do not have curbs on expenses for local elections.</P>
    <P>The positive aspect of the Minister's approach is that candidates will not have to appoint election agents or have expenditure limits, but they will have to account for income and the disposal of that money, they will need to complete a simple form, they must outline individual donations <Col N="1276" /> over £500, and their statements will be accepted unless a written complaint is received or the figures do not appear to be credible. It is important these matters are clearly spelled out to all intending candidates. They must be made aware of the parameters within which they will operate. Non-conformity with these guidelines means candidates will be disqualified and will not be eligible for membership of the relevant local authority until the next local elections.</P>
    <P>It is practically impossible to run a campaign without financial support, whether it is from one's own resources, fundraising or donations. In addition, it is becoming increasingly difficult to raise money, to get people to attend party functions or to contribute in writing specifying an amount. Many people do not want their names associated with politicians. All moneys over £500 must be disclosed. Consideration should be given to the proposal that local authorities should pay for elections, including the production of literature and other required paraphernalia on a fair basis for all candidates.</P>
    <P>A recent outrageous article about me in <i>The Sunday Times</i> referred to an incident 20 years when I was an employee in a company. An attempt was made to link me to a matter with which I had nothing to do. It was distressing for me and my family. I received a donation from the principal of the company 20 years later. It has got to the stage where one is almost accused by association with people, whether they be acquaintances, friends or business contacts. It must be very difficult for people entering politics to put up with this. The person who made the accusations against me was fined for fraud in the courts in Dublin, the first person to be fined under the intermediaries legislation. While I could name him, I will not do so.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the excellent work of the city and county managers and to the elected representatives of local authorities. I am privileged and proud to be a member of Cork Corporation for the past eight years. I have enjoyed my work and being part of the development of Cork city.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dukes referred to the dual mandate. Councillors have served the country well. The Taoiseach was a member of a local authority, as were previous Taoisigh. I expressed my concerns about the dual mandate some time ago. While circumstances vary across constituencies, one's work as a councillor is connected with one's work as a Member of the Oireachtas. There is a social mix in my constituency of Cork North-Central and where housing and other such matters need attention there is a heavy demand for social services from elected public representatives, including Members of the Oireachtas and councillors. The situation may be different in Deputy Dukes's constituency &ndash; I do not know the make up of his constituency or of the constituency of any Member who does not believe the dual mandate is not necessary. Approximately 60 per cent of my work is local authority related while 40 per cent is <Col N="1277" /> related to Departments. In view of this, I welcome the Minister's decision not to proceed with his proposals for these elections but to consider the views expressed to him by members of my parliamentary party and other Members in the House.</P>
    <P>Among the proposals the Minister is considering is the right of audience for Oireachtas Members at local authorities in their council areas. For example, I cannot get documentation from Cork County Council on decisions it has made or is about to make even though I can get it from my own local authority because I am entitled to it. I hope the Minister agrees to this proposal when he introduces regulations prohibiting Oireachtas Members from standing for local elections in 2004. It is important that we give Oireachtas Members the right to attend and speak, but not vote, at local authority meetings.</P>
    <P>The most important by-laws our local authority made under the Electoral Act, 1994, dealt with the prohibition on the consumption of alcohol in public streets and places. At my instigation, Cork Corporation introduced by-laws on 1 November 1998. Members of other local authorities referred to similar measures last week. The public is beginning to respond positively to the by-laws. There have been 122 offenders to date. Many have paid the £25 on the spot fine and 39 are before the courts. The main offenders are a mixture of boys and girls in the 18 to 20 years age group. From 1 May, Cork Corporation will intensify its campaign to stop the ugly sight of drinking on the streets in an uncontrolled environment. We are also introducing new signage. This is a difficult problem throughout the country and I encourage other local authorities to consider the by-laws we have introduced. Some have taken the initiative and I encourage others to do so.</P>

      <P>I welcome the provisions of the Bill that refer to the disclosure of donations and the expenditure by candidates in all future local elections, including the election to be held in approximately five weeks. In view of the climate and allegations regarding payments to politicians, the House must extend the limit on donations to public representatives to local authority members. The current low esteem in which politicians are held by many members of the public and the media must be redressed. The politicians are the only ones who can do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the general election of 1997 a donation limit of £500 was imposed. The system appeared to be, and was, more fair. No candidate was in a position to receive large sums of money from those who might be perceived to have been in a position to unduly influence or place undue pressure after the election. In the long-term this provision <Col N="1278" /> will be good for politics and for politicians. It is right to attempt to remove the direct donation element from elections and to transfer State funds to political parties, the amount of money in question reflecting their popularity at the last election. The days of the brown envelope and the fistfuls of cash exchanging hands &ndash; we do not know for what &ndash; are gone.</P>
    <P>What we are witnessing today in the tribunals is a necessary part of the cleansing process to begin the long slow attempt to reinforce the public's confidence in politics and politicians. It will take time and it will not be 100 per cent successful, but this generation of politicians owes it to future generations to clean up the tarnished image. Perhaps there is no truth in the rumours we hear and perhaps there are innocent and plausible explanations. Who knows? I hope that is the case, but in the meantime the rumour machines are out and accusations are being made. We are all being tarred with the same brush. We must be seen to clean up our own shop. Who knows the business of election expenditure better than the politicians themselves?</P>
    <P>Like my colleagues, I am surprised and disappointed that there is to be no limit on the amount of money which may be spent by an individual candidate. This is crazy. The only people who will benefit are those who offer advertising space in the local media, print literature or deliver literature to letterboxes. That there is to be no limit on expenditure makes it very unfair on those candidates who do not have money to spend on elections or who will not be in a position to receive donations of £500 or £499. In some cases, there will certainly be more than one £500 donation. Where is the equity in this decision? There is no remuneration of local authority members. Many voluntary community workers want to contribute to local politics and to society. A cap on election expenditure would be desirable. I am pleased that Deputy Dukes will table amendments to that effect on Committee Stage. I hope the Minister will reconsider because that view has echoed across the Chamber.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that there are 3,500 candidates standing for election to county councils and corporations. A great deal of money will be spent unless there is some limit on expenditure. I am a candidate in the local elections. I already have a file of media proposals for buying advertising space in local newspapers, free sheets and newsletters. There are all sorts of proposals on offer between now and the middle of June. The way the sales people pitch their wares, one would almost believe one would not be elected unless one spends a certain amount on their particular newspaper. I am told all candidates are placing such advertisements and if one is not in, one will not win. It is a difficult decision to make. Perhaps we should all get together and say no to this, but who could trust whom in this situation? I have even received a suggestion from a local television channel that I buy advertising space along with all other candidates, but I do not believe this <Col N="1279" /> works. I would like to be able to say I will not take up their offer of advertising space because I am limited by law on the amount of money I can spend. The only people to benefit are the owners of the media. Those people must be rubbing their hands in delight at the thought of all the money they will make from the 3,500 candidates in this election.</P>
    <P>We saw the implementation of spending limits for the first time during last year's by-elections and it worked well. I was directly involved in Cork. The message was clearly brought home by election agents that not one penny more than £20,000 was to be spent in the by-election in the five seat constituency to which I referred. There was a real threat that if the successful candidate overspent during his or her election campaign, he or she risked losing the seat, a prospect no one relished.</P>
    <P>A limit on expenditure at elections, be they local elections, European elections or general elections, is a good and fair system, but it demands a great deal of time from a financial officer in the constituency. In the case to which I referred, we were fortunate to have an accountant acting as treasurer who was willing to fulfil that role. It is a difficult position and demands a great deal of commitment. It is not easy to find people who are willing to give such time on a voluntary basis.</P>
    <P>Mention was made of the dual mandate. I am not a member of a local authority and I was first elected to the Dáil almost two years ago. I feel the need to be a member of a local authority because otherwise I have no access to the documentation of the meetings or decisions of Cork Corporation or Cork County Council and I have no means of making representations, other than by letter, to the county or city manager or relevant agents. If the dual mandate is to be abolished, Members of the Oireachtas should be provided with access to, or allowed attend meetings of, their local authorities. That is essential to the delivery of a better service to the electorate. A subcommittee of the Joint Committee on Environment and Local Government, of which I am a member, recently produced a document on reform of local government and that was one of its recommendations. I am pleased the Minister is also considering this matter.</P>
    <P>The introduction of electronic voting is probably welcome and inevitable. It is sad, too, because there is a tradition of nail-biting finishes to election counts. Will the tallyman be redundant? The election count is a spectator sport for those who are not directly involved. I have certain reservations about doing away with it because it is enjoyable for everyone, except perhaps the candidates. The business is done when the polling booths are closed the night before and a certain calmness comes over candidates at that stage. They can do no more about it.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill but I have strong reservations about the fact that there is no cap on elec<Col N="1280" /> tion expenditure. That is essential, particularly in local elections which are about local people going forward to represent their areas. It is not about big spending and high powered election campaigns.</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny)</i>
        <b>:</b> I do not wish to repeat much of the criticism, but a cap on election expenditure has not been introduced in the Bill. While a previous speaker from the Government side stated he could not understand why it was not accepted at the outset, there should be consistency in the work of the Dáil. If a cap was introduced for Deputies, it should be introduced for all other elections, including the most minor ones. If there is justification for not introducing a cap on expenditure for local elections, a cap should not exist for general elections. It is like planning. If one can stand over planning decisions because of consistency, one is justified. It is when a contradiction arises and somebody gets planning permission which was previously refused that public representatives get into a knot.</P>
      <P>There should be consistency about that in the same way as there should be consistency about allowing chairpersons of Oireachtas committees to stand for election. It belittles politics when, for the sake of an important supporter of the Government, an Act introduced as recently as 1994 is changed in 1999 to allow that person to stand in the local elections. There is enough sarcasm and criticism from hurlers on the ditch without leaving ourselves open to that kind of criticism. It is absurd.</P>
      <P>While I am criticising, perhaps I should raise something which I have already discussed with the Minister on the Adjournment, the absence of photographs on the ballot papers at local elections. Ballot papers with photographs of candidates will be used for the European elections, but we cannot have such ballot papers for the local elections. This is a serious mistake on the part of the Minister. In the past his answer to me has been that one could not get printers to print photographs for the local elections. Every Mickey Mouse printer in the country can produce perfect photographs on canvas cards. One would be amazed at how they can improve the raw material they are given when they are asked to do the printing. I do not accept the silly argument that photographs cannot be printed. It is far more serious than worrying about other candidates and, as a senior member of the local scene who is past his fortieth birthday, I should not give the opportunity to young whippersnappers to pass me by. However, for the sake of voters, photographs should be printed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been approached by the adult literacy group, which is furious that its members are deprived of the right to vote. These people do not want to publicly admit that they cannot read. This is not something this group has made up. On one occasion a man said to me that he had asked me about having photographs on ballot papers before an election. He said that he would not <Col N="1281" /> embarrass his illiterate wife and daughter by asking them to vote again and in solidarity with them he would not vote. Therefore, three people did not vote in the following election. This is grossly unfair to such people, who would love to exercise their right to vote. They could go into a polling booth, recognise a photograph and vote for that person. It is almost a dereliction of duty on the Minister's part to allow photographs for the European elections but not the local elections, even though the candidates are better known.</P>
    <P>I would welcome electronic voting and counting. I disagree with my colleague, Deputy Clune, because it is not pleasurable to contest an election in a constituency that is one of the last to produce a result and to have to sit there while spectators enjoy the bloodsport. I am a candidate, not a spectator, and I want the result to be known just after the polling station closes, if possible. I did not enjoy sitting in the count centre, hoping that transfers would go the right way and I would be elected. I hope this experiment will work in the forthcoming elections and the system will be used again.</P>
    <P>I was surprised by the results of the recent survey carried out by the National Youth Council which found that 52 per cent of young people would vote in the forthcoming elections and approximately 33 per cent would not. Our young people are probably the best educated and have the best work opportunities since the foundation of the State. From my dealings with them, they are very much aware of that and will vote.</P>
    <P>I have spoken to students in schools and colleges, as has every Member, and I have been more than impressed with their interest in and knowledge of politics. These students are 18 years old and, thus are eligible to vote. I have the utmost confidence in them that they will vote. They said they would vote for young people and, again, I am at a slight disadvantage, but there will be young candidates for whom they can vote.</P>
    <P>I do not know what role the spokesperson for the National Youth Council has but I was dismayed when she appealed to politicians to produce political lollipops to encourage young people to vote. Apart from pointing out that voting is a privilege and a right that many people want to exercise but cannot in other countries, she should fully explain to them why they should vote. She misjudged the situation but may get an opportunity to talk to them again and encourage them to vote.</P>
    <P>Councillors do not get the expenses payments they deserve. There is a system in vogue currently via which councillors are given money for attending conferences. If councillors should get expenses for attending conferences, the local authorities and the Department should be prepared to pay them directly. Those of us who serve on local authorities know that some of our colleagues work almost as hard as we do, especially in rural areas, where they are asked to travel to places which have been flooded or which have housing problems and so on. They deserve to be <Col N="1282" /> paid expenses and should not have to go through the sham of travelling to conferences around the country which leads to people highlighting on radio programmes the fact that an individual did not attend a given conference. I am not suggesting that people should not attend conferences if they go to the venue but it is not easy for people who are used to working in the open air to sit in on lectures for an entire day. Councillors should be paid a certain amount for attending conferences. Some conferences are excellent and councillors who attend are trying to update their skills and knowledge. However, the bigger share of the money should be paid as expenses and I have said this on many occasions. They deserve it and abuse of the system would be avoided. There will always be people who will abuse systems but many outstanding councillors attend conferences, keep up to date with what is going on and provide an outstanding service to their electorate.</P>
    <P>Anything to do with expenses leads to a great deal of comment. This morning Ireland's leading radio presenter interviewed an MEP about the proposed new salary for Irish MEPs, which will bring them into line with the European average. It is ironic that we cannot find out what he earns, but if the rumour is right, he probably earns 10 times more than MEPs and 15 times more than Deputies. If the kettle could call the pot black long ago, Pat should not call the kettle black today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Bill has been introduced. It includes the same basic principles of the previous Bill on this issue in that donations must be disclosed. If the Public Offices Commission were involved and all of us had to declare every expenditure, the system would have been too democratic, totally unwieldy and impossible to operate. There is some merit in the idea of setting maximum spending guidelines, but how can this be done? There should be maximum spending guidelines rather than strict limits. However, the local elections are not the problem because large amounts of money are not spent on them. The spending limits for general election candidates in the previous Bill were too low and would not have been practical. I hope other means are being tried out in this Bill.</P>
      <P>I hope the forthcoming elections are successfully run, the principles underlining them are taken on board and the Electoral Act, 1997, is amended. While other speakers referred to the by-elections which were well run according to the new provisions of that Act there is a difference between running a by-election campaign where all the attention of a political party is focused on one candidate and a general election where there are three or four candidates and the organisation's focus and energy is spread around. They are two separate cases and, while the system may have been successful in a few by-elections, that does not mean it is viable &ndash; at least, I do not give it my vote of confidence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps, but the question is how one sets the limit. In general elections constituencies return three, four or five Members, but the size of an electoral area does not vary all that much. How can one set a limit for a local election? I understand some Members of this House will stand in the local elections on 11 June in electoral areas with a population of only 1,100, whereas other Deputies will stand in an area with a population of 63,000. What limit can be set and how would we fix it? If the limit is appropriate to an electoral ward of 63,000 people &ndash; I am not running in that ward &ndash; that would make nonsense of the Bill because for a person running in an electoral ward of 5,000 people or less, the figure that applies to the electoral area of 63,000 is meaningless. If this is to be done properly we must have a range of limits related to the size of the constituency. There is such a huge divergence in the size of electoral areas that one limit would be impossible. Perhaps one of Deputy Dukes's amendments will deal with this, but it must provide a scale of limits. However, the system would then become bureaucratic and people would lose the run of themselves.</P>
      <P>I have been selected and hope to run in the Ballymun-Whitehall ward, which is a three seat area. Ballymun covers 50 per cent of this ward, but the population of that area alone is equal to, if not greater than, the populations of County Leitrim, County Longford and County Carlow. Given the scale of the differences, it is impossible to have a single expenditure limit, regardless of how admirable that might be. There is no point in speakers lamenting this unless one provides a list of possible limits, and if that is introduced the scheme will become so complicated we will not know where we are.</P>
      <P>I was unhappy with the expenditure figures for Dáil elections set down in the 1997 Act. Thanks to the last boundary commission, at the next election I will stand in a three seat area where we will be able to spend £14,000, which simply is not enough. Like anyone else, I am entitled to fight to retain my job. The party hierarchy and the Comhairle Dáil Cheantair will fight to allocate 40 per cent to one person and 20 per cent to another, so I will be expected to fight for my seat with buttons. As with the previous legislation, the figures in this Bill are too low and should be amended. I am not the last of the big spenders, I spend enough to project myself and that is all, and at Dáil elections we should be allowed to spend more. This Bill goes in a different direction and I hope it is successful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also hope we amend the 1997 Act before the next general election because if we do not many <Col N="1284" /> candidates will be in trouble. That Act was passed in a great hurry and was not thought through. I envisage parties running extra candidates in some constituencies simply to be allowed to spend more money. There will be two real candidates and two others who will not canvass or look for votes, but because the party is running four candidates rather than two, it will be allowed to spend more.</P>
    <P>As I said, I am not speaking from the viewpoint of big spenders, although to listen to me it might sound like I have plenty of money. This aspect of the funding of elections makes me laugh. I have heard speakers from other parties suggest that my party is wealthy, but the picture in the constituencies is quite different &ndash; it is the other parties who have the money. At the last election one Fine Gael candidate mis-spent enormous amounts of money and lost his running mate's seat in the process.</P>

      <P>I looked with envy at the Labour candidate's fabulous cardboard posters while I had cheap posters. She looked well on those posters but she gives the impression that her party has not one penny and that I represent the party of the rich. The best leaflet I saw in the last election was sent out by the Democratic Left candidate in Dublin North-Central. She received only 1,000 votes, but I do not know what that proves. It was a fabulous production and if I had produced something like it I would have thought I was on the pig's back.</P>
      <P>After we achieve equality and it is set down that all candidates spend the same amount, almost to the penny, what will happen? What one spends on leaflets and posters is only one aspect of the matter. Will we then demand that all candidates receive the same number of seconds on radio or television or column inches in the newspapers? I do my work as a backbench TD and am not good at preening myself on the plinth outside Leinster House or currying favour with the media. If we have to spend equal amounts of money, the next step must be rules and regulations for the media. Before RTE invites a Deputy to appear on a programme, it should have to check how many minutes and seconds he or she has been on television or radio over the last six weeks or six months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am delighted with section 6 of the Bill because it deals with an extraordinary anomaly in the 1997 Act, which I pointed out at the time. That legislation laid down rules for a candidate projecting himself or herself in the best possible way, but there were no rules about how much one could spend denigrating other candidates. I congratulate the Minister and the officials on filling this loophole. One can talk about fairness and equality, but whatever money one spends putting oneself forward in a positive way is all right. The danger opened up by the previous legislation was <Col N="1285" /> that a limit was put on how much money one could spend presenting oneself in the best possible way, but a candidate could set up a front organisation and spend as much as he or she liked in a campaign to do down, say, Deputy Neville.</P>

      <P>This was legitimate and no one could complain about it. That was an appalling mistake in the Bill and I am delighted it has been corrected so that such groups will have to register. That is right and proper.</P>
      <P>Last week Deputy Gilmore spoke about local residents' associations opposing candidates. I accept that you can turn any argument on its head or try to destroy it, but what is wrong with a local residents' association publishing a newsletter which outlines who has been helpful and who has not? However, it must also be recognised that such groups could have introduced an extraordinarily negative twist into the Irish political system which would have been appalling. I am delighted this has been nipped in the bud.</P>
      <P>It is not enough to take this type of action in respect of local elections. The Electoral Act, 1997, must be amended before the next general election because if you tie people down in one direction they are bound to shoot off in another direction. It is easy to establish and fund a campaign to smear a colleague. I welcome the positive provision in the Bill which will put a stop to such behaviour.</P>
      <P>I am pleased the chairpersons of Dáil committees will be permitted to run in the local elections. I am disappointed Members of this House who intend to run in the elections will be disbarred from becoming lord mayor or chairman of their county council if they gain election. I see no logic in that provision which was introduced in legislation a number of years ago. However, the fact that it is law does not mean it is right. I believe it is wrong. Given that the dual mandate will be removed in five years, everyone should continue to be treated equally. That was the recommendation of the sub-committee of the Joint Committee on Environment and Local Government which has been working on this matter. The sub-committee stated that the fact that the dual mandate will be abolished in five years is fine but that, until then, chairpersons of Dáil committees should be permitted to run and that they should be allowed to take up any office on being elected. It is scandalous that Deputies who are elected will be told they are not as good as other representatives and that they cannot serve as lord mayor or chairman of their county council. That is an appalling provision and I would be interested to see if someone will take a case before the courts to test its validity. It is unfair and wrong. I do not know how people feel about serving as chairman of their county council but we all aspire to becoming lord mayor of our cities. It is terrible to be informed, even after election to the city council, that you have to abandon that aspiration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1286" /> Last week the Joint Committee on Environment and Local Government discussed the forthcoming legislation in this area which will make provision for the direct election of lord mayors. I am aware of the origin of that idea and I wonder if we are merely looking at what is being done in London and running off half cocked. Why introduce direct elections in respect of local government and not in respect of central Government? The Taoiseach of the day is not elected by the people, he is chosen by his peers in whatever party or coalition of parties hold a majority of seats in this House. What will a popular candidate directly elected to the office of lord mayor of Dublin do if he or she is opposed by the 51 other councillors?</P>
    <P>We are concerned with raising the status of lord mayors or chairmen of county councils and giving them real power rather than having them serve as figureheads. However, if they are to be given real power, they will have to be able to use it, but they will not be able to do so unless they have the support of a party. This is a great idea in respect of the lord mayors we elect at present, namely, figureheads, but it is not suitable for lord mayors with real executive powers.</P>
    <P>I wish to put a number of questions to the Minister of State. I accept the provision where a person is obliged to disclose any donation of £500 or over. If I receive ten other donations of £100 each I will not be obliged to disclose the names of the donors. However, when submitting my return to the county or city council at the end of the campaign, will I be obliged to state that I received a donation of £500 from Joe Murphy and further donations totalling £1,000?</P>
    <P>I understand that anything I purchase before and use after the polling day order must be recorded. Will I be allowed to purchase 1,000, 2,000 or 5,000 corrugated board posters, put them on display for the duration of the campaign, take them down, store them and use them in the next general election campaign without being bothered or pursued by the Public Offices Commission? I am seeking confirmation from the Minister of State because if I seek it from the Public Offices Commission, it will request 20 additional officials to consider the matter and delve into the detail of it.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister of State will provide a common sense response because, in my opinion, reusing posters is a form of recycling. A number of weeks ago he appeared in the House to discuss reuse, recycling, waste minimisation etc. If I purchase posters, display them, collect them after the campaign and store them in my garage, will I be allowed use them in the next general election campaign or will I be pursued and asked to return them? If the Public Offices Commission informs me that it is wrong to reuse my posters, the law is an ass because preventing me from doing so runs contrary to the type of behaviour the Minister of State is trying to promote in terms of waste recycling etc.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1287" /> The legislation is acceptable and should be allowed to govern the local government elections. However, we should amend the Electoral Act before the next general election because otherwise we will all encounter tremendous difficulties. A spending limit is fine once constituencies are roughly equal in size. However, it is not possible to impose such a limit when constituencies vary in size from those with 1,100 inhabitants to those with 63,000.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill and pay tribute to the work carried out during the past century by those who volunteered to enter local government. It is not easy to seek election. An enormous contribution has been made to the State, our democracy and the people by those who sought election to local government and we must ensure that tradition of service continues.</P>
      <P>Times are changing and it will be difficult to find people who will be willing to volunteer to serve in local government and who can afford to devote more time to their work than did their predecessors. I have served on a local council since 1985 which is affected by a democratic deficit in that there are few PAYE workers serving on it. Teachers, the self-employed, farmers, publicans and others serve on the council because they are in a position to manage their time. PAYE workers are not represented in local government in proportion to their number in the State. That is because they are not in a position or do not get permission to take time off work or there is no system to facilitate them to become more actively involved at local government level. A small number of corporations hold meetings at 6 p.m. or 7 p.m. which helps but, by and large, local authorities meet during working hours. As a result local representatives who work in factories, companies, shops, restaurants and hotels are thin on the ground. An objective of our system is that all areas of society should be represented at local government level, but they are not.</P>
      <P>When I was elected in 1985 I worked in the PAYE sector. I was lucky that the company for which I worked encouraged and supported me to become involved in local government, but some of my co-workers resented that I got time off to do so. There is not a system in place to assist workers to become involved in local government. My company was very supportive but it is unique. I hope the fact that I was made redundant in 1987 had nothing to do with my being elected to local government in 1985. We should consider this aspect when examining the area of local government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Bill. My party favours maximum disclosure. While I do not want to repeat what <Col N="1288" /> others said, I disagree with a point made by Deputy Noel Ahern. I believe a formula can be drawn up to ensure there is a cap on expenditure. That should be an important aspect of the Bill. As previous speakers said, including Deputy Noel Ahern who spoke about posters and fancy leaflets, we must endeavour to ensure the field is as level as possible and that those who can command large funds do not have an edge over candidates who cannot get the same level of funds. While there are inherent difficulties because of the difference in the size of local government constituencies, something should be done to ensure the field is as level as possible.</P>
    <P>We must ensure powers are given back to local government. We are all aware that local government has lacked the necessary powers. I will not go into the reasons for that because my time is limited, but we must find a way to ensure responsibility for various functions is given back to local government. One of the main ways a local authority can exercise power is through the collection of taxes. I welcome the small move in the discretionary figure for car tax, but I do not know how effective it will be. When the roads in my constituency were in a poor state back in 1994-5, my council bit the bullet and significantly raised taxes. We did our duty. While some concerns were expressed about that, we were respected for doing it and we got the results. The then Minister recognised we were making progress and gave us matching funds and the necessary action was taken to address that problem. Councillors will take responsibility when they have to, but responsibility was taken away from them. Deputy Dukes spoke about this. He is keen to ensure responsibility for many areas is given back to local councillors.</P>
    <P>Major changes have taken place in the planning area, especially in rural areas. A policy is developing which seems to encourage people living in rural areas to move to towns and cities. Those who want to live in the country encounter many obstacles. I appreciate there are environmental problems in certain cases and nobody wants to damage the environment. While there has been talk about ribbon development and about areas not been serviced for development, we are basically a rural community and many of our people want to live in rural areas. Many Dublin people are only one or two generations removed from rural contact. People living in rural Ireland want to stay there but the planners want them to live in cities. They have seen what has happened in other countries and believe that is the way we should go. I object to that because the rural aspect of our people is a key element of our culture and, as a people, our aspiration is to remain rural. Ribbon development in my area has created a fantastic community. It ensured teachers remained in schools, hurling and soccer teams remained in the area and it has kept life in the community. However, planning permission for such development would not be given today; that is a is a backward step.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1289" /> Local government is damaged by certain aspects not least by the fact that there are a thousand people on the housing waiting list in County Limerick. We have not responded to the changes that have taken place in society, not least to the needs of single mothers. More than 20 per cent of children born last year were to single mothers.</P>
    <P>We have not responded to the need for sewerage schemes. I could name six sewerage schemes in my county in respect of which applications date back ten years. I have been told the plans submitted for them are out of date and that the process will have to recommence. I hope we will not have to wait another seven or eight years for approval of these schemes.</P>
    <P>It is reported that young people will not vote in the forthcoming elections. An opinion poll conducted by the National Youth Council of Ireland in the Minister of State's county yesterday showed that almost half of the eligible voters under the age of 25 may not vote in the local elections. I am not surprised by that finding because the political process has no interest in young people. I am not targeting the Government as being responsible for this. The political process has no interest in people under the age of 18. We do not respond to the needs of children and young people. We have not responded to the difficulties or crises they face. We do not honour our commitment under the UN Convention on Human Rights and we do not have an ombudsman for children. We have not responded to the alarming increase in the incidence of suicide among young men. On numerous occasions over the past 12 months I called for an examination of this issue, but neither the media nor the political process has shown any interest in it. Given that, we cannot expect young people to respond to the political process when they reach the age of 18.</P>

      <P>While there has been an impressive growth in the number of privately owned swimming pools in recent years, unfortunately, many of these facilities are outside the financial reach of many people. Family membership for many of these centres can cost anything up to £1,000 per year. The growth of private leisure centres has taken place at a time of rapid deterioration in the condition of public facilities. There is now a large number of public swimming pools that are sub-standard and in urgent need of major refurbishment. The poor physical condition of many of them has meant that attendance figures have dropped off dramatically in recent years. This has happened at a time when we should be encouraging people, young and old, to become more involved in exercise for health reasons but also getting young people involved in a leisure activity instead of the anti-social activities to which many are attracted.</P>
      <P>The Minister has a personal interest in this matter. If we invest in sport and recreation we will help young people to stay on the straight and narrow. Sport and recreation are the greatest preventative elements in the fight against crime and drugs. There have been many striking examples in recent years of crime and drug taking dropping dramatically as a result of properly organised facilities being put into disadvantaged areas.</P>
      <P>In response to a parliamentary question submitted by me on Tuesday, 23 March 1999, the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation replied that there are over 60 pools owned and managed by local authorities throughout the country, which were mainly built mainly in the 1960s and 1970s. In fact, in looking at the records, I discovered that some were built way back in the 1930s. The pools at Templemore and Tullamore were built in 1935 and 1937 respectively. It is obvious. therefore, that the majority of these pools are absolutely unattractive and do not meet modern day requirements.</P>
      <P>According to the reply I received on 23 March, the pool in Ballyshannon was built in 1974, the one in Dunmanway in 1978, the one in Tuam in 1971, those in Portlaoise and Portarlington in 1974, the one in Longford Town in 1968 and the one in Castlerea in 1940. Those figures give an idea of the existing position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1291" /> The Minister also confirmed that at present he has grant applications for refurbishment totalling almost £20 million. This figure is conservative and will escalate dramatically because of the rapid deterioration in the condition of many pools. The cost will escalate within a short time from the £20 million outlined in the Minister's reply, nearer to a figure of between £40 and £50 million.</P>
    <P>Further to the demands for refurbishment grants, it is my information that the Minister has at least four applications from local authorities for new pools currently on his desk, as well as one application from an organisation other than a local authority. Perhaps the Minister of State will quantify exactly the number of applications from local authorities that have been made.</P>
    <P>The development of new pools and the refurbishment of existing public pools was until recently the responsibility of the Department of the Environment and Local Government. That was with the exception of the pools defined in the plans for the regional sports complexes. The budget for meeting the demands placed on the Department of the Environment and Local Government was approximately £3 million per annum which was met from the proceeds of the national lottery.</P>
    <P>The Minister is currently considering proposals for the refurbishment of 14 pools operated by local authorities, as well as demands for new facilities in a number of areas. The pools that require refurbishment are at Glenalbyn in Dún Laoghaire, under the control of the local county council; Galway County Council's pool at Tuam; pools at Naas and Athy under the control of Kildare County Council and pools at Portarlington, Castlebar and Roscommon.</P>
    <P>Dublin Corporation is proposing to carry out major refurbishment at Ballymun costing £2.7 million, while at the same time there is a request for a pool at Finglas, at the same cost. Drogheda Corporation has made an application for a pool at Rathmullen at a total cost of £2 million, while Wexford Corporation has requested £1.162 million for a development at Ferry Bank. Ballinasloe UDC has applied for £1.2 million towards the cost of refurbishing its pool, while Thurles UDC has applied for £1.5 million and Tralee UDC has applied for just under £1 million.</P>
    <P>This level of demand indicates that there is now a serious problem nationally with the condition of our pools and further requests for major grant aid will be made shortly by a number of local authorities.</P>
    <P>A total of 48 public indoor pools were built between 1966 and 1974, 32 of those by local authorities. These pools were built mainly on the basis of the 1972 Department of the Environment guidelines prior to the oil crisis of 1974. As a result of obsolete systems and inadequate maintenance programmes, a rapid deterioration in the actual building fabric has occurred in recent years, resulting in a high number of pools <Col N="1292" /> throughout the country being in urgent need of refurbishment.</P>
    <P>There is now a serious crisis in swimming pool funding, particularly in relation to the refurbishment of facilities. It now seems that between £40 and £50 million will be required for the redevelopment of these outdated pools. This issue must be addressed within a short time.</P>
    <P>When I took office as Minister of State with responsibility for sport in 1995, I set up an expert group to look at sports facilities. I asked the group to consult with the Institute for Leisure and Amenity Management. The group, in its report entitled <i>Targeting Sporting Change in Ireland</i>, published in February 1997, stated that the planning criteria used by the Department of Environment and Local Government and the specifications for swimming pools were in need of urgent revision to take account of recent technological developments, market based planning, demand for conventional leisure pools and the need for professional management structures and operators. It also found that, even though the Departments of Education and Science and the Environment and Local Government were currently funding swimming pools &ndash; this was in 1997 &ndash; the co-ordinated planning of such facilities in Ireland at an interdepartmental level was very poor. That report also found that the approach of various local authorities throughout the country to the management of public swimming pools was quite diverse. It also found that public swimming pool facilities operated by community based independent management companies employing professional personnel were far more successful than those directly operated by local authorities in terms of usage, service quality and financial performance. The report also found that there was an urgent need for all local authorities to develop a comprehensive sports and recreation strategy which addressed all aspects of sport and recreation development, including the provision and management of swimming pool facilities.</P>
    <P>It has been proved in Cork city, for example, that a modern, professionally managed public swimming pool, supported by the local authority, will achieve standards in terms of the number of users, service quality and financial performance never reached by centres operated directly by local authorities.</P>
    <P>Swim World in Cork, which was Government funded and operated by a management group under licence from Cork Corporation, has surpassed all targets and, since its opening in 1997, has embarked on a further development involving gymnasium facilities which are complementary to the main activity. This has been done in response to public demand for the facility and it is making a profit.</P>
    <P>Members of the Oireachtas Committee on Tourism, Sport and Recreation recently received the report of the review group on the sports capital programme which was completed in December 1998. This report has raised major issues in relation to the future spending on capital <Col N="1293" /> projects. One question that needs to be answered is whether we should be spending vast amounts of money on high profile projects at a time when basic facilities in every parish, village, town, city and county are grossly inadequate. Should the Government be planning to spend at least £100 million, if not more, on a national stadium when the same money could be spent to develop facilities throughout the country which would get everyone, and young people especially, involved in sport and recreation? Should we be supporting the root and branch development of sport and recreation for all ages at community level which will ensure a healthy sporting structure at national level? Should these high profile projects be embarked upon at a serious cost to quality and quantity of facilities at local level?</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach answered a question from Deputy John Bruton which confirmed that over £350,000 has been spent on a feasibility study concerning a national outdoor arena. This at a time when Croke Park is being developed to an ultramodern standard, when the FAI is planning a national stadium in west Dublin and when the IRFU is considering either a stadium at Newlands Cross or developing Lansdowne Road. This consultants' report is a waste of money. They will tell us either what we know already or something the Department should have the expertise to tell us. Given the crisis in swimming pools throughout the country, spending this money on feasibility studies is scandalous and there are major questions to be answered as a result.</P>
    <P>In recent years, we have seen a high profile demand for a 50 metre swimming pool in Ireland. That demand is reasonable and realistic, but it must be considered in the context of the serious situation I have outlined, which may not be popular. The report of the review group is helpful but a national sports inventory should be immediately undertaken which would examine the size, location, age and condition of existing facilities and equipment. More immediately, an inventory of all swimming facilities should be undertaken. This could be done in a matter of months and informed decisions could then be made on the use of resources based on that inventory.</P>
    <P>In considering the most effective use of the available resources, consideration must be given to joint ventures in the development of national and regional facilities. I am disappointed that the recent review group report does not examine the possible use of tax incentives to encourage private sector investment in joint ventures. The major challenge now is to develop top quality outdoor and indoor facilities capable of meeting the needs of communities as well as the requirements of those who need top class facilities for training and competition. The Government cannot do everything and is unable to meet all demands. The Minister told us recently that 1,900 applications for funding throughout the country have been lodged with his Department. However, <Col N="1294" /> we must consider the volunteer ethos and enthusiasm among organisations and communities and we must satisfy their needs in an ordered way. The Government cannot meet all demands for financial support; therefore it is vital that financial incentives be put in place to make the provision of facilities profitable ventures as well as socially desirable. Tax incentives for joint venture sporting complexes and rates relief must be considered.</P>
    <P>There will also have to be greater co-ordination between Departments, as I have mentioned in the past. It is beyond comprehension that so many Departments are involved in sport. The Department of Education and Science provides physical education and sports halls and outdoor activity centres; the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources is involved in marine activities and the Department of Defence is involved in equestrian sport and provides playing pitches. The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment provides FÁS courses for sports coaches while the Department of Health and Children is involved in preventative measures in the sports area. Both the Department of the Environment and Local Government and Justice, Equality and Law Reform also have major roles.</P>
    <P>In the provision of this inventory we must also look at the under-usage of existing facilities. I refer to sports and school halls throughout the country. There is no purpose in funding sports halls that are open from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday to Friday, but are locked at weekends. I have seen scandalous scenes in areas devoid of sporting facilities where the gates were not just locked but greased so that young people could not get in to use the hard surface areas of these facilities. There will have to be realistic co-ordination between the Departments of Tourism, Sport and Recreation and Education and Science to free up these facilities. They must be open to those who need them most &ndash; young people.</P>

      <P>Public policy in the UK is that everyone over the age of eight must learn to swim; a similar policy is needed here. However, it cannot be implemented unless there are adequate facilities. In 1998, 60 people died by accidental drowning. In welcoming the Government's plan to develop an inland rescue service similar to the coastal service, we must remember that prevention is better than cure. Only a small percentage of young people in inland counties have learned to swim. A 50 metre pool will be a wonderful facility but we must ensure that our existing 25 metre pools are upgraded. There will not be top class swimmers to compete in our 50 metre pool if young people cannot take part in the sport in <Col N="1295" /> their own communities and towns. We must invest in the refurbishment of 25 metre pools before we spend money on a 50 metre pool. Flagship projects are well and good but we must develop facilities throughout the country to encourage young athletes who can go on to avail of these flagship facilities.</P>
      <P>Last year a drowning tragedy occurred in County Sligo. On 18 May 1998 a newspaper headline read, &ldquo;Three teenagers feared drowned off Sligo&rdquo;. That fear was well founded and the bodies of three young men were recovered from the sea. The three friends were non-swimmers and had got into difficulty while wading in the sea off Strandhill, County Sligo. On a visit to the location of the tragedy, the Taoiseach promised that the Government would try to ensure that such an accident would never recur. Serious questions are being raised about water safety but it has taken a tragedy such as that at Strandhill to focus our minds. The Sligo accident has cast a cloud over the standard of swimming education in Ireland. Of the four teenagers who got into difficulty, none could swim, let alone practise life saving techniques.</P>
      <P>The three teenagers from Sligo lived on the border of County Roscommon. One attended the school in Ballaghadereen which has applied to the Minister for the provision of a swimming pool. Ballaghaderreen has a large hinterland and is equidistant from Boyle and Castlerea, the other major towns in the area. More than 800 second level students attend the local school and there is a great need for a pool in the area. The people of the town have raised £250,000 towards the provision of a pool but the Minister has failed to provide the necessary extra funding.</P>
      <P>Two further applications for the refurbishment of the swimming pools in Castlerea and Roscommon town are on the Minister's desk, . The pool in Roscommon town has a list of defects which includes a roof constructed of asbestos, an inoperable air ventilation system, a water-heating and filtering system which would be more appropriately housed in the National Museum and changing facilities which are politely defined as sub-standard. The water level in the pool is maintained by direct flow from tap water and the pool itself is leaking. The local sub-aqua club who provide an excellent search and rescue service in the county used to use the pool for training. This organisation is vitally important in a county such as Roscommon which borders the rivers Shannon and Suck. However, as the pool is now closed, the members of the club must travel to Ballinasloe, more than 30 miles away, to train. This puts increased financial pressure on a voluntary organisation which is inadequately funded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The third application on the Minister's desk is for the refurbishment of Castlerea swimming <Col N="1296" /> pool. This is an outdoor pool and the funding required is modest in relation to the overall budget for pools. The pool was erected by the local community through their own persistence and they are now seeking a helping hand from the Government to carry out works including the refurbishment of the changing facilities. The Minister must now recognise the community spirit of the people of Castlerea by providing the required funds. It is a disgrace that a county surrounded by inland waterways does not have a proper swimming pool. It is also a disgrace for the Government to fund the provision of a 50 metre pool while neglecting our existing 25 metre pools. The Minister must urgently approve these applications and ensure that the work is done as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Similar problems exist in other inland counties. My own county has suffered from the lack of investment in swimming pools. Inland counties should receive priority funding for swimming pools. The counties of Laois and Offaly and many other inland counties have serious problems with regard to swimming pools. While coastal counties appear to receive adequate funding for pools, inland counties fail to do so. Swimming pools are not provided where they are needed. People in inland counties do not have an opportunity to swim until they go to the sea. This presents enormous risks.</P>
    <P>A number of tragedies have occurred and 60 lives were lost in 1998. Many of those people came from inland counties and did not have basic swimming skills. We must provide training in swimming. Last year, 39,975 swimming certificates were awarded. Many of these were awarded in County Roscommon and tremendous work is being done in Roscommon town swimming pool, training young people in swimming, safety and survival and rescue. This opportunity will not be available in 1999 because Roscommon town swimming pool &ndash; one of only two swimming pools in the county and the only indoor pool &ndash; is now closed because of lack of funds. A tendering process will be instituted in the near future but without a commitment of Government funds, facilities will not be developed. County Roscommon is bounded by rivers and lakes, yet the county does not have basic facilities to teach swimming and water safety. While the Minister promotes the building of a 50 metre pool, young people in County Roscommon are denied this basic facility.</P>
    <P>I compliment Deput Allen on proposing this motion and I ask the Minister to accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune" hpid="Ms Clune Ms Clune">
      <NameTxt>Ms Clune</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate my colleague, Deputy Allen on bringing this important subject before the House. We must upgrade our existing swimming facilities. In providing new pools, we must not forget the existing infrastructure and the need to upgrade it. Many of the pools I refer to were <Col N="1297" /> built in the late 1960s and early 1970s and are sadly in need of refurbishment. They have dilapidated heating systems, ventilating systems which do not work, substandard changing facilities, and pools which are leaking. Many of these pools are health hazards. In a pool in my own locality there has been an outbreak of verruca and other foot infections. I have been in one of these pools myself and I know it is not of a satisfactory standard.</P>
      <P>Swimming is an essential part of a person's education and should be an integral part of our education system. Many schools use local pools to teach pupils to swim but this can be difficult. To do so depends on the goodwill of staff and on the availability of teachers with the necessary skills and qualifications. The school with which I am involved is fortunate in having a swimming coach on the staff but many schools are not so fortunate.</P>
      <P>Ireland is surrounded by water. We are a seafaring and boating nation, yet we do not have a history of competence in swimming. In the tragic accident referred to by Deputy Naughton, three young people died because they could not swim. This is a sad reflection on our education system and on the standard of our swimming facilities.</P>
      <P>Swimming is a healthy activity. It is recommended as an exercise which promotes aerobic fitness and should be encouraged for that reason.</P>
      <P>The Gus Healy Swimming Pool in Douglas, Cork &ndash; named after our late colleague and Lord Mayor of Cork &ndash; is in a very sad state. It is in need of refurbishment and upgrading having been neglected for many years. It is in competition with private leisure facilities in hotels throughout the city which offer membership at exorbitant cost, up to £1,000 for a family for a year.</P>
      <P>The municipal pool should be an essential part of every community. Some offer reduced rates to old age pensioners and the unemployed to encourage them to use their leisure time more effectively. Young people should also be encouraged to learn to swim in order to keep them off the street and thus contribute to a better society.</P>
      <P>Deputy Allen mentioned the swimming pools throughout the country that are in need of refurbishment. Some are dilapidated and could be deemed to be a health hazard. I hope the Minister will provide the necessary moneys.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I pay tribute to Deputy Allen on bringing forward this motion. There is a need to ensure proper facilities are provided. The previous Government committed funds to the refurbishment of the swimming pool in my home town of Monaghan for which the Government has agreed to provide additional funding. As the pool is in constant use, many have to travel to Armagh and further afield to avail of <Col N="1298" /> alternative facilities. There is an enormous need for a swimming pool in Castleblayney. Pupils and others from the town as well as from Carrickmacross have to travel long distances to avail of such a facility.</P>
      <P>I pay tribute to Deputy Allen for giving a commitment, when Minister of State, to a community group in Bailieboro which had raised funds for a swimming pool. Because of the generosity of a specific donor, its task was made much easier. Others may claim credit but were it not for the efforts of Deputy Allen, with encouragement from Deputy Boylan and me, the project may not have proceeded. As there is no direct access from my constituency to the sea, there is a need to provide proper swimming facilities.</P>
      <P>Sub-aqua clubs need to be supported. There is an extremely good one in County Monaghan which was involved in a recent rescue of the wrong sort. Monaghan County Council is looking at the possibility of providing it with a permanent base. It will be seeking the necessary funding from the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>As highlighted last year in one of the most comprehensive studies ever undertaken, lack of funding and lack of planning are the major difficulties facing sport. The overall thrust of the 109 page document is that there is a piecemeal approach. Funding for facilities and, particularly, coaching at community level is drawn from a variety of sources, including the national lottery, the Department of Education and Science, the Department of the Environment and Local Government, the EU Operational Programme for Tourism, local authorities and the private sector, between which there are no structured links. The study highlights the need for strategic planning which should be seen as an immediate priority.</P>
      <P>A number of problems need to be addressed. Outdated public swimming pool facilities should be refurbished as a matter of urgency. A total of 48 public indoor swimming pools were built between 1966 and 1974, 32 by local authorities. They were built in accordance with Department of the Environment and Local Government guidelines before the oil crisis of 1974. As a result of obsolete systems and inadequate maintenance programmes, there has been rapid deterioration during the years. A high number are in urgent need of attention. Between £40 million and £50 million is required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 118 local authorities which are controlled by the Department of the Environment and Local Government provide the greatest level of funding to sport. In 1995 combined expenditure on sport and recreational amenities came to £108 million. According to the report, Targeting Sporting Change in Ireland, for which Deputy Allen must be complimented for initiating, there is a lack of strategic planning. Since the introduction of com<Col N="1299" /> pulsory competitive tendering in 1991, local authorities in Britain and Northern Ireland have a responsibility to provide sports and leisure facilities.</P>
    <P>In a parliamentary question Deputy Allen asked the Minister the swimming pools operated by local authorities; the year in which they were built; the size of each pool; if there are applications from relevant local authorities for upgrading of these pools and, if so, the individual amounts applied for. The list is startling. It includes swimming pools from Tuam to Ballymun and Finglas in Dublin and from Ballinasloe to Thurles and Tralee. I appeal to the Government to make the necessary funds available. It would make economic sense.</P>
    <P>The Sports Council in the United Kingdom is listed as one of the agencies to be consulted in local development as part of which the provision of swimming pools is sought. Here there is a lack of vision in terms of how the available funding should be used. Much was expected of the Minister when he was appointed to Cabinet and also of the Taoiseach who has a huge interest in sport, although his interest has not been obvious in monetary terms. I compliment Deputy Allen for initiating this important debate and I appeal to the Government to make funds available for the renovation and opening of pools, which are urgently needed.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to outline to the House the Government's programme to contribute to the provision of sports facilities, including swimming pool facilities throughout the country.</P>
      <P>Sport makes a unique contribution to society. It contributes in a special way to our social and economic development and has a significant and enriching impact on our culture and identity. Sport has obvious benefits in promoting health and fitness as well as having a commercial and economic significance. Sporting achievements provide a morale boost for the country at large, focus international attention on our country and promote our image as an attractive place to visit and to invest in to generate new jobs.</P>
      <P>Our high achievers in sport are excellent ambassadors for modem Ireland typifying as they do the self-confidence and commitment of today's generation of young Irish people. In other words, sport is a major contributor to the quality of life in Ireland today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In line with this Government's recognition of the value of sport and leisure to the physical and <Col N="1300" /> mental health of each individual, especially the role they can play in fostering a sense of community identity in even the most deprived areas, we have set a goal for our Department as follows: to formulate and oversee the implementation of policies for the promotion and development of sport and to encourage increased participation in sport and recreation, particularly by disadvantaged communities.</P>
    <P>To achieve this goal a number of key objectives have been set, namely: to develop a new policy framework for the promotion and development of sport and recreation; to promote a more strategic approach to the use of available resources for sport and recreation in Ireland by a sector driven mainly by voluntary effort; to develop a new holistic system of supports for high performance by athletes; to help overcome the isolating effects of social exclusion in disadvantaged areas by developing appropriate sport and recreational strategies for those areas and to encourage the promotion of standards of good conduct and fair play in sport.</P>
    <P>This Government has brought a new drive and momentum to the development of sport. This is borne out by the fact that the amount of funding available for sport has been increased significantly by this Government. This year we will spend £39 million per year on sport compared with £13 million per year when the rainbow government left office. As the first Cabinet Minister with responsibility for sport, Deputy McDaid, is proud, as am I, that this is the largest annual budget ever allocated by a Government to assist development in sport.</P>
    <P>As we all know, swimming is generally considered to be one of the best forms of exercise for developing and maintaining high levels of physical fitness. It is a sport in which most people can participate from a very early age throughout their lives. Swimming is a most basic, natural and efficient way of taking exercise. It is also an exercise in which many disabled people participate and which brings great joy and satisfaction to their lives.</P>
    <P>The National Survey of Involvement in Sport and Physical Activity published in 1996 showed that swimming was second only to walking as the most popular form of physical recreational activity. This survey, which covered people between the ages of 16 and 75 years of age, indicated that around 425,000 people participate in swimming. In addition the survey pointed out that more people wanted to swim and wished that more swimming facilities would be provided.</P>
    <P>The development of a quality infrastructure is crucial in the implementation of sport policy. In this context, the sports capital and swimming pool programmes, administered by my Department, are very important.</P>
    <P>The sports capital programme provides national lottery funding towards the provision of <Col N="1301" /> sport and recreational sport facilities at national, regional and local levels. It is the primary vehicle for promoting the development of such facilities and I am happy to say the Government has committed more than £50 million from the lottery to the programme over the next three years. This is a three fold increase over what was provided in the previous three years. Funding allocated under the programme assists sports clubs, voluntary and community groups to construct, refurbish, improve and equip high quality, well-designed and sustainable sport and recreational sport facilities.</P>
    <P>A comprehensive review of the programme was undertaken by my Department in 1998 and as a result, a new programme was developed with revised aims and objectives, assessment criteria and terms and conditions for grant assistance.</P>
    <P>Under the new programme special priority is being given to the development of facilities in disadvantaged areas in line with Government policy aimed at increasing participation in sport and recreation, particularly in those areas. Some 1,900 applications have been received for funding under the programme in respect of a variety of sporting facilities.</P>
    <P>These applications are currently being examined in my Department and given the large number of applications received and the level of work involved in assessing them, we expect to be in a position to make final announcements on the 1999 round of grant allocations later this year.</P>
    <P>In addition to the funding available under the sports capital programme for the development of sports facilities in disadvantaged areas, I remind the House of the announcement made yesterday in the presence of the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and my colleague, the Minister, Deputy McDaid, in connection with the allocation of more than £25 million for the provision of facilities and services including sports facilities in the 13 drugs task force areas of Dublin and Cork City.</P>
    <P>This funding, which is being allocated under the Young Peoples Facilities and Services Fund, will contribute to the provision of 86 capital facilities in the 13 areas over three years. Of these 86 capital projects, 20 will be sports and recreation facilities.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Young People's Facilities and Services Fund is to assist the development of preventative drug strategies in a targeted manner, through the development of youth, sport and recreational facilities and services in disadvantaged areas. The aim is to attract disadvantaged young people in these areas into these facilities and programmes and, I hope, divert them from the dangers of substance abuse.</P>
    <P>Under the swimming pool programme which provides capital funding for local authority swimming pools my Department pays grants of up to 100 per cent of the approved cost of refurbishing existing pools and up to 80 per cent of the approved cost of new swimming pools, with the <Col N="1302" /> remainder of the cost being funded by local contribution. Applications for funding under the programme must be submitted through the local authority supporting the project.</P>
    <P>To qualify for a grant, a pool must comply with the Department's procedures for the planning, approval and financing of swimming pools and technical guidelines. In general, there are four stages to a swimming pool project: the preliminary report stage, the contract document stage, the tender stage and the construction stage. Each stage is evaluated by my Department's technical advisers and local authorities are advised on when they can proceed to the various stages of the project.</P>
    <P>The commitment of funds to a project can only be considered when the project design has been approved and the local authority is in a position to accept a tender. The overall allocation of funding for the swimming pool programme and the competing demands of other pool projects for the available funds must be taken into account in deciding which projects can proceed.</P>
    <P>Local authorities are currently responsible for the operation of 73 per cent of all public swimming pools. At present, there are 66 local authority swimming pools throughout the country. Some 55 of these are indoor pools, of which 51 are currently operational. Some 11 are outdoor pools, of which ten are currently open during the summer months only.</P>
    <P>Since 1988, a total of £16 million in grant-aid has been allocated under the programme in respect of three new local authority pools which have been built in that period and various levels of refurbishment at a further 25 pools.</P>
    <P>My Department is aware that in the past ten years, the number of indoor hotel leisure clubs in Ireland has increased from 65 to 138 in 1999. In addition, there has been an increase over the past three years in the provision of private stand alone leisure clubs. The lack of quality public facilities is considered to be one of the reasons for the increase in private facilities. In general, adult consumers are more affluent today, they enjoy a higher standard of living and, consequently, have more disposable income available for sports and leisure activities. Increasingly, customer expectation of the standard of facility on offer is also higher.</P>
    <P>The type, level and quality of public swimming pool facilities provided and accepted in the 1970s and 1980s are no longer acceptable as we face into a new millennium. Local authority pools must now compete with private facilities and must provide additional health and fitness facilities over and above the basic pool if they are to be viable and successful ventures. Where new public pools have been provided in recent years, the improvement in quality and in the actual facilities available has been significant and these <Col N="1303" /> have now become the minimum standard for the future.</P>
    <P>The swimming pool programme has a budget of £3 million in 1999 for the refurbishment of existing pools and the construction of new pools. This money is fully committed to the refurbishment of three pools in Arklow, Monaghan and Waterford, the construction of six new pools in Ennis, Navan, Athlone, Enniscorthy, Wicklow town and at Renmore in Galway and the remainder is due on outstanding balances on three recently completed projects.</P>
    <P>At present, the Department has applications on hand for the refurbishment of nine local authority pools. These relate to the existing pools at Tuam, Naas, Athy, Portarlington, Castlebar, Ferrybank in Wexford, Ballinasloe, Thurles, Tralee and Dundalk. In addition, the Department has on hand applications from the relevant local authorities for funding towards the provision of new pools. Among these applications are proposals for new pools at Dundalk, Longford, Roscrea, Portlaoise and Bray.</P>
    <P>A number of applications for swimming pool projects has also been received under the 1999 sports capital programme, five of which relate to local authority pools. These are Ballymun, Finglas and Glenalbyn in Dublin, Rathmullen in Drogheda and Portarlington.</P>
    <P>The Department is currently examining, in conjunction with its technical advisers, the nine refurbishment proposals on hand with a view to prioritising them for future funding. It is clear that considerable investment is required over the next few years to update a number of existing local authority pools to provide attractive, competitive and viable public swimming facilities. In a number of cases, the pools were built prior to the oil crises of the 1970s and without due regard to energy efficiency or resistance to the corrosive environments of a pool. We hope to be able to make decisions on these proposals over the coming months.</P>
    <P>We are also aware that a number of other pools, for which the relevant local authorities have not yet applied for funding, require major refurbishment work. The Minister will consider the position of these pools over the coming months and plans to put policies in place to address the current problem of the condition of local authority pools when the examination of existing refurbishment proposals is complete. However, it must be borne in mind that there will always be limits on the level of funding available.</P>
    <P>Although this motion is not directly concerned with the long-standing 50 metre pool issue, it would be worthwhile to refer briefly to it. The provision &ndash; or rather the non-provision &ndash; of a 50 metre facility for our elite swimmers seems to have been on the agenda of every Government of recent times. No doubt, the attempts to deal <Col N="1304" /> conclusively with the issue were well-meaning but, unfortunately, they failed to come to anything. That is why it gives me particular pleasure to state that the first Minister at Cabinet with responsibility for sport, Deputy McDaid, is presiding over a tender process which he is absolutely confident will deliver the pool, not merely in the form of some further worthy blueprint but in bricks and mortar.</P>
    <P>Although the High Court is due to hear a case next month taken by a disqualified tenderer, the Minister remains confident that this will not blow our final objective off course and that, sooner rather than later, we will have a facility which will give our elite swimmers at senior and junior level the chance to train in conditions which will greatly enhance their prospects of success in international competition. This facility, when completed, will provide swimming opportunities for the general swimming public.</P>
    <P>The Department is committed to reviewing the swimming pool programme before the end of 1999. As part of this exercise, it is proposed to review and update the procedures for planning and financing swimming pools and technical guidelines which set out the Department's requirements in relation to the planning, approval and funding of pool projects. It is also proposed to address a number of other issues in the review of the programme. These will include looking at appropriate maintenance and management structures for pools for the future to ensure best value for State investment.</P>
    <P>It is vital that the promotion of sport and the development of facilities, such as swimming pools, is carried out in a strategic and focused way. That means establishing priorities, avoiding overlaps and ensuring full access to available facilities. Funding under the swimming pool programme, in the past, was provided in an <i>ad hoc</i> manner, without due regard to the specific requirements of particular areas. We are determined that the development of pools under the programme for the future will be done in a structured and focused way, concentrating on areas of greatest need.</P>
    <P>In relation to Deputy Naughten's query on the Roscommon pool, approval was granted in March by the Minister to prepare contract documents and it is hoped that funding will be provided later this year. The Minister is currently considering the issue of the national sports inventory and hopes to make a decision on how to proceed with this in the next few weeks. He has also requested the Department of Finance to consider how tax incentives might contribute to dealing with the results of the inventory.</P>
    <P>The Government recognises the need for further investment in the renovation of existing pools and the building of new pools and this is one of the Minister's priorities for the future. The Government is in office less than two years and <Col N="1305" /> significant improvements have been made in the provision of sporting and community facilities. By the end of our term of office, it is our intention that the unfinished business in relation to swimming provision will have been addressed. In that context, we hope to increase the level of provision for the refurbishment of existing pools and the provision of new pools as resources permit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for sharing his time and congratulate Deputy Allen on tabling this motion. We all realise there are sub-standard swimming pools which need to be refurbished and renovated. The Minister of State mentioned the pool in Ballinasloe which has been on the refurbishment list for some years. Twenty-four years ago I joined Galway County Council and I recall a proposal every year that the local authority give a subvention to Ballinasloe Urban District Council for the maintenance of the swimming pool. That subvention has been ongoing. A new heating system was provided over the years for the pools in Ballinasloe and Tuam resulting in the pools being more efficient, with heating bills cut drastically.</P>
      <P>It is marvellous news that schools have been allowed use the pools on a regular basis in the area I represent. Increasingly schools and adult groups are using the pools, particularly the ICA and other women's groups which have organised swimming lessons and have had many social outings built around the use of the pools. I encourage even greater use of swimming pools. The pool in Ballinasloe was used to launch the Connacht Special Olympics. I sincerely congratulate the Minister on his announcement that the Special Olympics will be held in Ireland in 2003. Many parts of the country which have sports facilities, including swimming pools, will be involved in the Special Olympics. The pool in Ballinasloe has facilities for people with special needs and has organised times on Sunday mornings for people, particularly children, with special needs.</P>
      <P>Every Deputy has referred to the need for new swimming pools and the Minister of State gave a list of applications in this regard. Deputy Perry referred to some of the pools in need of refurbishment, including that in Galway. Renmore has rightly been referred to by the Minister in terms of a new swimming pool. I am sure the Minister is aware that Galway Corporation has made a very strong case for the location of the 50 metre swimming pool in Galway. The Minister has many friends in Galway and many connections with the university and I am sure he has been approached in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the difficulties in the past in relation to inquiries by public representatives was that we were dealing with the Department of the Environment. However, we are now dealing with a different Department. We are hoping that given <Col N="1306" /> the extra money being made available, as outlined by the Minister of State, there will be more progress on refurbishment, renovation and upgrading of pools and on the development of new pools.</P>
    <P>Not mentioned on the list was an application by Loughrea Swimming Pool Company in Galway. A feasibility study was updated and revised by Holohan Leisure in Dublin on the advice of the assistant county manager of Galway County Council. The study was subsequently presented by the assistant county manager to a meeting of Loughrea Town Commissioners on 15 March 1999. I understand the application is with the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation since 25 March and I would like it to be added to the list.</P>
    <P>It is very important that almost all swimming pools are involved in swimming lessons. The Minister of State rightly spoke about health and fitness facilities. In Ballinasloe in recent times, for example, a sauna has been provided while other swimming pools have provided whirl pools. Modern swimming pools have new facilities which one associates with hotel and leisure centres. Swimming pools, like modern leisure centres, should have top quality facilities. Unfortunately, too many swimming pools have poor facilities with very cold changing rooms and a lack of proper shower, toilet and drying facilities. This is one reason I strongly support upgrading the pools on the list which has been circulated, two of which are in County Galway and are among the oldest in the country.</P>
    <P>Swimming pools should have longer opening hours, especially if swimming lessons take up a large amount of available time. Given that schools are increasingly using pools, local school buses should be used to bring students and children to pools. This is not just a matter for the private sector &ndash; we also have a role to play in this regard.</P>
    <P>Another issue often brought to my notice is that many people do not know the opening hours of swimming pools. For example, there is confusion as to whether they are open on bank holidays. Local authorities should advertise the opening hours of pools on bank holidays and Sundays. The more people using pools the more money they will make and the stronger the case for refurbishment. Swimming pools are trying to survive and seek subvention. At the end of the day the question will centre on whether a local authority can provide funding.</P>
    <P>I strongly support the case for the renovation, upgrading and refurbishment of swimming pools and I hope we will not forget the long list of applications for new swimming pools.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Chair, I wish to share time with Deputies Wall, Gilmore and Rabbitte.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1307" /> I compliment Deputy Allen on bringing this important motion before the House and assure him that the Labour Party will support it. This year's capital programme for swimming pools provides an increase in funding of 16 per cent for the provision and restoration of swimming pools. This sounds good on the face of it, but the actual amount of money involved is £416,000 which represents an increase from £2.584 million to £3 million. The Estimate shows that £6 million is being provided in funding for the 50 metre pool. I do not have a problem with a 50 metre pool, but these figures underline a flaw in the Government's approach, namely, that twice as much money is available for a project which is essentially aimed towards high performance athletes as against facilities which cater for the broad range of citizens. The Minister of State mentioned a figure of £490,000 in his speech.</P>
    <P>As a teacher I was involved in swimming. The school in which I taught was the first in Waterford to avail of the Waterford Crystal pool. The first important benefit which accrued was that the number of children in the school who could swim quickly increased to a higher percentage than before. There is on average more than one drowning per week. Figures are never that simple when broken down, but it shows a great deal still has to be done in terms of water safety and having the highest possible percentage of swimmers emerging from schools.</P>
    <P>Access for the disabled to public and private swimming pools is a vital area. That agenda is being met by and large, but it is something about which we must be vigilant at all times. We should demand not only basic standards but also seek to make improvements and bring to bear new technologies. The therapeutic effect of swimming for people with disabilities is important. Learning to swim gives people with an intellectual disability a sense of achievement and adds to the quality of life of people with disabilities generally.</P>
    <P>A theme running through the debate has been private pools, a sector in which there has been rapid growth. That is welcome because it adds to tourism potential as well as to facilities available in areas. I wish well those who can pay to avail of those pools. However, there is an attitude that public pools do not have to be of the same high standard and that is unacceptable. There must be the highest standards. I welcome some of the points made by the Minister of State which indicated we would be looking towards having high standards and making other leisure facilities available in pools. Financing pools and providing the requisite levels of staffing are problems for local authorities. Refurbishment is required after a while because the condition of pools reaches crisis levels. If other funding were available for more regular refurbishment, the State would get better value for money.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1308" /> Swimming can be learned at a young age and is one of those sports people can take with them through life. It is available to the young, the old and the disabled. It is not a welcome fact that swimming pools have reached the condition described. The Minister stated recently he has funding applications totalling £20 million. On the basis of what is available this year, £3 million, it will take more than six years to deal with those applications. The Minister of State indicated there are other pools in respect of which the Department expects applications. This level of funding is not good enough. When Government revenue has never been better, surely this important area should be addressed. Its recreation element is important because involving young people in organised sport and healthy recreational activities was never more necessary than it is today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy O'Shea for sharing time with me and I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important motion. I thank Deputy Allen, whose dedication to promoting sport is well known to all Members, for tabling the motion. There is an important political principle at its heart, which is that public facilities and the people who use public swimming pools deserve the same resources and facilities as those who can afford to join private clubs. In the past, public facilities have been starved of resources and were seen as easy prey for cutbacks in more financially stringent times. The reason the motion had to be tabled is probably due to the financial rectitude brigade who never realised that cutbacks hurt the old, sick and handicapped. The damage to public services during the 1980s was immense. Now when we have the resources at our disposal to rectify the situation, we should grasp the opportunity. I pay tribute to the work of my colleague, Deputy Howlin, when he was Minister for the Environment and was in charge of approving funding for swimming pool refurbishment. He recognised the important social and sporting roles swimming pools play in communities everywhere and battled for resources to ensure improvements were made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, Rome was not built in a day and much work remains to be done in upgrading public swimming facilities. The task of funding this programme now falls to the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation. I welcome this transfer of responsibility which is a sensible and rational administrative change. However, as with all else, the resources must be made available if progress on this issue, which is desperately needed, is to be achieved. There has been a huge upsurge in recent years in the number of private swimming facilities. Private clubs and gyms and the more upmarket hotels all have swimming pools, saunas and top quality facilities. However, it must be ensured that ordinary people and families and <Col N="1309" /> their children who cannot afford the huge annual fees these new institutions charge have the same access to high quality recreational facilities. The low paid people who struggle to make ends meet cannot be treated like second class citizens. They and their children deserve clean, high quality facilities and the State has an obligation to provide them.</P>
    <P>In my constituency, Athy swimming pool needs in excess of £800,000 to bring it up to a proper standard. The local community has supported efforts to upgrade the pool and it is a central part of sport and school life in the town. The Minister, Deputy McDaid, is in a Cabinet with a Minister for Finance who chose to bank almost £1 billion last year. At a conservative estimate, a much greater surplus will weigh down his pockets this year. The challenge for the Minister is to argue at Cabinet that it is immoral for the Department of Finance to bank these enormous sums of money while communities must endure second rate facilities.</P>
    <P>Members know of my deep involvement in sport. I have great belief in the benefits sport can bring, especially to young people. We have repeatedly heard that proper recreational facilities are crucial to building communities and ensuring children are not enticed down other avenues through boredom. Athy needs a proper swimming pool. A well researched proposal is before the Minister which has the support of the community. School children in south Kildare especially will benefit immensely from the refurbishment of the pool. The choice of whether this happens lies with the Minister and it is up to him to deliver to the people of Athy.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Defence also has a major responsibility in Kildare. The condition of the pool in the Curragh camp is a disgrace. Schoolchildren in the area who relied on it have been forced to do without it because it has been forced to close. The Minister has commissioned a report and it is vital it is acted upon as a matter or urgency. This is the same Minister who repeatedly assured us that the closure of barracks would release funding for local communities. Kildare has suffered the loss of two barracks, Devoy and Magee, yet there has been no payback to the community as far as the Curragh pool is concerned. We need answers and financial commitments. I am sure everyone in Opposition supports the Minister, Deputy McDaid, in his efforts to ensure funding is provided for these facilities as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies O'Shea and Wall for sharing their time with me. I compliment Deputy Allen on tabling this motion.</P>
      <P>I support the application made to the Minister by my local authority, Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, for more than £2 million to refurbish and upgrade Glenalbyn swimming pool.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To put this in context, Dún Laoghaire Rath<Col N="1310" /> down stretches over an area of south County Dublin which has a population of approximately 300,000 people. In that area there are only two public swimming pools, one at Monkstown and the other at Glenalbyn. The Glenalbyn facility has been operated for some time in conjunction and co-operation with voluntary sporting organisations, the GAA and a swimming club. It is a highly used facility, especially given the extent of the area which it serves.</P>
    <P>There is a need not only to upgrade the Glenalbyn facility, but to provide additional swimming facilities in this area. From a line between Monkstown and Stillorgan, where Glenalbyn is located, to Bray there is a population of between 100,000 and 150,000 people. The only other public swimming pool is at Presentation College, Bray, which functions as a public pool although it belongs to the college. If that pool were to close or not to be available to the public there would be no public swimming facility from Glenalbyn out as far as north County Wicklow. While there are a number of private facilities, many of them very fine, they have membership fees and charges which, by and large, put them beyond the reach of most people in the area.</P>
    <P>There is a need to develop a new swimming facility at the southern end of the county, perhaps at Shankill, Loughlinstown or Cabinteely. For some years the Loughlinstown Leisure Centre, which is owned by Dún Laoghaire Rathdown Council but is operated by an independent management committee, has had a plan for a swimming pool in that location. That facility and proposal should proceed.</P>
    <P>An alternative might be to redevelop the old Dún Laoghaire baths, which might be an interesting project. They are a Victorian facility, an outdoor baths, which have now gone into disuse. It would be a worthwhile project to use public money to redevelop these baths as an indoor facility for the public of the area.</P>
    <P>An issue I encounter frequently when talking to people, especially parents, is the lack of social and recreational facilities for young people. Money invested in swimming pools goes beyond the investment of money in sport. It is the provision of a social facility and is one of the unique sporting and leisure occupations which can be used and enjoyed by a family together at the same time and by young people.</P>
    <P>Given the resources that are now available to the Government and the huge surpluses being generated, the amount of money available to the Minister for spending on swimming pools is pathetic. It is fair to say that he has the support of the House in seeking additional resources from his colleagues to invest in swimming facilities, both the refurbishment of existing facilities and the provision of new facilities. Any such investment would be very worthwhile, both in terms of <Col N="1311" /> the sports facilities provided and the social and leisure opportunities for the community as a whole.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought, Sir, there would be white blackbirds at the weekend when I heard your partners in Government argue for a massive public investment programme in infrastructure and suggesting this was the <i>raison d'être</i> of the founding of the Progressive Democrats. If there is one area of the country's infrastructure desperately in need of upgrading, it is the swimming pools, such as they are. They are the subject of the motion, which I support.</P>
      <P>I wonder if anybody has told the Progressive Democrats about the motion because it ought to have been included in their rhetoric at the weekend. If the programme for Government is to be reviewed somebody should tell the Progressive Democrats about youth facilities, or the absence of youth facilities, in working class Ireland.</P>
      <P>I listened with interest to my colleague, Deputy Gilmore, rhyming off foreign sounding names of places which contain run down swimming pools in need of development. I represent a constituency of approximately 100,000 people where there are largely no swimming pools. In view of this, I find it difficult to understand the Taoiseach throwing his weight today behind a third national stadium for a city with a population of one million or a country of less than four million. All economic work done on this concludes that the operation a third stadium is not feasible in the context of this size of population. The cost of constructing such a stadium will be between £40 and £60 million. No doubt a lot of money will be paid to consultants in the interim to advise on the precise cost. Would the Minister not be better allocating half of that money towards the programme of refurbishment envisaged in this motion and beginning work on some local neighbourhood swimming pools? </P>
      <P>Yesterday the Minster of State at the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy Flood, announced a drugs package. I have consistently supported his efforts in this regard in the House. The Minister of State announced a package of some £25 million of various facilities, amenities and personnel to divert young children from falling prey to the drug pushers, as has happened in so many of our worst ravaged urban communities. However, I do not support his position regarding an application from Jobstown, in his and my constituency, for a small neighbourhood pool. It was proposed that the pool be part of an infrastructure that is non-existent at present but one that might in the future prevent a new generation of children going the way of their predecessors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State is aware, as I am, of the extent of the drugs problem in this part of Dublin <Col N="1312" /> and Tallaght. I regret that his response was to announce a £5,000 feasibility study. The last thing we need is more studies. We know the situation on the ground and I had hoped that the package he announced, which I otherwise support and welcome, would have included the initiation of that pool.</P>
    <P>The big gap in our approach to reducing the demand for drugs and to sports policy concerns youth facilities, especially in working class areas. It is a hugely neglected area of public policy under successive Governments. Now that the public finances happen to be in a propitious condition, the money is there to be put into the network of facilities that any other civilised country already has. It has been a neglected area. Existing swimming pools are in many instances in a run down, unkempt and, in some cases, unsafe condition.</P>

      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle and his helpful staff for contriving a mechanism to permit me to raise this important issue. However, I am extremely concerned, although I do not say this in any ungracious way because your office has been most courteous and helpful, about the implications of the decision which prevented me raising it last week on the grounds that it was not eligible for inclusion on the Adjournment. In so far as I can interpret it, the decision to disbar its discussion was because the Minister has not made any comment on it and, therefore, the Minister is not responsible. That is not in accordance with precedent. In no spirit of ungraciousness, I feel compelled to bring the matter to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. If this House was disbarred from discussing an industrial dispute in a major industry, it would be a matter of some import with many implications.</P>
      <P>The scaffolders' dispute, according to the Construction Industry Federation, now involves some 800 workers, threatens further lay-offs and is beginning to have a deterrent effect on planned investment. Certainly there is considerable hardship being experienced by the families of the workers and the tentative initiatives taken this week are the first indications of any serious attempt to resolve the dispute. A major industry is threatened with slowdown, if not close down, and for whatever reason the employers have been slow to engage meaningfully.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are talking about an industry which is booming, where the local bargaining clause in Partnership 2000 has been used to allow other <Col N="1313" /> workers, for example, the craft grades, to share to some extent in the success of the industry. The industry, we are glad to see, is recording unprecedented profits. It is, therefore, entirely understandable that workers would seek to share in this performance. It is especially understandable when we realise that this industry is a difficult task master, where workers burn out young, often endure conditions of considerable hardship and may be unemployed for periods for a variety of reasons. These employees also work in hazardous conditions in an industry which last year recorded 27 fatalities. Therefore, we cannot feign surprise that this pressure point has arisen within an industry whose leading individual companies are doubling their profit performance and in some cases doing better than that.</P>
    <P>If certain categories of workers benefit from local settlements, it is inevitable that lesser paid workers will seek such settlements. Our objective should be to meet these local demands in a fashion that does not do permanent damage to social partnership. The fact is extensive settlements have taken place which have not been deemed to be outlawed by Partnership 2000, not least in the public sector. Therefore, rather than promoting confrontational advertisements, I would like to see both parties using the industrial relations machinery to resolve this dispute. It is noteworthy that, despite the poor safety record of some companies in the industry, no prominent advertisements were taken out advising employees of their rights and employers of their obligations.</P>
    <P>It is not for me to comment on the merits or otherwise of the issues in the dispute. However, it is plain that the dispute may yet have far-reaching implications for pay bargaining determination in the wider economy. As such, the proactive involvement of the Government is necessary.</P>
    <P>As regard the dispute itself, I will say this much. The Labour Party wants to see training, certification, health and safety included on the bargaining agenda, not just because their inclusion may be helpful in facilitating a resolution of this dispute but because they merit urgent attention in their own right.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Mr. Flood)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the absence of my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment with responsibility for labour affairs, Deputy Tom Kitt, who is abroad on Government business, I wish to record his ongoing grave concern about the scaffolders' dispute. In this era of social partnership, the nature of the action being taken by the trades union members involved is particularly disturbing. Also, the impact of the action on the construction sector, its employees and customers, is potentially damaging.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am informed that the immediate cause of the <Col N="1314" /> dispute is the claim by scaffolders, who are members of SIPTU, for a pay scale ranging from £9.50 to £18 per hour. The current minimum hourly rate for scaffolders is £6.70 under the construction industry's registered employment agreement. The dispute is also taking place against the background of other industrial relations turbulence in the construction sector.</P>
    <P>On the suspension of pickets on Thursday, 15 April, talks took place at the Labour Relations Commission. Reportedly there was progress on health, safety and training issues but there was no movement on the pay claim.</P>
    <P>I understand that talks on the dispute are continuing in the Joint Industrial Council for the Construction Industry, which is chaired by an industrial relations officer from the LRC. In the past this mechanism has been utilised to assist in the resolution of disputes. I would strongly urge the parties on this occasion to continue to use the normal industrial relations mechanisms to resolve their differences. I understand that the discussions in the joint industrial council are at a sensitive stage and I, therefore, do not want to comment further on the specifics of the dispute.</P>
    <P>One of the most significant challenges facing this country is the management of economic growth. The challenge is to manage growth in a way which will sustain economic development and, at the same time, ensure that there is an equitable sharing of the growth. This challenge is readily apparent in the construction sector. Clearly the construction sector is a key contributor to both economic and social progress, in terms of the employment it provides and also in the key role it plays in the development of the economic and social infrastructure. Expansion in commercial construction and in house building provides a climate for the improvement of pay and other working conditions for those employed in the sector.</P>
    <P>There are also obligations on employers and trades unions to work together in a positive and fair way in a spirit of co-operation or, to put it another way, to develop and pursue a partnership approach, the partnership approach which has brought us four successive national economic and social agreements.</P>
    <P>The traditional indicators of the industrial relations climate are generally showing a significant improvement. For example, less than 40,000 work days were lost last year due to industrial action, the second lowest figure on record. However, these traditional indicators do not reflect the worrying incidence of other forms of industrial action in the industrial relations arena, both in the public and private sectors.</P>
    <P>I must ask what kind of an industrial climate do we want, whether in the construction sector or elsewhere? In our voluntarist industrial relations system, it is the parties themselves, employers, <Col N="1315" /> employees and their representatives, who must decide on their response to this question.</P>
    <P>Under the current national agreement, Partnership 2000, both trades unions and employers are committed to the promotion of industrial harmony. The agreement requires the parties to a dispute, who cannot reach agreement through negotiation, jointly to refer the matter to the industrial relations agencies or to other agreed machinery.</P>
    <P>I would again urge the parties to the current disputes, including disputes in the construction sector such as the scaffolding dispute, to adopt an approach which would facilitate their resolution through the normal industrial relations procedures. National partnership agreements, of themselves, do not eliminate disputes, but the agreements place an emphasis on the use of the available dispute settling mechanisms. The continuing decline in the number of days lost due to industrial action and the record of the LRC and the Labour Court underlines the success of such mechanisms.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise the refusal of the Southern Fisheries Board and the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources to pay the wages of or otherwise compensate a fisheries officer, Mr. Michael Hickey, who was assaulted and seriously injured in the course of his duties trying to enforce the fisheries law at sea off County Waterford on 28 July 1993. The assault on Mr. Hickey was a grievous one. He was fortunate not to have been killed and his injuries proved so bad that he has not been able to work since, notwithstanding the passage of almost six years. Two individuals were convicted of this assault and sentenced to terms of imprisonment; they were believed to have been associated with the IRA.</P>
      <P>Among others, Mr. Hickey made complaints to the Minister for the Marine and the Garda about corrupt practices in the board and among some of its officials. The first such complaint was made by the then chairman of the board to the then Minister for the Marine as far back as December 1987. These complaints were ignored by successive Ministers and by the Department until matters came to a head at the end of 1995 and legislation was introduced to replace the board for most purposes with a commissioner. A second Act subsequently had to be passed for the same purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The manager of the board was suspended and then dismissed but approximately 12 months later he was brought back and allowed to retire with a gratuity and pension. Two inspectors of the board were charged with a variety of offences relating <Col N="1316" /> to corruption and were returned for trial. Although the State withdrew most of the charges and the men were not convicted, they were nonetheless dismissed by the commissioner for what was euphemistically called &ldquo;breaches of the board's code of conduct&rdquo;. The three officers were paid their full wages up to the time of their dismissal, although it was clear from their dismissals that they had been guilty of serious misconduct.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, Mr. Hickey, who was the principal whistleblower in this entire affair, and who clearly was guilty of no greater crime than doing his duty and trying to enforce the fisheries law, has been penalised appallingly because after almost six years the board still refuses to pay his wages or otherwise compensate him. He is now in receipt of £111 per week social welfare and £39 per week from the board. His gross wages if he were working would be well over £300 per week. If he were a Garda or prison officer he would have received generous treatment years ago.</P>
    <P>The board's refusal to pay him, while for years it paid three officials who were subsequently dismissed even while they were suspended, is an appalling injustice and is typical of the grossly unfair attitude of Irish officialdom to a whistleblower. What kind of example are the Minister and his Department giving when they penalise those who try to enforce and respect the law and reward those who break it? I invite the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources to tell me the basis on which he justifies this action by himself and his Department and continues to do so after almost six years. I hope the Minister in his reply will deal with the points I raised rather than just using a script prepared in advance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to update the Deputy and the House on the situation of the fisheries officer in question, who is an employee of the Southern Fisheries Board and remains on sick leave following an appalling assault in the course of his duties in 1993. I should clarify that the Southern Regional Fisheries Commission was appointed in 1996 to take over the protection, conservation and management of functions of the southern board. This step was taken under the provisions of the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1995, and on foot of a report to the Minister which advised that the affairs of the southern board were not being managed in an effective manner.</P>
      <P>For the past three years, the commission has been working to systematically tackle and resolve the acknowledged serious difficulties, notably of a staffing nature, in the southern board. The Deputy will be aware that considerable progress has been made in that time by the commission to address with due process the key problems in the organisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1317" /> Among the key priorities of the commission in this context has been to pursue all the available options to bring about a fair resolution of the circumstances of the fisheries officer in question, Mr. Michael Hickey. I am aware that the Deputy is familiar with the background to this matter. Mr. Hickey suffered very serious injuries when assaulted in the course of a seagoing salmon protection patrol off Helvick Head in 1993. As a result of these injuries, he has been unable to return to work and remains on sick leave and half pay. The circumstances in which he sustained his injuries, and for which there were subsequent convictions in court, reflected a state of serious and bitter opposition to salmon fishing regulations throughout the 1980s and into the current decade in the southern fisheries region.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the Deputy's long standing committed concern to ensure that Michael Hickey gets fair play. I assure him that I share his concerns and have the utmost sympathy for Mr. Hickey in the ordeal he suffered as an officer of the State. I also assure the Deputy that the Southern Regional Fisheries Commission and my Department have been, and continue to be, actively engaged in arriving at a solution to meet the exceptional circumstances of his case.</P>
    <P>In light of the concerns expressed by the Deputy, it is important to put on record what has been put in place to date to assist Mr. Hickey. Mr. Hickey is an employee of the regional fisheries board and not of my Department. However, my Department has supported and continues to support all efforts to assist Mr. Hickey in recognition of the exceptional circumstances over and above the standard entitlements for regional fisheries board staff. For the first six months after the assault Mr. Hickey remained on full pay in accordance with the staff scheme in place in all regional boards. Full pay was extended as an exceptional measure in his case for a further seven months, after which he was placed on half pay. Under the staff scheme half pay would normally cease after a further six months. However, again in recognition of the his exceptional circumstances, Mr. Hickey remains on half pay.</P>
    <P>In addition, a number of special provisions have been made for Mr. Hickey in the intervening years. An <i>ex gratia</i> payment of £5,000 was made to him in November 1995 and he received refunds from the board's compensation scheme for his hospital costs as a public patient. Mr. Hickey still acts as a union representative in the board and the commission continues to contribute to his telephone bills and to pay for his travel and subsistence costs when on union business.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, extensive discussions have continued between Mr. Hickey and the commission on his future in light of successive medical reports. In the event of retirement on medical grounds, Mr. Hickey would in the normal course receive a mix of lump sum, pension and social <Col N="1318" /> welfare entitlements under the terms of the superannuation scheme for fisheries board staff. The commission has, in addition, been working assiduously, in consultation with my Department, to investigate and structure a proposal which would reflect and acknowledge the very exceptional circumstances of Mr. Hickey's case. The commission has been in ongoing contact with him during this process and has put on record its appreciation of the high level of commitment he had given throughout his service with the regional fisheries board.</P>
    <P>The commission has advised and my Department confirms that proposals are being actively and intensively progressed with legal advisers and the Department of Finance. All concerned are anxious to bring the matter to finality as quickly as possible in the interests first and foremost of Mr. Hickey. I assure the Deputy that there will be no let up by the commission or my Department in the effort to arrive at an acceptable outcome. I will ensure that the Deputy is kept fully briefed on development in the coming weeks. This matter is progressing rapidly.</P>

      <P>The next two items are being taken together. Deputy Jim Higgins and Deputy Naughten have five minutes each and the Minister has ten minutes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Mayo)</i>
        <b>:</b> I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for allowing this matter to be raised. The Irish Country Meats plant at Ballyhaunis, now called the Glan Bia plant, has a significance all its own. It has an economic significance in that it provides more than 200 jobs in an area starved of employment and bled white by emigration for decades. It has a social significance in that is kept the fire alight in many a household which would long since have been abandoned and kept open schools which would otherwise have been depleted or closed. It has an emotional significance in that seven years ago it faced the same bleak prospect it faces today.</P>
      <P>UMP, formerly Hal-al Meats, was put to the wall because its bank failed to honour and underwrite a rather modest debt. Its examinership did not receive the necessary support from the banks and the receiver was called in. Several larger meat companies cast their cold, predatory eyes on the plant, with the intention of buying it to close it and remove a competitor from the marketplace. I have seldom witnessed anything like the determined campaign mounted by the local community, the chamber of commerce, the IFA and the ICMSA to keep the plant open. The present Minister was extremely helpful; he was Minister at that time also and took an active interest in the plant and its future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1319" /> Avonmore took over the Ballyhaunis and Ballaghadereen plants and Government agencies supplied generous grant aid. For the best part of seven years the Avonmore subsidiary, Irish Country Meats, has traded profitably from its Mayo plant. The plant has been modernised and boasts new sheep and beef lines and a state of the art boning hall. Its future looked assured.</P>
    <P>When the news filtered through that the newly titled Glan Bia was actively seeking a buyer for the plant, shock waves went through the work force and local community. The move was seen in the context of recent remarks by the former managing director of Avonmore plc, Mr. Pat O'Neill, in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> on 28 March. Commenting on a management buy-out, he said Avonmore had received a proposal which was not viable and would not accept a proposal which did not provide adequate value and did not assist in re-modelling the sector. He said that the company had obligations and responsibilities to do the right thing for the sector and could not be too self-serving. He said the company wanted to play a part in consolidating the industry &ndash; in other words, to decode the language, &ldquo;McKinsey rules OK&rdquo;. According to Mr. O'Neill, the Minister must move on the McKinsey report.</P>
    <P>The report is the big fear. In blunt terms, it is clear that under the rationalisation plan the Ballyhaunis plant will be one of those put out of existence. The new owner will mothball it and receive a substantial golden handshake of several million pounds for co-operating in so doing. This is not acceptable. It is a modern, profitable plant which should be developed rather than closed. It has even greater commercial potential than has been realised to date. It is crucial to the social and economic fabric of this area &ndash; an area with no high-tech jobs &ndash; that it be retained.</P>
    <P>Within a quarter of a mile of the meat plant is the company's rendering plant. Although it has improved it still has a considerable air pollution problem. The local community has tolerated a lot over the years but it did so in the interests of the jobs in the main meat plant. A rendering plant on its own will not be tolerated &ndash; it is both or nothing. The rendering plant should be upgraded if it is to continue in operation because much more needs to be done to it.</P>
    <P>There is no objection to an outside company taking over the plant, provided there is a clear guarantee that the meat plant will be kept open and the jobs retained. I ask the Minister to intervene and to establish exactly what is going on. Why was the company so secretive and unco-operative at its meeting in Dublin yesterday with the IFA and the local chamber of commerce? I also ask the Minister to ensure that the expensive modernisation of the plant &ndash; a substantial portion of which was funded by the Irish taxpayer &ndash;<Col N="1320" /> is not to be unused, under-utilised or padlocked behind closed doors.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for selecting this important issue for the Adjournment, because it is of major concern not only to County Mayo and County Roscommon but to the province as a whole. Many people believe the proposed purchase of the two meat plants is a major step in implementing the McKinsey report, which proposed a dramatic reduction in the number of meat factories in Ireland. We must consider the livelihoods and lives of people in Ballyhaunis and Ballaghadereen, not only a report which has gathered dust for a number of years. Farmers, employees and the economy of the two communities must be taken into account.</P>
      <P>The rumoured purchaser of the plants does not have a slaughtering facility for sheep and if the Ballyhaunis factory were to close there would be only one major sheep slaughtering plant in the west of Ireland. This is of serious concern to sheep farmers in the province because it would mean a monopoly in the marketplace and no competition at marts, in contrast to the two buyers which exist at present. The plant is, therefore, crucially important to the economic prosperity of many communities in the west. It is also rumoured that the sole reason for buying these plants is to obtain the rendering facility and that it is intended to close both slaughtering facilities. This would have a detrimental effect on cattle prices at marts and would reduce competition.</P>
      <P>Ballaghadereen could not afford to lose between 200 and 270 wage packets. The town has been hit in the past by emigration and it is trying to build up employment, which is difficult. The slaughtering plant is the major employer and its loss would be a major blow which would signal the death of the town and its hinterland. I am delighted that the Minister of State, Deputy Davern, is replying to this matter because he is responsible for rural renewal. Without the facility in Ballaghadereen talk of rural renewal is pie in the sky, because there will not be enough people to do it. I hope the Minister takes this into consideration.</P>
      <P>Glan Bia, which owns the two plants and proposes to sell them, is a farmer controlled public limited company. It has a duty to the farming community to maintain competition. Jobs in rural communities are vitally important and agriculture is the main employer in County Roscommon. These are two of the most modern factories in the country, both have received substantial grant aid in State and EU funds, both have made healthy profits, and we want a written commitment to keep both plants open. We have no problem with a new owner provided it runs the plants and does not run them into the ground.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1321" /> This problem has arisen before and, in fairness to the current Minister, he did his utmost to ensure the plants remained open. I urge him to ensure again that the plants' future is guaranteed because they are vitally important to the economic prosperity of the towns. Without them, we could close the communities because there will be no one left. The tax designation will mean nothing because there will be no one to take it up. I ask the Minister to get a commitment from Glan Bia and the new owners that the plants will be kept open, employment remains in the town and competition is maintained in the west.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Davern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise in advance to my colleagues opposite in respect of the quality of my voice. I am suffering from a chest infection.</P>
      <P>Let me put the record straight regarding the processing plants concerned and the reference to the McKinsey report in that context. The McKinsey report was commissioned last year by Enterprise Ireland at the Minister's request and was submitted to him last autumn. It set out the most appropriate future strategy for the Irish beef industry and involved a list of recommendations aimed at improving the marketing, processing and production of Irish beef. The study concluded that the industry could improve profitability by the adoption of a series of initiatives across all levels of the sector. In summary, an important recommendation at processor level was that processing capacity should be reduced substantially through a self-funded buy-out scheme. Greater discipline in marketing and the introduction of a quality based pricing system was also recommended. At producer level the main initiative recommended was the production of better quality cattle in order to recover and increase export levels in EU markets. A greater degree of partnership between producers and processors was also recommended to develop a long-term and mutually supportive relationship.</P>
      <P>Following examination of the report it was decided to set up a task force to examine and make recommendations on the future of the industry, which would be translated into a plan of action. The McKinsey report would provide a useful starting point for the work of the task force but would not be relied on exclusively as a basis for drawing up a plan of action for the sector. This membership of the group, which I announced on 10 November 1998, was drawn from senior levels within the production and processing side of the industry as well as from the relevant State agencies under the chairmanship of the Secretary General of my Department, John Malone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In launching the task force I was mindful of the need to put the industry on a sound footing, once <Col N="1322" /> and for all, and to embark on a process of change which would enable it to overcome the obstacles which have hindered its progress. The task force held its first meeting on 18 November and the following terms of reference were agreed: &ldquo;To devise an action plan for the development of the beef industry covering the whole sector from primary production through to processing and marketing with a view to enabling the sector to overcome the obstacles impeding its development and to generate better returns from the markets.&rdquo;  The task force was expected to have concluded its deliberations earlier in the year but the Agenda 2000 negotiations have delayed this. Despite their expressed disappointment, I am sure both Members will agree that the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh, did a tremendous job in respect of Agenda 2000. The task force is now approaching the final phase of its deliberations.</P>
    <P>There is absolutely no link between the reported change of ownership of the processing plants in Ballyhaunis and Ballaghaderreen, or any plant in the country for that matter, and the recommendations in the McKinsey report. I emphasise that any sale or purchase of these plants is a matter for the parties involved.</P>
    <P>I recognise that a proposal or even a rumour about a proposal to sell a plant will cause concern among employees with regard to their future security. The beef industry overall employs about 5,000 people at processing level. Unfortunately, over half those jobs are on a part-time basis with workers employed two to three days per week only. This will not be sustainable in the future because of the availability of other full-time employment opportunities. The drain of skilled workers from the sector is already a major impediment to the development of the industry in many parts of the country.</P>
    <P>There is general agreement that there is excess capacity in the sector, the removal of which will provide the catalyst for more full-time jobs and improve the attractiveness of employment in the sector for existing employees and potential new entrants, and that career development opportunities exist for staff at all levels.</P>
    <P>The needs of producers must be addressed in any plans for the sector. Many of these producers provide the backbone of the labour force in the processing plants. Since the autumn of last year, Irish farmers received only approximately 75 per cent of the cattle prices paid to their European colleagues. Clearly there is a need to significantly narrow this gap, which will not be easy. The impact of the BSE crisis in 1996 continues to linger. The fall in consumption on EU markets, the renationalisation of some of these markets and the greater dependency on volatile third country markets all point towards the major challenges ahead.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1323" /> The aim will be to recover and increase market share on the high priced EU retail markets. To do this, action must take place on all fronts. The task force invested considerable time in addressing this area. Clearly there must be closer co-operation between producers and processors in order that the requirements of the EU markets are satisfied. An immediate step forward in this regard would be to provide for a payment system on the basis of quality. There is also a major requirement for the highest standards of food safety and hygiene at processing level. This will require ongoing investment, apart from the need to develop economics of scale which would reduce unit production costs and provide greater returns to the producer. Therefore, the debate on rationalisation must be seen in proper context as part of the development of the industry, not simply in terms of removing excess capacity. Rationalisation alone will not solve the problems of the sector &ndash; action is required across a range of fronts.</P>
    <P>The recently concluded Agenda 2000 agreement provides a framework for taking construc<Col N="1324" /> tive and forward looking action. The economies of beef production have been preserved, there have been major increases in direct payments provided under this agreement and our production base has been preserved through the retention of the full suckler cow quota.</P>
    <P>There is speculation about a change in ownership in these plants, which is part of commercial life in any business. The outcome of this process is not clear and it would be unwise to jump to hasty conclusions. If the factory is as good as the Deputies say it is, I am sure an interested party will seize the opportunity to purchase it and ensure that its employees are given work on a full-time rather than a part-time basis.</P>

      <P>The Government Strategy for Road Safety 1998-2002 acknowledged the importance of driver training and testing, with the qualification that these could not be expected to yield road safety benefits on the scale of measures directly targeted at speeding, alcohol and seat belt wearing which have been prioritised by the strategy. The strategy proposed, for the longer term, a significant reduction in the number of Irish drivers relying on a provisional licence.</P>
      <P>In order to attain this longer term goal, the short-term priority must be to restore waiting periods for driving tests to acceptable levels. I have already outlined, in the reply to Priority Question No. 31 on today's Order Paper, the significant additional resources now being made available to support this process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Measures have been in place for some years, and will be maintained, to restrict the indefinite holding of provisional licences. In addition, the Motor Insurance Advisory Board is developing recommendations for improving access to motor <Col N="1326" /> insurance for young people. The possibility of affording greater credit for the holding of a full driver licence may arise in this context.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to motor vehicle licensing. My Department has been engaged in a major project to modernise and upgrade our computerised vehicle database with the primary objective of providing a quality service to motor vehicle owners. The initial phase of the new system came into operation in November 1998 at my Department's offices in Shannon town centre. As part of the process of extending this system to licensing authorities, work is proceeding to provide for the installation of a new computer system in Wexford motor tax office on a pilot basis. This will be followed by the extension of the system to remaining motor tax offices over an 18 month period.</P>
      <P>The one-stop-shop concept is an important element of the Government's local government reform programme aimed at ensuring the delivery of a wide range of public services from a single location. It is a matter for each local authority which has a vehicle licensing function to decide on whether a motor tax service should be included in any one-stop-shop centre established by it. I understand, however, that a number of local authorities have plans for inclusion of a motor tax service in such centres. I fully support this approach.</P>
      <P>While the extension of the new computer system to all the principal offices of licensing authorities is my Department's priority at this stage, it is recognised that extension of the system to local or district sub-offices has to be a feature of the overall computerisation project. This will be addressed in the context of the rollout of the system to the principal offices of licensing authorities.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 37, 42, 55 and 77 together.</P>
      <P>The new affordable housing scheme involves the provision by local authorities of additional new houses for low income house purchasers on land provided by the authorities. The scheme is targeted primarily at major urban centres and their hinterlands where house prices have created an affordability gap for low income house purchasers and where the problem of house price escalation has been most acute. I also recognise that there are certain other areas where particular factors, such as strong demand for holiday homes, have increased house prices and created an affordability gap for local people. I have asked local authorities to consider the provision of affordable housing in areas where such circumstances exist.</P>
      <P>Initial details of the scheme were issued to all housing authorities on 3 March and copies were made available to Deputies and placed in the Oireachtas Library. My Department met with the county and city managers to provide further briefing and to respond to any queries. Subsequently a comprehensive circular regarding the scheme issued to all housing authorities on 8 April and copies have been placed in the Oireachtas Library. Local authorities have been requested to assess the extent to which the scheme could appropriately be used in their areas and to formulate proposals for specific developments which could be brought to construction at the earliest possible date. To avoid any delay in the implementation of the scheme, I have not asked local authorities to submit proposals to my Department for approval and the services of the National Building Agency are available, on request from a local authority, to assist them in undertaking projects under the scheme including land acquisition, design, tendering, contracting etc.</P>
      <P>The scheme has been welcomed by local authorities. While it is very early days yet to see the impact of the scheme countrywide, I am already aware of proposals, some ready to commence construction, in a number of areas including Dublin, Galway, Meath, Mayo, Wexford, Westmeath and Wicklow. The proposals for Dublin are within the Dublin Corporation area. I am confident at this stage that we will reach our target of 400 houses for 1999.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>The October 1998 policy statement on waste management &ndash; Changing Our Ways &ndash; is addressed chiefly to local authorities, recognising that they have a pivotal role in delivering a radical improvement in national waste management performance. The statement is intended to provide a national policy framework for the adoption and implementation by local authorities of strategic waste management plans under which national objectives and targets will be attained.</P>
      <P>Changing Our Ways identified the need for meaningful strategic planning, on a regionalised basis; a dramatic reduction in reliance on landfill, in favour of an integrated waste management approach which utilises a range of waste treatment options to deliver ambitious recycling and recovery targets; greater participation by the private sector in the provision of waste management services; a more effective and equitable system of waste charging which incentives waste minimisation and recovery; greater utilisation of legislative instruments extending the scope of producer responsibility initiatives and the mobilisation of public support and participation.</P>
      <P>Section 22 of the Waste Management Act, 1996, requires local authorities to make waste management plans in respect of their functional areas, and provides that two or more local authorities may jointly make such plans.</P>
      <P>Reflecting the waste hierarchy, the statutory objective of these plans is to prevent or minimise the production and harmful nature of waste; encourage and support the recovery of waste; ensure that such waste as cannot be prevented or recovered is safely disposed of and address the need to give effect to the polluter pays principle in relation to waste disposal.</P>
      <P>Under the 1996 Act, a local authority is required to take such steps as are appropriate and necessary to attain, in relation to its functional area, the objectives of a waste management plan made by that authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Local authorities have been encouraged by my Department to adopt a regional approach to this planning process, with a view to the more <Col N="1332" /> efficient provision of services and infrastructure, and carry out preliminary waste management strategy studies, to provide a context for evaluating available options and for identifying the measures, or combination of measures, most likely to optimise waste management.</P>
    <P>The response of local authorities has been very positive. Some 32 authorities are involved in or have adopted regional waste management strategy studies, or are otherwise committed to the making of regional waste management plans. Grant assistance of over £1.1 million has been allocated under the EU-funded Operational Programme for Environmental Services, 1994-1999 in respect of a number of strategy studies.</P>
    <P>It is evident that, in their strategic planning exercise, local authorities are being guided by Changing Our Ways, and that regional waste management plans will seek to give effect to the policy objectives and targets outlined in that statement. My Department will continue to liaise closely with local authorities as this planning process is brought to a conclusion, and we will endeavour to provide ongoing support, advice and guidance to local authorities with regard to the implementation of their waste management functions. A number of measures are already in train which will support the efforts of local authorities to deliver a radically improved waste management performance.</P>
    <P>A specially resourced unit has been set up in my Department to pursue the implementation of public private partnership arrangements, and will provide advice to local authorities with regard to procurement of necessary waste management infrastructure.</P>
    <P>My Department has formally invited the construction industry to develop proposals for a producer responsibility initiative aimed at meeting proposed recovery targets for construction and demolition waste, and initial discussions have taken place with the main representative organisations involved. The motor industry has also been invited to develop proposals in relation to end-of-life vehicles, while initial discussions have taken place with industry concerning waste electronic and electrical equipment.</P>
    <P>I am also developing a significant new and well resourced environmental awareness campaign, which will promote more environmentally sustainable behaviour, including waste minimisation and recovery. It is my intention to prepare a policy statement on recycling and waste recovery generally, for publication later this year. This policy document will address the factors and practical considerations which are relevant to the achievement of Government policy objectives in this area, and outline the scope of measures which will be undertaken in support of better recycling performance.</P>

      <P>From correspondence received in my Department from the Deputy, I assume that the two question are linked and, accordingly, I propose to take Questions Nos. 44 and 67 together.</P>
      <P>The disposal of land in the ownership of a local authority is a matter for the authority themselves. Disposal of land by local authorities can arise under a number of statutory provisions. As far as lands acquired for purposes other than the Housing Act, 1966, are concerned, the principal provision which local authorities may use to dispose of land surplus to their requirements is section 83 of the Local Government Act, 1946, as amended by the Local Government Act, 1991 (Removal of Control) Regulations, 1993. These provisions give the elected members a deciding role in the exercise of the local authority's functions in relation to the disposal of such lands.</P>
      <P>It is only where it is proposed to make a disposal of such lands at less than the market value that approval of the Minister is required. Where such a proposal is justified by benefits, economic or other, to the local community, I would be prepared to consider it favourably. I am not aware of any difficulties in the operation of section 83 in the context referred to by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>A ministerial policy directive has not been issued to local authorities in relation to the disposal of land to promote local economic activity and, in view of the progressive approach to economic development by local authorities generally, I am not convinced of the need for such a directive.</P>

      <P>In February last, I announced the Government's intention to introduce a new scheme of tax incentives aimed at the restoration and conservation of townscapes in smaller towns. An expert advisory panel is currently in the process of preparing detailed guidelines for the proposed scheme. The guidelines will be finalised and issued to county councils within the next few weeks. County councils will be asked to consider which towns can benefit from the proposed scheme and to submit plans to my Department in accordance with the terms of the guidelines. When the plans are submitted the expert panel will examine them and make recommendations. It is hoped to commence the scheme later in the year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 46 and 60 together.</P>
      <P>A major local government Bill is currently in preparation which will underpin the ongoing programme for the renewal of local government and modernise and consolidate local government law generally. Legislation relating to local authority management, some of which dates back 70 years, is among a range of enactments the provisions of which will be repealed, revised, modernised and consolidated by the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My intention is to significantly enhance the role of elected members and this will be reflected in the Bill and in a range of other initiatives some of which are already under way as part of the renewal programme. These include the introduction of strategic policy committees which will provide genuine opportunity for a far greater role for elected members in the formulation, review and monitoring of policy and on a partnership model involving relevant sectoral interests; new manage<Col N="1335" /> ment structures to support the SPCs; better training/information for members; an overview role for the corporate policy group (Cathaoirleach and SPC chairs); a range of powers will be available to the council to oversee the direction of local authority affairs; the position of the cathaoirleach will be enhanced and the distinctive nature of local authority membership strengthened, and the proposed county/city development boards will position local government as the hub in bringing together the activities of State bodies, local development agencies and in promoting economic, social and cultural development.</P>
    <P>Taken together, these and other measures will provide real opportunity for local authority members to determine and monitor policy with proper support and within an appropriate legislative framework.</P>
    <P>Subject to the foregoing, issues such as the allocation of individual local authority houses, the conferral of other individual type benefits or day to day operational matters will be the responsibility of the executive within the policy framework as determined and overseen by the council. As was also the policy of the previous Government it is not intended that decisions on such individual cases will vest in the council.</P>

      <P>The average economic cost of road congestion in OECD countries, excluding related issues such as environmental and road safety costs, has been estimated at some 2 per cent of GDP.</P>
      <P>Detailed studies of congestion costs in Irish conditions have not been carried out. However, estimates made by the Dublin transportation office indicate that the cost of congestion in the Dublin region is of the order of £500 million per annum. This figure is based on the loss of time spent in traffic queues, as opposed to free flow traffic conditions, and does not take into account other costs associated with congestion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Policy responses to congestion must be based on an integrated approach to transport requirements. This involves increased investment in road infrastructure, but also improvement of public transport, management of road transport demand, promotion of alternative transport modes and better co-ordination of transport and land use planning. These matters are being addressed through, <i>inter alia</i>, the Operational Programme for Transport 1994-99 and urban transport initiatives such as the DTI, and will be <Col N="1336" /> taken into account in the formulation of the next national development plan.</P>

      <P>The European Commission has notified my Department, by way of Reasoned Opinion under Article 169 of the Treaty on the European Union, of eight cases of non-transposition or failure to comply with the terms of EU directives.</P>
      <P>The directives involved in these instances are as follows: Directive 75/442 on waste, as amended by Directive 91/156, Directive 91/689 on hazardous waste, and European Parliament and Council Directive 94/62 on packaging and packaging waste as they relate to waste management planning: The Commission has been requested to defer further action in this matter, in light of the substantial progress achieved in the current waste planning process. Directive 85/337 relating to environment impact assessments: Ireland and the Commission have differing views on the application of the directive to wind farms and are in communication in this regard. Wind farm development will, however, require environmental impact assessments from 1 May 1999 under new regulations which I have recently made (S.I. No. 93/99). Directive 91/692 on reports on implementation of certain directives: Ireland has responded to the Commission in respect of its reasoned opinion in relation to outstanding reports under this directive. Directive 96/53 relating to maximum dimensions in national and international traffic: Required regulations will be made in mid 1999. Directive 97/26 relating to driving licences: the Commission has been notified that this directive will be transposed in September 1999. Directive 97/68 relating to emissions from non-road mobile machines: regulations to transpose the directive are currently being drafted.</P>

    <P>In two instances action has already been taken in regard to matters raised by the Commission.

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The serviced land initiative is one of a number of measures aimed at bringing forward serviced land for housing as rapidly as possible. Under the initiative, 47 local authorities, including 15 urban district councils, were allocated funding for approved schemes involving 100,000 sites. Details of all the schemes approved are set out in the reply to Questions Nos. 130 and 132 of 24 March 1999. I should say that all qualifying schemes in the major urban areas, and their transport catchments, submitted to the Department were approved. All of the local authorities concerned have acted on the measure and considering the necessary lead-in times progress to date has been reasonably satisfactory. Local authorities have been asked to progress the schemes as a priority.</P>
      <P>It is not possible, from the returns submitted by local authorities, to indicate the actual number of new house starts which can be directly related to the initiative but, based on the most recent local authority returns, schemes either completed or already at construction are expected to produce some 5,000 sites. In addition, schemes which are at an advanced planning stage account for a further 40,000 sites. In general, the majority of these schemes should reach construction this year. A further indication of the positive impact of the measures is the fact that house completions are up 20 per cent in the first ten weeks of 1999 compared to the same period last year. The rate at which new houses will start on lands serviced under the initiative depends not only on the construction of the schemes themselves but on factors such as progress by developers in the submission of planning applications, and commencing building.</P>
      <P>Of course, serviced land initiative schemes are an addition to the schemes in the Department's main water and sewerage services investment programme, which is expanding water services infrastructure generally. This year's capital provision of £275 million represents an increase of 50 per cent on expenditure in 1998, and is more than double the expenditure on these services in 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a further measure to boost the supply of serviced sites, my Department has issued a circu<Col N="1338" /> lar to all local authorities asking them to facilitate residential development by allowing interim and temporary arrangements for water and sewerage services, subject to necessary safeguards, pending the provision of permanent infrastructure. A copy of this circular is available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>

      <P>Of the £10 million allocated for certain large-scale group water schemes under the Operational Programme for Environmental Services 1994-1999, expenditure to the end of 1998 amounted to £8.5 million. This was less than had been projected and resulted from the commencement of some schemes being delayed by the devolution arrangements for group schemes introduced by the previous Government in 1997. A sum of £3 million had been allocated for group schemes from the operational programme that year of which £1.3 million remained unspent at year end. The underspend was carried forward into 1998 but, as a result of the delays that had already occurred in starting schemes, local authorities were unable to draw down the increased allocation in full. The moneys unspent at the end of 1998 are being rescheduled for draw down in 1999.</P>
      <P>Commitments on schemes already approved for funding are currently being assessed and any uncommitted balance arising will be allocated to new projects, ensuring that all of the available co-financing will be fully drawn down by the end of the year 2000, as required by the operational programme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 59 and 198 together.</P>
      <P>The DTI Strategy, which was published in 1995 with a planning horizon to 2011, provides the framework for a wide range of initiatives in response to Dublin's transportation needs. These include: major infrastructural projects such as Luas, the Dublin Port Tunnel and completion of the Dublin C-Ring; improvements in public transport through the provision of Quality Bus Corridors, additional buses, additional rolling stock for DART and suburban rail, and the upgrading of suburban rail lines; improvements in traffic and parking management.</P>
      <P>Progress has been made on many fronts with implementation of measures recommended in DTI. There have, however, been delays in implementation of major infrastructural projects such as Luas and the C-Ring; in addition, traffic growth in the Dublin region has been significantly higher than anticipated.</P>
      <P>The DTO short-term action plan, broadly endorsed by Government and published by the Dublin Transportation Office last September, is designed to advance and accelerate a set of measures consistent with the DTI Strategy which can be completed in the period up to end 2000. Its focus is on public transport enhancement, traffic and parking management and the provision of cycling facilities. Detailed objectives include: completion by end 2000 of the original 11 QBC network and the provision of a QBC serving Ballymun; provision by end 1999 of an additional 150 buses by Dublin Bus; provision of additional rolling stock for DART; lengthening of 12 outer suburban and key DART platforms; upgrading of Maynooth-Clonsilla rail line, and completion of 160 kilometres of cycle tracks by end 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Implementation of the short-term action plan is being undertaken by the various local authorities and CIE under the co-ordination of the DTO.  Good progress is being made with implementation of the plan. For example, orders have been placed for the new buses with delivery of the first batch to be completed by June; work is proceeding on the planning, design and implementation of the QBC network; the programme <Col N="1343" /> of platform lengthening has commenced; and contracts have been entered into for additional DART rolling stock.</P>
    <P>The 1999 Estimates include an increased provision of £24 million for the DTO &ndash; up from £9 million in 1998 and £7 million in 1997 &ndash; to fund key elements of the short-term action plan, (this includes £2 million towards the cost of pilot park and ride facilities in the Dublin area); £17 million for the provision of additional buses.</P>
    <P>Since the publication of the short-term action plan, the Minister for Finance has also announced the removal of benefit in kind taxation from public transport passes provided by employers for their employees; tax incentives to promote park and ride facilities; a review of the potential for benefit in kind taxation of workplace parking.</P>
    <P>In the longer term, the DTO has begun the process of updating the original DTI Strategy; this will lead to the publication of a revised and updated strategy for the period 2000 to 2016. The intention is to complete this updating work by end 1999, with an investment programme to be finalised in advance of this to assist the preparation of the new national development plan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Litter Pollution Act, 1997, which came into operation on 1 July 1997 provides the necessary legislative framework to deal with the problem of litter pollution. Under the Act, the primary management and enforcement response must come from the local authorities.</P>
      <P>Since taking up office, I have pursued the following programme of action to combat litter pollution; in the second half of 1997, I undertook, through my Department, a factual information campaign to inform the general public of their duties and responsibilities under the 1997 Act. This included the printing and circulation to local authorities and the general public of an information leaflet about the new litter laws, the supply of generic advertising material to local authorities and an information campaign on local radio.</P>
      <P>In September 1997, my colleague, Minister Dempsey, commissioned a second national litter survey which was presented to my Department in December 1997. This survey was a follow-up to the initial survey carried out in October 1995 and it has been used by me in targeting action against litter.</P>
      <P>I have allocated almost £650,000 in grants to local authorities between 1997 and 1998 to co-fund selected public education and awareness initiatives on litter.</P>
      <P>I am developing a national litter pollution monitoring system to monitor and assess local authority litter management and enforcement action, which will become operational in the first half of 1999. The system will also help to identify and eliminate litter blackspots. Local authorities will be able to use the data produced to review needs and priorities at local level to prevent and control litter, and to target appropriate action to implement them.</P>
      <P>I am providing financial support for An Taisce led project: National Spring Clean 1999 &ndash; a broad based partnership approach, co-sponsored by national and local government, an NGO and major private sector companies, to raise public awareness and participation in anti-litter initiatives at local level to clean up the local environment. The project includes a central role for local authorities.</P>
      <P>I am stepping up the promotion of anti-litter awareness among young people, in co-operation with the Department of Education and Science and through an anti-litter campaign for primary schools for the 1998-1999 school year developed by ENFO.</P>
      <P>I met all local authority managers in June-July 1998 to reinforce the need for strong action to tackle the litter pollution problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take every possible opportunity to urge local authorities to make full use of their powers under the 1997 Act to combat litter. My Department's provision for litter awareness activities for 1999 has increased to £526,000 and we will be working with local authorities, businesses and the edu<Col N="1345" /> cational sector to secure effective implementation of the range of ongoing measures and to develop new initiatives. Since 1 January this year, local authorities can also deploy some of the additional resources now available under the Local Government Fund to extend their anti-litter operations.</P>

      <P>In 1995 my Department issued a circular letter requesting planning authorities to make copies of documents held on a planning application file, other than plans, drawings or photographs, available to the public for purchase at a reasonable fee. It should also be noted that the Local Government (Planning and Development) Regulations, 1994 require planning authorities to make available for purchase copies of environmental impact statements, or extracts from them.</P>
      <P>Following reports that some planning authorities had not made adequate arrangements for the provision of documents, planning authorities were reminded in 1996 of the need to put arrangements in place for the provision of copies of documents, and to ensure that all relevant staff were aware of the contents of the previous circular.</P>
      <P>It should also be noted that the issue of the availability of information in the planning system has been considered as part of my review of the planning code. My proposals in this regard will be contained in a major Bill to reform and consolidate planning law to be published in mid-year.</P>

      <Quest>the steps, if any, he will take to deal with the significant increase in aluminium in water supplies identified in the recent report of the Environmental Protection Agency in view of the possible links between aluminium in water and health problems; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>Primary responsibility for the provision of drinking water supplies and for upholding the <Col N="1346" /> prescribed quality standards rests with sanitary authorities, under the general supervision of the Environmental Protection Agency. The required standards for drinking water are prescribed in the European Communities (Quality of Water Intended for Human Consumption) Regulations, 1988. Exceedance of the quality standards does not automatically mean that there is a risk to public health.</P>
      <P>Aluminium sulphate is widely used in Ireland and internationally in the treatment of drinking water, primarily to remove colour and particulate matter.</P>
      <P>In terms of the health implications of aluminium, the most recent assessment by the World Health Organisation, WHO, indicates that the present epidemiological evidence does not support a causal association between Alzheimers disease and aluminium in drinking water. As a consequence, the guideline value recommended by WHO in respect of aluminium in drinking water is based on aesthetic, rather than health, considerations. This assessment has been reflected in the recently adopted revised Directive on Drinking Water (98/83/EC) where aluminium has been included as an indicator, rather than a health-based, parameter.</P>
      <P>However, in view of my concern to ensure that all water treatment plants are operated to the highest standard, I have asked sanitary authorities to examine all aspects of the operation of treatment plants, in the light of the recommendations set out in the EPA report, with a view to optimising treatment processes generally. In this connection, I have again emphasised the importance of ensuring that relevant personnel involved in the operation of water treatment plants participate in the caretaker development course which has been developed by the National Training Committee.</P>

      <P>The Government strategy for road safety 1998-2002 has set out specific targets for improving road safety in Ireland, notably the objective of reducing deaths and serious injuries by at least 20 per cent by 2002. This target will be achieved by a number of key new initiatives and by enhancing and intensifying existing road safety measures.</P>
      <P>As indicated in the strategy its planning horizon is the five year period to 2002. This term was adopted so as to allow trends to be identified and monitored with reasonable accuracy, and because a number of key measures would take some time to mobilise fully. The high level group on road safety was mandated by Government to monitor the progress of the strategy and to make recommendations to the Government for updating and adjustment. This task is being carried out independently by the group who will also publish their assessments: the first of these is expected by mid-1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the meantime good progress is being made with implementing the strategy in accordance with its timetable for key actions: the Garda have deployed additional mobile speed detection units; in co-operation with the Department of the Environment in Northern Ireland and Shell, the National Safety Council has developed a new media campaign, titled &ldquo;Crush&rdquo; and targeting all road users; the National Roads Authority are on target in implementing their low cost remedial measures and traffic calming programmes on national roads; regulations were made earlier this year to widen the scope of the on-the-spot fines <Col N="1350" /> system to include stop and yield sign infringements, traffic light infringements, defective tyres and non-wearing of seat belts; preparations by the Garda and the Medical Bureau of Road Safety for the operation of evidential breath testing for drink driving are at an advanced stage; mandatory roadworthiness testing for cars will commence in January 2000; and significant extra resources have been assigned to my Department's driver testing service.</P>
    <P>Certain measures will require legislative change, in particular the proposal for a penalty points system. This is now being developed by my Department. Consideration is also being given to the possibility of a legislative amendment to provide for random breath testing for drink driving, on a selective basis.</P>

      <P>Following a complaint to the Ombudsman regarding overpayments on a number of local authority housing loans my Department requested local authorities to identify any cases of overpayments on mature housing loans; take appropriate action to ensure that any overpayments on paid up mature loans are refunded; where appropriate, alert borrowers to contact their paying bank with instructions to terminate their standing orders; adopt appropriate procedures to ensure that overpayments of paid up loans do not occur in the future.</P>
      <P>My Department also consulted with the Local Government Computer Services Board whose housing loans system is used by most local authorities. As a result, the board is assisting local authorities in preventing any reoccurrence of the problem. The board has issued a new reporting programme which will identify when a transaction occurs on a paid up account and, in addition, the board has held a number of training courses on the housing loans system throughout the country to advise local authority staff of procedures designed to prevent overpayments. Those local authorities who do not use the board's system have also been requested by the Department to ensure that their system incorporates a facility to clearly identify paid up loans.</P>

      <P>I refer to the reply to Priority Question No. 31 on today's Order Paper. Some 97,000 <Col N="1353" /> applicants are at present awaiting driving tests. Of these, approximately 26,000 have been given test appointments and a further 10,000 have indicated that they are not currently available to be tested.</P>
      <P>While average waiting periods have not been compiled for individual test centres due to limitations in the IT systems involved, the national average waiting time for a test is now some 31 weeks. However, applicants who require a test for urgent reasons are being given earlier appointments. At present some 28 per cent of applicants are being tested within 15 weeks.</P>
      <P>Applications for driving tests are now running at some 36 per cent above earlier levels, driven by exceptional conditions of economic growth. In 1998 an all time record of nearly 150,000 test applications were made to my Department.</P>
      <P>Very significant additional resources are now being allocated to the driver testing service, which will shortly number 103 testers compared to 66 in 1998. Together with recent productivity agreements and Saturday working, this will increase the testing capacity of the service by over 90,000 tests to some 202,000 tests annually.</P>
      <P>Through these actions, I am determined to bring progressive and substantial improvement to the quality of service provided to the public; and in particular to end present excessive and unacceptable waiting times.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>The European Commission has communicated its view that the failure by some Irish local authorities to impose household waste charges does not respect the requirements of Article 15 of Council Directive 75/442/EEC on waste. Our response indicated that the requirements of this article are substantially respected and implemented in Ireland, and that significant progress is being made towards full cost recovery by all local authorities of all costs incurred by them in the provision of waste services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under section 22 of the Waste Management Act, 1996, local authorities are required, in making waste management plans, to have regard to the need to give effect to the polluter pays principle. The October 1998 policy statement on waste management, Changing Our Ways, elaborates on this obligation, and has been brought to the attention of the Commission. This policy <Col N="1354" /> statement emphasises the need for early, major change in the planning, financing and operational approach to waste management by local authorities, and specifically recommends that &ndash; local authorities move rapidly towards full cost recoupment for waste collection and disposal services which they provide, as a matter of equity and to incentives waste reduction, the level of waste charges should vary according to usage, and there should be regional consistency in charging policies and a broad equalisation in the level of such charges.</P>
    <P>In December 1997, the European Commission issued a reasoned opinion to the effect that Ireland had failed fully to transpose the provisions of Directive 94/62/EC on packaging and packaging waste. In March 1998, the Commission was provided with a detailed report on the implementation of this Directive by Ireland, and formally notified of draft regulations intended to address outstanding issues. The Waste Management (Packaging) (Amendment) Regulations, 1998, completed the transposition of this Directive into Irish legislation.</P>
    <P>In July 1998, following earlier correspondence, the European Commission issued a reasoned opinion to the effect that Ireland has failed to fulfil its obligations under Council Directive 75/442/EEC on waste, as amended by Council Directive 91/156/EEC, Council Directive 91/689/EEC on hazardous waste, and European Parliament and Council Directive 94/62/EC on packaging and packaging waste, with regard to the making and content of waste management plans.</P>
    <P>The Commission has been advised that the waste management planning system in Ireland is being very substantially developed and improved, under and in accordance with the Waste Management Act, 1996 and subsequent regulations. Waste management planning authorities are currently subject to legal obligations which significantly exceed those imposed under relevant EU waste directives, and are making very good progress in discharging these obligations.</P>
    <P>In the light of this progress, and our commitment to the conclusion of this comprehensive planning process within a matter of months, the Commission has been requested to defer consideration of further action in this matter. My Department maintains regular contact with Commission services to apprise them of ongoing developments.</P>
    <P>Sectoral reports on the implementation by Ireland of Directive 75/442/EEC on waste (as amended) and Directive 91/689/EEC on hazardous waste were submitted to the Commission in February 1999.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has a proposal before the Government to draft an intoxicating liquor Bill the effect of which will be, among other things, to extend the permitted hours of opening of licensed premises. Demand for change in our present licensing laws has come from publicans/hoteliers/restaurateurs and from their customers and has been influenced by competition-related considerations. I fully recognise and appreciate these marketplace realities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The working arrangements for the proposed extended opening hours are, in the normal course of industrial relations, matters for negotiation between the employers concerned (and/or their representative organisations) and their workers (or, as appropriate, their representative organisations). It is difficult at this early stage to predict the likely employment effects of the additional hours &ndash; these will depend to a large <Col N="1359" /> extent on whether the rosters of the existing workers may be reorganised to absorb the extra hours. If not, the employers may have to resort to additional workers in which case the extended opening hours may produce a small employment dividend.</P>
    <P>Of paramount importance in the latter context, however, is that the statutory rights and entitlements of workers employed in the licensed trade must be fully respected. In particular the rights of employees &ndash; and the corresponding obligations of employers &ndash; in relation to such matters as maximum working hours, hours of rest, night work, Sunday work and holidays as laid out in Organisation of Working Time Act, 1997, must be observed. I have a special concern in this regard for the position of young workers in the trade. Indeed the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act, 1996, prohibits the employment of 16/17 year olds beyond 10 p.m. a prohibition which operates to protect the interests of young workers both as regards their health and safety and as regards their schooling/education.</P>
    <P>It is my intention to take, within the limits of the resources available to me, all possible and appropriate action to ensure that any new opening hours regime for licensed premises functions in a manner which upholds and supports the general working conditions for employees in the sector as prescribed by law. Labour law enforcement activity by my labour inspectorate will reflect this approach.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 94 and 95 together.</P>
      <P>Under the operational programme for environmental services 1994-99 grant aid of some £200,000 was made available to Waterford County Council in 1996 and 1997 towards coast protection schemes at Cunnigar and Tramore costing £266,164.</P>
      <P>I recently announced my Department's coast protection programme for 1999, under which financial assistance will be provided for 29 projects which will be carried out in conjunction with local authorities. In addition, I have also committed funding to develop a geographical information system (GIS) and for coastal and aerial survey work. The data generated from this essential survey work will critically inform future coastal protection programmes. This year's programme involves expenditure of some £4.9 million to combat coastal erosion and represents a fivefold increase on the annual funding available in previous years.</P>
      <P>Waterford County Council has not to date applied to my Department for further financial assistance towards implementation of other coast protection measures at Cunnigar or Tramore.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>Article 169 of the treaty establishing the European Economic Community (TEC), provides that if the Commission considers that a member state has failed to fulfil an obligation under the treaty, it shall deliver a reasoned opinion on the matter after giving the State concerned the opportunity to submit its observations; and that, if the State concerned does not comply with the opinion within the period laid down by the Commission, the latter may bring the matter before the European Court of Justice.</P>
      <P>When it believes that a member state has failed to meet its obligations under the treaty the Commission, acting under Article 169, writes formally to the member state concerned, in the normal course to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, setting out its views and asking the member state to submit observations on the contents of the Commission letter within two months of receipt there- of. The letter advises that after taking note of the observations of the member state, the Commission may, if necessary, deliver a reasoned opinion under Article 169; and also that, if it does not receive a response within the time limit given, the Commission may deliver a reasoned opinion.</P>
      <P>When the Commission issues a reasoned opinion under the provisions of Article 169, it invites the member state to take the measures necessary to comply with the reasoned opinion within two months of the notification thereof.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no set procedure or timetable for dealing with any general enquiry which the Commission might issue to a member state in advance <Col N="1362" /> of initiating any proceedings under Article 169. In this connection the Commission keeps under constant review, in consultation with the member states, the possibility of improving working methods in relation to infringement cases and, whenever possible, endeavours to deal with complaints without resorting to formal infringement procedures.</P>
    <P>As I indicated, the Commission addresses the formal letters issued under Article 169, and also the reasoned opinions, to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. As the Department of Foreign Affairs would not have direct responsibility for implementing EU regulations, the Article 169 letter is passed to the Department concerned, which examines the matter and prepares a draft reply which subsequently issues from the permanent representative or deputy permanent representative to the European Union in Brussels.</P>
    <P>It would not be feasible to supply the Deputy with a schedule of Commission communications in relation to infringement cases. If there is a particular case of interest to the Deputy, he might like to let me have the details.</P>

      <P>The Department of Agriculture and Food issues pre-printed area aid application forms as a service to farmers. However, the onus rests with all herd owners to submit an area aid application form before the closing date. My Department did not receive an application form in respect of the 1998 area aid scheme from the <Col N="1365" /> person named. An application cannot now be accepted for 1998.</P>

      <P>There was a parcel of land on the 1998 area aid application for the above named which was also being claimed by another applicant. Both applicants were contacted regarding this matter and the person named admitted that he did not have the right to declare this parcel on his application. The area of this land parcel constituted an over-claim in excess of 20 per cent. Under EU regulations this results in the application of a 100 per cent penalty.</P>

      <P>The person named declared his forage area as 2.87 hectares in his 1998 area aid application. Clause 11 of the terms and conditions governing the 1998 cattle headage scheme requires that applicants under the scheme must occupy and farm at least three hectares of utilised agricultural land. Accordingly, as he does not have sufficient forage area, he is not eligible for grants under the cattle headage scheme.</P>
      <P>He did not hold a milk quota in 1998 and did not apply for grants under the 1998 ewe premium or sheep headage schemes. He did, however, apply for the 1998 suckler cow premium scheme but did not have a suckler cow quota. He did not, therefore, qualify for grants under the 1998 suckler cow premium scheme or the 1998 or 1999 winter fodder schemes.</P>

      <P>The person named applied for an allocation of suckler cow quota from the 1999 national reserve. He applied under category B which was reserved for farmers who already held a suckler cow quota and who required additional quota to ensure the future viability of their holding. Because of the small amount of quota available for distribution, it was decided that only farmers in this category who held at least ten and not more than 20 livestock units, would be considered for an allocation.</P>
      <P>Livestock units were calculated with reference to the number of livestock units on which ewe premium, suckler cow premium, and special beef premium had been claimed in the 1998 marketing year. The livestock units equivalent of any milk quota held on 1 April 1998 would also be taken into account.</P>
      <P>The person named held 29.8 livestock units made up as follows: special beef premium &ndash; 5.6; suckler cow premium &ndash; 14; milk quota &ndash; 10.26.</P>
      <P>As his total livestock units exceeds the upper limit of 20, he does not qualify for an allocation of quota from this reserve.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Western Development Commission, which was set up on a statutory basis on 1 February 1999, will administer the fund. An initial provision of £5 million for the fund is included in the Vote for my Department in 1999.</P>
      <P>Being financed by the Exchequer, it is necessary to obtain the clearance of the EU Commission for the operation of the fund as a state aid.

      <P>The person named applied on 24 animals under the 1998 cattle headage scheme. At an inspection carried out on 17 August 1998, two animals were found to have lost their eartags. Under clause 19 (c) of the terms and conditions governing the scheme, no payment can be made on any animal found to have lost its eartag. He was advised of this in writing on the date of the inspection and was given the opportunity to appeal this decision within seven days. As the person named did not appeal, payment of his entitlement of £653.60 under the 1998 cattle headage scheme, based on 22 animals, issued on 10 December 1998.</P>
      <P>The person named submitted his application under the 1998 cattle headage scheme on 16 June 1998 so payment was subject to a 7 per cent late application penalty in accordance with clause 18 of the terms and conditions of the scheme.</P>

      <Quest>the amount of payments provided for in the CAP allocations to Ireland for the years 2000 to 2006 relating to cattle headage, sheep headage, sheep premia and suckler cow grants in disadvantaged areas; and if these EU payments will be supplemented by payments from the Exchequer.</Quest>
      <QRef>[10923/99]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The agreement on CAP reform, which was finalised at the European Council in Berlin on 24-26 March 1999, contained no specific allocations to member states under Agenda 2000 relating to sheep premia, suckler cow grants or compensatory allowances, which include cattle headage and sheep headage.</P>
      <P>As far as the suckler cow and the ewe premiums are concerned, payments under these schemes will depend both on the level of applications and the rate of premium in the year in question. In the case of the suckler cow scheme, the rate of premium will increase in three equal stages from 169.15 euro in 1999 to 214.15 euro in 2002. It is important to note that the suckler cow quota for this country was protected in the negotiations. The rate of the ewe premium will vary in accordance with market prices.</P>
      <P>The agreement on CAP reform also covered the continuation of EU aid to farmers for certain structural measures, including compensatory allowances.</P>
      <P>There are, however, two important changes as regards the implementation of this measure in the coming period. Compensatory allowances will be payable on a hectare basis rather than on each animal and they will be met from the guarantee rather than the guidance side of the EAGGF (European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department is at present examining what might be the best approach in transferring to the new system. As regards funding, the council agreed to the broad rural development budget for <Col N="1373" /> the union as a whole, an average of 4.7 billion Euro annually over the seven year period 2000-2006. It is expected that the EU Commission will shortly decide on indicative allocations for individual member states for a package of rural development measures which for Ireland would include aid for the environment, REPS, early retirement, compensatory allowances and forestry. It would then be up to member states to submit a proposal for formal approval to the Commission on a balanced allocation of these funds to the various measures.</P>
    <P>It is a general requirement under the structural funds and guarantee fund regulations that EU structural funding is also supported by national Exchequer resources. The level of such resources can only be considered in the light of the indicative allocation Ireland receives from the European Union.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">

      <P>I expect that approximately two million gallons of milk quota will be available from the national reserve for distribution in the 1999-2000 milk quota year. The vast bulk of this quota will be allocated, on the recommendations of the milk quota appeals tribunal, to producers, free of charge, on hardship grounds or on a temporary basis on animal disease grounds.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the milk quota appeals tribunal is a body established to consider applications for additional quota from producers who have suffered severe hardship as a result of the introduction of the milk quota system. In assessing eligibility for additional quota on the grounds of severe hardship, the tribunal takes account of the following factors: (i) current quota size; (ii) off-farm income and/or other farm enterprises; (iii) size of holding; (iv) family circumstances including succession; (v) commitment to dairying; (vi) financial problems; (vii) previous allocations from the national reserve; (vii) producers with a low butterfat representative level.</P>
      <P>The amount of quota available for allocation is limited in the context of the large numbers of applications which are submitted.</P>
      <P>Other applications for additional quota are assessed on their own individual merits.</P>

      <P>Without a valid area aid application for the relevant year, headage payments cannot issue to a herdowner. Consequently, as a 1997 area aid application was not submitted by the person named, payment cannot issue in respect of his 1997 equine headage application.</P>
      <P>The person named applied on 12 mares under the 1998 equine headage scheme. One of the mares &ndash; Passport Number 2318763 was not registered with the Irish horse register. My Department wrote to him on 22 October 1998 and on 2 December 1998 requesting that the mare be registered and that following registration he should send the passport to the district livestock office for checking. My Department also requested in this correspondence that he should submit the passport for the mare with the passport No. 96638.  To date, no reply has been received. These passports must be provided before the application can be processed further.</P>

      <P>Under paragraph 2 of the terms and conditions of the scheme applicants must have suckler cows surplus to the cows needed to produce their milk quotas in order to be considered for payment. The person named is deemed to require 16.25 cows, milk quota of 14,581 divided by the national average yield of 897 gallons, to fill his milk quota. As he declared a total of 34 cows in his herd he was deemed to be entitled to payment on 17.75 cows. Payment has already issued in respect of these cows. A subsequent check by the local office confirmed that the person named had made an error and had a total of 44 cows in his herd on the date of application instead of 34. Arrangements are being made to pay the balance on 6.25 suckler cows as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>The Minister for the Environment and Local Government has primary responsibility for the quality of drinking water in Ireland.</P>
      <P>However, the objectives of the rural environment protection scheme, REPS, operated by my Department include the establishment of farming practices and production methods which reflect the need for environmental conservation and protection.</P>
      <P>REPS is a voluntary scheme and all participants must carry out their farming activities in accordance with an agri-environmental plan for the holding which complies with the scheme conditions and specifications. This plan sets out a nutrient management programme for the total area of the farm and also lays down conditions regarding the application of slurry and fertilisers.</P>
      <P>REPS has recently been revised to include a supplementary measure, which provides support for farmers who are required to comply with certain environmental guidelines under the EU habitats and birds directives or who have to reduce their stocking rates to allow for the regeneration of degraded commonages. Farmers in the areas in which this new measure will apply, i.e. natural heritage areas (NHAs), including special areas of conservation, SACs, special protection areas, SPAs and all commonages, will be able to avail of compensation at the following rates: 242 euros-hectare up to and including the first 40 hectares; 24 euros/hectare for areas over 40 hectares and up to and including 80 hectares and 18 euros/hectare for areas over 80 hectares and up to 120 hectares max.</P>
      <P>Applicants under the nationally funded schemes for the control of farmyard pollution and improvement of dairy hygiene standards, which I expect to introduce shortly, will be required to have a nutrient management plan in place in order to qualify for grant aid.</P>

      <P>The Irish national lottery began operating in 1987 under the provisions of the National Lottery Act, 1986. It is operated by An Post under licence from the Minister for Finance. State control is retained, while efficiency is encouraged by placing the lottery in a competitive business environment. The licence sets out the detailed framework in which the lottery must operate, but within that, the licence holder can operate with commercial freedom.</P>
      <P>Under the existing licensing arrangements, the number of agents to be appointed to sell lottery tickets or to operate the Lotto game is a matter for determination by the National Lottery Company (NLC) subject to the consent of the Minister for Finance. The company advises me that the present number of agents selling lottery tickets is based on the level of population and is in accordance with international norms for sales of this nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All applications for agencies are considered in detail by the NLC having regard to such factors as their existing sales network in the area, volume of business, distance from the other outlets and so on. Although the NLC constantly reviews the network, a process which sometimes give rise to alterations, I am advised that the on-line Lotto network of approximately 2,010 terminals is cur<Col N="1379" /> rently satisfying player demand. In this context, there are no plans to increase the number of agents at present.</P>
    <P>The Department of Public Enterprise has advised that the European Parliament and Council Directive 97/67/EC on common rules for the development of the internal market of Community postal services and the improvement of quality of services in all member states ideals with, <i>inter alia</i>, the basis for defining postal services which are provided on a monopoly and a competitive basis respectively.

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 141 and 145 together.</P>
      <P>I refer the Deputies, for their information, to the reply to the Adjournment Debate held on 2 March 1999 which dealt comprehensively with this matter. I can confirm that I have no plans to add visually impaired persons to the list of those eligible for the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1381" /> The present medical criteria for access to the scheme relate essentially to disabilities which seriously and permanently impair the physical mobility of the person concerned. This reflects the origins of the scheme as a relief for disabled persons who were confined to wheelchairs but nevertheless were capable of driving suitably adapted motor cars.</P>
    <P>A review of the scheme is being undertaken by an interdepartmental group chaired by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The existing medical criteria for qualification is one of the issues that have been raised with that group. I await their report.</P>
    <P>However the current scheme is costly and opening it up to wider ranges of disabilities would significantly add to this cost. I must caution, therefore, against an expectation that a broader range of persons who suffer from some form of disability or disablement will be admitted to the scheme as a result of this review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Elderly siblings relief under capital acquisitions tax (CAT), which was introduced in 1991, recognises the special circumstances of elderly siblings living together and eases the tax burden associated with the inheritances of a &ldquo;family&rdquo; home in such situations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The relief allows the value of a house or part of a house which is inherited to be reduced for CAT purposes by £150,000 or 80 per cent, whichever is the lesser. Given the current Class II threshold of £25,720, the share in the house passed by <Col N="1382" /> inheritance would have to be worth over £128,600 in order that tax be payable under this relief. This calculation assumes that no other gifts or inheritances have been received by the recipient since 2 December, 1988. This is a significant concession and should exclude most elderly siblings from paying CAT on the inheritance of all or part of their &ldquo;family&rdquo; home. To qualify for this relief the successor must fulfil the following conditions: be either a brother or sister of the disponer; have attained the age of 55 years; have resided in the house with the deceased sibling (disponer) continuously for a period of not less than five year's ending on the date of the inheritance; and not be the beneficial owner of any other house or an appropriate part of any other house.</P>
    <P>A broadly similar relief was introduced in the 1998 budget, to cater for the situations that arise where other close relatives, for example grandchildren or nieces-nephews, who have been resident with the disponer inherit their homes.</P>
    <P>Conditions of the scheme are that the beneficiary must be a close relative of the disponer i.e. the relationship comes within those defined under the Class II threshold for CAT, both the disponer and the recipient must have been living in the house for ten continuous years immediately prior to the inheritance and the recipient cannot be the beneficial owner of any other house or part of another house. The five year continuous residence requirement has been extended to ten years in view of the fact that no age criterion will apply. The terms of the relief are similar to those of the elderly sibling relief, i.e. reduction in the value of the house for CAT purposes of 80 per cent or £150,000, whichever is the lesser.</P>
    <P>These provisions address the situations the Deputy appears to have in mind. However, I recently undertook in the Dáil that prior to the next budget, I would examine the operation of the CAT code in detail. Reliefs in the CAT area are costly and, for this reason, must be looked at in a budgetary context when choices have to be made on which elements of the tax system to address.</P>

The reply to them is currently being prepared. This is part of the normal process associated with obtaining EU approval and that the procedure may take some time to complete.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 150 and 154 together.</P>
      <P>It is not correct to state that some pensioners have been denied full restoration of pension parity.</P>
      <P>The position is that, in June 1997, in An Action Programme for the Millennium, the Government undertook to protect public service pensions. In November 1997, the Government announced that the benefit of the restructuring pay deals under the Programme for Competitiveness and Work  would apply on the basis of parity to public servants who had retired before the commencement dates of those deals; however, in order to protect retired public servants who would have received less than 3 per cent had parity been applied in the normal way, the Government decided that a minimum increase of 3 per cent (or 2 per cent in the case of any pensioners who have already received an advance payment of 1 per cent) should apply.</P>
      <P>Following the Government decision in November 1997, my Department issued comprehensive guidelines for dealing with cases. Initially, there were difficulties in interpreting how these guidelines applied to certain groups of pensioners. These issues were subsequently resolved and my Department, along with the other Departments involved, made every effort to ensure that the terms of the Government decision were fully implemented.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, my Department is directly responsible for Civil Service pensioners. A number of these pensioners have not yet received their full entitlement under the various PCW restructuring deals. The bulk of them did, of course, receive an interim payment in 1997 or early in 1998. However, because of the nature and complexity of the various restructuring pay deals many thousands of individual pensioner files had to be examined in order to determine the individual benefits. My Department has sought the relevant service details of these pensioners from their parent Departments in order to determine their full entitlement under the relevant restructuring deals. The compilation of this information by the parent Departments is time consuming because the individual files have to be examined manually and the relevant information may not be readily available on the files. Nevertheless, I can assure the Deputy that all relevant cases will benefit from the Government decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1386" /> In some cases it has not been possible to make any payment to pensioners because a PCW restructuring pay deal has not been concluded for serving staff; they will, however, benefit when the restructuring deals are completed for the relevant serving officers.</P>

      <Quest>the amount a child can inherit from a parent before capital acquisition tax is payable; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the amount has not kept pace with the increases in value of houses which a child might inherit and there are instances where children have to sell the family home in order to pay the tax; and if he will make a statement on whether he proposes to raise the limit.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>A child can inherit up to £192,900 from his-her parents free of capital acquisitions tax &ndash; CAT. This exempt amount is described as the Class I threshold. Smaller thresholds apply to gifts or inheritances received from other close relatives &ndash; class II &ndash; £25,720 &ndash; and from others not covered by the above two thresholds &ndash; class III &ndash; £12,860. Only the value of benefits received in excess of the relevant threshold gives rise to a charge to CAT. Transfers between spouses do not give rise to CAT. Since 1990 these thresholds have been indexed annually by reference to the consumer price index.</P>
      <P>Where the beneficiary has received previous gifts or inheritances since 2 December 1988, the value of these benefits is added to the value of the current benefit when determining the CAT liability. This process is known as aggregation. The rate of CAT on inheritances is nil up to the appropriate threshold rate, 20 per cent on the next £10,000, 30 per cent on the next £30,000 and 40 per cent on the balance. CAT on gifts is charged at three-quarters of the rate on inheritance.</P>
      <P>In order to accommodate concerns about large inheritances of property taken by children on the death of their parents, the class I threshold would have to be significantly increased. Apart from the significant Exchequer costs involved by greatly increasing the amount of wealth which could be passed free of tax, there is also the question of tax equity to be considered. Significantly increasing the class I threshold would benefit only those who receive substantial inheritances from their parents in one form or another. The yield from inheritance tax was £75 million for 1998. This revenue greatly assists the Government's programme and helps achieve the on-going goal of reducing the tax take on employment incomes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nonetheless, I undertook on the passage of the recent Finance Bill, to examine the CAT code for the next budget. Any changes in the CAT area are costly and, for this reason, must be looked at in a budgetary context when choices have to be <Col N="1387" /> made on which elements of the tax system to address.</P>

      <P>My Department has no specific guidelines in relation to the provision of services to the parents of multiple birth children.</P>
      <P>Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on means. It is open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board for a medical card if they are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves or their dependants without hardship. Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board.</P>
      <P>Income guidelines have been drawn up by the chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these are revised annually in line with the consumer price index. However these guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that an applicant's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this.</P>
      <P>Non-medical card holders are entitled to a broad range of health services including an entitlement to public hospital and public consultant treatment subject only to modest statutory charges, and to out-patient services free of charge.</P>
      <P>There are also schemes which provide assistance towards the cost of medication. Health boards may also provide assistance under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme in circumstances where this is considered appropriate.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the national breast screening programme, all women aged 50 to 64 years in the Eastern, North-Eastern and Midland Health Board areas are being invited to attend for a screening mammogram. For those women who require further assessment and-or treatment, these services will be available to all women, <Col N="1390" /> including medical card holders, within the public hospital system. Under the first phase of the national cervical screening programme, which is being developed in the Mid-Western Health Board, all women aged between 25 to 60 in the Mid-Western Health Board area will receive screening free of charge at five year intervals. It is envisaged that screening will commence early next year. Following evaluation of the first phase the programme will be rolled out to the rest of the country.</P>

      <P>The Government has no plans to introduce legislation which would require all agencies providing health related support services to persons with a mental handicap and those with a physical and sensory disability to have parent representatives on their boards of management.</P>
      <P>A major proportion of services for people with disabilities are provided by voluntary agencies. Many of these agencies are parent and friends associations with parental representation on their boards of management. For others, and in particular the religious orders involved in this area, this issue can present particular difficulties because of the structures within which they work.</P>
      <P>I am aware, however, that the Federation of Voluntary Bodies Providing Services to People with Mental Handicap, which represents voluntary agencies in this area, has met with the parents group set up by the National Association for the Mentally Handicapped of Ireland (NAMHI) to discuss this and other related matters with a view to putting in place mechanisms which will increase parental involvement in all aspects of the services.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Health and Children</askee>
      <Quest>the efforts, if any, being made to improve services in accident and emergency departments in Dublin hospitals, particularly Beaumont and the Mater hospitals; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware the levels of attendance at accident and emergency departments are complex and difficult to predict and all of them experience periods of exceptional demand which can result in delays for patients. However, it is important to note that appropriate medical treat<Col N="1391" /> ment is provided at all times and that waiting periods are kept to a minimum.</P>
      <P>In 1998, I made an additional £2.3 million available for the development of accident and emergency services. This additional funding was used primarily for the launch by the Eastern Health Board of a national public education campaign aimed at persuading people with minor ailments to attend their family doctor rather than a hospital accident and emergency department, and also the development of a range of initiatives in major accident and emergency departments. Within this funding, Beaumont and the Mater hospital each received an allocation of £200,000. In both hospitals the funding was deployed for the provision of additional accident and emergency staff in order to alleviate pressures in the accident and emergency department.</P>
      <P>This year I provided further funding of £2 million to enable major acute hospitals to implement various initiatives aimed at addressing some of the difficulties being experienced in our accident and emergency departments particularly during periods of peak demand. These initiatives will include measures to free up beds for emergency admissions through the provision of alternative step down facilities for patients occupying beds in acute hospitals for lengthy periods. They will allow for the provision of enhanced staffing levels, the development of rapid diagnostic systems for common emergency presentations, continued development of treatment/observation areas in accident and emergency departments and an improved access for general practitioners to urgent specialist opinion. Within this allocation of £2 million, a sum of £200,000 was allocated to Beaumont hospital and this funding is to be used for a total refurbishment of its accident and emergency department. A sum of £210,000 was allocated to the Mater hospital and my Department is in discussion with regard to the deployment of the 1999 allocation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that I have also published the report of the review group on the waiting list initiative and am committed to ensuring that its recommended approach is implemented. The report is one of a number of measures which I have taken to address the question of long waiting lists and waiting times. I have provided a total of £20 million for waiting list activity in 1999. This is a 66 per cent percent increase over the amount provided in 1998 and is two and a half times higher than the sum of £8 million provided by the previous Government in 1997. The report recommended the implementation of a range of steps to free up acute hospital facilities for more elective work. It pointed out that a significant proportion of acute hospital beds were being inappropriately used by patients who did not need, or who no longer needed, acute hospital care. This problem arises due to a shortage of places in the areas of &ldquo;step-down&rdquo; or convalescent care, rehabilitation facilities and community based ser<Col N="1392" /> vices which reduce the need to use acute hospital care.</P>
    <P>In an effort to address these problems, I have provided extra funding in 1999 of £9 million for services for older people. This funding will help to free up acute hospital beds which are currently occupied by patients who could be accommodated in more appropriate convalescent or extended care facilities or discharged home if adequate community supports were available. It will be used, <i>inter alia</i>, to improve the home help service, increase the number of nursing and paramedical staff in the community, provide support for carers, enable a number of new health board convalescent or extended care facilities to open and increase the number of private nursing home places either subvented or contracted by health boards. There are also a number of chronic sick in acute hospitals who have completed the acute phase of their illness and who are awaiting placement at a level of care more appropriate to their needs. The task of identifying and securing appropriate alternative care facilities for them is under way and this also will have a significant impact on freeing up acute beds in general hospitals over the coming months. I am confident that the measures I have outlined will contribute to improvements in availability of beds in the acute sector and ease pressures in accident and emergency departments in Dublin.</P>

      <P>In regard to current or revenue funding, my Department does not make specific financial allocations in respect of the Hospital of the Assumption, Thurles or any other health board hospital. The relevant funding is contained within the overall financial determination to the Mid-Western Health Board and it is a matter for the board in framing its service plan to decide on the priorities locally. I will ask the board's chief executive officer to supply the Deputy with the expenditure figures in respect of this particular hospital for the years in question.</P>
      <P>As regards capital funding, the Mid-Western Health Board was notified in July 1995 that £140,000 was available in respect of planning fees for the proposed replacement for the Hospital of the Assumption. However, until recently, there was little prospect of proceeding with the project due to unavailability of the overall funding required and approval to selection of the design team was not conveyed until 19 April. In the circumstances, only £23,000 of the £140,000 was drawn down. When the design team is appointed, the planning process will proceed quickly. The required capital funding will be approved and released as the project proceeds.</P>

In addition the Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative, which is a global campaign led by the World Health Organisation and UNICEF to encourage hospitals and health workers to support mothers to breastfeed, <Col N="1395" /> has recently been established in Ireland. Participation in this initiative was recommended in the national breastfeeding policy for Ireland and I am confident that participation in this initiative will result in an increase in the incidence of breastfeeding in this country.</P>

      <P>The administration of the registration system is a <Col N="1398" /> matter for An tArd-Chláraitheoir, the Registrar-General of Births, Deaths and Marriages, and for local registrars who operate under his general direction.</P>
      <P>In my reply of 22 April 1999, in relation to steps being taken to maintain and improve indexes to the records of births, deaths and marriages, I referred to the special project for the capture of the records and associated indexes in an electronic format which has been ongoing in Roscommon for some time. The first stage of this work which involves scanning the records and indexes from 1844 is making steady progress and the project team will shortly be in the position to begin the development of a retrieval package. When this archival records project is completed, it will improve the efficiency, flexibility, access and management of the records and the associated indexes and will provide potential for the development of a range of services, which would not be possible in a system reliant on paper based indexes. I am sure that the Deputy will appreciate that this will be of benefit to all customers of the registration services throughout the country, including those who currently avail of the services of the research room in the General Register Office.</P>
      <P>In the interim I understand that the data from the indexes to births which have been scanned, will soon be available to augment the current computer aided retrieval system in operation in the General Register Office but some adjustments will have to be made to the current system to facilitate this work. In addition, plans are in hand to relocate the public counter on the first floor in Joyce House to provide additional space in the public search room.</P>

      <P>Our inhabited offshore islands lie within the areas of responsibility of three health boards and it is the statutory responsibility of these boards to provide health services to the population. I have been advised by the North-Western Health Board that it has established a steering committee which is in discussion with island representatives to agree an action plan for service enhancements. Donegal County Council and other agencies also work with the board in this pursuit. Both Aranmore Island and Tory Island have permanent public health nursing services and there is also a permanent general practitioner service on Aranmore which is also provided with a weekly dental service, a monthly chiropody service, a twice-monthly community welfare service and a social work service as required. There are plans to <Col N="1399" /> introduce an optician service. At present the board is considering a proposal from the community group on Aranmore Island for a small nursing unit on the island. The proposal is that the community group will provide and run the nursing unit if subventions are provided by the board and if some capital grant is provided by the board. There is a social work service to Tory Island as required.</P>
      <P>The Southern Health Board has advised me there are seven inhabited islands in its region. There is a permanent public health nursing service on Cape Clear Island and on Bere Island. A general practitioner attends as required and in addition there are regular clinics on Cape Clear Island. School medical services are provided annually on Cape Clear, Sherkin and Bere Islands but the children of Whiddy Island attend school on the mainland. There are no children on Dursey, Hare or Long Islands. The board has informed me that it would not be feasible to provide a dental service on the islands as the proper maintenance of equipment would be a particular difficulty because of infrequent use and the problems of corrosion from sea air. Similarly, there are no arrangements for the provision of ophthalmic services on the islands. Although neither service should require frequent visits to the mainland.  Visits by social work staff and community welfare staff are arranged as required. Arrangements are being made for the provision of an island based chiropody service.</P>
      <P>The Western Health Board has advised me that apart from the general practitioner resident on Inishmor a second general practitioner has been engaged under a pilot scheme allowing for the provision of a full service to Inishmor and a weekly service to Inishmaan and Inishere. There is a weekly children's dental clinic held on Inishmor and annual school visits to the three Aran Islands. Residents of Inishboffin attend Clifden health centre for dental treatment. There is an annual visit by an ophthalmologist to the Aran Islands for both adults and children, residents of Inishboffin attend Clifden health centre. A chiropodist visits Inishboffin twice a year but there is an arrangement that if treatment is required by an individual who is visiting Galway they will be facilitated. Assistance is provided to residents of Inishmaan and Inishere travelling to Inishmor for dental treatment. Arrangements have been made to establish an inter agency working party which is expected to report later this year at which time decisions on developments on offshore islands can be taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government established, in January last year, an interdepartmental committee on the Islands, the Gaeltacht and the Irish Language, under the chairmanship of the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Cuív. That committee has met on a number of occasions and my Department in represented on it. The committee provided a most useful forum for a broadly based consideration of matters relevant to the islands, including health <Col N="1400" /> services. I understand that on 4 March 1999, the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Cuív, met with the relevant programme managers from those health boards dealing with the islands and the Gaeltacht. I trust the above clarifies matters for the Deputy.</P>

    <P>Funding has also been provided for the deployment of 24 cancer nurse co-ordinators in the Eastern Health Board region. These posts are currently being phased in.  A range of other support services are provided in various health board regions such as public health nurses, general practitioner support etc., to assist cancer patients in their home environment.</P>
    <P>I regard the services provided by home care nurses as extremely valuable. The health boards are currently prioritising service developments for the next few years. I expect the development of cancer support services by home care nurses will feature in these statements of priority. I will be happy to consider them in light of available resources.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1404" /> Local authorities carried out their statutory assessments of housing needs on 31 March last and authorities have been asked to forward a full analysis of their assessments to my Department by 31 May. The assessment of need will provide accurate data on the extent and nature of housing needs for households seeking local authority accommodation and for homeless persons in each local authority area. It will take some time to obtain returns from all 90 local authorities and to ensure that they are comprehensive and complete. However, I expect to be in a position to have the results published in my Department's housing statistics bulletin for the September quarter.</P>
    <P>The length of time households are on local authority housing waiting lists can vary and depends on a number of factors such as their assessed priority for housing, the number of households already on the lists, the numbers of new applicants for housing, the number of local authority houses provided each year as well as the rate of casual vacancies occurring in each local authority area.</P>
    <P>Information is not available in my Department on the numbers of persons staying, or on the length of their stay, in emergency short-term accommodation which includes accommodation in homeless hostels and shelters as well as bed and breakfast accommodation. Most of the emergency accommodation for homeless persons is located in the Dublin area.</P>

      <P>The computer aided mobilisation project is being implemented nationally on a phased basis through three regional centres. The Dublin centre is in operation and currently caters for the Dublin area and Laois and Meath via an interim system. The centre is intended to cover the Leinster counties, Cavan and Monaghan. It is hoped to bring the remaining counties into the system on a phased basis as early as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The operation of the fire service, including its financial arrangements, is a matter for individual fire authorities. Fire authority income to meet such costs would, in the main, comprise income from rates, fees and charges from goods and services and general purpose grants. As a result of increased allocations which I have made from the Local Government (Equalisation) Fund in 1998 and from the Local Government Fund in 1999, <Col N="1405" /> local authorities will be greatly assisted in meeting additional costs which might arise.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 193 and 194 together.</P>
      <P>Comhar &ndash; the National Sustainable Development Partnership, which was established in February 1999, is an independent body acting under terms of reference agreed by Government. As I indicated in the reply to Question No. 14 of 3 March 1999, I expect that Comhar will make a significant contribution towards the national pursuit of sustainable development. It will be influential in contributing to policy development and implementation, and also in promoting awareness of, and national consensus on, sustainable development in Ireland. Under its terms of reference, Comhar is required to determine its own work programme within three months of establishment. In this regard, I have drawn the attention of Comhar to a number of specific issues and invited it to: make recommendations on how to influence behaviour across the economy and society to support action under the forthcoming National Greenhouse Gas Abatement Strategy; arrange appropriate public participation in Ireland in the consultative process which is taking place at EU level in the context of the global assessment of the EU's Fifth Environment Action Programme; and make recommendations on good practice models and instruments to inform and influence more environmentally sustainable behaviour.</P>
      <P>Comhar may make recommendations to any Minister of the Government, and may also address itself to various sectors of society, including the general public. I will carefully consider any recommendations made by Comhar which relate to my area of responsibility. I expect that all of Comhar's recommendations, which will be published, will be influential in contributing to the understanding and further development and implementation of sustainable development policies. A copy of an introductory booklet on Comhar has been placed in the Oireachtas Library.</P>

The proposals are being developed from a range of options prepared by consultants on behalf of the Commission. While the estimated costs and other implications of a range of scenarios for emission ceilings are now under examination, the measures which may be necessary at EU and national levels and the associated costs, are dependent upon the final ceilings which will be adopted in due course by the Council of Environment Ministers in co-operation with the European Parliament.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 199 and 200 together.</P>
      <P>Designations under the new urban renewal scheme were based on Integrated Area Plans submitted by local authorities and were in line with recommendations made by an expert advisory panel which I established to assess all of the plans submitted. The IAPs were drawn up on the basis of detailed guidelines prepared by the expert panel and issued to local authorities. These guidelines made it clear that, in selecting areas for the preparation of IAPs, local authorities were expected to give priority to areas in cities and towns with strong urban characteristics and the highest concentrations of physical decay and socio-economic disadvantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The panel considered the amount of land proposed for designation in Dungarvan by Waterford County Council to be excessive. A number of areas suggested by the Council for designation were not recommended by the panel. With regard to the Waterford Foods site, the panel confined their recommendation for designation to one sub-area at Bridge House, Davitts Quay. This sub-area will qualify for commercial tax incentives only which cannot be brought into effect until approved by the EU Commission under State aid rules. The expert panel exercised an independent role in assessing the plans submitted and making recommendations on the sub-areas to be designated in the context of these plans. The recommendations made by the panel were accepted in full and that is the basis on which designation is now being implemented. There is no proposal to <Col N="1408" /> designate further areas under the urban renewal scheme which runs until 28 February 2002.</P>

      <P>The Waste Management Act, 1996 provides a comprehensive and flexible legislative framework within which progressive waste management policies may be pursued and implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1409" /> To date, the primary focus in relation to the operation of the Act has been the introduction of secondary legislation in response to EU and national requirements reflected in the Act, the development and improvement of our waste management planning system, and the implementation of an effective waste licensing system which ensures that waste recovery and disposal activities comply with high standards of environmental protection. Further initiatives will be undertaken on a progressive basis, utilising the powers available under the Act, in support of an improved waste management performance.</P>
    <P>To date, 14 sets of regulations have been made under the 1996 Act. Under Part II of the Act local authorities are required to make waste management plans in respect of their functional areas, and the Environmental Protection Agency &ndash; EPA &ndash; is required to make a national hazardous waste management plan.</P>
    <P>I refer to the reply to a previous question today with regard to the significant progress which has been made in relation to waste management planning by local authorities. It is anticipated that the EPA will shortly publish a draft national hazardous waste management plan. Producer responsibility obligations have been introduced under Part III of the 1996 Act in relation to packaging waste and farm plastic waste.</P>
    <P>Part IV of the Act provides for a stringent system of integrated waste licensing in respect of waste recovery and disposal activities. Licensing obligations are being imposed on a phased basis. The EPA has received 100 waste licence applications, and has granted ten licences and given notice of three proposed licensing decisions. Specified waste disposal and recovery activities may be subject to a local authority waste permit in lieu of a waste licence from the EPA.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that there should be effective implementation and enforcement by local authorities of relevant provisions of the 1996 Act, and of subordinate regulations. In this regard, I consider that local authorities should maintain a strong and continuing focus on the implementation of environmental legislation generally.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 206, 207 and 208 together.</P>
      <P>Local authorities carried out their statutory assessments of housing needs on 31 March last and authorities have been asked to forward a full analysis of their assessments to my Department by 31 May. The assessment of need will provide accurate data on the extent and nature of housing needs in each local authority area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will take some time to obtain returns from <Col N="1411" /> all 90 local authorities and to ensure that they are comprehensive and complete. However, I expect to be in a position to have the results published in my Department's housing statistics bulletin for the September quarter and I will ensure that copies of the bulletin will be placed in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    <P>The local authority housing programme, together with the output from the complementary social housing measures and vacancies occurring in the existing housing stock, enabled the housing needs of some 8,500 households to be catered for in 1998. I expect that the needs of more than 10,300 households will be catered for in 1999.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 212 and 213 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The matters referred to are essentially matters for each local authority and my Department does not systematically collect information on them. However, the Department did carry out an informal survey last year among local authorities on the extent of the problems with unfinished housing estates and the factors contributing to such problems. Replies were received from 77 of the 88 planning authorities and revealed that 706 housing estates are regarded as unfinished and <Col N="1413" /> 1248 estates have not yet been taken in charge. The size of the estates varied in size from approximately two to 200 houses. From the information received it is not possible to estimate the number of houses affected.</P>
    <P>The issue of unfinished estates is being considered in the context of the review of the Planning Acts. My proposals to deal with the enforcement of planning control, including unfinished estates, will be contained in the major Bill to reform and consolidate the Planning Acts which I hope to publish by mid-year.</P>
    <P>Kildare County Council is among the planning authorities which responded to the Department's survey and stated that 103 estates were unfinished. The Department does not have any funds at its disposal for unfinished housing estates. Local authorities have been asked to ensure that permissions for development of housing estates are subject to a condition under which an acceptable security is provided by way of bond or otherwise so as to ensure the satisfactory completion of the estate.</P>

      <P>A deciding officer therefore disallowed her payment from 13 April 1999 on the grounds that she was not incapable of work within the meaning of the social welfare legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The employment status of members of the entertainment profession has been examined in recent years by my Department in conjunction with the Office of the Revenue Commissioners. In general, entertainers, actors and dancers are classified as employees for both income tax and PRSI purposes. As employees they are insurable for all benefits and pensions, both long-term and short-term, covered by the PRSI Class A rate of contribution.</P>
      <P>There are a number of exceptions to this general rule. Certain prominent actors and entertainers have established themselves as self-employed for income tax and PRSI purposes. In addition, other members of these professions occasionally operate on a self-employed basis while engaged on short fixed term contracts. Where a person is self-employed, the PRSI Class S rate of contribution is payable provided the total income is £2,500 or more per annum. Class S provides a more limited range of cover than Class A. Self-employed Class S contributors are covered for most long-term pensions but not for any of the short-term benefits &ndash; other than maternity and adoptive benefits.</P>
      <P>The decision as to whether a person is employed as an employee or is self-employed is determined by looking at the terms and conditions under which they are engaged. An explanatory leaflet entitled &ldquo;Employed or Self-Employed &ndash; A Guide for Tax and Social Insurance&rdquo; which was published jointly by my Department and the Revenue Commissioners, contains a checklist to assist people in deciding to which category they belong.</P>
      <P>If any person employed in the entertainment profession is in doubt about his/her position or considers that she/he has been wrongly classified as self-employed, she/he can request to have the matter examined and formally decided by the scope section of my Department. If dissatisfied with a decision by scope section, there is a right of appeal to the independent Social Welfare Appeals Office.</P>
      <P>A person who is normally self-employed may claim a means-tested social assistance payment, such as unemployment assistance, during a temporary lay-off. Any income from self-employment is assessable as means for this purpose. The method of assessment involves a calculation of the person's income for the year ahead. In the absence of any other way of determining the means, the previous year's income, updated for any expected changes, is used.  A formal decision is made by a deciding officer at the local social welfare office. If the applicant is unhappy with the decision, she or he may appeal the matter to the independent Social Welfare Appeals Office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1417" /> There is no general policy of categorising members of the entertainment professions as being self-employed and earning £100 per week. If the Deputy has a particular case in mind the matter will be examined if he supplies further details.</P>

      <P>To answer the Deputy's question, it is necessary for me to explain the administrative procedures in relation to post-nuptial applications. Applications for post-nuptial citizenship by persons living in Ireland are dealt with exclusively by my Department while applications made by persons living abroad are processed by the Department of Foreign Affairs through its embassies and consular offices. When that processing is completed, the applications are forwarded to my Department for issue of certificates of citizenship.</P>
      <P>The application in question was received by the Irish Embassy in London in May 1998. It was passed to the Department of Foreign Affairs in Dublin on 29 January 1999 when it was learnt that the applicant and his wife had moved to Dublin in December 1998. The papers were received in my Department on 7 April last.</P>
      <P>Officials in the immigration and citizenship division of my Department have advised the person referred to that some documentation in support of the declaration is required. When this is received, and deemed to be in order, it should be possible to issue a certificate of citizenship to the person concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 234 to 237, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I have had inquiries made in this matter, and I am informed that this case was the subject of a full and proper Garda investigation which resulted in a person being charged on the directions of the Director of Public Prosecutions and subsequently dealt with by the courts.</P>
      <P>The courts are, subject only to the Constitution and the law, independent in the exercise of their judicial functions. I have no function in relation to verdicts of the courts, nor is it open to me to intervene in or comment in any way on the conduct of court proceedings which are entirely a matter for the presiding judge. I have been informed that the defendant in this case was acquitted on all charges by the jury who returned a verdict of not guilty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Constitution, with certain exceptions, provides for trial by jury in any trial involving criminal charges. The role of the jury is to decide on matters of fact as disclosed by the evidence presented in court and to return a verdict. Where, as in this case, the verdict is not guilty there is no avenue for further action open to the State. This is a long-standing judicial principle which is common to very many other countries with similar judicial systems to ours and any departure from <Col N="1423" /> it would represent an unprecedented change in public policy in this area.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy may be aware, I undertook in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 327 on 8 December 1998, to have inquiries made in relation to the deposition sought by the parents of the person named in the question. As a result, the Coroner for the City of Dublin has recently confirmed that the deposition in question was not used at the inquest held on the 17 June 1993. As the deposition was not placed on the record of the inquest, the City Coroner cannot release it.</P>
    <P>I also understand that the Director of Public Prosecutions would not release any such statement, as it is assumed that a witness would make a statement to the Garda only for the purposes of investigation and trial, and for no other purpose. The Deputy may be interested to know, however, that persons who make statements are themselves entitled to receive a copy of their statement.</P>
    <P>The State Pathologist normally visits scenes of death in suspicious circumstances prior to the removal of the body. In this case, I am informed that the victim was removed from the scene to St. James's Hospital where he was medically treated and subsequently certified dead. The body was then removed to the city morgue where the State Pathologist carried out the postmortem examination.</P>
    <P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities that local gardaí have met the parents of the person named in the question on a number of occasions before, during and after the trial to explain the various legal procedures involved in the case and to assist them generally in any way possible to come to terms with their son's death. Officials of this Department have also met the parents to explain the legal issues involved.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that each search process is unique to the individual situation and must stand on its own merits. Searches initiated by An Garda Síochána are in accordance with relevant legislation and I am assured that members of An Garda Síochána are fully aware of the importance of courtesy to members of the public, and respect for their constitutional and legal rights.</P>

      <Col N="1424" /> When an individual feels there is cause for complaint recourse to the Garda Síochána Complaints Board, directly to Garda management and to the courts, where appropriate, is of course available to them.</P>

      <P>I have outlined to the House on numerous occasions the purpose and remit of the National Steering Committee on Violence Against Women. The committee is responsible, <i>inter alia</i>, for the development of a cohesive, multi-agency and multi-disciplinary response to the issue of violence towards women, including domestic violence. The committee issued its first report on 7 March 1999.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy may be aware the Domestic Violence Act, 1996 already makes clear that a barring order is made where the court is of opinion that the safety or welfare, which includes physical and psychological welfare, of the person in whose interest the order is made requires it. I think the Deputy will agree that this covers the case raised in his question.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may be interested to know that my Department has part funded recent research into the operation of the Domestic Violence Act.</P>

    <P>Because of the very wide spectrum of cases and the considerable backlog of applications which I inherited on taking office as Minister it is difficult to identify an average time from start to finish of the asylum determination process which would have any real meaning.</P>
    <P>I can, however, inform the Deputy that by the end of 1998, all applicants who had sought asylum in the State before January 1997, had been afforded the opportunity of a substantive interview. First stage determination of asylum applications follows within a matter of weeks of the substantive interview in most cases, exceptions would be where a reinterview or further detailed inquiries are necessary. By June 1999 it is <Col N="1426" /> expected that all applicants who lodged a claim up to March 1998 will have been afforded the opportunity of a substantive interview.</P>
    <P>The task force which I put in place to deal with this matter is dealing with new and old applications simultaneously. At the present rate of progress and based on current application figures I am advised that the task force will have dealt with the entire backlog of applications by July 2000 and from that date will be processing applications within weeks of arrival.</P>
    <P>I appointed Mr. Peter Finlay and Mr. Eamon Cahill to act as appeal authorities, to hear appeals against the decision to refuse refugee status, replacing Mr. Justice Peter O'Malley who retired from the post in July 1998. They commenced hearing cases in September 1998. The two new appeals authorities have heard 523 substantive appeals to 31 March 1999, decisions have been reached in 280 of these cases and refugee status has been granted in 98 cases. In addition, the appeal authorities have considered 23 appeals against the decision to refuse refugee status, on manifestly unfounded grounds, and eight appeals have been successful and 15 were refused. I have recently appointed a further two appeals authorities, Ms Una McGurk and Mr. Aidan Eames, who will be commencing hearing appeals in the near future.</P>
    <P>The information sought regarding the percentage and numbers of successful applications in each of the past three years is set out in the following tabular statement:</P>

      <P>In May 1998, my Department compiled a list of interpreters, both individuals and companies, who had previously provided interpreting services to the courts and were willing to continue to provide such services, and requested court offices to select companies from the list when engaging interpreting services for a court subsequently. My Department's intention in compiling the list was to introduce more efficiency in the provision of interpreting services to the courts as the service had been provided on an entirely <i>ad hoc</i> basis up to May 1998.</P>
      <P>When my Department notified individuals or companies of their inclusion on the list, they were informed that such inclusion did not &ldquo;confer any right to employment which is subject to the requirements of the courts&rdquo; and that &ldquo;an individual or company may be removed from the register if the Minister deems fit and such a removal is notified in writing&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the company referred to by the Deputy, my Department received information which indicated that it would not be appropriate for that company to provide an interpreting service for an Irish court of law. On this basis, and in accordance with the provisions set down by my <Col N="1427" /> Department for inclusion on the list of interpreters, my Department notified the company referred to in the question, in writing, of its removal from the list with effect from 23 March 1999.</P>

In carrying out its functions, the commission will have regard to the factors that are to be taken into account under the Agreement in individual cases, that is, the seriousness of the offence or offences involved and the need to protect the community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department has provided funding to support the development of child care services in disadvantaged areas since 1993. In July 1998 I announced expenditure of £5.2 million on the equal opportunities child care programme over the 1998-99 period which marks a significant increase in my Department's child care budget. Further expenditure of £450,000 was announced on 9 April. The equal opportunities <Col N="1429" /> child care programme is designed to support local communities and employers who are trying to facilitate women and men who have child care responsibilities while accessing training, education and employment. It is targeted primarily at community based projects in disadvantaged areas. The equal opportunities child care programme is part-funded by the EU.</P>
      <P>The equal opportunities child care programme provides funding for capital infrastructure funding for upgrading, enhancing or establishing facilities; core funding to meet salary costs for senior child care workers in 25 community childcare projects nationwide; and employer demonstration child care initiative which is being developed in partnership with IBEC to stimulate employer interest and involvement in the development of child care services.</P>
      <P>Later last year, my Department allocated £100,000 to the Shanty educational project in respect of child care.</P>
      <P>In addition, a child care database is being established by my Department in conjunction with Area Development Management Limited to document and quantify the range and extent of child care provision and training being supported under EU funding and to establish baseline data on other facilities/services in child care being supported by the State. The child care database is also part-funded by the EU.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is probably aware, the Government decided on 2 February last to establish an interdepartmental committee on child care to evaluate, cost and prioritise proposals for the development of child care which are set out in recent reports on the matter. The committee is chaired by my Department and comprises representatives, at senior level, of the relevant Departments. It is required to report back to Government within a period of six months. The committee has already met on four occasions to date.</P>
      <P>The Government also announced new measures in December 1998 to support child care in the budget. The new measures provide for the introduction of a capital allowance for capital expenditure incurred on the construction, extension or refurbishment of a building or part of a building used as a child care facility. They also provide exemption from benefit-in-kind taxation of certain child care services provided by employers to employees on a free or subsidised basis.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 253, 254, 255, 264, 265, 267, 268 and 269 together.</P>
      <P>The young offender facilities to which the Deputies refer cater only for children and young persons placed in the centres by the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A development plan for the Oberstown campus, which was based on an assessment of emerging needs and the likely impact of the Children Bill, includes proposals for the eventual development of up to 24 additional places for young male offenders and up to seven additional places for young female offenders. These proposals envisage the development of an extra, high security unit at Trinity House school to enhance the capacity of this facility to cater for the most disruptive children placed in custody by the courts; the phased replacement of the existing units at Oberstown Boys' Centre with more robust facili<Col N="1433" /> ties and an increase in the capacity of that centre to cater for up to an additional 16 young male offenders; the development of seven additional places for young female offenders at Oberstown Girls' Centre.</P>
    <P>The priority focus at this stage, based on a detailed assessment of emerging demand and the likely impact of the Children Bill, is on the development of the high security unit at Trinity House and the phased replacement of existing units which comprise Oberstown Boys' Centre.</P>
    <P>The Deputies will appreciate that the very significant costs involved in such developments requires care in ensuring only such development as is actually warranted should be undertaken. In this regard, the impact of the principle set down in the Children Bill, that custodial sentences should only be applied as a matter of last resort, will be a relevant consideration in determining the ultimate level of development undertaken.</P>
    <P>A final decision has not been taken regarding the height of the fence in question. Issues relating to the most appropriate height, location and nature of the fence are currently being reviewed by my Department in the light of recent expert advice and research into the effectiveness of such measures. The objective of the review is to ensure that any actions taken in this area will achieve the desired objective of enhancing security at the facilities and reassuring residents of the area, without resorting to unsightly and excessively intrusive security measures. In addition to the erection of a perimeter security fence, arrangements are being made for the introduction of security lighting and access control at the entrance to the campus.</P>
    <P>Funding amounting to £4.033 million is available in the current year to facilitate the erection of the security fence at Oberstown and to meet the cost of developments taking place at the Finglas Children's Centre. The actual cost of the security fence at Oberstown will be known when the tendering process has been completed.</P>
    <P>The Deputies will appreciate the need for a degree of confidentiality in relation to measures which are of a security nature and are designed to contain young offenders who have been placed in custody by the courts. However, within this limitation it is intended that local residents will be kept fully informed of developments. Lusk Community Council is already represented on the board of management of the facilities at Oberstown and as such is kept fully informed on an ongoing basis in relation to developments at the Oberstown campus.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to a survey carried out in 17 voluntary secondary schools in the Tipperary and Clare areas which indicate that most schools are experiencing a deterioration in their staffing allocation in spite of his claims that they are making improvements; if his attention has further been drawn to the fact that, where some schools are receiving new allocations to compensate for the loss of teachers, the new allocations are essentially part-time hours rather than a full-time post; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[10669/99]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the survey referred to by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The teacher allocation for an individual voluntary secondary school for a particular school year consists of approved ex-quota or concessionary posts and the posts warranted by the enrolment at the end of the preceding September on the basis of the current pupil teacher ratio. Where the number of permanent teachers employed in the school exceeds the approved allocation, the surplus teachers are liable for redeployment in accordance with the terms of the redeployment scheme.</P>
      <P>As a result of the initiative announced as part of the budget proposals, an additional 225 teaching posts will be provided at second level this year which will enable a move towards the provision of an automatic remedial resource in all schools and home/school/community liaison in all disadvantaged schools. In the case of schools with over quota teachers who might otherwise be redeployed, this resource will be used in the first instance to meet the remedial and home/school needs of the school.</P>
      <P>Schools which are within quota and lack the appropriate remedial and home/school provision will receive an additional allocation. The allocation in respect of remedial will be a full post in the case of a school with 600 or more pupils and 0.5 of a post where enrolment is below 600. In the case of home/school/community liaison, the allocation to each disadvantaged school will be 0.5 of a post. In this regard, the Deputy will appreciate that, where the additional allocation is less than a full post, this provision can only be met through the allocation of part-time hours.</P>
      <P>In addition, a retention ratio of 18:1 is being applied to schools which, following implementation of the above package, have on their staff over quota teachers thus allowing those schools to retain teachers who might otherwise have been placed on the redeployment panel. Secondary schools in Clare and Tipperary are benefiting to varying degrees as a result of these provisions.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will see from these moves, it is simply unsustainable to suggest that the staffing of second level schools is not being improved, especially in comparison with the policies which pertained previous to when this Government came to office.</P>
      <P>I should add that it is open to the authorities of individual secondary schools to apply to my Department for an increase in the teacher allocation in order to cater for curricular shortfalls within the school. Each such application received will be considered in the context of available resources.</P>

      <P>Under the terms of the student support schemes, the rate of maintenance grant payable is determined by reference to the distance from the student's normal residence to the college, which she/he is attending. In the case of independent mature students, normal residence is defined as the residence of the candidate while in attend<Col N="1441" /> ance at college. If this address is 15 miles or less from the college being attended, the adjacent rate of grant is payable. If the address is more than 15 miles from the college the non-adjacent rate is payable. However, where an independent mature student can produce evidence that he/she is maintaining a residence other than their address while attending college it is open to the local authority to regard that address as the student's normal residence.</P>
      <P>I previously indicated my concern about mature students generally and independent mature students in particular in regard to the rate of grant payable in accordance with the provisions of the schemes. With effect from the coming academic year all eligible mature students will qualify for the higher non-adjacent rate of maintenance grant. This improvement is estimated to cost £2.4 million over the next two years. The new arrangements will be provided for in the context of the 1999 student support schemes, which will be available later in the year.</P>

      <Quest>if education services will be provided in the Roscommon area in view of the recent survey of primary schools in the county which indicates inadequacies in the education services and highlights the lack of educational and psychological services; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the survey recently conducted by the Roscommon Partnership Company in relation to the provision of primary school educational services in that county.</P>
      <P>It was precisely because of my concern and that of the Government for the primary education sector, that I made a commitment on assuming office to give primary education a clear priority in the allocation of resources. To this end, I have increased the capitation grant by 33 per cent in only two years and I am confident that this increased funding is assisting schools on a nationwide basis. In addition, significant improvements have been introduced to the staffing schedule for all schools.</P>
      <P>On the points in the survey relating to a lack of remedial services available to schools in County Roscommon, arrangements are currently being made in my Department to extend the remedial teacher service to all primary and second level schools from next September. All primary schools, including the primary schools in County Roscommon, will be covered by the expansion of the remedial teacher service.</P>
      <P>Currently, there are two primary schools in County Roscommon included in the disadvantaged areas scheme and, as such, these schools will have the services of a home-school community liaison co-ordinator from September 1999. In addition there are five primary schools in the county included in the Breaking the Cycle project. Each school included in this project has the services of a co-ordinator, part of whose duties include the provision of a home-school community liaison service.</P>
      <P>In relation to access to my Department's psychological service one of my key priorities as Minister is the establishment of a national educational psychological service, to be available to all schools at both levels. In this regard, I recently announced Government approval for the establishment of a national educational psychological service. Financial provision has been made for the first two years of a five year implementation phase. At the end of this five year period it is envisaged that 200 psychologists will be in place and that every school in the country will have access to a schools' psychological service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sixty-nine psychologists are already in place and my Department will shortly be recruiting 25 additional psychologists, who should take up their appointments during the school year 1999-2000. Officials of my Department are currently carrying out a detailed analysis of the needs and resources <Col N="1443" /> available in all parts of the country, in order to set priorities for the expansion of the national educational psychological service. Findings from surveys which have already been carried out will also be taken into account.</P>
    <P>In relation to capital expenditure on schools in County Roscommon, my Department has provided grant assistance towards major works in 18 schools within the past few years. Architectural planning has been initiated to upgrade a further seven schools in the current year, while my Department's primary building unit is currently considering applications for refurbishments at another 14 schools and decisions will be conveyed to the relevant school managements shortly.</P>
    <P>In addition, since 1997 all national schools receive a basic annual capital grant of £2,000 plus £9 per pupil, which may be expended by schools on improvement works to buildings, services, grounds and furnishings. It is open to school managements to apply to my Department for grant assistance towards capital works not covered by the scheme.</P>
    <P>On the finding of the survey that music, singing, art, speech and drama and dancing are not available in many schools, I would stress that all of these activities are covered in the prescribed curriculum for national schools. Schools have a responsibility to ensure that they adequately deal with each area of the curriculum.</P>

      <P>Under the terms of the third level student support schemes, grants are generally not payable to candidates who already hold an undergraduate degree and are pursuing a second undergraduate degree.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, if a student pursues an LLB as their first undergraduate degree, she or he will be eligible to apply for a higher education maintenance grant. However, where a candidate pursues a BA degree and then pursues an LLB as a second undergraduate degree course she or he will not qualify for funding towards the second undergraduate degree course. The LLB is offered as a post-graduate course in NUI Galway, in which case students who already hold an undergraduate degree are eligible to apply for grant assistance in respect of the post-graduate course. However, these students would then be precluded from availing of further grant assistance for other post-graduate courses.</P>
      <P>I have outlined the general position in my reply and would ask the Deputy, if he has any specific instance in mind, to contact me or my officials to have the matter further investigated.</P>
