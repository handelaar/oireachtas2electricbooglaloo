    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take No. 32, Electricity Regulation, Bill, 1998, Second Stage (resumed) and No. 1, Local Government (Planning and Development) Bill, 1998 <i>[Seanad]</i>, Second Stage.</P>
      <P>It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that any division demanded today shall be postponed until immediately after the Order of Business on Tuesday, 23 March 1999.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one proposal to be put to the House. Is the proposal for dealing with the postponement of any division today agreed to? Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>On No. 32, will the Taoiseach say if the relevant Minister has any intention to intervene in an incipient and difficult industrial relations situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should wait until the debate on the Bill. The matter can be raised in another way during the day. The Deputy will have other opportunities to raise the matter and I will give favourable consideration to any such request.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that, but this could be a matter of great urgency in a short time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter can be raised today but not on the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that former Senator George Mitchell of Maine is to be awarded the Congressional Medal of Honour by his country in recognition of the work he has done in the peace process here. Will the Taoiseach convey &ndash; I am sure &ndash; on behalf of all the House and certainly on behalf of my party, our thanks and congratulations to Senator Mitchell on this signal honour?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be glad to do that. I hope <Col N="286" /> to meet him but it has not been confirmed and I will certainly mention Deputy Bruton's remarks and pass on the best wishes of all Members of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Anyone who knows George Mitchell will know that while he will appreciate the medal of freedom, the fact that a scholarship has been established and funded by the Oireachtas in his name is of more tangible substance and will be a source of satisfaction to him. Nevertheless, I join in what the Taoiseach has said.</P>
      <P>In a document published at the commencement of the session it was promised to publish 16 Bills before the end of the Easter recess. I do not want to interfere with the travel arrangements for the next week, but I draw the Taoiseach's attention to the fact that the following Bills have not been published: the Broadcasting Bill, the Údurás na Gaeltachta (Amendment) Bill, the School Attendance and Education Welfare Bill, the Companies (Amendment) Bill, the Equal Status Bill, the Illegal Emigrants Bill, the Mineral Developments Bill, the Human Rights Commission Bill, although the heads have been circulated, and the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Bill. In effect there are only three weeks remaining in the session. When will we see these Bills?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>More than half of the Bills promised for this session have been published. I wish they were all published but a number will be published in the coming weeks. The ESB Infrastructure Bill will be published today. The Human Rights Commission Bill is before the two committees and others will be published in weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>On promised legislation, specifically the Water Services Bill, does the Taoiseach accept we have a serious problem with water pressure and supply in the city? Does he agree the legislation dealing with water services, which dates back to 1841 and 1867 is hopelessly inadequate in the context of a modern city? Will this Bill receive urgent attention?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It will receive urgent attention. Much of the legislation governing the operation of water services dates back to the 19th century. There are 15 Acts on the Statute Book which contain provisions on water services and it is a complex task to bring them together. The general scheme of the Bill will be submitted to Government before the end of this year and then will come before the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of the British-Irish Agreement Bill, due to time constraints last evening we had difficulties discussing the bodies to be established under the Bill. As there is a great deal of interacting legislation to be studied will the Taoiseach, after he has discussed the timeframe with the British Government, indicate the future progression of the legislation, the dead<Col N="287" /> lines and so on as this would give us an opportunity to plan. There are concerns about the Commissioner of Irish Lights, as many questions need to be answered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will examine what the Deputy is saying. Much of this work had been done and each part had difficulties. The Irish Lights issue seemed small on the face of it, but took some weeks to resolve because of the British legislation. The UK Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr. Gordon Brown, MP, has been directly involved because it comes under his responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from the Minister for Public Enterprise's announcement of the transport plan, when will we see legislation to amend the Transport Act to allow CIE to borrow the additional money which the plan will require, since no other money has been provided? Since we do not have a crowded agenda today, could time be made available to discuss the critical issues arising from the picketing of all ESB power stations this morning, with the likelihood of power cuts?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already indicated that there are ways in which that matter could be raised today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On the first matter, if legislation of that order is required it would have to be brought forward. You, a Cheann Comhairle, answered the second matter earlier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>The legislation is required because there is a limit on CIE's borrowings and it cannot borrow the amount the Minister has indicated will be needed. I take it such legislation is promised, when might we see it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister told the company to borrow but gave it no money.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>When the organisation reaches its limit and legislation is required it will be brought forward. It is not required yet.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>When I asked about the National Parks and Historic Properties Bill some time ago, it was suggested there were constitutional difficulties. We are now told the Bill is not being proceeded with at present because of other priorities but I am not aware that the relevant section of the public service is working on other legislation. Has the Bill been dropped altogether or will the Taoiseach indicate what the other priorities are? They certainly do not include the preparation of legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, that Department is working on a number of Bills and I hope they will be published shortly. I said yesterday that the National Parks and Historic Monuments Bill has been deferred because of other priorities, it has not been dropped. The heads of the Bill are being prepared in the Department and it is not expected to be published until the middle of the year, at the earliest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that, in the past 12 months, house prices have risen by 29 per cent and rents for apartments and houses have risen by about 20 per cent in Dublin, will the Government arrange a debate on Dr. Bacon's second report on the housing crisis?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that in the past week there has been the affordable housing initiative, the second Bacon report, the introduction of tax measures, the transport initiative, the improvement of railway safety and the voluntary housing initiative.

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith" hpid="Mr. B. Smith Mr. B. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak in support of the Electricity Regulation Bill and the establishment of the new commission for electricity regulation. This is far-sighted and courageous legislation because it opens the field of electricity generation and distribution to competition for the first time in over 70 years. At the same time, it will ensure protection for the public, those involved in electricity generation and distribution, consumers and the environment.</P>
      <P>Ireland owes its development, often its survival, to electricity. Last Christmas the inhabitants of many areas in the north-west and the midlands were given a reminder of what life without electricity is like. We knew that ESB staff were working to rectify the situation and that power would be restored. For most people it meant annoyance and discomfort, but it was also a reminder of what it feels like to be powerless.</P>
      <P>The provision of electricity has given people power to take greater control of their lives. To farmers, the arrival of electricity made possible the introduction of mechanisation for tasks such as milking. It also meant that electrical appliances could make life easier and more enjoyable whether a person was engaged in food preparation or watching television. The arrival of electricity also made life more secure.</P>
      <P>Today's world has become increasingly dependent on electricity. The spread of ultra rapid telecommunications and other forms of data exchange would be unthinkable without electricity. Computers are an integral part of every office and, increasingly, of every home, where they are no longer playthings but are used for a wide spectrum of communications requirements which range from surfing the Internet to writing letters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Electricity bills are a major item in everyone's budget. Energy bills account for an even greater proportion of industrial and business costs. Electricity production and consumption is an accepted yardstick of the vitality of a country's economy and it is hardly surprising that in recent years the electricity sector has grown by 6 per cent annually. It is my hope that this sector will continue to grow at its current rate because this will reflect our continued economic buoyancy. We have a duty to ensure that energy is generated and distributed as efficiently as possible and that the <Col N="292" /> consumer, whether a business or a private household, is able to avail of electricity at less expensive rates. We must also be in a position to provide for the continued increase in consumption, with an equivalent increase in electricity production. It is for this reason the Bill opens the electricity sector to competition, removes the Electricity Supply Board's monopoly on power production and distribution and gives the new commission responsibility for sanctioning the construction of power generating plants.</P>
    <P>None of this implies any criticism of the ESB or any diminution of the praise and gratitude we owe that organisation and its staff for their contribution to the development of our nation. It was through the ESB that Ireland, a country relatively poor in natural and mineral resources, was able to transform its abundant water supplies and peat bogs into power and, ultimately, into greater prosperity. It was the ESB that supervised and organised the rural electricity scheme, replacing flickering oil lamps with light bulbs that provided illumination at the turn of a switch. The rural electrification scheme was a major act of public service to the Irish people because it represented a commitment on the part of the ESB to supply power and its benefits to everyone in Ireland, regardless of where they lived and irrespective of the costs of installation and continued supply. That commitment as been maintained by the ESB to this day.</P>
    <P>The ESB has enjoyed a monopoly on the generation of electricity since 1927. This was justified in the past because no private power generator had the resources to generate and supply electricity cheaply to the entire nation. Not only was this justified, it was also necessary because it was part of the process of building this nation. We have benefited as a result. However, the world is changing.</P>
    <P>The answers of the past cannot supply solutions to the problems and demands of the present or ensure our continued progress in the future. The political borders dividing countries into self-contained economic entities have been rendered increasingly meaningless, particularly with the advent of the Single European Market. Many countries in Europe relied in the past on one supplier for the provision of power, but the benefits of competition have seen a gradual transformation towards a near total liberalisation of the sector in some countries. We must ensure that Irish consumers do not pay higher charges for electricity than their European neighbours. It is vital that commercial and industrial users should not be placed at a disadvantage because of higher energy costs in this country.</P>
    <P>The opening of Ireland's electricity sector should not be viewed with fear because it goes hand in hand with similar liberalisation elsewhere in Europe. The ESB will remain the most significant player in the Irish electricity sector for many years to come. The legislation heralds the beginning of a new chapter in its history. Other electricity production companies are free to enter our <Col N="293" /> market and introduce their expertise. However, the ESB, as a result of the expertise and talent at its disposal, is not only able but capable of doing this throughout Europe. It will also be possible for Irish companies to compete with the ESB in Ireland. Some of these may operate on a smaller scale than the ESB and serve a more limited geographical area. The resultant lower overheads and costs they incur could be passed on to consumers in the form of lower prices. We should not lose sight of those small-scale producers of electricity who are already generating electricity and feeding it into the national grid. The liberalisation of the electricity sector has the potential of benefiting these small-scale producers.</P>
    <P>There may be those who are afraid that liberalisation of the electricity sector will not lead to cheaper electricity nor to a power supply that is either regular or consistent. The Bill and the powers granted to the Minister and the commission will ensure the public interest is maintained and well served. Everyone and every region that wants and needs electricity should be able to acquire it at a reasonable rate. The power to maintain this situation has been given to the commission. It would be unjust and, ultimately, self-defeating if users in some parts of the country found themselves paying higher energy and electricity charges because of greater costs in maintaining supply, especially in outlying or thinly populated areas. That would militate against rural development and the necessary rural regeneration needed in many parts of the country.</P>
    <P>The commission will take care of environmental issues related to the energy sector to ensure liberalisation does not lead to environmental damage or the construction of plants generating electricity in a dangerous manner. It will also safeguard the use of indigenous sources of power, especially peat, as opposed to imports.</P>
    <P>The Bill has many strengths. It is permeated throughout by pragmatism. It introduces liberalisation in the electricity sector, not because of some trendy ideology but through a desire to provide electricity as cheaply and efficiently as possible. At the same time it does not establish cheapness and efficiency as sacred idols but makes adequate provision that the benefits of greater competition will be spread evenly. It will oversee change of a far-reaching nature while making sure no one has anything to fear. Our future depends on efficiently produced sources of power. The Bill gives the people the power to shape their future.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on bringing forward this pragmatic, innovative and important Bill which will contribute enormously to our economic development.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on the Bill having had the opportunity last night to speak on the historic British-Irish Agreement Bill which provides for the establishment of cross-Border bodies. Within the European Union cross-border trading is becom<Col N="294" /> ing increasingly important. New energy producers are emerging in the liberalised marketplace. There are benefits in this for the entire island, where the energy market is relatively small, in terms of increased co-operation.</P>
      <P>There is a need to develop a joint strategic energy policy for the entire island with the aim of developing a co-operative approach to the development of the electricity and natural gas infrastructure to ensure efficiency, maximise the opportunities for cross-Border energy trading and promote competition to the benefit of the consumer; to develop a seamless energy infrastructure to facilitate energy trading and ensure security of supply; to evaluate on an ongoing basis the need for electricity and gas interconnectors on the island and between the island and the United Kingdom &ndash; according to a recent newspaper article it will be 50 years before the State obtains any revenue in respect of the gas find off the west coast as the Minister has no say in where the company involved will be located; and to promote best practice in energy efficiency and the use of renewable energy sources.</P>
      <P>Active co-operation between the regulators in Northern Ireland and the Republic should be promoted to achieve a more competitive energy market on the island. There was never a better time to do this following the removal of the threat of violence. The EU directive on the internal energy market should be implemented to ensure consumers, particularly in the six Northern and six Southern Border counties, gain maximum benefit from the liberalisation of the sector. There is a need for a common strategy in this regard.</P>
      <P>It is encouraging that some of the Republic's largest customers, those who use more than four gigawatts of power, will be able to choose their own supplier early in the year 2000 under a new innovative Bill presented by the Minister. This represents 28 per cent of the market and will rise to 32 per cent by 2003.</P>
      <P>The Bill has been introduced on the back of an EU directive. This means companies such as Northern Ireland Electricity can target the ESB's top 300 customers and supply them with cheaper electricity. Competition is the lifeblood of trade. While it has served the country extraordinarily well, the ESB has been a monopoly since its foundation. Its charges &ndash; up to 12p per unit in certain cases &ndash; account for a huge part of business costs which can be considerable. This means that hotels, restaurants, supermarkets, factories and so on are massively subsidising domestic consumers. If they are to survive and remain competitive, charges must be levelled out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill goes some way to protect the ESB and thus place it at a competitive advantage in the market by allowing the independent regulator to impose public service obligations on electricity providers. As it operates older plants and has to support social objectives such as operating turf powered plants, any charges incurred in liberalising the market are certain to be passed on to con<Col N="295" /> sumers. The introduction of competition, however, should help to keep prices down. The day of the State protecting monopolies is over. I am delighted the request for a 3 per cent increase has been turned down given that the rate of inflation is running close to zero.</P>
    <P>There is also a need for greater clarity on the proposed levies and the public service obligations. It would be a big mistake for the ESB to recoup the loss of many of its large corporate customers, should that arise, by increasing domestic charges. The Government must ensure that domestic consumers will not have to bear the brunt of cheaper electricity to the corporate and commercial sector through a rebalancing of tariffs. Competition in the trade should help to address difficulties that may arise in this area.</P>
    <P>Another Bill next year will deal with how the new liberalised market will operate. Following that the Government will address the future of the electricity market for domestic users. This will be the start of what will be major changes in the coming years.</P>
    <P>The building of a new power plant by the ESB cannot be until the new regulator is in place. Competition will bring big changes and there will be a need for rationalisation in the company. Regrettably, there may be job losses because some employees are on huge salaries, although it must be said they have all done excellent work. Business is devoid of sentiment. Profitability is everything and the days of cushioning staff are over. In the accountancy terms of timber, surface and water, the timber will surface when the changes are implemented.</P>
    <P>It is important that the new commission is fully accountable. It will be required to submit accounts to the Comptroller and Auditor General and to report to a joint committee of the Oireachtas. Other controls include an appeals mechanism and the application of the Freedom of Information Act.</P>
    <P>The new commission will have wide ranging powers, including the power the grant licences to the ESB and other providers to build and operate generating stations. The Minister has allowed capital allowance write-offs on wind farms, subject to EU approval.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>When I was travelling from Sligo I saw the wind farms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>They are in the mountain regions around Lough Arrow. Two major wind farms are planned for Cairnhill, Lough Arrow. It is proposed to build up to 14 turbines despite huge objections. It is one of the most scenic areas in the country, close to the megalithic tombs, which are older than the pyramids.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Are these in addition to the ones that are already there?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. One planning application at <Col N="296" /> Cairnhill has been successfully blocked at Geevagh. Had it been successful it would have been seen from Roscommon and would have broken the mountain skyline. A renowned photographer, Mike Bunn, has created an artist's impression of what may happen. It is disturbing that up to 20 turbines could break the skyline. It has serious implications for remote areas.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to undertake a study of these wind farms. They are driven by considerable capital write-offs and many applications are being processed by a holding company using different names. That is regrettable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Where exactly are the farms I saw while travelling from Sligo?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>They are located in Arigna. These farms have not been the success in the US that was expected of them years ago. They are noisy and many have been switched off after 20 years. Nor do they create many jobs. Given that locations are being chosen in mountain ranges in the most scenic parts of the country, there must be careful planning. Many applicants believe they are entitled to establish farms in these areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>They must get planning permission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct, however, local authorities tend to be driven by Government directives. If these farms are seen as an alternative source of energy supply by the Government they are obliged to comply with directives from the Minister's Department. Perhaps the Minister would consult the county planners to ensure that local authorities will have the autonomy to decide based on the applications lodged.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides that the ESB will be required to prepare a statement setting out connection, transmission and distribution charges. These charges can be very high to those building their own homes in remote areas. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government has given the go ahead for high density house building. However, if a son or daughter in a family wishes to build a house he or she can be charged £4,000 to £5,000 to be connected. The ESB must take the long view: it will acquire a customer for generations and this consideration should be used to subsidise connection costs.</P>
      <P>The built-in costs arising from planning, electricity connection, etc., act as a huge disincentive to site developments in remote areas. Families should be encouraged to buy sites for their children who may then develop them, even if this means commuting from long distances. It would encourage people to settle in the peripheral regions. Big retailers cherry-pick sites where there are high housing densities. The ESB tends to take the same approach. People should not be penalised for living far from the centre, but that is happening at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to the Department, a net additional <Col N="297" /> Exchequer cost will not arise from these proposals as the new commission is to be fully financed by the industry. It is important that the industry finance its development. It is involved in a huge business which will undergo rapid expansion, given that up to 400,000 new houses are expected to be built in the coming years. It must be a hugely profitable business. By announcing these changes, the Minister has given it the authority to make money. It is important that it is accountable and that the Minister is appointing a new controller.</P>
    <P>As the native resources of turf and water are exploited to the full, we will need to use alternatives, such as gas, oil and coal. The Minister should consider the use of gas. The liberalisation of the electricity market in any country in the past ten years has involved breaking up generating and retailing monopolies. As new generators enter the production market, new retail groups can buy electricity at wholesale prices. Allowing new entrants into the market will make it more competitive. It will take huge investment to encourage major players from outside the country to break into the market and that will not happen overnight.</P>
    <P>The Minister has appointed Mr. Reeves as the first State regulator.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>There is already a regulator in Telecom Éireann. This is the second State regulator but the first in electricity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>His task will be to ensure that European Union requirements are met. His appointment also means the ESB will no longer be the sole provider of electricity, a position it has enjoyed since 1927. That is a huge change in something which goes back to the foundation of the State. One of his functions will be to issue permits for the generation and supply of electricity. As these changes have attracted interest from a number of overseas companies, he must ensure there is a level playing field for new entrants to the market. It is good that he is independent because this could be a difficult job.</P>
      <P>For the past decade volume has been growing at 5 per cent each year and new generating capacity will be required in the near future. Among those believed to be interested in building power stations here are Northern Ireland Electricity and Marathon.</P>
      <P>I am delighted to have had the opportunity to speak on this issue. I was delighted to see the Minister in Sligo last weekend and I look forward to many future visits.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is becoming more difficult to compete with city people from various parts of country. I welcome the development which is an indication of progress on another front.</P>
      <P>This Bill represents a momentous and exciting development and provides a challenge, which is what people tend to focus on. Just as the introduction of electricity revolutionised life in Ireland and throughout the world, this Bill offers a similar opportunity for progress. The ESB is well placed to benefit from rather than lose out on this development.</P>
      <P>County Clare has a long association with ESB generation as the first power station, Ardnacrusha, was sited in the county. It was in a position to provide three times the requirements of that era. That highlights the fact that people were prepared to think ahead and to accept a challenge. Demand soon outstripped the level of power it could generate and, subsequently, a small power station was built at Milltown Malbay. It was demolished ten years ago when it became obsolete. Most people forget it even existed although it contributed greatly to the local economy. However, it contributed little to the national grid in terms of electricity. Moneypoint generating station in County Clare is the biggest in the country. I pay tribute to all those who have worked at various levels of the ESB over the years.</P>
      <P>The rural electrification scheme, which began in 1945, was a difficult and costly development. Strong arguments were made against it on the basis of the return on investment. During her Second Stage speech the Minister referred to the first use of electric light in Ireland in Princes Street in Dublin in 1880. I did not realise electricity was available in Ireland in any form at that time.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides for the setting up of a regulator. The regulator has an extraordinarily wide remit, most of which is currently held by the ESB. We are entering a more liberal market and implementing an EU directive. I have criticised the effects of EU directives on many occasions, but I welcome the effects of the liberalisation of the electricity market arising from this directive.</P>
      <P>Deputy Perry mentioned that the regulator's costs will be paid by the industry. We welcome that as no one wants to place extra burdens on the State. There is a belief that he who pays the piper calls the tune. However, there are provisions in this Bill to ensure that does not happen. I also welcome the fact the regulator has been named and is preparing for a huge job in terms of his responsibilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One interesting development in the area of electricity generation is wind farms. There was a discussion on the radio recently about a proposal to erect a wind generating system near the Kish bank. I was extremely surprised at the capacity such a wind farm would have in terms of contributing to the national or international grid. There is strong environmental argument in favour of wind farms. However, there is a substantial level of opposition to them in the areas in which <Col N="299" /> they are proposed, including my own county. I hope the provisions in this Bill will allow the regulator to clarify the issues raised about wind farms. They seem to have enormous potential but such is the level of objection to them, it is unlikely they will contribute any appreciable percentage to the national electricity requirements in the short-term.</P>
    <P>The ESB has an excellent record in international consultancy work and is in competition with other people in the area of communications. It would be difficult for it to argue against competition when it is already competing with someone else.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>In another area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>The quality of the ESB's work has made it sustainable.</P>
      <P>The Minister also referred to the role of the Department of Finance in the early days. As one would expect, it was not enthusiastic about spending money in this area. We are entitled on occasion to query its objections to spending money on projects which are beneficial in the long term.</P>
      <P>The Minister set out an exciting options list which included strategic alliances, further employee shareholdings, public share offerings, public private partnerships, disposal of the company or a combination of these. I am delighted her approach is one of common sense and pragmatism. Where these criteria are used to assess a development, it is invariably successful and I congratulate the Minister for taking that approach. I hate to see ideological considerations overcome common sense. That has happened on occasion when pressure was applied to push people in a certain direction. That is not the case on this occasion and I am glad.</P>
      <P>It is important that the needs of remote areas are looked after. The provisions regarding the regulator will ensure that happens. However, we will have to be vigilant. Every Member who represents less accessible areas will have encountered constituents who had difficulties getting three phase electricity into their areas, difficulties in terms of cost and, sometimes, in the availability of the service. The ESB is doing a great deal of work at present upgrading lines and so forth. That is important work and it should continue. Deregulation should not put remote areas further down the list of priorities.</P>
      <P>We have already gone part of the way on this route in electricity generation given the announcement that IVO of Finland will provide the new generating station. It is in the national interest to have as many options as possible for the supply of electricity to industry, homes and services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the provision for the establishment of an appeals panel. I am not sure what the panel's work will include but, given previous experience, I am confident matters will arise <Col N="300" /> which will have to be put to appeal. Section 46 provides for powers of compulsory purchase to be transferred from the ESB to the regulator. I did not know the ESB had such powers. There might be concern about the regulator having these powers in case they could be used to force developments on communities which do not want them. The legislation and the powers of the regulator would be defective if an appeals panel were not provided for. The existence of the panel and the other mechanisms provided for in the legislation are welcome.</P>
    <P>The legislation covers a broad area and addresses the requirement under the European directive, whose objectives are supported by the general public, to have a more open electricity market.</P>

      <P>Deputy Killeen mentioned Miltown Malbay power station. In my youth I heard stories of how the station bought turf by weight. A person had to be guaranteed that a water hose was available for dry turf going to Miltown Malbay. I often ponder the simplicity of the managerial skills that existed then and how they could not devise a system which would reward good, dry turf. It is unbelievable that these practices were tolerated.</P>
      <P>This Bill is introduced on foot of an EU directive. One wonders what would have happened this country if it had not joined the European Union. Every legislative measure appears to originate from a directive from the Union with which we must comply. According to the notes I received about this Bill, 28 per cent of the market must be available for competition. The note further states that 28 per cent of consumers use more than four gigawatts of electricity. The Minister has the power to lower the thresholds. However, if one is starting off with only 28 per cent using the quantity that competition can be allowed for, does it mean that if they do not get all the consumers to switch they are at nothing? Is that setting the standard too high? Only 28 per cent are using the quantity that can switch&mdash;</P>

        <b>:</b> The Minister is like the parish priest long ago &ndash; she has the power. She can lower the thresholds with regard to the number of people who can switch.</P>
      <P>The ESB will set the standard charges for using the lines. That is something to which the regulator should pay close attention. The charge put on the use of the lines could make it uneconomical for competitors. I hope there is a way of dealing with that.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to see any more lines being put up around the country, but if there is overloading, new lines will be necessary. There is a great deal of controversy at present about communications masts for mobile telephones. Some think they carry all kinds of danger for people's health. However, there are monstrous ESB pylons throughout the country and they are far more dangerous to health than the little antennae that might be located at a police station. I hope no more lines are put up except in isolated areas.</P>
      <P>The ESB should have competition. For a person looking for three phase electricity where two poles are required to bring it to his home, the charges are unbelievable. Competition is the lifeblood of trade and it will probably be good for the ESB to take a more realistic view of these charges. I understand there are strikes in the ESB at present; somebody told me we might not have power tonight. It is a pity strikes are taking place because of the arrival of competition.</P>
      <P>The staff in the ESB must be looked after but that does not mean they cannot modernise and prepare for competition. There should be more sanity about this matter. Whoever carries out the negotiations should discuss the issue fully and facilitate the introduction of fair competition without putting existing stations at a disadvantage. Some generating stations use coal, which is expensive, while new stations can use gas. The advantage of setting up a new plant is that one can have the best facilities available but that is a problem which the ESB must confront and overcome.</P>
      <P>There was a complete reassessment of the number of staff in the ESB after which it was decided to get rid of some workers. However, those permanent workers have been replaced by temporary workers. I understand there are now more than 1,000 temporary workers, some of whom have been working for up to three years for the ESB. They are skillful workers but I am worried that some of them will not get the opportunity for further training. They cannot participate in the adult training schemes because they are temporary workers. The Minister, being a caring person, should examine this issue. Workers should not be used as a form of cheap labour and, if they have learned practical skills, they should not be prevented from getting official training courses. I ask the Minister to examine that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The appointment of an office holder, which is <Col N="302" /> temporary until this Bill is enacted, will be a major help in that he will be able to make decisions. The office holder, who is a one man leader, can employ his own staff. He will be freer and more independent in the way he can deal with the problems that arise.</P>
    <P>I welcome competition in the ESB and I hope it will be good for the country. The production staff have worked long hours in the past, often beyond the call of duty. They have often worked for days on end when we have had storms and snow. We cannot forget their contribution and a balance must be struck to ensure they can have a fair crack of the whip.</P>

      <P>I welcome this legislation. In doing so, I am not criticising the service provided by the ESB. Through membership of the European Union we have learned the advantages to be gained from aggressive competition without its being predatory. We have seen this particularly in other services and there is much more of that to come. We must try to ensure we are at least as competitive as other member states and that our consumers gain the benefit of such competition.</P>
      <P>There was a great deal of speculation about the location of a power station in recent years, which has given rise to the need for this type of legislation. I refer to the one in the midlands. It was referred to as a moveable feast because the proposal for its location moved back and forth across county boundaries, but it was finally decided. Often by the time all the regulations governing planning permissions and other regulations have been dealt with, events have caught up to the extent that one might wonder in a few years' time what all the fuss was about.<b></b>It is generally recognised and accepted that the need for a fast and efficient electricity generation service for consumers is greater and more acute than it ever was before. Domestic and industrial consumers expect the service to be delivered in an efficient and focused manner. They cannot await developments over a period of time. I hope they will continue to have an efficient delivery of this service.</P>
      <P>The ESB has a proud record in this area over many years which should not go unacknowledged. It provided an efficient service when it did not face competition. It merely had to respond to the needs of its consumers. Its function will become much more focused because it will now have to respond to the needs of its consumers in a competitive environment. This will improve the service provided by the ESB to an even greater extent than it considers. There are probably many within the ESB who will have concerns about the current proposals. I hope these proposals will do what is intended by delivering a more efficient and rapid service to the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At a later stage the Minister may indicate how the commission will operate. An agency similar to the Commission for Electricity Regulation exists in the telecommunications sector and in a series of other sectors. Almost every function in <Col N="303" /> the public service will be overseen by a regulator of some description.  I hope this commission will not be another amorphous body that the Oireachtas cannot find accountable to it. The regulator is accountable to the Minister.</P>

      <P>I hope the Minister recognises that. I intend to ensure that function is exercised at regular intervals. Public representatives find it irritating to ask a question in this House to be told it is not the responsibility of the Minister.  I, and I am sure all other Members, have a strong view on this subject. I hope Ministers also have a strong view. The Bill states categorically who is responsible for this area. This comes within the remit of the Minister. We expect and require answers to questions. There is a growing culture in some Departments that the way to answer a question is to give the least possible information. I am not suggesting this is the position in any one Department, but that has been known to happen. There are those of us who spend our time drafting questions and those who spend their time wondering how little information can be given by way of reply. That is not the way Parliament, accountability, or transparency is supposed to work. Rather than somebody trying to ensure that a question should not, cannot or will not answered, a concerted effort should be made to ensure public representatives are given adequate answers. That will have two effects. It will reassure the public and protect the Minister. The worst possible scenario is when someone decides a question should not be answered and a technical means is found to deflect it by saying the Minister has no official responsibility for the subject matter of the question. That reply is regularly given and it is a worrying development. It is not in anybody's interest to allow that to happen in this instance. I hope we recognise that a new commission has been set up which is accountable to the Minister who in turn is accountable to the House. Those of us who have been in the House a long time and those who have not been here as long should be able to find sufficient ways and means of couching questions in an orderly fashion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to stir up the thorny issue of the provision of services. The public have become more conscious in recent times of the impact of electric pylons and cables and the transmission of services by installation stations, switching stations and so on. Many people believe that if permission was sought for the provision of the services we now enjoy, it would not be forthcoming because so many objections would be made. We live in an <Col N="304" /> objection conscious society. There may be valid reasons for objections in certain circumstances. I hope that consideration will be given to the appropriate location of switching stations or pylons, having due regard within reason for the environment and the aesthetics of the area in question. I accept it is not always possible to do that. However, it should be possible to circumnavigate the more garish and outrageous transgressions in this area. Those of us who live in rural Ireland will know of cases where the ESB or some other body got planning permission for a development in a sensitive area that would not been granted for a simple dwelling house. The local people ask questions about such decisions. I am not suggesting planning permissions are given because of undue influence or coercion. I accept that it is not the case. They have been given because of the establishment of the ESB as the electricity generating and supply authority some 50 or 60 years ago.</P>
    <P>The culture that evolved from that recognised that the service must be provided and that the ways and means proposed by the proposer are acceptable. That is not always the case. I hope any new installations arising from this legislation will have due regard for the sensitivities of the area and will recognise that public utility services requirements should be in accordance with regulations and no more obtrusive than any of the other facilities and services provided by others in the area.</P>
    <P>Competition opens up new avenues for those entering the market and the Electricity Supply Board, which is currently in the market. The ESB has shown over the years that it is able to compete in local and international markets. Its experience of those areas will enable it, in whatever form it may be constituted, to take on the challenges this legislation will present.</P>
    <P>I hope this legislation will be effective and ask the Minister to remember that the Oireachtas is the place to which Ministers are accountable. It is advisable to ensure that the maximum amount of information will be made available to the House about commissions or other subsidiary bodies set up under this legislation, or anticipated in similar areas in the provision of utility services in which the public have an interest. Once bodies become autonomous it can be difficult to make them accountable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I know this legislation and I do not welcome it as warmly as some other people. I come from a background of 20 years in a semi-State body and the euphoria with which people welcome what they see as the great new world of competition always makes me slightly nervous. I am a supporter of semi-State bodies, ESB or otherwise. Private enterprise could have moved into many of them at a much earlier stage but chose not to and now they are coming along when they see that semi-State bodies are strong and have developed their businesses and done marvellous work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="305" /> In any walk of life people can abuse a monopoly. It is the job of public representatives to see that there is no abuse of monopolies. Monopolies can be much worse if they are private. Public monopolies have machinery to make them accountable. Deputy Durkan wants his bread buttered on both sides. He wants this great new world of competition but still expects the Minister to be able to answer every detailed question about the ESB.</P>
    <P>This Bill is phase one. Phase two will come when the ESB is made into a PLC. The Minister may be able to answer questions in five or ten years' time about the regulator but not about every pylon and ESB shop. You cannot have your cake and eat it. Other speakers have cherry picked, the same as those private interests which now want to generate electricity.</P>
    <P>It is not all good news. I accept that competition can be valuable in certain circumstances. The ESB has always been open to competition, if not from other electricity suppliers then from suppliers of other forms of energy, such as gas.</P>
    <P>I hope we will not have a private monopoly in 15 years' time. I have seen that in other businesses which were privatised. After a few years the big and powerful buy out the smaller share owner and soon there is a private monopoly. We have seen in the tribunals how private businesses cause trouble.</P>
    <P>I am nervous about the way in which people here welcome this absolutely. Competition in the private world means exactly that. It is the survival of the fittest, it is not all good news. Competition and the pursuit of profit mean that certain practices will go by the wayside. Life will not go on the way it was. Deputy Ring thought that competition would mean he would get his electricity connection cheaper in Bangor Erris. I do not think the private bodies will be rushing off to supply electricity in west Mayo. That is not the way they operate.</P>
    <P>I accept this is being done under an EU directive. I would like to think that much of this is a 25 year fad and member states will cop on to themselves without making any major errors along the way.</P>
    <P>This is about competition, but is that competition fair? Is there a level playing field? Private bodies will generate electricity which they may sell to the national grid or, in time, supply directly to big consumers. That is unfair. Fair competition means a level playing field, it does not mean that you find out the biggest ten consumers of electricity in Ireland and start building generating plant next door to them, leaving ESB to look after rural Ireland. That is nonsensical.</P>
    <P>Concerns have already been expressed that some of the regulations may not apply to electricity imported from abroad. I hope the Minister will appease the ESB's concerns on that. If we opt for maximum profit, who will stop much of our power being generated externally? I am sure the Minister could prevent this happening by introd<Col N="306" /> ucing legislation. However, we have seen other examples of where the States starts off with its golden share, but five years down the line, some of it is sold and then five years later, the full golden share is sold. This happened in shipping; we had Irish Shipping, B&amp;I and other shipping companies and we sold them all. We then reached a stage when we could not even export our cattle. I am not from a farming background so I am not well up on how the matter now stands but at one stage, we could not even export our cattle on roll-on, roll-off trucks because we sold our shipping companies and none of them were owned by the State. Yet, 20 years previously we had a couple of companies and we could control what was done. However, the shipping companies were deemed to be old-fashioned and, as there was no third world war on the horizon, we did not need them. It was decided that private enterprise could do things better, and 15 or 20 years later we were not calling the shots.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister and the regulator, will ensure that, as years go by, a private company does not introduce cheap nuclear generated electricity. Can anyone assure me this cannot and will not happen? It may be provided for in this legislation. However, the emphasis changes over the years. The Minister said this legislation is only the first of three legislative proposals. I see this as only the first round. Obviously there is a long way to go. How can we guarantee these things will not happen?</P>
    <P>I am beginning to wonder has life left me behind. From my background in semi-State bodies, I watched ten years ago when other political parties made huge capital from semi-State bodies being privatised or becoming involved in a joint venture. There has been a sea change in this thinking, more at political level and &ldquo;Chief Buck Cat&rdquo; trade union level. I do not know if this has trickled down to the concerned worker. I know workers' concern has been allayed by the fact they will now get shares and I welcome and support that. However, in many respects, the willingness of people to jump from their previously held positions just because money, shares or directorships are on offer, has surprised many people who saw them as committed, genuine, semi-State workers. If one holds a principle dear, one should not be seen to be too willing to jump ship and chase a few pounds. However, I am glad workers who have built up these companies will profit from them and I hope this will help to secure their employment in the future.</P>
    <P>The ESB is concerned that some of the legislation will not cover electricity manufactured abroad. I am concerned about private companies manufacturing electricity; a planning application has been made for one close to my constituency, in Finglas. I am concerned they will concentrate on supplying the big users in the short term and that competition will be at that level, rather than that of the consumer in Bangor Erris or Midleton. This has also happened in other areas such as telecommunications, where tariffs are rebalanced <Col N="307" /> in the name of competition, to make our industrialists more competitive, as compared with Japan or elsewhere. However, does this mean the household consumer will have to pay more in the short-term? I am concerned about the way this will be handled over a long period. Our industry must compete with other European states and the rest of the world.</P>
    <P>However, I hope everything works out the way we want it to work out and that all of these matters have been carefully planned. We cannot help our industry to be more competitive if the private consumer ends up being thrown to the wolves under the guise of technical jargon such as the rebalancing of tariffs. This basically means the private consumer becomes the sacrificial lamb to provide industry with power so it can sell its products abroad.</P>
    <P>There are other problems. The company involved in the new station at Finglas will have the most hi-tech generators available. I am not suggesting that ESB equipment is old-fashioned but the ESB has always had a public service obligation, although I do not know whether it was always enshrined in writing. The generation of power by the ESB over the years was initially based on our natural resources, water, turf etc. Its plants have become more competitive and efficient in recent years. I am sure that Cement Roadstone or whoever has the plant in Finglas will have state of the art equipment which will allow it to produce electricity at a much cheaper rate. I hope this is regulated and that it does not mean the slightly old-fashioned, less efficient and less modern generating plants around the country are closed down.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;and it must be implemented in a balanced way. We must be aware of the good work done by the ESB, such as the way its manufactures electricity from turf. I would like to think that at least in the short term, the ESB will not be thrown to the wolves. If it is, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment needs to establish a task force to get new jobs and industry into the parts of the country which will be in trouble. There is a price to pay for all of this. Semi-State companies are under the control of the Minister and many have complained in the past about the delay in decision making by var<Col N="308" /> ious Ministers. In the bright new world, the leading executives in these semi-State bodies, now to be plcs or whatever, will be happy as the decision making process will be much quicker.</P>
      <P>However, this also means that Deputy Durkan will be unable to ask the Minister to explain on a daily basis what was bought and why. Once one bows to the gods of profit and privatisation, it is a whole new world. The Minister will not be in a position to answer for many of the actions of the individual companies involved. I hope the prevailing position now will last for a long time and in five or ten years time the regulator will not be thrown to the wolves as well.</P>
      <P>The Minister and her Department are in touch with the ESB, and I hope the fears and concerns of its staff are allayed. I am hopeful, if not confident, that the ESB will be able to compete with any new private bodies. Other semi-State companies that have faced competition have, by and large, done very well and are at least hanging in there.</P>
      <P>I would like this to be done fairly; it is not being done fairly by my standards as it allows the private companies to target the big users of electricity, but they should be told to look after west Cork, west Mayo and other less glamorous parts of the market. They should not just cherrypick the best business, as that is not competition. They will just feed off that part of the market and leave the ESB to look after the customers scattered around the country. That is not sensible.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Minister will tell me that these things are guaranteed and tied down, and I hope she is correct. However, I am slightly sceptical because, over time, a lot of things we hoped would not happen occurred anyway. The Minister should tell us how these public service obligations will be paid for. Will there be a subsidy for the public service obligations the ESB must carry out, or will it be up to each individual Minister to fight the battle? I would like to think that if we want the ESB to look after its public service obligations, a source of revenue for that purpose should be clearly earmarked for many years ahead.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Sargent. I welcome the Bill. I do not claim to be an expert on the legislation, but having listened to Deputies Browne, Durkan and Noel Ahern, I have heard both sides of the story. From a wider political perspective people have been worried about the death of the old Labour Party, but while Deputy Noel Ahern is in the House many of the views of that party will be expressed strongly from the Fianna Fáil benches. The more some things change the more they stay the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Politically, we are going down the same road with our economic planning and development as Britain and the United States did ten or 15 years ago. That seems to be the way with most of these matters; what occurred in Britain in the 1980s appears to be under way in Ireland in the 1990s. <Col N="309" /> Some of that is good and some bad, but it has to be conceded that deregulation and competition have worked well here in the past few years. The airline, telecommunications and health care industries were referred to, and generally the consumer has benefited. There were difficulties, and there must have been doubts among the staff of former State companies that had been so strongly protected by Governments. However, the consumer must be king. The consumer has benefited from cheaper air fares, a better range of telephone services and now a choice of health care policies. I hope the consumer also benefits from this legislation.</P>
    <P>The Minister made the valid point that electricity consumption is growing by approximately 6 per cent per annum and that it is likely to continue growing. In the era of the Celtic tiger we can expect a rise in consumption, but is that necessarily a good thing? The rise in demand for energy as a sign of a growing economy is one side of the equation, but there is also a tremendous waste of resources in the country. We should be more conscious of environmental issues. We should ask ourselves about the consumption rate of electricity in Ireland rather than boasting proudly that consumption will rise significantly in coming years. Our policy should be to ensure that this resource is carefully managed and monitored and used sparingly, as all resources should be. Notwithstanding that, however, it is likely that there will be an increase in supply and that there will be significant room in the market for new companies.</P>
    <P>I have no great difficulty with the ideological concept of free trade for electricity, and I am sure the majority of Irish people feel the same. I therefore welcome the legislation, particularly the creation of a commission for the regulation of electricity. I note the appointment of Mr. Tom Reeves from the Minister's Department as commissioner, and obviously he has all our best wishes in a difficult job. The commissioner will have responsibility for taking account of protection of the environment. Knowing my constituency, the Minister will know the matter I am about to raise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">

    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister visited the constituency of Cork East recently and is now more aware than ever of the situation regarding the proposed erection of a major pylon project from Raffeen to Aghada. Politically, I do not always believe in dancing to the beat of the loudest drum, but the Minister will agree that there is an unprecedented level of opposition to the ESB's plan to develop that power line. A Cork County Council meeting last Monday discussed using a section 30 motion to reverse a planning decision, which is very rare. I am a member of Cork County Council, and it has been hugely responsible in planning matters throughout the years. In my 14 or 15 years as a councillor we have used <Col N="310" /> section 4 motions once or twice. The fact that councillors are considering the introduction of a section 30 motion to deal with the ESB proposal shows the strength of feeling on the issue. I know from the Minister's responses to me, to parliamentary questions and to correspondence from the area that she has no direct control over ESB decisions and that she can only speak to ESB management. However, the Minister must ask ESB management to look long and hard at an alternative power supply.</P>
      <P>I noted with great interest a new plan for electricity generation which is a joint venture between the ESB and another group, particularly the fact that the power will be supplied underwater through cables. We are being told in east Cork that the underwater cable option is not practical, but if it can be used off the coast we must return to the ESB and insist that this is a viable option to the Aghada-Raffeen project. I am not trying to respond to scare tactics or loud protests, but as the Minister has ultimate responsibility for electricity supply, she should be extremely concerned by events in the east Cork area.</P>
      <P>One would have to be extremely concerned about events in east Cork. I have never seen so many concerned people willing to go to such lengths, legal and otherwise, to stop this project. As politicians we should not have to respond to the biggest protest group or the loudest chant. However, there are occasions when we have to take on board the concerns expressed by constituents. At this late stage I appeal to the Minister to speak with ESB management. We are not asking anyone to climb down from previously held high moral ground, accept mistakes, reverse policy etc. We are simply asking, in light of the changing circumstances and opposition to a project which will not go away, and which may verge on civil disobedience, that ESB management adopt a mature attitude to the underwater cable option which is a viable alternative. We can argue about the costs. Given that there is an alternative, it should be used. That is one issue that affects my constituency and one which the regulator will have to look at because he will have many such proposals and projects before him for consideration.</P>
      <P>On the question of competition, the Minister's Department, with aid from the EU, put in place a scheme where small suppliers of alternative sources of electricity were assisted in developing projects.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if those projects were successful. I recall one or two projects in my constituency were considered. Small players were assisted and some may have come to fruition. I hope, as a result of this legislation, that scale of operation will not disappear and that we will cater not only for large firms supplying the market but that there will still be room for the smaller player who may have a local project linked to a <Col N="311" /> tourism or amenity project. I hope that scheme remains in place.</P>
      <P>I welcome the legislation and have no ideological difficulty with it. I am sure the commission for electricity regulation will take on board the necessity for competition. I hope the concerns expressed by Deputy Noel Ahern will be listened to, that we will not throw out the baby with the bathwater and that in recognition of the work done by the ESB in the past it can be assured of a major role in the supply of energy in the Ireland of the next millennium.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister to look again at the dangerous situation in east Cork. I do not make loud noises simply to gain cheap publicity. I recognise her remit and her lack of direct control but common sense can prevail. I appeal to her to ask the people to sit down together, given that we want a viable and strong electricity supply for Cork city for industry etc. However, it must be done in an environmentally friendly fashion that does not blight the landscape. I apologise for straying a little from the Bill but it is a serious problem in my constituency.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Green Party, An Comhaontas Glas, the energy sector needs community control. If it cannot be organised in a regional fashion, national control is necessary. The Bill is not one we can endorse as a desirable turn of events for the energy sector. Internationally there is a legal and a moral obligation, in the interests of future generations, to reduce drastically our emissions of greenhouse inducing gases. Scientists working on the intergovernmental panel on climate change have agreed that a 60 per cent reduction in greenhouse inducing gases is needed over a certain period. In the case of Ireland, we are getting away with increasing our CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions. This Bill does not face up to the problem facing Ireland. It turns its back on the problem to a large extent, apart from its provisions on renewable energy development. The mechanisms for energy conservation are not clearly laid out and have not been thought through.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ahern referred to national needs of employment and customer service, both of which will be seriously compromised by a rush to privatisation. That is an issue about which we will all hear much in our constituencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to focus on the ESB, how it has managed to do its job and what it is expected to do in the future. As a national monopoly the ESB has set itself targets to curtail demand for electricity, but those targets have been breached. People explain that by referring to the Celtic tiger. Internationally the best economies have managed to decouple the parallel growth in economic development with growth in energy consumption. The more backward economies still depend on a parallel growth in energy with a growth in economic activity. There is nothing to be proud of in saying the demand for energy is rising as econ<Col N="312" /> omic activity continues to develop. It is an admission that we have not faced up to the need to decouple energy consumption with economic activity. That is a challenge that faces this and all future Governments.</P>
    <P>In the area of housing and industrial development, there is a demand which will push up energy consumption even if we try to curtail it. The water crisis is an indication that we do not have the infrastructure for water conservation to avoid supply being cut off. We have yet to put in place proper energy conservation measures to curtail the growth in energy demand. For example, energy audits on buildings are not required and various measures to conserve energy are not in place. We have much work to do. This Bill puts the onus on the private sector to do what the public sector has failed to do. I do not have faith in a policy which is framed in that way.</P>
    <P>The Bill marks an alarming leap into the darkness and obscurity of market forces. It is a very optimistic Bill if it expects market forces to act in the common good. It would be an unusual state of affairs if market forces were to act in the common good because, generally, they follow sectoral interests. There are many associated with the Bill who would try to claim the high moral ground. It is amazing to hear how a term like &ldquo;alternative energy&rdquo; can be grasped by people involved in the nuclear industry, for instance, who proclaim that they are extremely friendly to the environment because they do not emit carbon dioxide. That is their mantra and they stick to it. They try to claim the tag of alternative energy. The gas industry is now trying to claim that because it has lower CO2 emissions than oil it deserves to be considered as an alternative energy.</P>
    <P>Many sectoral interests are trying to use the Bill to their advantage. The combined heat and power sectors have a greater claim to the alternative energy tag, but the technology involved still utilises fossil fuel. The definition on page 5 of the Bill is extremely narrow and allows quite a wasteful application of CHP technology. It needs to be strengthened That is one issue that will be coming forward in amendments to the Bill.</P>
    <P>Before Committee Stage, the Government should carefully consider what is being unleashed here. It should pull back and ensure there is a national energy conservation strategy in place &ndash; one that is binding and not simply a wish list of aspirations. There is currently a rush from different private interests to get a foothold in the deregulated market. In light of that, there is clearly a need for a national strategy on energy conservation and generating capacity so that the number of new power stations built is controlled after the deregulation of the industry. In that way, CO2 emissions will be reduced in accordance with Ireland's obligations under the Kyoto Protocol, renewable energy sources will reach their full potential and the practice of using energy inefficiently in all sectors will be brought to an end.</P>
    <P>That is quite a challenge but unless we grasp it <Col N="313" /> we will face huge local and national problems as very large players in the energy sector come into Ireland and try to undercut each other by producing electricity more cheaply and on a larger scale than the last applicant. There is little incentive for energy conservation in that scenario.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ahern mentioned an application before Fingal County Council. Like him, I have received representations on the issue of a CRH 600 megawatt station at Huntstown. It is alarming to hear from local residents about the effects in an agricultural area, as they would understand it, when they hear about this proposal and what it will mean. For instance, they compare the proposed height of the chimney stacks with stations such as the one at Ringsend. It seems that on account of its proximity to Dublin Airport those stacks are to be half the height of the ones at Ringsend. That compromise is understandable from an aviation safety point of view, but it is unacceptable from the point of view of good planning and having regard to the needs of people living in the area. It seems there is a general lack of consideration being given both to national energy needs and to the needs of people who will be most closely affected by the type of proposal that will arise as a result of deregulation.</P>
    <P>Already we have a huge intrinsic problem in the planning process in relation to developments such as the one I mentioned and to other large developments, because the process adjudicates on good planning practice but does not have any role in monitoring the pollution effects of a plant. That is a matter for the Environmental Protection Agency. On the one hand we have a plan on paper which the local planning authority will decide upon, and if it gives permission the Environmental Protection Agency will be faced with making a decision whether or not to allow it to proceed as proposed. The latter scenario is bizarre because millions of pounds could be invested in a large building which could become a white elephant if the EPA decides at that point not to give it the go ahead.</P>
    <P>The Bill shows up a further problem in the planning process in relation to large developments such as the proposed generating station. It does not indicate any great future for those employed in the energy sector. I understand from the environmental impact statement and the literature that large-scale operations, such as the CRH development I mentioned, are due to create about 30 jobs over 15 hectares. It does not seem that this will placate local communities which expect some return from such a huge imposition in their area.</P>
    <P>A large pylon network will be involved in such a power station. The impact of that on a local community is the subject of intense debate and controversy. There seems to be a policy to ride roughshod over local communities, but in whose interest? It seems as if the people generating the electricity will be the ones who will benefit, but the national interest should take precedence over the private interests of those individuals.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="314" /> The literature I received in relation to the CRH plant indicates that people have many worries about such a large proposal. These include everything from noise, electro-magnetic radiation, dust, inability to curtail greenhouse gases in the deregulated market, landscaping and visual amenities, the material assets of the area and general safety concerns. Who would want to buy a house beside a generating station? I could go into all these aspects in considerable detail because I have received copious amounts of information on them. Suffice it to say, however, that the Minister will have to think about what is being unleashed here and whether there will be sufficient motivation, obligation and conditions attached to the operators of the electricity market if deregulation is agreed, as proposed in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The potential for energy conservation, in the domestic, transport, commercial and industrial sectors, is not being harnessed, although we talk about it and have an energy awareness week. We also have an energy centre which is awaiting legislation but is not a priority, by all accounts, compared to this legislation. That centre is being asked to take all that responsibility on energy conservation and implement it as national policy. That is laughable considering the pressures for increased capacity which the private sector will impose.</P>
    <P>In tandem with that energy conservation agenda, there is the vast potential of renewable energy in this country. Denmark has managed to develop a community based control system of renewable energy where people living in the area &ndash; far from seeing windmills or any of the other means of generation by wind, sun or wave power as something alien, imposed or strange &ndash; see it as part of their community. It is controlled by the community and the dividends go back to the community, who have an interest in developing it further and feel a close affinity with it. Here the renewable energy sector lies virtually untapped, apart from the often mentioned wind farm developments. The areas of biomass, solar technology &ndash; which does not require as much sunshine as people think &ndash; and wave energy have been developed but need to be developed further. Deregulation still keeps them in the halfpenny place and as long as energy conservation is not taken seriously, they will always occupy the smaller percentage of energy demands. If energy conservation was tackled seriously they would obviously be able to fulfil a much larger percentage of our energy needs and consequently we could meet our obligations internationally to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</P>
    <P>We could also ensure local communities are not persecuted by private interests coming into this country to benefit from the profiteering opportunities which the Bill offers. The closure of older plants will result in considerable suffering in the community. When phasing out the older plants at the end of their lifespan we should take account of the needs of communities and update <Col N="315" /> the technologies rather than assign plants to the scrap heap in the interests of private profiteering.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>A taboo has been broken and I presume anyone can speak as often as he or she likes on Second Stage.</P>
      <P>If we count Deputy Sargent once, 32 Members spoke on the Bill which indicates a high level of interest in the Electricity Regulation Bill. Many interesting points were raised during the debate. Many Deputies, particularly those from rural areas commented on the longevity of the ESB, a State monopoly set up in 1927. The company was given due credit for its role in rural electrification and what it has achieved down through the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the exception of two or three speakers, Members recognised that competition was now a feature in the provision of utilities and this gave rise to the need for a regulator. I think competition is good. I have noticed in the provision of public service utilities that those who lag behind fall behind and those who compete soar ahead. Although I take Deputy Durkan's point, where would we be without Europe if we were to enter competitive markets? The advent of competition is timely, it will shake up matters and lead to a better service. Fears were expressed about the older stations and their impact on the ESB. A <Col N="316" /> review of the peat stations was carried out some time ago in which the timespan of each station was annotated and we are working to that timeframe. The public service obligations will be obligatory on all who compete in the electricity market.</P>
    <P>Almost everyone who spoke addressed the question of alternative energy. It is amazing that everybody is in favour of alternative energy, but many, with the exception of Deputy Sargent, have fears about the size and level of noise that emanates from windfarms, although I know new technology has mitigated the noise. Denmark has managed to achieve a 12 per cent penetration with wind farm technology for the supply of alternative energy. Deputy Sargent stated that in Denmark the wind farms are community based and partly community owned. There is a strong tradition of community involvement in Denmark. Everyone said wind farms were a good idea but also mentioned the distress caused to communities by their configuration, size and location. People have every right to speak in this way because we must take into account the concerns of communities. They are in favour of wind farms but not in their areas. They want them in remote places where no one can see or hear them or know they are there, but such places are becoming scarce. When returning from Sligo on Monday I saw the Arigna wind farm, which is a striking sight against the horizon. There are about ten windmills and even from a great distance one could hear them whirring. I do not find them unsightly but I do not live beside them. That is the difficulty people have &ndash; they are in favour of wind farms but not near where they live, and Deputies do not support them if they affect their constituents. I am not surprised by this, we are all affected by what our constituents tell us and I do not castigate Deputies for this, I merely offer it as an observation.</P>
    <P>The Bill establishes a regulator and there will be another Bill, which I hope will appear in the autumn, to incorporate the PLC measures and the greater part of the directive. This legislation is necessary because new plans for electricity generation could not go ahead otherwise. There is a regulator in waiting or a putative regulator and once the Bill is passed he will be appointed.</P>
    <P>Several Deputies from Cork and from different parties mentioned electricity pylons. Deputy Bradford spoke on it today, and Deputy Sargent also mentioned it in his two contributions.</P>

      <P>Cuireann sé áthas orm ar mo shon féin agus ar son an Aire Comhshaoil agus Rialtais Áitiúil an Bille tábhachtach seo a chur os comhair na Dála. Bille stairiúil atá anseo, a thabharfaidh cosaint cuimsitheach d'ár n-oidhreacht tógtha. Tá an chosaint sin tuillte go maith ag an gcuid sin d'ár n-oidhreacht. Is cuid lárnach é an Bille seo den obair atá curtha i gcrích ag an Rialtas seo chun cabhrú le slanú na bhfoirgneamh suntasach sin a d'fhág ár sinsear ina ndiaidh mar bhronntanas orainne agus ar na glúnta atá le teacht.</P>
      <P>On behalf of my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, I am pleased to introduce this important Bill to the Dáil. It forms a central part of the package of measures this Government has put in place to ensure the protection and survival into the future of our built heritage. The Bill on the National Inventory of Architectural Heritage which the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands has introduced will complement the provisions of this Bill to ensure comprehensive legal protection for the architectural heritage. In addition, the Government has ensured the legislation is backed up with adequate resources in terms of financial assistance and conservation expertise to enable the legislation to work effectively. The Bill has already been passed by the Seanad where it was warmly received by all sides. I am sure it will receive a similar welcome in this House.</P>
      <P>Every generation carries a great onus to ensure that its heritage and culture are preserved and passed on to future generations. So it is with our built heritage. It is often said that architecture is the mother of all arts. The Bill will ensure that we live up to our responsibilities to protect that built heritage.</P>
      <P>There is widespread agreement that we need to have a more effective regime if we are to properly fulfil our responsibility to our own and future generations to protect our architectural heritage from the threats against it &ndash; threats that can arise from lack of resources, carelessness, ignorance and greed. This new regime decided on by the Government for the protection of our architectural heritage can be said to comprise three pillars: modern robust comprehensive legislation, dedicated financial resources and the employment of adequate expertise and knowledge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="319" /> The first pillar consists of this Bill, which will transform the legislative protection afforded to the architectural heritage. It has been drafted following comprehensive consultation and consideration of all the issues involved. Many of the provisions derive from the report of the Interdepartmental Working Group on Strengthening the Protection of the Architectural Heritage which was published in September 1996. The committee had consulted widely before reporting and many observations were received following publication of the report. This Bill expands and improves on the working group's recommendations. It has been through careful scrutiny in the Seanad, where a number of improvements were made to its provisions thanks to contributions from Members on all sides.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to correct recent reports in the media that the Bill does not fulfil the promise of the 1996 report. All of the major legislative recommendations in that report will be implemented by the two related Bills which are currently before the Oireachtas. As recommended in the report, the statutory obligation on local authorities to protect the built environment is included. The respective roles of the Department of the Environment and Local Government, local authorities and Dúchas are precisely as recommended in the report and the extent of the protection afforded to those buildings which are protected under the Bill is yet again as recommended in the report. Those criticising the Bill are more intent in causing mischief than in making constructive contributions to strengthening the legal protection afforded to our built heritage.</P>
    <P>The Bill introduces a systematic approach to the protection of buildings. Local authorities have been criticised in the past for widely divergent approaches to listing buildings for protection in their development plans. Some local authorities have very comprehensive lists, some have none; some authorities have one list, others have six or seven. Distinctions are often made between objectives to preserve buildings and objectives to consider their preservation.</P>
    <P>The Bill will bring uniformity to the way in which buildings are protected in the future. The formal record of protected structures created under the Bill will be kept in a standard format common to all local authorities. It will remove the distinctions between lists. If a building is worth placing on the record of protected structures then it is worth protecting.</P>
    <P>This new systematic approach to protecting the built heritage will be enhanced by using the resources of the National Inventory of Architectural Heritage which is administered by the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands. The inventory will be used as a national database to record Ireland's built environment. It is intended that those buildings which are identified by the inventory as being of international, national or regional significance will be recommended to local authorities for protection.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="320" /> Local authorities will continue to have an ongoing role in identifying buildings for protection independently of the inventory. They will have to determine the buildings which are of significance to the local community and, therefore, deserving of protection. Guidance will be given to local authorities to help them carry out these functions in a consistent manner. Once buildings are identified for protection they will be subject to comprehensive protection. The protection extended to buildings under the Planning and Development Act, 1963, was too narrow and too many interiors have been lost because they were not specifically listed. The Bill will ensure that where a building is protected, the whole building, interior and curtilage, will be subject to that protection. Any works which would affect the character of the building will require planning permission. It is recognised that this proposal could be quite onerous on owners of protected buildings. Therefore, the Bill provides that owners and occupiers of protected buildings will be entitled to a declaration from the planning authority which would determine the types of works which the planning authority considers would affect the character of the building.</P>
    <P>Another key issue in providing comprehensive protection is the need to protect buildings independently of the statutory five year review of development plans. The Bill facilitates the addition of buildings to the record of protected buildings as the need arises. Furthermore, it tackles the issue of protected buildings being allowed to become dilapidated due to the neglect of the owner or occupier and will allow local authorities take a proactive role in ensuring protected buildings are not neglected. These provisions are modelled on the Derelict Sites Act, 1990.</P>
    <P>The Bill also responds to the need to identify and make provision in development plans for special streetscapes or other areas of interest which need to be protected. This will allow planning authorities to apply local planning policies to these areas in a way which will ensure that any development is compatible with the character of the area. For example, this will facilitate protection of an entire square rather than just individual buildings.</P>
    <P>Legislation in itself is not sufficient to ensure the protection of the built heritage: it needs to be backed by resources. This brings me to the second pillar &ndash; money. The Government announced last May that it would provide a new budget line of £5 million per annum from 1999 onwards to ensure that the package of measures can be fully implemented. Out of this around £4 million will be available for grant-aid for protected buildings.</P>
    <P>The new scheme of grant-aid will be administered by the principal local authorities as it is the local authorities who will have the statutory function of protecting buildings under this Bill. An advisory group made up of representatives from the Departments of the Environment and Local <Col N="321" /> Government and Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, the Heritage Council and the County and City Managers' Association is finalising recommendations on the detailed terms and conditions of the new grant scheme for protected structures. We are aiming for effective and consistent administration of grant aid throughout the country. It is expected that, in the initial years at least, those buildings most at risk will be a priority.</P>
    <P>Local authorities are also being provided with £300,000 per annum to assist them in employing the necessary conservation expertise to ensure that all buildings worthy of listing are identified, the legislation enforced and the grant scheme operated effectively. It is hoped the local government service could employ 15 to 20 conservation officers to enable it carry out its functions fully. This new cadre of conservation experts will constitute part of the third pillar &ndash; the expertise to which I referred earlier.</P>
    <P>The provision of proper conservation advice is fundamental to the success of the Bill. I am certain, therefore, that the deployment of conservation expertise in the local authority service will bring such expertise to local authorities. This local expertise will, in turn, be backed up by comprehensive guidelines drawn up at central level by Dúchas, the heritage service of the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, in consultation with the Department of the Environment and Local Government. Dúchas will also act as a central unit providing day to day advice to conservation officers and local authorities regarding their functions. This system will bring a consistency of approach to the conservation of the built environment in Ireland which has been lacking up to now.</P>
    <P>I will turn now briefly to the main provisions of the Bill. A very comprehensive explanatory memorandum has been provided, therefore, I will concentrate on the essential features. The definitions of &ldquo;structure&rdquo; and &ldquo;protected structure&rdquo; in section 1 are crucial to the understanding of the Bill. The effect of these definitions is that when a building is included in the record of protected structures, the interior of the protected structure, including its fixtures and features and the land and structures immediately around it &ndash; the curtilage &ndash; will be automatically protected and will no longer require specific listing. This marks a major advance on the present limited provisions. Other features in the grounds of the structure beyond the curtilage &ndash; for example, a folly or ornamental fountain &ndash; which add to the architectural interest of the building may also be included for protection if specifically identified on the record. The term &ldquo;protected structure&rdquo;, as a legal term, will replace the term &ldquo;listed building&rdquo;. This is in line with common international practice.</P>
    <P>Section 2 provides that planning authorities will be obliged to have a record of structures of special architectural, historical, archaeological, artistic, scientific, social or technical interest <Col N="322" /> which will form part of the development plan for the area. This constitutes a wider definition of &ldquo;architectural heritage&rdquo; than the reference to buildings of &ldquo;artistic, historic or architectural interest&rdquo; in the existing legislation. The record of protected structures will continue in existence, even where a review or a variation of a development plan is made under Part III of the 1963 Act.</P>
    <P>The requirement to establish a record is linked to the mandatory provision to include objectives in the development plan for the protection of the architectural heritage which is provided by the amendment of section 19 of the Planning Act, 1963, by section 33 of the Bill. This amendment also obliges planning authorities to include objectives in the development plan to protect groups of structures and places, including townscapes.</P>
    <P>Section 3 provides that the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands may, after consulting the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, issue guidelines to planning authorities to assist them in carrying out their functions under the Bill in protecting buildings and townscapes. The guidelines will ensure a consistent approach to protecting the built heritage is adopted nationwide.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides that, in addition to the above guidelines, the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands may recommend the inclusion of structures in the record of protected structures. This will be based on the information contained in the national inventory of the architectural heritage.</P>
    <P>Section 5 provides that a planning authority may add a building to the record of protected structures where it considers such a building warrants protection or may delete a structure where protection is no longer warranted. The making of a deletion from, or an addition to, the record of protected structures may be carried out when reviewing the development plan as part of the statutory five year review or in accordance with the provisions laid down in section 6.</P>
    <P>Section 6 sets out the procedure for amending the record of protected structures independently of the development plan review process. This will allow buildings to be protected as the need arises without having to wait for the five year development plan review process &ndash; a weak point of the old system. The final decision on what structures are to be accorded protected status will rest with the elected members of the authority.</P>
    <P>Section 8 provides that planning permission will be required for works on a protected structure which affect its character. As the protection will extend to the interior of structures, permission may be required for interior decorating activity, such as plastering, if it would affect the character of the structure. To clarify for owners and occupiers of protected structures exactly what works they are permitted to do without permission, they may request the local authority to indicate those works in a declaration. For example, a declaration could state that works to the interior would not affect the character of the <Col N="323" /> building and, therefore, would not require permission where redecoration was being contemplated. Planning authorities will be required to issue the declarations within three months of a request, although provision has been made in the transitional arrangements to extend the time if a large number of requests for declarations are made when the Bill is enacted.</P>
    <P>Special consideration is given to structures used for religious worship. Planning authorities will be obliged to respect liturgical requirements and consult the relevant Church authorities when issuing a declaration. The same will apply to a planning application that affects the interior of a protected church.</P>
    <P>Section 9 provides that it will be an offence to deliberately damage a protected structure, with fines of up to £1 million on indictment. Owners and occupiers will be under a duty to ensure a protected structure is not endangered, either through their actions or neglect.</P>
    <P>Section 10 provides that, if a protected structure is endangered, planning authorities may issue a notice to the owner or occupier requiring works to be carried out. The planning authority may, at its discretion, assist the owner or occupier in carrying out the works, either financially or otherwise.</P>
    <P>Section 11 provides that the planning authority can require the owner or occupier of a protected structure to carry out works to restore the character of a protected building. This could include, for example, the removal of incongruous signs on a protected building or street, even if such signs were erected lawfully. The planning authority will, however, have to pay the full cost of works to be carried out under this section.</P>
    <P>Sections 22 to 29, inclusive, give a power to planning authorities to purchase a protected structure which is endangered, if necessary compulsorily, and set out the procedures to be followed if this happens.</P>
    <P>Section 30 requires sanitary authorities, before issuing a dangerous buildings notice in relation to a protected building, to consider instead whether a notice to carry out works under the Bill or the Derelict Sites Act would be appropriate. This is not an attempt to circumscribe a sanitary authority's powers, merely to oblige it to consider that it may be dealing with a protected building which should be preserved, if possible.</P>
    <P>Section 38 provides for transitional arrangements for buildings currently listed for protection or preservation under a development plan. These will automatically become protected buildings under the Bill. Owners and occupiers of these buildings will, however, be consulted and entitled to make representations to the planning authority on whether their building should remain a protected structure.</P>
    <P>The Bill marks a major advance in the way we preserve and look after the precious heritage of buildings which we are lucky to possess. It is a mark of our maturity as a society that there is <Col N="324" /> widespread support for devoting some of our increased wealth to preserving our physical history for our edification and those who come after us.</P>
    <P>Taispeánann an Bille freisin go bhfuil muid dáiríre i dtaobh úsáid agus athnuachan na bhfoirgneamh atá againn, i dtreo is go dtig linn iad a úsáid sna blianta atá le teacht sa gcaoi chéanna inar úsáideadh iad leis na blianta a chuaigh thart, thar na céadta bliain in ammana. Foirgnimh bheo atá iontu, ní seoda iad atá coinnithe faoi ghlas i músaem. Athraíonn siad agus athraítear iad de réir mar a athraíonn an saol agus an tsochaí thart orthu. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Long Title of the Bill indicates that it is intended &ldquo;to make better provision for the protection of the architectural heritage in the interests of the common good and to provide for related matters.&rdquo;  According to the explanatory and financial memorandum, it is intended to provide for the greater protection of buildings and structures of special architectural, historical, archaeological, artistic, scientific, social or technical interest.</P>
      <P>No one would oppose the intentions of the Bill. Many hold the view that a more vigorous approach to its objectives is long overdue. Much of our built heritage, which goes back centuries, is in great danger, despite being built of stone. In many parts of the country it is crumbling and little is being done to preserve or conserve it. I do not criticise those directly involved, they are part of a culture which has chosen to ignore much of our built heritage which is in danger from neglect and carelessness as well as the competing demands of new development.</P>
      <P>There are numerous examples, including recent examples in Dublin, of a cavalier attitude to our built environment and architectural heritage, not just on the part of developers but on the part of planning authorities. I will not refer to some of the more celebrated cases. An Bord Pléanala and some planning authorities can be criticised for decisions they have made which have impacted severely on the built environment. Insensitive and uncaring development has already robbed us of many significant structures. For that reason what remains is to be cherished all the more.</P>
      <P>It is significant that the Minister should have found it necessary to refer to the precious heritage of buildings we are lucky to possess. We are lucky to possess some of them, and it has been more by luck than judgment that some parts of our built heritage still remain with us. Many parts have been demolished or obliterated by an uninformed and uncaring approach to development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a cause of concern because there is probably a smaller element of architectural record in Ireland than in many other European countries. For much of our history the plain people lived in rather impermanent structures, many of which were repeatedly destroyed and replaced. While it is fair to say the prevalence of <Col N="325" /> full-scale warfare here was less than in many other European countries, turbulent episodes in our history destroyed parts of the contemporary built environment. For much of our history the forms of economic and social organisation which prevailed produced a pattern of settlement very different from that to be seen in the medieval towns that are such a notable feature of the architectural heritage of many other European countries.</P>
    <P>All of these considerations render the protection, preservation and conservation of our built environment all the more important. For that reason the Bill needs to be reinforced in some respects and to be made more explicit in others. For the sake of completeness I urge that the definition of architectural heritage included in the Heritage Act, 1995, should be inserted into the definition section of the Bill. Provision should be made to include buildings of cultural and political interest within the scope of the Bill. The definition is not sufficiently widely drawn and there should be a specific reference to buildings of cultural and political interest. In this respect the episode involving the Carson house in Harcourt Street underlines the importance of including it in the defining provisions of the scope and ambit of the Bill. I would argue for the widest and most comprehensive definition of the areas to be covered.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Bill sets out to give a more comprehensive framework to local authorities for the actions they take within the ambit of their development plans to pursue the objectives of the Bill. Here again, I would argue for a more comprehensive and muscular approach. There are several reasons for concern in this regard. It is not clear, for example, what the effect of the Bill will be on current List 2 or List B buildings in existing local authority development plans. They comprise the majority of listed structures in these plans. If they are omitted &ndash; it appears they may be &ndash; there could be a threat to their continued existence. The Bill must explicitly include those buildings. The Minister briefly referred to this when he said:</P>
    <P>The Bill will remove the distinction between lists. If a building is worth placing on the record of protected structures then it is worth protecting.</P>
    <P>I agree with the sentiment, but I would like an assurance &ndash; I do not find it in the Bill &ndash; that this means that all of the List 2 and List B buildings in existing local authority development plans will be covered by the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>We will separately debate the legislation on the national inventory of architectural heritage, which is the responsibility of the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands. That this legislation, which overlaps with the provisions in this Bill, is the responsibility of a different Minister indicates a lack of consistency and congruency in policy in these areas. We must <Col N="326" /> ensure that both provide for mutually supportive and reinforcing policies.</P>
    <P>The Bill repeatedly provides a measure of discretion to the Minster for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands in issuing guidelines to planning authorities. It also provides for discretion on the part of local authorities in the integration and implementation of those guidelines in their development plans. The Minister referred to this when he pointed out that there are differences, indeed widely divergent approaches between local authorities and that the Bill will bring uniformity to the way in which buildings are protected in the future. He went on to state: &ldquo;The formal record of protected structures created under this Bill will be kept in a standard format common to all local authorities.&rdquo;  That is fine, as far as it goes. However, the provisions of the Bill contains words such as &ldquo;may&rdquo;, &ldquo;guidelines&rdquo;, &ldquo;have regard to&rdquo; and so on. There appears to be nothing constraining or compelling about the actions of the Minister, his recommendations or the guidelines.</P>
    <P>I worry that this may not be a sufficiently strong approach because if Ministers may issue guidelines they may equally choose not to, and if local authorities have regard to guidelines, what is the limit of their regard for them? There are questions to be answered here and the more discretion there is the less satisfactory the situation will be.</P>
    <P>There are many areas in planning laws and in current legislation to deal with listed buildings where discretions are available to Ministers. There are powers provided to Ministers in existing legislation which have not been used. One wonders why. One also wonders if it is wise to continue to leave that margin of discretion open. I do not argue for the hands of the Government or of Ministers to be tied, but provisions should be included that adopt a more muscular approach to the implementation and execution of a settled policy. Regrettably, some of the drafting in this Bill does not give me the confidence that there will be that kind of certainty.</P>
    <P>Nowhere does the Bill provide for a central body to advise the Ministers and the planning authorities on the implementation of the measures in the Bill, notwithstanding the fact that such a body was recommended in the interdepartmental report entitled <i>Strengthening the Protection of the Architectural Heritage,</i> published in 1996. Given the pressures that will inevitably be placed on Ministers and local authorities in favour of development, we should take the opportunity of this legislation to set in place a focus of countervailing power with the explicit mission of advising Ministers and of making it difficult, if not impossible, for local authorities to ignore, or only partially to execute the policies enunciated by Ministers, policies which should be more than simple recommendations.</P>
    <P>In this regard the Minister, referring to what he called another innovation in the Bill, stated:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="327" /> This new systematic approach to protecting the built heritage will be enhanced by using the resources of the national inventory of architectural heritage which is administered by the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands. The inventory will be used as a national database to record Ireland's built environment. It is intended that those buildings which are identified by the inventory as being of international, national or regional significance will be recommended to local authorities for protection.</P>
    <P>There is nothing constraining about that, it leaves a margin of discretion to local authorities. If these buildings are included in the inventory of architectural heritage and are of international, national or regional significance, why should it simply be a matter of recommendation? Why should we not take it seriously and say these buildings must be protected? </P>
    <P>It has been suggested to me from several quarters that all pre-1870 buildings and structures should be treated as if listed, unless it is agreed they should be delisted because of the existence of exceptional and extraordinary circumstances. Such a measure would protect many structures which are now at serious risk. It would, for example, protect a great proportion of all types of vernacular buildings. The date of 1870 was suggested since prior to that date construction in both rural and urban areas tended to use materials such as handmade bricks and cut stone which were later replaced by mass or industrial produced materials which are easier to replace.</P>
    <P>Another question arises about the circumstances in which buildings may be chosen for protection. In his speech the Minister stated:</P>
    <P>Another key issue in providing comprehensive protection is the need to protect buildings independently of the statutory five year review of development plans. The Bill, therefore, facilitates the addition of buildings to the record of protected buildings as the need arises.</P>
    <P>I presume that is what is intended in section 6. Perhaps the Minister could clarify if section 6 provides for what is known as point listing of buildings. If it does not, it should be reinforced so that can be done.</P>
    <P>The Bill includes the protection of townscapes among its objectives. That provision is welcome as far as it goes. However, it needs further consideration than is given to it in the Bill. The protection of townscapes should not concern itself only with facades. We tend to look at facades and the cumulative effect of a group of buildings on the ambience of a street. Far more consideration should be given to the integrity of the structures which make up townscapes than has often been the case in the past.</P>
    <P>We tend to ignore the rear aspects of buildings, yet street plans or topography ensure the rear aspects of buildings in cities and towns have almost as much impact in the overall visual envir<Col N="328" /> onment as the facades. In many of our towns and villages, an attractive streetscape &ndash; that is, one which is attractive when viewed from the street &ndash; can often produce an effect of appalling ugliness when viewed from a different vantage point in the town or from vantage points accessible to the public, not just car parks at the backs of buildings. A concentration only on facades is an incomplete approach to the preservation of townscapes.</P>
    <P>We should consider making a specific provision for conservation areas. Such a provision would reinforce and support action already being taken by some planning authorities and put this action on a firm statutory base. The Minister referred to this when he mentioned the action the Bill proposes on streetscapes. He said:</P>
    <P>This will allow planning authorities to apply local planning policies to these areas in a way that will ensure that any development is compatible with the character of the area. For example, this will facilitate protection of a whole square rather than just individual buildings.</P>
    <P>I agree with that intention, which should be supported, but I am arguing for a more explicit approach. A whole square should be designated, for example, as a conservation area and a statutory base given to the action local authorities can take on such an area. Some local authorities have already adopted that approach in part of their work and they should be given statutory backing for what they are doing.</P>
    <P>Enforcement is another issue which should be considered. There are discretions and powers in the current legislation governing the listing of buildings which have not been used. Where such a discretion is given to a Minister and not used, action by other parties is effectively precluded. That is unsatisfactory. Where powers are used, we must ensure they can be properly enforced. For this reason, we should make the enforcement mechanisms provided for in the Bill compatible with those in section 27 of the Planning Act, 1976. Such a provision would add a third party right to seek enforcement of the enforcement rights given by this Bill to local authorities.</P>
    <P>This Bill should establish a clear presumption in favour of protection, preservation and conservation and it should oblige Ministers and local authorities to act on the basis of that presumption. To make sure this presumption is carried through, we must apply that same presumption to the framework within which An Bord Pleanála makes its decisions when it is called upon to do so. I will propose other measures in relation to An Bord Pleanála when we discuss the overall review of planning legislation later this year after the local elections, in spite of what the Minister for the Environment and Local Government has said.</P>
    <P>There is a lot of work to be done in relation to An Bord Pleanála. This Bill should specifically address the role of An Bord Pleanála in the con<Col N="329" /> text of the achievement of the objectives set out in this Bill. The matters dealt with in this Bill are important enough to merit separate legislation and special attention should be given to them in the riding instructions we give to An Bord Pleanála.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for certain obligations to be laid on the owners and occupiers of protected structures. We must pay detailed attention to the drafting of these provisions. It is clear that the owners and occupiers of protected structures have particular obligations to meet in the context of the objectives of this Bill. People who acquire or occupy such structures once this Bill is passed must be clear on the obligations they are <i>de facto</i> undertaking.</P>
    <P>The provision in the Bill which deals with declarations is useful. The Minister referred to provisions which deal with the interiors of buildings. Those two sets of provisions are important. It is good that if an owner or occupier of a building wishes to carry out work on the outside or the interior, he or she can ask the local authority for advice on what type of work will be acceptable within this Bill's framework. We are presuming local authorities will be in a position to give that type of advice. I will refer to this matter later because I am not happy with the provisions in that regard.</P>
    <P>There might be cases where the legitimate requirements flowing from this Bill, as set out and limited or defined in the declarations that will be given by the local authorities, will be onerous for such owners or occupiers. It provides that in those cases assistance may be given to the owners or occupiers. It further provides that where, for whatever reason, the necessary works cannot or will not be carried out, the local authority has the power to compulsorily purchase a protected structure.</P>
    <P>The intent of these provisions is fine but their execution is a different matter. The explanatory memorandum points out that the Government has agreed an allocation of £3.9 million for grant aid for the conservation of buildings, commencing in 1999. The Minister said it is £4 million but we will not argue about £100,000 because we have no means of knowing or judging how far that money will stretch. We could legitimately use a great deal more than that annually and still be faced with a substantial annual requirement stretching a considerable distance into the future.</P>
    <P>The interdepartmental working group suggested a provision of £10 million per annum, £5 million in the form of grants and £5 million in the form of tax incentives. This amount would cover 30,000 buildings per annum at £333 per building which, the group said, would be too small a sum. The Heritage Council recommends a minimum sum of £10 million per annum for grants alone. In the Bill the first provision for 1999 is £3.9 million. That indicates that these functions will be undertaken at a relaxed pace.</P>
    <P>Most local authorities do not have the personnel resources required to fulfil the obligations <Col N="330" /> that will be placed upon them by the Bill. According to the explanatory memorandum, the Government has agreed an allocation of £300,000 to the authorities for the employment of conservation officers to provide expert advice and guidance on their role in the protection of valuable structures. That is an inadequate provision. The document &ldquo;Strengthening the Architectural Heritage&rdquo; proposed the funding of a minimum of 40 conservation officers at an annual cost of £1.63 million. On that basis, the £300,000 provided by the Government would fund 7.3 conservation officers.</P>
    <P>The Minister said the £300,000 would permit the employment of 15 to 20 officers. How will it be possible to fund that number of officers at an average cost of £15,000 to £20,000 per officer?</P>

      <P>That is neat. If that covers the employment for only a portion of this year, the cost of employing 15 to 20 conservation officers would amount to several times the £300,000 being provided for. I hope provision will be made accordingly. However&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with co-funding later.</P>
      <P>Even the employment of 15 to 20 conservation officers compares badly with the interdepartmental working group's view that a minimum of 40 conservation officers is required. The Government produced a nice leaflet called &ldquo;Protecting our Architectural Heritage&rdquo; which is based on the report of the interdepartmental group but contains a watered down version of its key provisions, including the difference between 40 conservation officers recommended as a minimum by the group and the 15 to 20 mentioned by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The explanatory memorandum informs us that in the event of the planning authorities having to acquire compulsorily a protected structure they will be liable to pay compensation to any person who has a property interest in the structure. The amounts concerned will be met from the auth<Col N="331" /> ority's resources. That is either breathtaking optimism or an instance of culpable burying of heads in the sand.</P>
    <P>The Minister said the Government has ensured that the legislation is backed up with adequate resources, both in terms of financial assistance and conservation expertise, to enable it to work effectively. Clearly, that is not the case. That is an outrageous piece of puff on the part of the Government. The resources have not been allocated.</P>
    <P>The Minister proceeded to speak about the three pillars underpinning the legislation. Clearly, the pillar of wisdom is not one of them. He identified two of the three pillars as dedicated financial resources and the employment of adequate expertise and knowledge. The dedicated financial resources are inferior to the task at hand. There is no provision of financial resources to cover the eventuality that local authorities might compulsorily acquire buildings or provide grant aid under the Bill.</P>
    <P>It is simply not on for the Government to devolve and allocate functions to local authorities without giving them the support required to provide the personnel and other necessary resources to carry out the functions assigned to them. Any other course of action cannot be taken seriously and as long as that continues to be the case, as it is in the provisions made in this legislation, we can only treat the Bill as a statement of benign intent by the Government that will not have the effects it should have and which our architectural environment deserves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill can be described as post-colonial legislation. For a long period since independence, this country had an ambivalent attitude to much of its architectural heritage.</P>
      <P>It is worth reflecting on the vandalism and destruction which was inflicted on much of that heritage, particularly in the early years after independence. A mistaken view was taken by people, many of whom had good reason to resent the occupants of the big house. That resentment was taken out on the house rather than on the political and social system which produced the problems and inequalities which gave rise to the resentment in the first place. During those years a considerable portion of this island's architectural heritage was lost through the burning of large numbers of fine houses, the destruction of others and through neglect and dereliction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That kind of attitude towards the big house prevailed very much into modern times. It was particularly evident in the 1960s and 1970s when we went through a period of so-called modernism. Large parts of our architectural heritage around this city were destroyed in the name of modern development. Large parts of Georgian Dublin and of the architectural integrity of this and other cities were destroyed to make way for office blocks and tower buildings of one kind or another, which 20 or 30 years later are considered <Col N="332" /> by those who work in them as sick buildings and by those who have to look at them as buildings that should be taken down for aesthetic reasons.</P>
    <P>On this occasion we should pay tribute to the people who flew the flag for our architectural heritage over recent decades. This Bill is catching up on the public view on our architectural heritage, which on many occasions was not a popular position to take. Members of this House 30 years ago spoke in derisory terms about the belted earls and the pinks and other descriptions were attributed to that category. Students occupied buildings in Hume Street to protect them. An Taisce also played a role. People marched in this city only two decades ago on the issue of Wood Quay. In many cases they were derided by people in power &ndash; they were often derided by Members of this House.</P>
    <P>It is only through the efforts of those people, of organisations like An Taisce and the Irish Georgian Society and people who took an interest in our architectural heritage that we have managed, often in very hostile circumstances, to keep alive an appreciation of architectural heritage, its importance and the need to protect it and to do something about it. Many people, who may not belong to any organisation, often went out in the morning to protect a building which they considered important when they saw it about to be knocked by bulldozers in the so-called interests of progress and development. It is their efforts that have created an understanding and an appreciation of our architectural heritage which has led to the position of there being two Bills in this area before the Oireachtas. I refer to the Bill we are debating and the Bill from the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, which is complementary to it. To some extent these two Bills are only catching up on the public mood in relation to our architectural heritage and architectural matters.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill. As it progresses through the House discussion on it will be very much a Committee Stage one. A principle underlining this Bill is the need for legislation to provide better protection for our architectural heritage, there is no doubt about that. There is no dispute about the principles underlining the Bill or the thinking behind it. I pay tribute to my predecessor, Deputy Howlin, who was Minister for the Environment when the working group submitted its report which has provided the basis for this legislation.</P>
    <P>A great opportunity has been lost in this legislation. This Bill is very much a minimalist approach to the work that must be done. There are a number of weaknesses in the Bill which we will have an opportunity to address on Committee Stage, but which need to be examined in their totality at this stage.</P>
    <P>The idea behind this Bill is to give effect to the Granada Convention, which we have ratified. It was referred to in the report. There is some doubt as to whether this Bill will give full effect to that convention. An Taisce's submission, which was circulated, states that this Bill does not comply and so leaves Ireland open to reporting, under <Col N="333" /> Article 20 of the Granada Convention, by its committee of experts for failure to implement the principles embodied in the convention. That needs to be seriously considered in terms of whether this legislation enables us to fulfil our international obligations to protect our architectural heritage.</P>
    <P>Article 3 of the Granada Convention, which we have ratified, states that each party undertakes to take statutory measures to protect the architectural heritage within the framework of such measures and by means specific to each state or region to make provision for the protection of monuments, groups of buildings and sites. The question must be posed whether the Bill fulfils that objective. The term &ldquo;listing&rdquo; has now been replaced in the Bill. The Bill places ultimate responsibility for the listing of buildings with the local authorities, which are required to do that on foot of recommendations that will be made by the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands. They will be based on an inventory to be drawn up and subject to an enforcement regime that is defective, to which Deputy Dukes referred.</P>
    <P>We must review the listing of buildings by local authorities. Under the 1963 and 1976 Planning Acts there are considerable powers in relation to the listing of buildings and the protection of architectural heritage, but those powers were not exercised. Until recent years many local authorities did not list buildings and where they were listed the list was not complete. Even where local authorities had done considerable listing, subsequent enforcement was defective. It is estimated that local authorities have listed only about half the buildings of architectural merit which would justify listing.</P>
    <P>This legislation proposes that responsibility for the listing of buildings will remain with local authorities. The only obligation placed on them by this legislation is that they must take account of recommendations made by the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands. There is no obligation on a local authority to implement a recommendation. Local authorities can ignore recommendations. They can send back a response to the Minister explaining why they have not listed a building as recommended. Where buildings or structures are identified for national reasons as justifying protection, a mechanism must be put in place to ensure they are listed. That is notwithstanding any view taken by a local authority that there should be some overriding provision whereby that can be done. In the existing legislative arrangement there is such an overriding provision. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government has power under existing legislation to require a local authority to list individual buildings, but I am informed that power has never been exercised.</P>
    <P>There is no reason to believe the powers will be exercised because they are being transferred to the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands. Many of the organisations <Col N="334" /> interested in this legislation have suggested that, rather than leave it to the Minister to recommend something to be implemented by the local authority, there should be an independent national body which would have responsibility for deciding which buildings are to be listed and which structures are to be protected, to deal with areas where there is a conflict between the local authority and the Minister, or when the priority given to the protection of our architectural heritage is not as great.</P>
    <P>The basis for the protection of buildings will be in accordance with the inventory. We come again to the matter of resources. The inventory, based on the availability of money, will take between 12 and 25 years to complete. What will happen in the intervening period if local authorities are waiting for the recommendation to come from the Minister and the Minister is waiting for the inventory to be completed? There will be an <i>interregnum</i> where buildings which should be protected are not protected because they have not been listed in the inventory and the resources to include them do not exist. They will not be recommended by the Minister and the local authority will feel it can ignore them. That is a serious gap in the provisions.</P>
    <P>Some attention will have to be given to a definition of buildings which deserve to be protected being included in the Bill. An Taisce has suggested that all buildings or structures with special artistic, cultural, architectural, archaeological or historical interest, historical associations, age, which use innovative technology or are of unique value should be listed. The Irish Georgian Society has also made some recommendations while Comhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge has made a case that consideration should be given to linguistic matters in the protection of buildings &ndash; in particular the need to protect the Irish language in the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>The Irish Planning Institute has drawn attention to two areas which raise questions of resourcing. It asked how practical a single list will be with the resources available and drew attention to the inclusion of the interiors of buildings for protection. The inclusion of interiors on a blanket basis is an understandable question in regard to the institute's professional experience of what happens throughout the planning system.</P>
    <P>We will have good legislation, and there is no doubt about the aspirations behind this legislation, but it will not protect our architectural heritage if there are not sufficient resources. I agree with Deputy Dukes about the amount of money available. The Minister told us that £4 million will be available in a year for the implementation of this legislation. That is not enough. If one compares this with the considerable resources available through urban renewal schemes and incentives for new development, £4 million is a small amount of money when it is spread throughout the State and across all types of buildings which may need assistance.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="335" /> The amount of money available for the employment of conservation officers is pathetic. Perhaps the Minister intends to employ the conservation officers on a community employment scheme. Unless he does so, he will not be able to employ 15 or 20 conservation officers with a budget of £300,000. That number of conservation officers will not be able to enforce this legislation anyway. That is not even an individual officer per local authority. It will mean that two or three local authorities will have to share a conservation officer. When one considers the wide area, the number of buildings which need to be protected and the amount of work which this legislation will impose on conservation officers, that will not be practical. The report on which this Bill is based recommended that there should be 40 conservation officers. Even that is being cautious.</P>
    <P>We have experience in this State of legislation being passed and handed to local authorities without the resources and professional backup necessary to implement it. This Bill will fail and the aspirations of the Minister will fail unless the necessary resources and staff are provided to give it the strength it requires.</P>
    <P>The proposed penalties will test the effectiveness of the Bill. They sound impressive &ndash; there will be fines on indictment of up to £1 million for serious breaches of this legislation. If, however, someone comes along and destroys an important architectural structure, what is the worst that can happen? He could get the wrong judge on a bad day and get the maximum fine of £1 million. As we know from experience, maximum fines are rarely imposed. The largest fine which can be imposed under this legislation is £1 million. I can think of many examples where it might be worth the while of the developer to demolish a building or architectural structure and run the risk of the anger of the judge who will eventually have to be faced under the terms of this legislation.</P>
    <P>There are a number of questionable defences provided for in the legislation. As we know from our experience of existing law on the protection of buildings, there is a range of reasons which can be offered to justify the destruction of a building, ranging from safety; with which nobody will disagree although we all have to doubt whether buildings were unsafe at the time of their demolition; to people claiming some exceptional economic, environmental, or developmental reason.</P>
    <P>In some cases, a £1 million fine will not be a great deterrent in preventing the destruction of a building, if, for example, the value of the site when it is cleared of the structure, is worth more than £1 million or where the value of the time lost to the developer or the cost of legal fees is in excess of that. The legislation needs to provide a process whereby, if damage is done to an architectural structure or if, in the worst case scenario, a building is demolished or destroyed, there is an obligation on the person who commits that offence to make good the damage in some way. <Col N="336" /> There needs to be a means of recovery other than a fine which may not be a deterrent at all.</P>
    <P>The legislation in terms of its aspirations is fine; we all want to protect our architectural heritage. I agree that we need a single Act which underpins that and a single listing system for buildings. I agree the interiors of buildings need to be encompassed in the protected category of buildings. There is probably scope for extending the range of structures covered by this legislation. For example, Deputy Dukes referred to vernacular buildings and structures built prior to 1870; that case has been made by a number of organisations and we can usefully pursue it on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>However, I am concerned that the practical mechanisms provided for in this legislation for the protection of buildings may not work; they are effectively giving to the same authorities who mainly have not been successful in protecting buildings under the existing regime, the same responsibility, under basically the same remit. The powers of the Minister are purely recommendatory and there is no evidence from past experience that Ministers exercise a great deal of authority in the protection of buildings.</P>
    <P>An independent body has not been provided for, which was called for by a number of organisations and anticipated in the report on which this legislation is based. Insufficient resources are being provided in terms of money and grants and not enough conservation officers are being provided for in the legislation, as regards the money referred to in the explanatory memorandum. Unfortunately, the penalties provided for in this legislation, while they may sound impressive, ultimately will not be sufficient to act as a deterrent, where, for reasons of profit or greed, someone is determined to demolish a structure which is of importance. I will support the Bill on Second Stage but I intend to table a range of amendments on Committee Stage because this Bill needs to be strengthened considerably.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill. Deputy Gilmore spoke about the vandalism perpetrated on historical buildings over many decades. This Bill provides for that and is a sign of our maturity. It is long overdue and welcomed by everybody. I would prefer to look forward rather than backward on that issue. Deputy Gilmore referred to the penalties. Section 40 states that a person guilty of an offence under that section shall be liable, on conviction or indictment, to a fine not exceeding £1 million, together with, in the case of a continuing offence, a fine not exceeding £10,000 for every day on which the offence is continued &ndash; that could be up to £300,000 per month, in addition to the £1 million &ndash; or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years. This is a necessary deterrent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fleming</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to amend and extend the Local Government (Planning and Development) Acts, 1963 to 1968, to provide for greater protection of buildings and structures of special architectural, historical, archaeological, artistic, scientific, social and technical interest. Some protection has been provided under the various planning Bills to date through the process of listing them in the local authority development plan. The 1976 Planning and Development Acts extended the listing process to interior fixtures and features when they were specified in the development plan. Allied with the legislation to protect national monuments, this affords major protection to much of the built heritage around the country.</P>
      <P>In recent years there has been a significant heightening of public awareness of the value of conserving our built environment. In that context, it has become clear that the current protection of our built heritage under the Planning and Development Acts is not sufficient. The programme for Government contained a commitment to introduce conservation legislation to protect and enhance our built environment. This legislation is part of that process.</P>
      <P>I will summarise the main provisions of the Bill. It will place a clear obligation on all planning authorities to create a record of protected structures as part of their development plans. It will also ensure that where a structure is protected, the whole structure, interior and curtilage, will be subject to that protection. All works which will affect the character of a protected structure will require planning permission. However, owners and occupiers will be entitled to a declaration, in effect a guidance document, from the local authority, which will inform them of which works on their building will be considered as affecting its character.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Buildings may be added to the record of protected structures at any time, independently of the statutory five year development plan which is drawn up by each local authority. The Bill will place an obligation on the owners and occupiers of protected structures to ensure they do not become endangered. Planning authorities will also be able to take action, direct and indirect, to ensure protected structures do not become neglected. Planning authorities will also be enabled to require works to be undertaken to restore the character of protected buildings. The planning authority will have to pay for such works where the offending alterations were effectively carried out with the approval, through the granting of planning permission, of the said local authority. Planning authorities will be able to compulsorily <Col N="338" /> acquire a protected structure where it is necessary to protect it.</P>
    <P>The Bill also gives recognition to the protection of townscapes and streetscapes in a local authority development plan. This means a street, square or cul-de-sac which has some architectural significance can be protected. The buildings currently listed in development plans will automatically become protected buildings under this Bill, but the owners and occupiers will have to be consulted. When a local authority considers issuing a dangerous building notice in respect of a protected building, it will have to consider the protected nature of that building and will be obliged to preserve as much of the building as is safely possible.</P>
    <P>This legislation is part of the Government's overall package to deal with conservation and archeological protection. The Architectural Heritage (National Inventory) and Historic Monuments (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 1998, has passed through the Seanad and will come before the Dáil in the near future. There is a case for that Bill to be combined with this one. Both Bills deal with the same issue. The Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands and the Minister for the Environment and Local Government referred to each other's roles and responsibilities in the Seanad debates on these Bills. The explanatory memoranda are also cross-referenced, and the Minister for the Environment and Local Government said that he might have to look at a consolidated planning Bill in the future. That was an implicit acknowledgement of the need to bring these Bills together, though I do not know if he can do so now. I suggest he consider it seriously, as there is nothing more difficult than for local authorities to have to implement two different Acts which deal with the same topic.</P>
    <P>There are three elements in this Bill which include to put conservation on a legislative footing and to provide finance and expertise. There has been much debate about the level of finance being provided, but that is slightly disingenuous, as £300,000 is provided this year for the employment of officers under this Bill. As we are well into the year, this will not be the allocation necessary for a full year and next year's Estimates will have a full year's Estimate included.</P>
    <P>In the past buildings were referred to as &ldquo;listed buildings&rdquo;, and they are now to be called &ldquo;protected buildings&rdquo;. That is an important distinction that should be highlighted, as should the reference to a &ldquo;structure&rdquo;, because it is important that people know what we are talking about when discussing the Bill. The Bill states:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;structure&rdquo; has the same meaning as in the Principal Act but includes&ndash;</P>
    <P>(a) the interior of the structure,</P>
    <P>This has been mentioned by all speakers as being extremely necessary. Paragraph (b) refers to &ldquo;the land lying within the curtilage of the structure,&rdquo;. <Col N="339" /> One has to agree with this. In the case of fine big old houses, the ornaments, fountains and waterfalls that are part of the gardens and curtilage should also be protected. The Bill also refers to:</P>
    <P>(c) any other structures lying within that curtilage and their interiors, and</P>
    <P>(d) all fixtures and features which form part of the interior or exterior of any structure or structures referred to in paragraph (a) or (c);</P>
    <P>Everyone agrees that is a good broad definition. It is not enough just to protect the basic physical structure, one must also look at the curtilage and monuments outside the walls of the house.</P>
    <P>There is also a major change in this legislation in the move away from references in previous Planning Acts to &ldquo;listed&rdquo; buildings to &ldquo;protected&rdquo; buildings. This Bill refers to:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;protection&rdquo; in relation to a structure, or part of a structure, includes conservation, preservation and improvement compatible with maintaining the character and interest of the structure or part;</P>
    <P>This is very important and is a major strengthening of our approach to this matter. Up to this point we were putting buildings on a list, but we were doing very little with that list. Now there is a clear onus on the protected list and on protecting these buildings in future.</P>
    <P>Although the definitions in the Act are very comprehensive, I seek clarification from the Minister on some issues. He might include the geological aspect of our heritage, for example, and the protection of various species of animals or plants. There are also old burial grounds covered by grass. Archaeologists are aware of their existence, but are they covered by this definition?</P>
    <P>Dúchas will have a major role under this Bill, as will the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands. The crossover of the two Bills is important in this regard. The Architectural Heritage (National Inventory) and Historic Monuments (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 1998, includes a definition of architectural heritage as structures and buildings, together with their settings, grounds, fixtures and fittings, groups of such structures and buildings and sites which are of architectural, historical, archaeological, artistic, scientific or technical interest. The similarity between this definition and that of the Granada Convention has been mentioned.</P>
    <P>It is also important that the Bill provides for the establishment on a statutory basis of a national inventory of architectural heritage. That is being done on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis without a legal format, and it is good that this will be put on a statutory basis and incorporated into the list that will be sent by the Minister to local authorities <Col N="340" /> for inclusion in their lists of protected buildings. Both Departments should co-operate closely on the implementation of these two Bills.</P>
    <P>There is an anomaly in the area of fines. We have mentioned the fines of up to £1 million and the jail sentences, but the Architectural Heritage (National Inventory) and Historic Monuments (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 1998, refers to fines and the matter of a person restricting the access of an authorised officer to inspect a private dwelling who has a warrant from a district court. There is a fine of £1,500 on summary conviction, which I consider totally out of place with the £1 million fine in the other Bill. There is no point in having a fine of £1 million if something is done incorrectly when there is a fine of £1,500 for preventing the authorised officer from coming in to get access to basic information. That £1,500 fine should be revisited.</P>
    <P>I will raise other concerns on Committee Stage, notwithstanding my overall support for the Act. Under section 10 a local authority can serve a notice on the owner or occupier of a house to take remedial action if it is becoming dangerous. The Bill later states that no planning permission is required for a notice to be issued under the Act. I question the approach of issuing orders and undertaking work on protected buildings without some planning process. There should be some consistency of approach here. I do not believe an order should be exempt from the planning process just because an order is issued under one section of this Act.</P>
    <P>Owners have a duty not to undertake any action which will endanger a protected building and not to neglect such a building. I welcome the fact that inaction will be deemed an offence as well. Will negligence have to be proved if a protected building is damaged? There was a fire in County Laois, in De Vesci House, and the owners spent £4 million renovating it. It was a major source of distress to the owner that this protected building was damaged. I seek clarification on the legal obligations when negligence is involved.</P>
    <P>The Bill refers to churches and places of worship. It has been a tragedy over the years to see the number of false ceilings in office blocks and churches which previously had high ceilings. False ceilings are installed to make them cheaper to heat, but that covers up the fine architecture, which is a tragedy.</P>

      <P>The latest tender procedure for the development of a National Conference Centre in Dublin, with EU assistance of up to 33 million ecu under the Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-1999, was organised by Bord Fáilte under the direction of the Independent Management Board for Product Development, and advertised in 1997.</P>
      <P>The procedure was conducted under the terms of EU Council Directive 93/37/EEC and Bord Fáilte-led evaluation teams undertook detailed assessments of full tender submissions which were received from five consortia. The management board concluded that the tenders submitted were not such as to enable it to make a recommendation and the process then proceeded in April 1998 to the 'negotiated procedure' stage provided for in Article 7 of the EU directive. This was conducted by an independent team of technical experts, specially appointed for the purpose by Bord Fáilte. On consideration of its findings, and following a positive recommendation by the board of Bord Fáilte, the management board decided on the proposal submitted by Spencer Dock International Convention Centre Limited to develop the project at a site in Dublin docklands.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the operational programme, decisions on grant applications in respect of amounts at or above 15 million ecu &ndash; productive investments &ndash; must be made with the agreement of the Government and the EU Commission on foot of a cost benefit analysis conducted in accordance with Community law. This cost benefit analysis, which was favourable towards the project, was undertaken by independent consultants and on 16 September 1998 the Government agreed to the making of a submission to the EU Commission recommending formal approval for a 33 million ecu grant towards the cost of developing the project. The final decision of the Commission, which is also concluding its examination of a complaint lodged with it on the tender procedures under the public procurement process, is awaited. All queries subsequently raised by the Commission have been responded to through correspondence and meetings between Bord Fáilte, the management board and Commission officials.</P>

If so, surely his curiosity would have aroused him to make inquiries and get information on the impact of this threat to the project. As Minister with responsibility for tourism and sport he would have his own opinion on the future of this project. He cannot bury his head in the sand and ignore the risks confronting the project.

I met with the developers, Treasury Holdings, in my office on that issue and I explained to the Minister their fears about tax concessions. From day one I have backed this project. The matter was off the rails when I came to office 18 months ago. We are further down the tracks now than in the past eight years. This is the third attempt to get a conference centre. The Deputy and my predecessor support the conference centre. We learned from the mistakes of previous Governments and were able to overcome some of those mistakes. I am totally committed to this project and will do everything possible to ensure Ireland has a conference centre. Dublin is the only city in Europe which does not have such a centre. While I have raised my concerns and listened to all involved, the matter of tax relief and the newspaper article cause concern.</P>

      <P>The various options for the future funding of tourism destination marketing were set out in detail in my Department's discussion paper, &ldquo;Strategy for Tourism in the Context of EU Structural Funding 2000-2006&rdquo;. In that paper it was proposed that a tourism marketing fund would be established and it was suggested this could be financed through a combination of financing from the EU, the industry and the State, with an enhanced level of partnership between the key players.</P>
      <P>Since the preparation of this document last year, my Department has been engaged in a consultation process with the industry, through the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation (ITIC) who examined funding and institutional options in their planning document entitled &ldquo;Strategy for Growth beyond 2000&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I share the industry's objective of ensuring that a substantial marketing fund for Irish tourism will be in place for the new millennium. Ireland's performance in a growing but hugely competitive international marketplace has been excellent over the past decade with ambitious targets for foreign earnings and for visitor numbers consistently being achieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under two EU co-funded operational programmes for tourism, covering the period 1989-99, the State, in partnership with the industry, has <Col N="344" /> made excellent use of Structural Funds in marketing Ireland as a tourism destination abroad. My Department is making a strong and persuasive case for continued EU funding under the next round. However, the outcome of negotiations on future structural funding for Ireland and the subsequent allocation of that funding between individual economic sectors, will not be known for some time yet.</P>
    <P>Given the uncertainty over, and timing of, decisions on future EU funding, the introduction of a modest visitor levy is one of the options being considered by my Department in consultation with ITIC, as a possible mechanism to contribute to the future financing of tourism marketing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister seems to be approaching the negotiations regarding EU funding in a very defeatist way. He is looking at a doomsday situation of introducing a tourist access tax to fund the marketing programme. If we assume he is introducing a £3 per tourist access tax, what will be the take on that? Will the take from that tax be ringfenced as suggested by tourism interests? Is the Minister aware of the strong reservations of Ryanair, Aer Lingus and the representative bodies of tourism interests in this country about the tourist tax?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not taking a defeatist attitude in this matter. Like every other sector we are pursuing our case for EU funding. However, as the Deputy will be aware, we are also realists. We understand there will be a drop in EU funding and we might as well accept that. We are, however, at the top of the European league with regard to marketing and tourism figures. We have 5.3 million people coming in and I am determined to ensure this country remains at the top of the European league.</P>
      <P>Huge competition is developing on our doorstep. Scotland is now talking about devolution which means that the Scottish will be focusing on themselves. They are a problem next door to us, in tourism terms. Scotland is a huge sleeping giant. In addition, the Far East is beckoning for many other countries, so there is huge competition. Two weeks ago I was in Milan where I spoke to some major hotel groups. For example, the Shangri-La group told me it has 39 hotels worldwide, 15 of which are in China. Therefore, one can see the competition that will develop there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Both the Government and the tourism industry realise we will have to have a tourism marketing fund, which we have agreed upon, to keep this country to the fore. We have also agreed that the figure for the fund should be in the region of £20 million over a period of five years. That would be an ideal figure to keep us at the top of the league. How we will raise that funding is a matter that is currently under discussion. I suggested a small, modest visitor levy should be the way forward. It is all a matter of supply and demand. Through <Col N="345" /> our marketing achievements we can create the demand for people to visit here. The modest fee I am talking about would yield approximately £17 or £18 million in the initial years, and would probably increase to more than £23 or £24 million in years to come, thus averaging out at £20 million per year over five years.</P>
    <P>As regards the Deputy's second question, one cannot ringfence anything. We should create a fund of £20 million a year over the next five years, as the industry has suggested. That is what I am trying to do and this would be a way of contributing to it.</P>
    <P>We must confront the reality that we are facing huge competition. In the year 2006 we expect 8 million people to visit the country, which will be worth £4.5 billion to the economy. If we achieve those targets it will make tourism the number one industry. It is well worth looking after this industry and we must do so. I assure the Deputy and the House that I will not make any decisions without the backing and co-operation of the industry.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree there is a serious contradiction in his statement? He said we have to be competitive and are facing major competition from areas such as Scotland and the Far East, yet in the next breath he said we must introduce a tourist tax to market Ireland effectively. Does he agree that any tourist tax will make this country less competitive? The Minister quoted figures concerning the take from tourism, which are trotted out on a monthly basis. Since there is a £1.1 billion tax take from tourism, which shortly will be our largest industry, surely the Government should provide £20 million for the marketing drive without killing the goose that lays the golden egg by making the industry less competitive <i>vis-à-vis</i> our competitors. Will the Minister agree that he will not get agreement from tourism interests unless there is guaranteed ringfencing of the revenue take? </P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>Those matters are the subject of constant discussion between me and the industry. I will only come to Cabinet if the proposals are acceptable to the industry and when I have its backing. With regard to the £1.1 billion figure, there is a huge input to the Exchequer from tourism which is a net contributor. We need all that revenue to aid other Departments. We must pay for health, the environment and education. That is why we garner revenue. All those within the industry &ndash; including hoteliers, publicans and tour operators &ndash; benefit from spending on education, health, the environment, sewerage and water services. They benefit across the board as a result of being net contributors to the Exchequer and, from that point of view, they are beneficiaries in any event. We are the only country in Europe that does not have such a levy. In Austria they charge £8, in Belgium £10, in Denmark £7.80, in Finland £7.30, in France £7.70, in Germany £3, in Greece £14, in Italy £3.20, in Norway £12.20, in <Col N="346" /> Portugal £7.80, in Spain £4, in Sweden £10 and last year they introduced a £10 sterling charge on anyone who moves anywhere in the UK. We, a small nation on a small island in the middle of the Atlantic, are the only country in Europe without such a levy. I do not believe a modest levy of this nature would cause a problem to incoming tourists, particularly in the way it will be brought about. It will have the opposite effect. I want to ensure the industry has a say in the matter I do not want to be heavy handed. I would like the industry, in accordance with the Little report, to take an active role in the matter. I do not see the necessity for the State to be deeply involved in this area. Those in the industry know their business and we need only set up the fund and ensure there are adequate funds.</P>
      <P>If we set up such a fund it will put this country's industry on a firm basis to face all competition in the next five years.</P>

      <P>The Minister trotted out the departmental propaganda on tourist tax rates in Europe but conveniently ignored the fact that Ireland has one of the highest VAT rates in Europe and is the only island member state without a land link to Europe, since Britain has rail access to Europe. Is it not ironic at a time when we are trying to support agriculture in every way &ndash; at the recent agriculture Ministers' negotiations &ndash; that we are attempting to kill by taxation our second largest industry, soon to be our largest if we treat it properly? Would the Minister agree that is a major contradiction?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>The international carding scheme, which I launched in 1998, provides a range of supports, both financial and non-financial, to assist Ireland's high performance players and athletes to perform at the highest levels of international sport. Qualification for the scheme is based on sports specific criteria which have been agreed with the relevant national governing bodies of sport. Application forms for funding under the scheme are forwarded by the relevant national governing bodies to individuals who in their knowledge, may meet the qualifying criteria for the sport, and returned to my Department for processing and final decision.</P>
      <P>I understand the person referred to by the Deputy is a swimmer. Sports specific criteria for swimming have still to be developed under the carding scheme. The AGM of the Swimming Association took place on 24 January 1999 when the IASA, the previous governing body for the sport, was disbanded and a new swimming body, Swim Ireland, was formally established, I understand that certain progress has been made and a further general meeting of the organisation is planned for April next, when a new executive is due to be voted in and appointed. I have stressed to the new body that as soon as the wider membership have expressed their satisfaction that appropriate steps have been taken to address the issues highlighted by the Murphy report on the incidence of child sexual abuse in swimming, I will be in a position to restore funding to the organisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the interim, having regard to the situation of individual swimmers, I have agreed that the Irish Sports Council will commence preparatory work <Col N="348" /> on developing sports specific criteria for swimming in the context that the sport may be included in the 1999 carding scheme. This provides a mechanism whereby, in the event that funding is restored, there should be no delay in awarding funding to individual swimmers who qualify for inclusion in the scheme by reference to the sports specific criteria as developed.</P>
    <P>The person referred to by the Deputy should keep in touch with Swim Ireland and in another reply to the House today I have encouraged all members of the new body, constituent clubs, and affiliates to participate wholeheartedly in the preparations for, and the conduct of, the upcoming AGM to ensure confidence in the organisation of the sport is restored.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree an elite swimmer, referred to in the question, is effectively penalised for the mismanagement and totally unacceptable behaviour of those involved in the sport in the past? Will funding be restored to the elite swimmers themselves or will they have to wait until Swim Ireland is effectively up and running? Will the Minister ensure the guidelines for funding of elite swimmers will be restored on an equitable basis so that each one on the team will be able to benefit from funding? At present swimmers have to fund from their own resources training trips to Arizona and England. Does the Minister consider this acceptable when they are under enormous strain and expectations are put on them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to see a new beginning for Swim Ireland and a new generation of leaders in swimming. The Deputy must understand that it is impossible for me to distinguish between the elite swimmers and the children. I refuse to fractionalise so that I would be seen to look after the elite and not the younger swimmers.</P>
      <P>Organisations are made up of individuals and it is up to the individuals to put their houses in order and as soon as I am satisfied that children's safety is looked after I will be in a position to restore funding to the organisation. We tend to forget what happened, there was horrific child sexual abuse and it was happening in the schools. I do not want to hold back funding for a particular swimmer, but it is up to the organisation to put its house in order. Swim Ireland will hold its AGM in April. I want each club to encourage people to allow their names go forward for positions. Membership of clubs is not confined to children, parents can join, pay a fee of £5 or £10 a year and go as a delegate to the AGM. If parents are interested in their children, they can go as delegates to the AGM and exercise their democratic rights. That is why I want to see a new beginning and a new generation becoming involved in Swim Ireland but that is a matter for the organisation, I cannot become involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the swimmer mentioned by the <Col N="349" /> Deputy, I want to be able to restore funding to all areas of swimming as soon as possible. As regards the carding system which did not include swimming, I have asked the Sports Council of Ireland to draw up the criteria under which these swimmers will qualify for it. I introduced this system last year. The grant provided depends on an athlete's world ranking. We have the best carding system in Europe and Irish athletes get higher grants than those from any other European country. If an athlete is ranked between first and third in the world he or she receives the full grant, which is £25,000. The payments are graduated through to juveniles and people with disabilities. When the organisation is set up the person mentioned can apply for funding through it. There is a scale of payments so she should know how much she would receive, based on her world ranking. If the organisation puts itself in order, I assure the Deputy that the payments will be retrospective.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Will there be an equitable distribution among the top swimmers in the team? Each makes the same journey and has the same expenditure. In advance of Swim Ireland qualifying for the scheme, does the Minister favour a policy similar to that in other countries, under which elite athletes and swimmers are given credit for their sporting attainments and are able to go to university in their own country? In Ireland they must choose between their sport and their studies but that does not happen in the North or the US. Will he consider working with his colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, to ensure top athletes are given credit for the time and effort put into their sport?</P>

      <P>If a national organisation intends to enter a team in an international competition, it submits its plan for the year to the Sports Council in January of that year, and that plan includes the cost of the team's participation. The carding system applies to individual athletes. The team may be made up of four people with different places in the world ranking who would receive different levels of grant aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about the grants they receive. I agree there should be equity. As regards the education system, I would like to see what the Deputy suggests and I am sure I could discuss that matter with the Minister for Education and Science. We had a problem heretofore in that we did not have training facilities for elite athletes. I hope the 50 metre pool will be built soon and preparations are advanced but as the Deputy is aware the matter is before the courts and, consequently, progress is stalled. I understand the next court hearing is on 12 May. Our swimmers have to develop in their teens and I hope we can provide a 50 metre pool to facilitate <Col N="350" /> their training and education in Ireland, so that they do not have to go abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has all-party support in stamping out the evil of sex abuse in sport, in this case, swimming. However, does he not think the decision to deny funding to top class athletes over the last 12 months was a serious error of judgment? With hindsight, does he not agree he should have accepted the suggestion, put forward by myself and others, that he should have continued to fund those athletes through the Sports Council of Ireland while the swimming body was being re-organised? Is he aware that his failure to fund these athletes has jeopardised their preparation for the Sydney Olympics and affected their performance at events across the world, and that some athletes have been forced to sleep on floors and stay in hostels because he terminated their funding?</P>
      <P>The Minister expressed equal concern for funding young people as for funding top class athletes. Can he reconcile that statement with his Department's refusal to fund the Irish Schools' Swimming Association's quadrangular international tournament?</P>

    <P>There is already in place an extensive system of registration and listing of guest accommodation in accordance with standards set by Bord Fáilte. One of Bord Fáilte's functions is the registration of certain types of tourist accommodation such as hotels, guesthouses, holiday cottages, holiday apartments and holiday hostels. Arising from the implementation of the recommendations of the review of Bord Fáilte carried out by consultants A. D. Little Limited, in 1994, the inspection activities associated with these functions were contracted to a third party, Tourism Quality Services Limited. In addition, Bord Fáilte's system of approval for listing accommo<Col N="353" /> dation in the bed and breakfast sector was also out-sourced to industry associations formally recognised by Bord Fáilte as self-regulatory bodies, on the basis that they apply Bord Fáilte agreed standards.</P>
    <P>The issue of compulsory licensing of all tourist accommodation has been examined by successive Administrations and they have all reached the same conclusion that any compulsory system, in order to be effective, would require a significant diversion of resources currently devoted to the development of tourism towards administration and policing. This would be particularly burdensome because many accommodation providers only operate for short periods of the year.</P>
    <P>In recent years there has been a substantial increase in the volume and range of tourist accommodation which has enhanced the choice available to tourists and allows market forces to weed out accommodation which is not of a sufficiently high standard to meet tourist requirements. In light of developments in the supply of accommodation, I share the view of my predecessors that the introduction of a compulsory licensing system would be an inappropriate use of resources. There is no evidence to support the view that such a system would have any appreciable impact on accommodation standards over and above that brought about by market forces.</P>
    <P>In this context, it should be noted that all providers of accommodation for tourists are obliged, whether approved or unapproved, to comply with official requirements in areas such as taxation, planning, fire and safety and hygiene. In the past year, I have written to my ministerial colleagues with responsibility in these areas asking them to ensure that there are no advantages for unapproved operators in the application of the law.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile, Bord Fáilte and the recognised approving bodies will continue to encourage all operators to seek approved status by highlighting, in particular, the benefits to be gained, including access to official marketing through Bord Fáilte and the tourist office network and access to special support schemes, such as tax incentives, which are available only to the approved sector. As part of this process, I recently announced a major new initiative by Bord Fáilte to help small accommodation providers. It is proposed to undertake a fundamental review of how the various groups in this category are branded and marketed overseas. Part of this process will involve the appointment of a project executive and a steering committee, who will undertake market research and then develop and implement a marketing plan. I am confident that this initiative will result in a long-term marketing plan for smaller tourism accommodation providers being put in place. Resources totalling £300,000 have been set aside to support this initiative in 1999.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to comment on the licensing arrangements for bed and breakfast accommodation in Northern Ireland. The marketing of Ireland on an all-island basis as a tourist desti<Col N="354" /> nation is part of the ongoing cross-Border co-operation and partnership which exists at departmental, agency and industry level in the tourism area.</P>
    <P>Co-operation at agency level between Bord Failte and the Northern Ireland Tourist Board has existed since the 1960s and has been considerably strengthened and facilitated in recent years by the availability of financial assistance for marketing, training and product development from the European Union and the International Fund for Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Overseas Tourism Marketing Initiative, which operates on an all-island basis, brings together Bord Fáilte, the NITB and industry representatives North and South in a £7 million EU co-funded annual consumer tourism marketing programme in the US, Britain, France and Germany. My Department and the Northern Ireland Department of Economic Development are also engaged in the joint administration of tourism elements of the INTERREG, Peace and Reconciliation and International Fund for Ireland programmes and marketing of the Shannon-Erne waterway.</P>
    <P>Inevitably there are many differences between State supports and other arrangements in place for the tourism industry North and South. However, these differences do not hamper co-operation in relation to tourism marketing of Ireland on an all-island basis.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to licensing and standards in the unapproved sector, the accommodation sector has grown by 15 per cent during the past 12 months. There is major competition in the sector and the market is dictating developments. It is <Col N="355" /> interesting &ndash; I do not intend to be derogatory to any sector by saying this &ndash; more complaints are made in respect of the licensed sector than the unlicensed sector. I remind the Deputy that one dissatisfied customer can do more damage than 20 satisfied customers. Ninety per cent of dissatisfied customers will not return.</P>

      <P>How many unregistered bed and breakfast establishments are there in the country? What is the position in other European countries with regard to premises which open their doors to guests? The Minister indicated that the number of complaints about unregistered premises is far lower than that for registered premises. Does he agree that many of them relate not to the standard of the premises but, as indicated in a recent article, to the lack of friendliness? Is it his intention to direct unregistered bed and breakfast establishments to register with Bord Failte or one of the other organisations involved? Are they still free to put up a sign and keep guests?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>Success breeds complacency. I agree that, in general, complaints do not relate to the standard of accommodation provided in bed and breakfast establishments or hotels but to the inclination to take visitors for granted. Ninety per cent of dissatisfied visitors will not return. It is the wish of many visitors who stay in bed and breakfast establishments to mingle with the family in an Irish atmosphere but this is no longer possible in many instances because of the increase in standards.</P>
      <P>I do not have the information sought on the approximate number of unregistered bed and breakfast establishments but will obtain it for the Deputy, if she so wishes. There is no point in introducing a licensing system if one is not in a position to police it. This would require huge resources which would have to be diverted from other areas.</P>
      <P>I encourage unregistered premises to register because of the benefits that would accrue. I intend to pursue certain ideas. I will not allow unregistered premises to avail of benefits introduced in future budgets willy nilly. They will have to be registered for a certain number of years.</P>

      <P>The Minister is unable to give a breakdown. The informed opinion within the industry is that there are as many unregistered guesthouses as there are registered. The Minister appears complacent in his attitude to standards. He referred in a flippant way to the mattress inspectors of Bord Failte and the need for resources. The issue of fragmentation in the organisations which deal with the industry must be addressed. The principle appears to be that if it is everybody's business, it is nobody's business. How does the Minister envisage the industry being managed? There is no co-ordination of the efforts of Bord Fáilte, the regional tourism organisations, Leader groups, partnership companies and local authorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to see incentives for bed and breakfasts. However, a 15 per cent explosion in the level of accommodation means that increasing numbers are becoming involved in the sector. Their incentive is the realisation of the potential of the country as a tourism destination. Grant aid was provided previously in terms of room extensions, etc. but it was abused when, a couple of years after the payment of grants, signs were removed. It is difficult to give grant aid assistance in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand the problems in the bed and breakfast, farmhouse and self-catering sectors. They lost out because of the absence of a proper marketing fund. That is why last month I initiated a £300,000 marketing fund for overseas, especially Europe. We can benefit from the congestion in <Col N="357" /> Europe. I have said that people in Milan, Berlin and France do not want to travel to cities; they want to get away from it all. I am trying to sell Ireland as the antidote to European stress.</P>

      <P>According to Bord Fáilte's last survey of visits to tourism attractions, carried out in 1996 and published in <i>Perspectives on Irish Tourism &ndash; Visits to Tourists Attractions,</i> the top ten tourist attractions for that year were: The National Gallery of Ireland, the Book of Kells, Dublin Zoo, Bunratty Castle and Folk Park, the National Museum of Ireland, the Hugh Lane Gallery, the Irish Museum of Modern Art, the Guinness Hopstore, Muckross House and Gardens and Waterford Crystal Visitor Centre.

      <P>According to the latest figures from Bord Fáilte, the revenue created by overseas visitors by county indicate a great disparity. Setting aside Counties Dublin, Cork and Galway, south Kerry would be in fourth place at £111 million. This slides downwards to the bottom of the scale, which is west Offaly at £4 million. It appears tourists are drawn to centres of attraction. If the same disparity in results arose in job creation or in any other economic area there would be an outcry. While the lakes of Killarney cannot be moved to west Offaly, would the Minister agree to look at the counties that do not benefit to the same extent as others with a view to identifying a location or project in them which may become a focal point for visitors?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy. The words US citizens most frequently use when asked about Ireland are Dublin, Waterford Crystal, Killarney and Connemara. I have been trying to create a better regional spread in tourism. In this regard I am banking on the Good Friday Agreement. We must all insist on letting it be known that there is peace on this island because we must overcome the tendency of the likes of CNN only to report negative messages from Northern Ireland. This is why so many Ministers are travelling the world for Saint Patrick's Day. We are promoting the benefits of the Agreement to encourage people to travel here.</P>

      <Col N="358" /> I hope we will be able to obtain more EU funding for product development in a bid to get visitors to stop in the areas referred to by the Deputy. Outstanding areas have not yet been profiled or promoted. We know about the lakes of Killarney, Kilkenny Castle, etc. However, if we can persuade tourists to visit the unexplored areas they will act as ambassadors and will ensure they are known more widely. That requires more money for marketing, which is what I am trying to do, especially for Europe.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will know of my commitment to the objective of creating a sporting environment that fosters the pursuit of excellence and fulfilment in sport by fair and ethical means. Education has a very important role to play in achieving this end, as recognised by the Council of Europe Anti-Doping Convention, 1989, which seeks a three strand approach to the reduction of doping in sport, namely, testing, research and educational programmes and information campaigns.</P>
      <P>Ireland's first ever national sports anti-doping programme, which I launched last year, is scheduled to become operational when the Irish Sports Council is established on a statutory basis. The Sports Council Bill passed Committee Stage last week.</P>
      <P>The programme has been designed with reference to the Council of Europe Anti-Doping Convention, 1989. It is anticipated that the educational and information aspects of the programme will emphasise the dangers to health inherent in doping and its harm to the ethical values of sport. Specific programmes will be developed by the Irish Sports Council and the National Coaching and Training Centre, Limerick, in co-operation with the NGBs.</P>
      <P>Research has already begun on existing educational and information programmes with a view to devising an appropriate, strategic, focused and co-ordinated campaign for implementation under the national sports anti-doping programme. Early discussions are planned in this context with the health promotion unit within the Department of Health and Children. The council will also be able to draw upon developments at both EU and Council of Europe level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Education programmes and information campaigns will need the fullest co-operation and support of all those involved in sport if the scourge of drug taking is not to be carried on through future generations of sports boys and girls, men and women. In this regard, I will be asking for <Col N="359" /> the wholehearted commitment from all those involved in sport, including parents, schools, sponsors, trainers, coaches, doctors and, most importantly, high profile athletes to work with the sports council and the governing bodies in actively promoting the qualities of genuine sporting endeavour and to educate our young people involved in sport of the health risks associated with taking performance enhancing drugs and the potential health risks from the misuse of other products, such as food supplements.</P>
    <P>I note the Deputy's idea of using major Irish events as a platform and will convey this to the Irish Sports Council for its consideration in the ongoing development of the national sports anti-doping programme and in the context of initiatives in the general area of awareness of the risks and problems of doping in sport.</P>

Often participants are smeared by the dye of commercialism, as was evident at Lansdowne Road where participants were smeared with the dye of the advertising companies on the pitch. Does the Minister agree that sports heroes exert major influence on young people and communities? Will he initiate a programme to enable our sports men and women to visit schools and communities to instil in young people the spirit of participation and enjoyment of sport which seems to be eroded by the growing influence of commercial interests on sporting events? This would be an important initiative in dealing with the growing use of performance enhancing substances in sport.</P>

The majority of people who participate in sport do so on a voluntary basis. The image of sports heroes has been tarnished by recent events. When we see someone on the podium now, we usually ask what they have taken. Young people do not seem to have heroes anymore.</P>

      <P>The sport of athletics is experiencing many challenges, including retaining current members, attracting new members, ensuring that the linkage between school and adult athletics provides a continuum of involvement for athletes and in competing with other sports for commercial and corporate support. With a view to increasing participation in athletics and maintaining its popularity in Irish sport, it is my intention to streamline the administration of athletics and reach a position for the year 2001 where it will be possible to fund one administrative structure, which will become a stronger and more robust focus for the development of athletics.</P>
      <P>As a first step in this process, I have requested BLE, the National Athletic and Cultural Association of Ireland and the Irish Schools Athletic Association to submit a joint proposal for funding in respect of organisational development, international competition and training and the hosting of international events for 1999. To facilitate the athletic bodies in this process, I have asked the director of the National Coaching and Training Centre to assist them.</P>
      <P>I understand some progress has been made in advancing this process and I look forward to receiving an agreed proposal in the near future. As soon as an agreed proposal is received, it will be considered by the Irish Sports Council.

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I see no reason athletics must have three governing bodies. I have said I will give them two years to get their house in order. I have asked them to bring forward an organisational and strategic report this year on how they intend to operate to ensure there is no overlap and that competitions are not held at the same time so that athletes are shown fair play.</P>
      <P>Three organisations have administered athletics for the past 15 to 20 years. I am determined to streamline this so I have introduced a cut off date of 2001. We have seen in Northern Ireland over recent years that unless a deadline is set, the process will be open-ended.</P>
      <P>Athletics receives 10 per cent of all Government funding, which is the highest administration costs of any organisation, and it is split between the three bodies. There is a total overlap in the work they do. I want to bring them together under one umbrella, but I assure them there will be no diminution of funding. I am prepared to increase funding if they come together under the one umbrella and I am glad they are working towards that end.</P>
      <P>One unknown voice disputed this proposal recently but they did not have the courage to go on record. Their views, however, were contradicted by their official spokesperson. I am totally committed to ensuring that athletics is streamlined and to working with all the national athletics organisations, but I am determined that athletics will be administered by one structure by 2001.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank both Deputies and the other Deputies present who I am sure will ask questions also.</P>
      <P>The current position is that unofficial pickets have been placed on ESB power stations &ndash; more than the number Deputy Stagg mentioned&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>No, more than that. Pickets have been placed by members of the TEEU and AEEU in relation to disciplinary cases involving two staff at Tarbert power station being pursued through the long-established industrial relations procedures in the ESB. The imposition of the unofficial pickets has not given rise to power problems as generating stations are continuing to produce normally and power supplies are being maintained. Nevertheless, as in any industrial relations case, it must be recognised that the situation is subject to change, and, should there be an escalation, there will be a risk to the continuity of power supplies.</P>
      <P>Industrial relations in the company is a matter for the management of the ESB in association with its trade unions. In view of the critical nature of the industry to the economic and social life of the country, I am monitoring the position carefully on an ongoing basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A formal meeting took place last night between <Col N="363" /> the ESB management, the group of unions and the company. It failed to produce a solution but the parties are committed and continue to maintain contact on the issue. I understand those contacts have continued through the day. I have spoken to the chairman of the ESB and the chairman of the group of unions. I understand ICTU commenced a meeting with the unions concerned at 3 o'clock this afternoon.</P>
    <P>This industrial action is unofficial and is in breach of the agreed disputes procedures which apply in the ESB as well as in the Partnership 2000 agreement. I ask the staff and everybody else involved, in the interests of electricity consumers throughout the country, to return to work and pursue their grievances through the appropriate procedures.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the acute hardship that would be caused to many individuals should power cuts occur, including people who do not have access to generators, those on ventilators and others using cardiac equipment in their homes who will be in a perilous state in the event of a power cut? I understand this dispute is about who is in charge of workshops in Moneypoint. Could everybody not revert to the position that pertained last Friday or Saturday, prior to the flare up in Moneypoint on Monday, so that some process of arbitration can deal with the issue that caused the row? People could return to work pending arbitration on the nub of the dispute. Are the Minister's efforts going towards dealing with the dispute in a peaceful way?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>We would all like to deal with the dispute in a peaceful fashion but industrial disputes, particularly unofficial disputes, often do not lend themselves to clearcut agendas. I am aware of the acute inconvenience and hardship many people will experience should a break in power supply occur. I hope that common sense and clear heads will dictate the talks currently under way between congress and the unions in question.</P>

Is she aware that 15 of the 27 power stations are being picketed by workers from these power stations and that included in these is Moneypoint which represents 30 per cent of our gross capacity? Does she appreciate the danger of escalation in this dispute? Will she agree the unions have been warning both the management and the Minister, through her Department, of the deterioration in industrial relations, particularly in the power generation area, that what we are dealing with now is simply the spark that ignited the tinder box, and that there is no telling where this will end? Will the Minister agree she has a duty to ensure power supply is maintained and that she cannot adopt a hands-off position? Is she aware that her job is not only about good news and photo oppor<Col N="364" /> tunities but that she must deal with the bad as well as the good? Will she tell the House what she, as Minister for energy, proposes to do to lift the threat of cuts in power supplies to the domestic sector, the emergency services and industry, because she has done nothing so far?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the serious nature of the problem. The unions have not warned me, and I have met them frequently. I met the two men involved from Tarbert; they travelled to Athlone and we spent a considerable length of time talking about the matter. I then took up their case with the ESB. If the Deputy calls that a hands-off approach he is wrong. I then got the full history of the two employees in their submission to me and also from the ESB. The Deputy asked me to tell the House what I have been doing. I have spoken to the chairman of the board and, on two occasions, to the chairman of the group of unions. I have been kept up to date throughout the day on what transpired at the six hour meeting last night, which resumed again this morning. This is an unofficial strike. The talks with Congress have started. I cannot say what the outcome of those talks will be but I am glad congress has got involved. It is a hopeful sign. I hope that commonsense, cool heads and wisdom will win the day because an unofficial strike can spread rapidly, which this has done, and get quickly out of hand.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister focus on the detail in this problem? Is it accurate or inaccurate to say that in resolving what was the problem on Monday, another has been created that has gone from being a bush fire to an inferno? Was proper consideration given to the settlement of the issue <Col N="365" /> at Moneypoint, where a shop steward was sent home, and the knock-on effect on Tarbert and on fitters as opposed to day workers? In solving one problem, were 14 additional problems being created?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Moneypoint situation was a fresh difficulty, the Tarbert one was nearly at an end. While both are about people and grievances, they were at different stages of development. Since the dispute is unofficial, and given the complexity of unions involved and the nature of inter-union talks, I cannot say if one led to the other. However, the Tarbert situation was ongoing for weeks if not months. Deputy Moynihan-Cronin brought it up during a recent debate. I met the two employees involved and listened to their stories. I then heard the story from the other side. That matter is nearing the end of its process within the ESB system for dealing with these disputes. The Moneypoint situation is new.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept this is a symptom of a wider disease or malaise in industrial relations in the ESB and that her inept handling of the electricity brief has led to high levels of stress and uncertainty throughout that organisation? As a result, there is an urgent need for a reappraisal of industrial relations in the ESB, particularly given the Minister's threatened privatisation of the company and the introduction of competition.</P>
      <P>Will she initiate a reappraisal of industrial relations to ensure the necessary changes are achieved in a peaceful manner and will she stop acting like a bull in a china shop doing more harm than good? Will she also stop substituting blather for real action in this regard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The only blather I hear is from the Deputy. He is great at it.</P>
      <P>I would not attempt to intervene and tell the ESB it must have a new system of industrial relations&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course the Minister should. If she had left it alone in the first place she would not have to intervene now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the arch blatherer of Dáil Éireann. Industrial relations are an ongoing issue within the ESB. It has a long history of good personnel relationships and the CCR, which was started by Deputy Cowen and is due to end in May this year, has been a success. The onset of competition was set down in the directive adopted by the former Minister and Minister of State, Deputy Dukes and Deputy Stagg, respectively, at the Council of Ministers. The ongoing discussions about the directive &ndash; I had 23 meetings with the unions over a 12 month period &ndash; are bound to be fraught and difficult. However, <Col N="366" /> the Tarbert and Moneypoint issues have nothing to do with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>They are a symptom of a disease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I went through the Tarbert issue thoroughly with the men concerned. It has been an ongoing issue for many weeks. I have also heard from the various sides about the Moneypoint issue and it, too, is specific to a method of working and an operation in that station.</P>
      <P>I am loath to say much now when congress is talking to the unions involved. I hope the talks are fruitful and that there will be a successful outcome. I hope, as a result, both disputes will be resolved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not agree Deputy Stagg has a point about the fear of uncertainty among workers in power plants? Given that the CCR is due to expire in a month, can she say anything about a successor which would alleviate the fears of day workers, shift workers, fitters and so forth who work in power stations and who are subject to a new legal and competitive regime?</P>
      <P>The Minister is responsible to the general public on this issue. Can she assure elderly people, and shift workers in factories who might be let go if there is a power cut, that there will be no power cuts in the next 48 hours? Can the Government, which is the sole shareholder and in charge of this body, also assure the public that there will not be power cuts and the attendant serious disruption?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I mentioned the successor to the CCR when I spoke to the chairman today. Once, hopefully, the current difficulties are resolved, there will have to be an explicit debate between unions, management and the Government, although I have met the unions and management on numerous occasions. The onset of competition on foot of the directive will be operated in Ireland at a minimal level. Other countries are opening up to competition at levels of between 80 per cent and 100 per cent, whereas we are opening up to only 28 per cent in 11 months. There is a need for open dialogue between management and unions &ndash; I am prepared to be absolutely open about everything too &ndash; to ensure everybody is aware of the upcoming situation rather than maintaining a belief that things will continue as they always have. Clearly, competition will make a difference.</P>
      <P>I cannot tell the public there will be no power cuts because talks are taking place at present. When I receive the result of the discussion between congress and the unions, I will be in a better position to speak about the future. I hope there will be no power cuts. I intend to stay working on this matter all day and night.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware there are pickets on 15 power stations and that the shift changed at 4 p.m.? She has done nothing effective to prevent that. Does she know whether the power stations did or did not close seven minutes ago while we debated this matter? Will she agree that her hands off policy is unacceptable? Such a stance demonstrates her lack of concern for the general public who will be without power this evening if the workers do not pass these unofficial pickets.</P>
      <P>Will she agree to intervene directly with a view to settling the dispute and removing the threat of widespread power cuts? If she is not prepared or able to do that, will she consider her position and allow somebody who would do something about this matter to take over?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume that in the sense that the ESB, which is a management company with thousands of employees, did not wait for Deputies Rabbitte, Yates, Stagg or me, learned as we are, to mention this on the floor of the House. When I speak to the chairman after the congress meeting, I expect that a contingency plan will be put forward to me. I cannot compile one. They are the people with the power; it is their job to submit a contingency plan to me and I expect that is what they will do.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>On Deputy Rabbitte's point about a plan B, it will not be the Minister's fault if agreement is not reached, but I would have thought it would be prudent to have a contingency plan &ndash; I am not an expert on this area &ndash; whereby the Labour Relations Commission, the Labour Court or some official State arbitrary system would be on standby to deal with difficult and complex IR issues. Practices used for 25 years in the ESB have worked well, but if they fail, as in any other industries, there must be a back-up safety net of IR procedures in place. I appeal to the Minister to ensure a suitable person, such as <Col N="369" /> Mr. Mulvey, is on standby to provide a cooling down period so that we can have a guarantee of electricity provision while the matters in dispute are arbitrated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that is what will transpire informally at the congress meeting this afternoon. This strike is unofficial. The Labour Relations Commission does not intervene in unofficial strikes. I agree that a plan B and, if necessary, a plan C, would have to allow a person, persons or an arm of machinery detail the way to deal with this and call matters to a halt. These matters have engaged me, and many others, yesterday afternoon, last night and this morning, up to 2.30 a.m., and from 7.30 a.m. all day. I intend to continue to be engaged in them. I hope common sense will prevail and there will be a resolution of this dispute.</P>
      <P>A resolution of this dispute or a cooling down period would enable these issues, which were near completion, to be addressed and security of electricity supply to be maintained. The alternative would not only cause upset but would pose serious problems for our people, including those in hospitals. This dispute demands, as I am giving it, total consideration and constant attention. I expect it will have ongoing consideration and attention day and night.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister has had so many meetings with the management and staff without success, will she convey to them that the opinion of all sides of this House is that they should defer action and let due process continue to resolve the matter to the point where the threat of power cuts is removed and the difficulty is resolved? She told us she had met the Tarbert two three weeks ago. What happened at that meeting? Apparently, nothing useful happened. Did they get a dose of auld blather also?</P>
      <P>I am concerned about the Minister's reply to Deputy Rabbitte's question. I ask her to be clear on this. She said she assumed there was an emergency plan in place in the event of power cuts occurring about now, at 4.15 p.m. Does she know if there is an emergency plan in place? If so, what is the nature of it or is the Minister washing her hands of this and confirming her adoption of a hands off policy in which apparently she has been involved? </P>

      <P>Is it the case that if those shift workers continue on the picket line, there will be power cuts and ESB management will be unable to maintain supplies? The scenario has been clearly painted that when the shift changes, a new set of workers will come to work who may not pass pickets. From the Minister's discussions with the chairman and management of ESB and the unions, are power cuts unavoidable if insufficient workers turn up? Can management run the facilities and utilities? In that event, does the Minister have a fail-safe IR procedure or is she confident that management can continue to run the stations for a period, irrespective of a walk out?</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFleming" hpid="Mr. Fleming Mr. Fleming">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fleming</NameTxt>
      <P>The concept of this Bill is well thought out and is part of the Government's commitment to improving legislation in this area. The Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands will bring forward similar legislation which will dovetail with it to improve arrangements in this area.</P>
      <P>Given there are two separate Government Departments involved &ndash; the Office of Public Works has a major role in the area as well &ndash; there must be proper co-ordination between the Departments and the Office of Public Works. There is a role for public bodies in relation to buildings in their ownership. Many of the buildings which will be protected by this legislation will be in the ownership of the State. I hope the same rigours and standards will be applied by local government and those drawing up the inventory. They should not discriminate between publicly and privately owned buildings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Leinster House is a classic example which, I am sure, will be on the inventory. I want to be sure there are no exemptions for State bodies or the <Col N="374" /> State itself. I was at a meeting of the House Services Committee recently at which there was a discussion about extending the canteen facilities and an architect of the Office of Public Works told us that Leinster House does not have a fire certificate. That alarmed us. There is an exemption from fire certificates for the State in matters like this. Similar matters should not arise in the new legislation. Every building should be treated on its merits and not on the basis of who owns it. There should not be a separate set of laws for public buildings. The fire officer of Dublin Corporation should inspect this building. It is not satisfactory that the Office of Public Works should say the building is in order with respect to fire regulations. Independent verification is required and the same independence should apply when we are drawing up the national inventory of architectural heritage and buildings.</P>
    <P>There will be transitional procedures for this legislation. Every building currently included as a listed building in county development plans will be included as a protected building. Will there be any independent appeals mechanism? If it is proposed to include a building and the owner contests it, his views can be sought and members of the local authority will ultimately make the decision. I would like some independent mechanism of arbitration on these matters. I would also like to see proper procedures outlined by the Minister at the appropriate time, in consultation with the local authorities and the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, Deputy de Valera, to ensure there is an open and transparent method by which the authorised officers will decide what is included on the protected list. It is not good enough for planning or heritage officers to take a drive, look up at a building and say it looks lovely so it should be included on the list. There must be more detailed examination of each building; it is not enough to take a cursory glance.</P>
    <P>This legislation highlights the area of planning permission. I said earlier I was concerned about a local authority taking an action against an owner or an occupier of a house.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that the Local Government (Planning and Development) Bill and the Architectural Heritage (National Inventory) and Historic Monuments (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, introduced by the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, are considered together.  I welcome the introduction of new laws for listed buildings. It is important that where a planning authority orders work to be undertaken on a protected building, it will have to pay for the work if offending alterations were not authorised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under this Bill, all listed buildings will in future <Col N="375" /> be known as protected buildings. The inside structure will now be protected. It is hard to control this unless the interior of a listed building is properly recorded prior to works being carried out. While the facade may remain the same, considerable changes can be made inside. Planning authorities are to be given powers to ensure heritage buildings are protected and they will be entitled to order works to be done to preserve or restore them. This is important. The Government is to introduce a new grant scheme for protected buildings at a cost of £3.9 million, which will be administered by local authorities. How will this fund be dispersed per county? A further £300,000 has been made available to deploy conservation expertise within local authorities. How many conservationists will this include?</P>
    <P>Buildings may be added to the record of protected structures at any time, independently of the statutory five year development plan. All planning authorities are obliged to record buildings to be protected because of their architectural, historical, archaeological, artistic, scientific, social or technical interest. This is important. I am dismayed that a spokesman for An Taisce said that while this legislation is an improvement, it falls far short of what is required. It is certainly well overdue. He also said there is a need for an outside body of conservation experts to supplement the activities of local authorities, which he claimed were not meeting their responsibilities as regards the conservation of our heritage.</P>
    <P>I welcome this new era of protecting our heritage. Our record in protecting our official heritage has left much to be desired. However, the new regime which will come into operation under this new legislation will work well if supervised by local authorities working with the Department of the Environment and Local Government and the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands. This is a huge area which should be looked at.</P>
    <P>Section 3 provides that the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands may, after consulting the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, issue guidelines to planning authorities to assist them in carrying out their functions under this Bill in protecting buildings and townscapes. The guidelines will ensure that a consistent approach to protecting heritage buildings is adopted nationwide. It is important that this is focused on.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides that, in addition to these guidelines, the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands may recommend the inclusion of buildings in the record of protected structures. This will be based on the information in the national inventory of archaeological heritage. While I welcome this legislation, tougher laws are needed. The difficulty will be in its implementation.</P>
    <P>Section 5 provides that a planning authority may add a building to the record of protected structures where it considers such a building war<Col N="376" /> rants it or it may delete from the record a structure where protection is no longer warranted. A deletion of or addition to the record of protected structures may be carried out when reviewing the development plan as part of the statutory five year review or in accordance with the provisions laid down in section 6.</P>
    <P>All these sections are important. A sum of £300,000 has been allocated for the employment of conservationists for the remainder of this year. However, these people will have a huge workload. Unfortunately, in the past, some of our great buildings have been destroyed.</P>
    <P>Section 8 provides that planning permission will be required for any works which affect the character of a protected structure. This is welcome. As protection will now extend to the interior of structures, permission may be required for interior decorating, such as plastering. Owners or occupiers may request the local authority to indicate the works it intends to carry out in a declaration. This will be time consuming.</P>
    <P>The new planning Act, the purpose of which is to allow for the increase in membership of An Bord Pleanála amends the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1983. This is necessary to allow the board to cope with the large increase in planning appeals in the past two years. The new Act also allows for the identification of actions taken by staff and members of the board in the performance of their duties.</P>
    <P>Section 38 provides for transitional arrangements for buildings currently listed for protection or preservation under a development plan. These will automatically become protected buildings under the Bill. Owners and occupiers of these buildings will be consulted and entitled to make representations to the planning authority on whether their building should remain a protected structure. A huge amount of work will have to be done by planning officers to deal with compliance with these regulations. Local authorities are overworked because of the huge level of applications being made at the moment and staff have not been allocated to deal with this.</P>
    <P>As regards the £3.9 million which has been allocated towards the conservation of buildings, how much will be given per county on the basis of buildings in each county? The cost of detailed applications will be higher because people will be complying with conservation orders. Will part of the £3.9 million be made available as a grant to help people restore buildings which are a national treasure? While people will want to follow the guidelines, it is important that a grant be given as an incentive to help people comply with the regulations.</P>
    <P>This Bill must be welcomed; it is very much overdue. The overhaul of planning guidelines, which the Minister will bring forward in the coming months, and intensification which will allow people build on confined sites are welcome.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Government is looking at our architectural heritage before the millennium. I am critical of some aspects of the <Col N="377" /> Bill, but I welcome its thrust. A fund should be available to maintain our rich heritage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill. Its introduction is timely, as those of us who are county councillors are discussing draft development plans. Planning is very much the centre of attention, and those involved in planning are often criticised. The Celtic tiger has spawned a huge expansion in building, and a parallel development is the dramatic increase in workload for the planning departments of local authorities. They do excellent work often in pressurised circumstances. As public representatives, we often find ourselves in conflict with them because we view planning decisions in a media context, while they must show vision and consider the future regarding the development. We are all aware of the types of difficulties that can exist at local level, particularly with regard to septic tanks and other issues. We are moving in a different direction with this Bill, however, and that is timely as local authorities are compiling dossiers of buildings that need conservation. Those lists are being discussed with councillors, and in my county I have seen a voluminous document produced which outlines the types of properties which need to be preserved.</P>
      <P>We lost some fine buildings at the time of the Land Commission and the distribution of estates, for example. It is unfortunate that many historic buildings were destroyed in a mood of petulance at the time. We have probably learned to regret that, and we need to preserve what is left. That is why this Bill is so important; it dwells on the conservation aspect, which is vital.</P>
      <P>Many people in rural areas will say conservation can be costly, and that is reflected in the Bill. If a person lives in an old building according to contemporary design, there is often an associated cost in preserving its integrity. The Bill states that several million pounds will be allocated to local authorities, giving a financial injection to preservation efforts. I know of cases where the facade of buildings has deteriorated aesthetically, and the local authority tells the owner not to change the design or structure. The people involved will then automatically claim they are being pressurised into retaining the structure as it is, even though it is deteriorating and they do not have the finance to carry out the necessary works. It is important that a financial mechanism is in place for a building recognised as being worthy of preservation. It is in the long-term interests of the person concerned and the community to preserve these buildings.</P>
      <P>There is a great emphasis on thatched houses in my area, and it is amazing how they have come back into vogue. The work of the thatcher has returned, and there are incentives for thatching houses. Adare is a classic example of thatched premises being preserved.</P>

      <P>Noel Bradshaw is a 49 year old Christian Brother, a native of Portarlington, County Laois, who has been involved in humanitarian work in Africa for many years. Brother Bradshaw had originally worked in Liberia until the civil war approximately ten years ago forced him out of the country. Since then he has been working as a teacher with the victims of war in Sierra Leone. It now appears Brother Bradshaw, together with two priests, one from Italy and one from Sierra Leone, were taken hostage on 28 February, but news of the kidnapping emerged only within the past few days. His captors are apparently members of the Revolutionary United Front.</P>
      <P>The situation in Sierra Leone has been very unstable, with widespread violence in recent months. There is effectively a civil war situation with the Revolutionary United Front in conflict with the Government, which is in turn backed by Nigerian troops and forces from other west African countries. The Secretary General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan, recently condemned what he called the merciless murders and inhuman mutilations carried out by the rebels on the innocent inhabitants of the capital, Freetown. However, he also noted in a report to the Security Council that troops of the Nigerian led ECOMOG force, which is backing the Government, had been accused of summary executions.</P>
      <P>Sierra Leone is inhospitable for outsiders, but typically, when the situation deteriorated further in December, Brother Bradshaw refused an offer of evacuation saying he wanted to remain with the children with whom he had been working. His family has not heard directly from him since then.</P>
      <P>Brother Bradshaw's family and the other members of his religious community are clearly very worried about his safety, particularly given a number of recent high profile kidnappings in international trouble spots. I appeal to the Minister for Foreign Affairs to take all possible efforts to secure his release and safe return. In this regard I welcome the reported release of 31 children who had also been kidnapped by this group and the call by the leader of the Revolutionary United Front, Foday Sankoh, for the release of Brother Bradshaw and his two colleagues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland has diplomatic relations with Sierra Leone, and although we do not have an ambassador there, we do have an honorary consul in Freetown. However, I hope the Minister will take a personal interest in this case and use the good offices of our EU colleagues, who have resident diplomatic missions in Sierra Leone, to use all their good offices to secure the release of Brother Bradshaw. I also hope the Minister uses all the <Col N="379" /> channels available through the United Nations to impress very strongly to the Government of Sierra Leone the need to avoid any actions that could endanger the life of Brother Bradshaw. I also ask the Minister to ensure that full contact is kept with Brother Bradshaw and his religious order so that they are kept up to date with all efforts being taken to secure his release.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy De Rossa for raising this matter, and I apologise on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who, due to pressing business already committed to, is unable to be in the House this evening.</P>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to inform the House about what we know regarding this matter and the efforts we are making to ensure the welfare and safe release of Brother Bradshaw.</P>
      <P>Because of its concern for the welfare of the small number of Irish citizens there &ndash; most of them missionaries like Brother Bradshaw &ndash; the Department of Foreign Affairs has been monitoring particularly closely the developments in Sierra Leone since the renewal last December of hostilities between forces of the Government and ECOMOG on one hand and those of the Revolutionary United Front, or RUF, on the other. The Department was therefore aware that Brother Bradshaw decided to remain in the town of Makeni, 116 miles from Freetown, after it was taken over by RUF forces several weeks ago. He did so contrary to the advice of his order and to what most other expatriates did. My understanding, however, is that until recently he was free to leave the town if he wished. Brother Bradshaw, who is 49 years of age and a native of Portarlington, belongs to the English Providence of the Irish Christian Brothers, has worked in Sierra Leone for ten years. On 9 March the Honorary Consul-General of Ireland in Freetown reported to the Department that he was informed by the Christian Brothers there on 7 March that Brother Bradshaw had been abducted from Makeni on or about 28 February. Two priests, an Italian and a Sierra Leonean, from the nearby town of Kambia were also abducted at the same time. The Honorary Consul-General had by then already contacted the Foreign Minister of Sierra Leone, the Commander of the ECOMOG Task Force, the Deputy Head of UNOMSIL, the United Nations Observer Mission, the Apostolic Nuncio to Sierra Leone and the British High Commission.</P>
      <P>On my instructions the Embassy in London yesterday requested the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to ask its High Commission in Freetown, one of the very few diplomatic missions, if not the only one, functioning in the city, to assist in any way possible, through its contact with the Government and other parties in Sierra Leone, in the efforts to ensure the welfare and release of Brother Bradshaw. I have every confidence this will be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Embassies in Rome are also in contact <Col N="380" /> with the Italian and Holy See authorities who are making their own efforts to communicate with the RUF. The imprisoned former leader of the RUF on 8 March publicly asked his men to liberate all their hostages, particularly the three Catholic missionaries.</P>
    <P>In this difficult situation I will continue to do all I can, with the assistance of the Sierra Leone Government and of the other parties I have mentioned, to secure the outcome we all desire.</P>

      <P>I thank you for the opportunity to raise the matter of further decentralisation proposals which, I understand, are being considered by the Government. I urge the Government and the Minister to consider favourably Mullingar as the strategic location for the transfer of any Department or State agency. In the past there was acute disappointment that Mullingar was overlooked when the question of decentralisation was discussed, despite being in the heart of the country, a major selling point for many civil servants who would prefer to be relocated nearer their families in the geographical area.</P>
      <P>I understand the Cabinet intends to discuss the transfer of more civil servants to towns and cities and it is likely a decision will be made to accelerate the process of decentralisation. I understand the Minister is engaged in a study. I ask him to ensure Mullingar is at the centre of any such proposal to extend decentralisation. Mullingar is ready, willing and able to accept any proposal to decentralise any Department or agency to what is a very fine and vibrant town. Neither I nor my colleagues have ever engaged in the politics of begrudgery. The surrounding towns have benefited considerably from the transfer of Government Departments and the accompanying jobs. I am pleased at the success of the decentralisation programme. It is an important contribution to the process of reinvigorating rural Ireland as well as helping to reduce congestion in and around Dublin.</P>
      <P>Many civil servants from Mullingar and the surrounding towns and villages of north Westmeath have to travel to Dublin or elsewhere daily or weekly. They would be delighted with the opportunity to transfer to or near their home or to be in a position to apply for transfers to work in a decentralised Department or agency. They would be delighted with the opportunity to move back home and avail of cheaper costs of living and more affordable property prices. Some also travel daily on a rail service which Deputy McGrath and I acknowledge has enormous problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McGrath and I are proud of Mullingar, a place of great beauty which has much to offer. <Col N="381" /> As the capital of the lakelands, it has much to offer in terms of recreational facilities. The lakes, Ennel, Owel and Derravaragh, are renowned for game and coarse fishing. The Royal Canal which will be fully navigable in the near future circles Mullingar and allows for leisure and recreational pursuits. A championship golf course, a fully refurbished and upgraded swimming pool, a bridge centre, a squash centre and an equestrian centre are among its many amenities. It has a tremendous array of schools and educational establishments. It offers a skilled back up service in banking and construction, a committed workforce and all the necessary infrastructure. It has excellent training facilities, an unlimited supply of clean water, top class housing, excellent health services staffed by excellent medical personnel in private practice and a highly qualified and professional staff at Westmeath General Hospital.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister ensure Mullingar is considered favourably for any future decentralisation programme? Those who come to Mullingar never want to leave it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Penrose for sharing his time with me. Mullingar is the jewel of the Midlands, situated about 50 miles from Dublin, well served by roads, a railway which we hope will be improved, and infrastructural services. It has land available for development, sewerage facilities, water, schools, hotels and so on.</P>
      <P>Mullingar has been overlooked for decentralisation. The neighbouring towns of Tullamore, Athlone, Cavan and Longford have benefited considerably from decentralisation. In the past Mullingar may have been seen as a well-off market town in the midlands, where the local community was well served. It deserves decentralisation. Large numbers of civil servants commute daily to Dublin while many other Mullingar people live in Dublin. They should be given an opportunity to return to their home base. In the next round of decentralisation programme priority should be given to Mullingar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>: I thank Deputy Penrose for raising this matter and Deputy McGrath for contributing on it. To date about 3,800 personnel have relocated under the decentralisation programme to centres across the country. Approximately 400 further personnel are in the process of decentralising to the remaining designated centres which include Dundalk, Roscommon and Wexford. It is expected the relocation process will be complete in about two years' time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To put the scale of the decentralisation programme into context, it is interesting to note that of an overall total of about 29,000 staff serving in the Civil Service, about 16,500, 57 per cent, are located in Dublin and some 12,500, 43 per cent, are located outside Dublin. While not all the staff located outside Dublin relocated as part of the decentralisation programme, nevertheless it has contributed significantly to a greater geographical spread of Government services. Successive <Col N="382" /> Governments have supported and developed the programme of decentralisation. This Government is committed to completing the ongoing decentralisation programme.</P>
    <P>By way of background I wish to explain some of the issues which were considered prior to the announcement of the extended decentralisation programme. One of the first steps taken was that all Departments and offices were examined with a view to identifying sections suitable for relocation. To be suitable, sections need to be of a certain size to be viable and be sufficiently self-contained to be able to function effectively outside Dublin.</P>
    <P>The locations were selected by the Government having regard to the desire to promote regional development, economic growth and a more even spread of public sector jobs around the country. The centres include Sligo and Letterkenny in the north-west; Ballina, Castlebar, Roscommon and Galway in the west; Limerick, Ennis and Nenagh in the mid-west; Cork and Killarney in the south; Waterford, Wexford and Kilkenny in the south-east; Athlone, Tullamore, Portlaoise and Longford in the midlands, and Cavan and Dundalk in the north-east and Border areas.</P>
    <P>The decentralisation programme was initiated to facilitate more widespread location of public service employment which would contribute to the development of some of the main urban areas outside Dublin, helping to reduce regional imbalances and the pressure on the Dublin region. Undoubtedly, the movement of public servants to the provincial towns has added to the social and economic wealth of those towns.</P>
    <P>The current policy of decentralisation is not yet complete and there is no decision to extend it to other areas. However, the Minister for Finance is considering the many issues relevant to decentralisation policy and he proposes to discuss these with his colleagues in Government in the near future.</P>
    <P>The case made by both Deputies for the inclusion of Mullingar in any future decentralisation programme has been noted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>This week the Government announced the latest set of initiatives designed to respond to the growing housing emergency. It was another PR opportunity for a Government which is only now responding to the housing crisis following almost two years of inaction. While the Government shed crocodile tears for tenants facing an insecure future, the measures enacted to afford greater security and protection to the tenant have yet to be enforced. We have a proud history of enacting laws which are not enforced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of landlord registration, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government has adopted a &ldquo;hear no evil, see no evil&rdquo; approach. If it is the intention in our housing policy to provide good quality and affordable accom<Col N="383" /> modation for tenants within the private rented sector, it must surely follow that regulation of some description should be brought to bear on this sector. It was with this in mind that the last rainbow Government introduced legislation in 1996 requiring landlords to register with their appropriate local authority. The legislation made sense. By registering such property a start was to be made in terms of ensuring standards and value for money within a sector of the housing market which has always been regarded as a poor relation. Registration would not only seek to increase standards but was also designed to provide tenants with protection from unscrupulous landlords.</P>
    <P>It is, therefore, unimaginable that a law which was passed by the Oireachtas has remained virtually unenforced since its enactment in 1996. This situation is nothing short of a scandal and reflects poorly on the Minister who has direct responsibility for housing policy. The Minister will, no doubt, argue that it is the responsibility of local authorities to enforce the law in this area. Indeed, at last week's Question Time, the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, explained to me that he recently dispatched a letter from his Department to county managers informing them of their obligations under the registration law. A letter in nearly two years of office does not signify adequate ministerial action.</P>
    <P>For the record, I would like to inform the House that between 75 and 80 per cent of all housing units in the private rented sector have yet to be registered. The latest figures released by the Department of the Environment and Local Government show an actual reduction in the number of registrations from 26,651 in June 1998 to 23,847 in September 1998. Similarly, the number of registered landlords has dropped in the same period from 15,951 to 13,779.</P>
    <P>Since 1993 only 53 prosecutions have been taken against landlords for failing to comply with the housing regulations which were introduced that year. Local authorities, the Department of the Environment and Local Government and the Minister of State with responsibility for housing seem to have no difficulty in turning a blind eye to landlords who want to evade their legal responsibilities. What would happen if the Department of the Environment housing inspectors refused to inspect the standards that applied to newly built housing units? Would a public outcry be heard? The failure to apply existing law to the private rented sector would not be accepted in any other part of the housing market.</P>
    <P>I understand that a case has been taken against the Department and the Minister in relation to the registration fee which is incurred when a landlord registers his property. The Minister should either challenge this through the courts or introduce amending legislation at once. If the £40 fee involved in each registration unit is such a major <Col N="384" /> difficulty, a simple way of resolving the problem would be to abandon the registration fee altogether. What is important is the registration of property and not the potential for this scheme to be a revenue stream for local authorities.</P>
    <P>It is quite obvious that the black economy is alive and well in the private rented sector. However, it is unacceptable that where health boards pay out huge sums of money for rent subsidy, no information on the landlord is ever transmitted from those health boards to the local authorities. It is a classic example of one public institution failing to communicate with another. I hope this Adjournment debate will propel the Minister into action and afford him the opportunity of enforcing law that is currently in place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Hayes for raising this important issue. My colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for housing and urban renewal, Deputy Molloy, is unable to be in the House this evening to respond to this debate, so I will do so on his behalf.</P>
      <P>Local authorities, as housing authorities, are responsible for the enforcement of the Housing (Registration of Rented Houses) Regulations, 1996. As in the case of other responsibilities entrusted to local authorities, it is a matter for each authority to put in place arrangements to ensure the effective implementation of these and other regulations applying to private rented accommodation.</P>
      <P>The requirement to register applies generally to rented dwellings with certain exceptions such as formerly rent controlled dwellings, temporary convenience lettings, lettings by State bodies, local authorities or certain approved voluntary bodies, lettings to family members by a landlord, or where there is a single letting in a house in which the landlord is resident.</P>
      <P>An initial and an annual registration fee of £40 is payable by the landlord to the local authority per unit of accommodation. The fee generates an income to assist local authorities in carrying out their functions in relation to enforcement of the various statutory requirements relating to the private rented sector.</P>
      <P>The range of enforcement measures available to local authorities include regular advertising of registration requirements, carrying out of inspections or other investigative procedures to identify unregistered houses, issuing individual reminders to landlords, issuing notices to landlords specifying a registration deadline and initiating prosecutions against known non-compliant landlords. It is regrettable that there is a significant level of non-compliance by landlords with the regulations and a concerted effort by many of them to evade their obligations in this connection. However there is no basis for the figure of 80 per cent non-compliance as claimed by the Deputy. He appears to be overlooking entirely that there are many rented dwellings to which the regulations do not apply and which are not required to be registered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="385" /> A number of factors have been cited as contributing to the failure by landlords to comply with their statutory obligation to register their rented dwellings. First, landlords' representative bodies have been opposed to the regulations since their inception, although their views were taken into account when the regulations were being drafted and some amendments were made on foot of their representations. Second, they have sought a judicial review of the regulations mainly on the basis of arguments put forward that the initial £40 registration fee is an arbitrary charge and represents additional taxation on landlords. The case is still before the High Court and is at the discovery stage. Its existence has been well publicised among landlords, many of whom, I understand, advance it as their reason for not registering when pursued by local authorities.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State with responsibility for housing and urban renewal is concerned to see an improved level of compliance with the provisions of the regulations and, to this end, local authorities have been regularly urged by the Department to take all steps open to them to secure compliance by landlords with the regulations. The latest instruction in this regard issued to local authorities as recently as mid-January 1999.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Leaving Certificate Examination.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank your office, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me to raise this matter and I also thank the Minister of State for attending this Adjournment debate. Last week I was invited to attend a talk given by adult students who were in the course of completing a UCC diploma in social and community studies in east Cork. Four of these students undertook a study to find out how many students are affected by crises such as bereavement, illness, accidents or even pregnancy, just before or during their leaving certificate examination. This would mean they would have to forego sitting the examination and therefore lose a year of study.</P>
      <P>In today's world, education and its end results determine our eventual financial and social status. Getting points in the leaving certificate examination is one of the most important events in a student's life. Should a crisis occur, such as I have outlined, it would mean the student cannot sit the examination and would have to lose a full year. At third level, students have the option of repeating examinations at the end of the year, but unfortunately this does not apply to leaving certificate students. The Minister should examine the possibility of allowing such students a chance to repeat any exam papers they may miss out on, within four to six weeks of the examination. This would enable them to pursue the goals set out for and by them since they began school 13 or 14 years earlier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The leaving certificate is a crossroads for most students. A couple of years down the line, whether at college or in employment, maturity <Col N="386" /> becomes inevitable and independence becomes a reality. There are a number of reasons this is so, but they would not have to put their careers on hold if they could repeat the leaving certificate examination. That is an important point because their applications for CAO places depend upon leaving certificate results. Places in the Defence Forces, the Garda Síochána and nursing also depend upon the results of that examination.</P>
    <P>We must remember that it is costly to repeat a year's study for the leaving certificate examination. Through no fault of their own, leaving certificate students who suffer a crisis must bear the full cost of repeating the year, including hidden costs such as bus fares, a new uniform, lunch money, new books and, possibly, grinds because the curriculum changes.</P>
    <P>A crisis is hard enough but in addition the student is unable to reach the goal towards which he has worked for many years. This may cause damage to the student's state of mind. The friends leave school after the leaving certificate. The student has to repeat the leaving certificate the following year &ndash; leading up to the anniversary of the crisis, a bereavement or family breakdown for example, which reminds him of what he went through. We should try to protect young people from that if possible.</P>
    <P>There are reasons to oppose my suggestion, such as the need to set extra examination papers. I understand other examination papers are prepared in case examination papers get lost, stolen or damaged. Teachers are on call and are available. I think students would travel anywhere to repeat the examination. Even if the results were not available for the first round CAO offers in August they may be ready for the second or third rounds and that would be preferable to repeating the school year.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister request the Department to examine the possibility of implementing this suggestion? The students in Midleton carried out research, conducting a survey in eight schools and discovered that of the 1,857 students who sat the leaving certificate in the past four years, 193 repeated the exam and of those 15 were crisis students. If one extrapolates the figure for the whole of the country, approximately 2.5 million students sat the exam in the four year period, 24,000 sat the repeats, 1,700 of whom could possibly be crisis students. The student together with his family are in crisis. I know the Minister will not be in a position to say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; this evening, but will he request a feasibility study on giving these students the choice of a second chance. Some may not want it, but that is their choice. Students may opt out if they do not get a second chance and that would be a pity. The pros far outweigh the cons. Knowing the way the thinking in the Department of Education and Science has progressed, this suggestion should be looked at sympathetically and I look forward to getting a considered reply in the future.</P>
    <P>I was asked to present the survey to the Minister for Education and Science, who unfortu<Col N="387" /> nately is not present, but I will forward it to him. I commend the students who carried out the survey because they did a great deal of work in compiling this valuable research.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Deputy Stanton for bring this important issue to the House. I will reply on behalf of the Minister for Education and Science, who is unavoidably absent.</P>
      <P>The Minister believes it is important to consider the precise nature of our examination system and the constraints it imposes in terms of accommodating the life experiences of individual students.</P>
      <P>Essentially the leaving certificate examination is a terminal examination that is examined by external examiners. This contrasts with other examination systems where assessment is conducted on a continuous basis or where assessment takes place at regular intervals and where some of the assessment is conducted by the student's teachers. It is an inevitable consequence of a terminal point in time system of assessment that some students will take tests at a time that they do not consider optimum for them. At leaving certificate this is the case for written examinations held in June but can apply in the case of practical, oral and aural tests as well. By contrast where students are regularly assessed over the duration of a course the final grade awarded can be based on overall performance and therefore need not be contingent exclusively on how a student performs on one day alone.</P>
      <P>The structure of our examination system, with its heavy emphasis on terminal examinations and the modes of assessment employed for different subjects, results from a strong tradition of approaching assessment in the manner outlined. As such it very much reflects the views of the education partners as expressed from time to time. The precise format of assessment is also inextricably linked to syllabus requirements and in turn each subject syllabus, with its modes of assessment is developed by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment through a collaborative process involving the interested parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The constraints inherent in a terminal and externally examined examination system are not imposed by any Minister. They exist as fact and derive from the length of the school year, the time required for holding examinations, arranging for marking conferences, the numbers of suitably qualified persons available to act as exam<Col N="388" /> iners, the necessity to provide ample time for those examiners to conduct the marking to a high standard and by the pressing requirement of having results available to feed into the college entry process which is conducted by the CAO and college admissions departments in August each year.</P>
    <P>The scale of the operation must also be considered. More than 130,000 students take the certificate examinations and more than 1.5 million tests comprising written, oral, aural and practical work must be organised and subsequently examined.</P>
    <P>For those examinations conducted in June alone some 300 different question papers must be prepared and printed in adequate quantities.</P>
    <P>Overall the administration of the certificate examinations is a mammoth exercise and the existing tight timetable from examination through marking to the release of results to candidates and the CAO does not provide scope for factoring in repeat examinations. To suggest that the operation could be replicated, albeit on a much smaller scale is unrealistic particularly as there would be little prospect of having results from a late July-August second sitting available in time to be reflected in college place offers.</P>
    <P>Ensuring availability of an adequate number of examiners would present as a significant problem. At present we use 3,750 examiners for the written examinations alone during the June-July period. Repeat examinations would require a cohort of examiners to be available beyond late July-early August and this would involve a further encroachment on the traditional vacation period of teachers. As matters stand those who act as examiners essentially must take holidays in August before the schools re-open in September. The Department is anxious to do all it can for students who suffer bereavement or other crisis at examination time. The range of arrangements put in place as matters stand include such as, the provision of a special centre to allow a candidate take an examination on his or her own, adjustment of the examination start and finishing times to allow candidates attend funeral services, and support from the Department's psychological service. The Department will continue to be as responsive as it can be to the needs of students at examination time but it is important to recognise that there are limits to what it can do which are imposed by the current format of our examination system.</P>

      <P>One of the Government's key priorities is to ensure a more focused and better co-ordinated response by the statutory authorities in addressing the needs of severely disadvantaged urban communities.</P>
      <P>To that end, the Inter-Departmental Committee on Local Development, which I chair, has been given a mandate to oversee an integrated services project which aims to produce a model of best practice that can be extended to other deprived urban areas.</P>
      <P>The first phase of that project involved a close look at the situation on the ground in four areas &ndash; Dublin's north east inner city, the canal communities (Fatima Mansions, St. Teresa's Garden, St. Michael's House, Dolphin House), Jobstown, Tallaght and Togher, Cork.</P>
      <P>The outcome strongly suggests the value of closer working and planning relationships between the organisations from the State-funded sector which are active in deprived urban areas. It also indicates the value of taking account of the real needs and experience of end-users in the design and planning of service delivery in those areas.</P>
      <P>Following a decision by the Cabinet committee on social inclusion, the implementation phase of the project was launched by the Taoiseach on 4 December last at a special meeting of Secretaries General of relevant Departments and chief executive officers of relevant statutory agencies.</P>
      <P>Each of these relevant Departments and statutory agencies have been asked to designate an official at national level, and also for each of the target areas, who will be responsible for driving the integrated services process within that Department or agency.</P>
      <P>Persons designated at local level have commenced the process of examining the needs of each area and how best to address them, as a team. They are being assisted in this process by a national co-ordinator based in ADM Limited, who is looking after operational aspects of the Project, and his team of four development and monitoring officers, one based in each of the target areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole drive towards a more integrated approach to the design and delivery of State services does have significant implications for <Col N="390" /> Departments and agencies, each of whom has been asked to address a number of generic issues relevant to the development of a more integrated, community-informed modus operandi. Participating Departments and agencies have also been requested to examine, as a matter of urgency, a number of suggestions for local action which emerged in the initial stages of the project.</P>
    <P>The work done in relation to the target areas during the research phase was co-ordinated by ADM Ltd. with a good input from community representatives and front-line workers. It was designed to give some feeling for the sort of issues which need to be tackled in order to secure a more integrated approach. It generated a series of suggestions about possible local actions which are being examined by relevant Departments and agencies. In reality, it has given us a baseline from which to work. It was never my intention to have that work formally published.</P>
    <P>However, as I do appreciate the support and interest which the Deputy has in this project, I will arrange to have a copy of this research work made available to him.</P>
    <P>Up to £500,000 is being made available from my Department's Vote this year for overall administration and salary expenses in respect of the project, which, I should stress is about the integration and enhancement of the delivery of State services and is not a capital grants scheme.

      <Quest>the progress made to date in drawing down money allocated for local initiatives to combat drugs in each of the years 1996 and 1997 arising from the reports of the ministerial task force on the reduction in drugs demand; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid)</NameTxt>
      <P>Following the publication of the ministerial task force report in October 1996, the Government allocated £10 million in 1997 to support the implementation of over 200 separate initiatives in action plans, which were prepared by the local drugs task forces. These task forces were set up to develop and implement an integrated response to the drug problem in their areas; and involve local communities in the planning, design and implementation of that response.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Funding for this initiative is held in the Vote of my Department and is transferred, on request as projects become operational, to other Departments and agencies, which are acting as channels of funding to the approved projects. Approximately, £5.6 million has been drawn down by these Departments and agencies to date and around 88 per cent of the projects are currently in receipt of funding. The balance of the £10 mill<Col N="391" /> ion is being held in the Vote of my Department, for payment to projects as they come on stream.</P>
    <P>An important feature of the initiative is the engagement of local communities in the design and planning of strategies to respond to the drug problem in their areas and in the implementation of approved projects. In the majority of cases, this has been undertaken by voluntary and community groups, in partnership with relevant statutory agencies and assisted by the local drugs task forces. It is hoped that this approach will assist the viability and sustainability of these projects and facilitate their future &ldquo;mainstreaming&rdquo;. However, a vital prerequisite to achieving this is the need to develop the capacity of community and voluntary organisations to deliver locally-based drug programmes and services.</P>
    <P>In the task forces areas where strong community structures were already in place prior to the setting up of the initiative, the emphasis in the action plans was on developing and expanding those structures. Accordingly, in such areas, it was possible to get the majority of approved projects up and running relatively quickly.</P>
    <P>It is notable that these areas either had a long tradition of community involvement in responding to the drug problem or had a local partnership company which had established a strong community network in the area. Conversely, in the areas where community networks were less developed, the emphasis in the plans was on building up these structures and, as a result, it has taken longer to get projects off the ground.</P>
    <P>The four principal features which have impacted on the speed at which projects are being established are the fact that they are designed to address gaps in current service provision means that, in many instances, they have to be designed and planned from scratch; in many instances, appropriate management structures have had to be put in place as a prerequisite to ensuring that the projects will work effectively, meet their objectives and are sustainable with a view to their future &ldquo;mainstreaming&rdquo;; the lack of suitable premises from which programmes and services could be run and, in a number of instances, local opposition to such services, due to a misunderstanding as to their purpose, which is to provide backup and support to the care and after-care services being provided by the health board; and the shortage of appropriately trained personnel to deliver drug programmes and services and the potential competition which this can cause between projects.</P>
    <P>The local drugs task forces, the Departments and agencies acting as channels of funding and the national drug strategy team all play an important role in ensuring the effective implementation and monitoring of the approved projects.</P>
    <P>The task forces assist in the planning and design of the projects and submit regular reports <Col N="392" /> to the national drugs strategy team on progress in their implementation. The team members and the statutory representatives on the task forces are making every effort to assist the projects in overcoming problems or difficulties inhibiting the start-up of projects being funded through their Departments or agencies.</P>
    <P>I would like to assure the Deputy that every effort is being made to ensure that the £10 million provided by the Government to support initiatives in local drugs task force areas is fully spent and on initiatives which will make a considerable positive impact on the lives of the communities.</P>

      <P>The latest tender procedure for the development of a National Conference Centre in Dublin, with EU assistance of up to 33 million ECU under the Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-1999, was organised by Bord Fáilte under the direction of the independent Management Board for Product Development, and advertised in 1997.</P>
      <P>The procedure was conducted under the terms of EU Council Directive 93/37/EEC and Bord Fáilte-led evaluation teams undertook detailed assessments of full tender submissions which were received from five consortia. The management board concluded that the tenders submitted were not such as to enable it to make a recommendation and the process then proceeded in April 1998 to the 'negotiated procedure' stage provided for in Article 7 of the EU directive. This was conducted by an independent team of technical experts, specially appointed for the purpose by Bord Fáilte. On consideration of their findings, and following a positive recommendation by the board of Bord Fáilte, the management board decided on the proposal submitted by Spencer Dock International Convention Centre Ltd to develop the project at a site in Dublin Docklands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the terms of the Operational Programme, decisions on grant applications in respect of amounts at or above 15 million ECU, productive investments, must be made with the agreement of the Government and the EU Commission on foot of a cost-benefit analysis conducted in accordance with Community law. This cost-benefit analysis, which was favourable towards the project, was undertaken by independent consultants and on 16 September 1998 the Government agreed to the making of a submission to the EU Commission recommending formal approval for a 33 million ECU grant towards the cost of developing the project. The final decision of the Commission, who are also concluding their examination of a complaint lodged with them on the <Col N="393" /> tender procedures under the public procurement process, is awaited. All queries subsequently raised by the Commission have been responded to through correspondence and meetings between Bord Fáilte, the management board and Commission officials.</P>
    <P>The developers are still working towards completion within the timeframe of the current Operational Programme, should an early and favourable outcome from the Commission's deliberations on the project be forthcoming.</P>

      <P>The Deputy, and indeed all Members of the House, will be well aware of my abhorrence of drug taking within sport and my commitment to do all within my power to help eliminate this scourge.</P>
      <P>To this end, I launched details of Ireland's first ever national sports anti-doping programme last year. This programme will be operated under the auspices of the Irish Sports Council once the Council is established on a statutory basis. As Deputies will be aware, the Irish Sports Council Bill passed Committee Stage of the House last week.</P>
      <P>While my core objective is the introduction of the national sports anti-doping programme, which is predicated on the active participation of autonomous national governing bodies of sport, I have also felt that the measures in the programme might also be complemented through the application of certain legislative based measures.</P>
      <P>A number of options have been identified which I and my officials are currently pursuing &ndash; specifically in the area of possession and supply of certain performance enhancing drugs. I am for example currently in discussion with my colleague the Minister for Health and Children on the scope available under the Misuse Of Drugs Act for assisting in the battle against doping in sport.</P>
      <P>Drug abuse in sport, of its nature, cannot, of course, be tackled at just the national level. This was borne out at the recent IOC World Conference on Doping in Sport in Lausanne where there was open acknowledgement that doping in sport is an international problem which requires a concerted and co-ordinated response at international level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This has also been acknowledged at European level where the EU has committed itself to work together with sports organisations in the fight against doping in sport. At the instigation of EU <Col N="394" /> Sports Ministers, the European Commission has established a working group composed of officials of the member states to assist in preparing a report on harmonising both national and European assistance for doping control for consideration at an informal conference of Sports Ministers currently scheduled for June. I believe strongly that we should work together collectively to address these issues.</P>
    <P>While I have not spoken directly with the Olympic Council of Ireland, Mr. John Treacy, executive chairman of the Sports Council, was present as an observer, on my behalf, at the International Olympic Committee's Conference on Doping in Sport at Lausanne. I have expressed my disappointment in particular with the stance taken at the conference with regard to the proposals to impose a standard two year sanction for a first offence involving Class 1 substance; and I subsequently wrote to the three national governing bodies whose international federations were reported as not agreeing to the proposal &ndash; Union Cycliste Internationale, FIFA and International Tennis Federation. I am pleased to say that the three national governing bodies have each assured me respectively of their commitment to the anti-doping measures currently in train under the national programme.</P>
    <P>I have also expressed concerns about the proposal that the international anti-doping agency be chaired by the IOC, and in particular the importance for such an agency to be seen to be truly independent if it is to have credibility.</P>

      <P>As I have already indicated in reply to earlier parliamentary questions on this subject, I share the objective of the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation (ITIC) of ensuring that a marketing fund for Irish tourism will be in place for the new millennium. Ireland's performance in a growing but hugely competitive international marketplace has been excellent over the past decade with ambitious targets for foreign earnings and for visitor numbers consistently being achieved. I consider that a marketing fund is essential to maintain and increase visitor numbers.</P>
      <P>Given the uncertainty over and timing of decisions on future EU funding, the introduction of a modest visitor levy, in line with practice in many other countries, is one of the options being considered by my Department, in consultation with ITIC, as a possible mechanism to contribute to the future financing of tourism marketing.</P>

Almost 1,900 applications were received by the closing date and these are being examined at present.

The detailed criteria to be applied in assessing applications are set out in the guidelines for the new programme which issued with the application forms.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16 and 22 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government, in line with the commitment given in the joint programme, An Action Programme for the Millennium, to invite proposals for a national 50-metre swimming pool, decided in November 1997 to initiate a tender procedure to invite such proposals. The tender procedure is being conducted in accordance with EU Council Directive 93/37/EEC, concerning the co-ordination of procedures for the award of public works contracts. A project team was established by the Department to assist with the preparation of invitation to tender documentation and to oversee the tendering process. This team com<Col N="397" /> prises representatives of a number of Government Departments and other organisations.</P>
    <P>The tender procedure notice for the project was published in the Official Journal of the European Communities and in the Irish media in January 1998. The invitation was open to both the public and private sectors. The Department requested developers to come forward with proposals for the design, construction, financing and management of a 50 metre swimming pool, capable of meeting the training requirements of Ireland's high-performance swimmers for international competition. Such developers were required to demonstrate that they had the necessary financial status, technical knowledge and experience to undertake the development. The Government has agreed to provide capital assistance, up to a maximum of £6 million, and annual operational assistance, up to a maximum of £250,000 for a maximum period of 20 years, towards the cost of implementation of the successful tender.</P>
    <P>The deadline for submission of full tenders from qualified candidates was 27 November 1998, and three tender proposals were received on that date. Two tender proposals were deemed to have met the qualification criteria by the project team, which is overseeing the tender process with the assistance of independent professional consultants, and these proposals have proceeded to the evaluation and assessment phase of the project. However, on 18 January 1999, the other tenderer applied for and was given leave by the High Court to seek to have their disqualification set aside, and their tender considered. These proceedings are still ongoing.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile, the detailed evaluation of the two remaining tenders is well advanced, but effectively stalled pending the outcome of the High Court case. The evaluation is being undertaken by an independent multi-disciplinary consultancy team who will produce a full technical assessment and evaluation report for the project team which is overseeing the project. The team will then report its findings and recommendations, following which I will present a memorandum to the Government on the matter. A timetable for the final decision and public announcement on the outcome is conditional, however, on the progress of the High Court proceedings.</P>

The steering committee, which to date has met on four separate occasions, is chaired by Mr. Derek Keogh and includes representatives from major sporting organisations, including the FAI, the GAA and the IRFU, as well as representatives from the private sector and a number of Government Departments.</P>
      <P>The committee is overseeing the preparation of a feasibility study which will address the issues necessary for the Government to make an early decision on the matter. The study will examine a range of issues relevant to the feasibility of developing and operating a stadium, including the economic, social and other benefits that can be expected to be derived, and will analyse potential demand for use of the facilities from various sporting, entertainment and other commercial categories. A process to select experts to carry out the feasibility study, conducted by the steering committee in line with EU and national public procurement procedures was initiated and a number of consultants were subsequently invited to submit tenders for the task by a deadline of 9 February. I understand that selection of the successful proposal to undertake the task will be made very shortly. The steering committee expects that the finalised feasibility study, and the recommendations on it, will be available for consideration by the Government by September 1999.</P>

The eval<Col N="399" /> uation, which reviewed the operation of the local drugs task forces and the national drugs strategy team, found that the local drugs task forces had achieved a number of significant successes in the short time since they were established. In accordance with the recommendations in the report, the Cabinet committee agreed, in principle, to the continuation of the local drugs task forces for the time being, to facilitate the putting in place of an evaluation framework which would include clear statements of the overall aim of the initiative, the specific objectives arising from this aim and the specific targets arising from these objectives, quantified where possible, and appropriate macro-level monitoring arrangements to allow performance against stated objectives and targets to be measured.</P>
    <P>A full review of the local drugs task forces &ndash; having regard to the findings and recommendations of the evaluator &ndash; has now commenced, with a view to submitting proposals on their future operation to the Cabinet committee at an early date. This will pave the way for a review of the overall national drugs strategy, on which work is expected to begin later in the year. The question of including a representative of Dublin Corporation on the national drugs strategy team can be considered in that context.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Mr. Flood)</NameTxt>
      <P>In its two reports, the ministerial task force made a series of recommendations across a range of areas to address the problem of the demand for drugs, including the establishment of structures at national and local level to co-ordinate a response to the problem. As the Deputy will be aware, a Cabinet drugs committee, the national drugs strategy team and 13 local drugs task forces were set up arising out of those recommendations.</P>
      <P>The national drugs strategy team comprises representatives from relevant Government Departments and agencies, along with two persons who bring the perspectives of the voluntary and community sectors to its work. The team's brief is to ensure effective co-ordination between Departments and agencies in implementing the Government's drugs initiative as well as monitoring developments at local level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Local drugs task forces were set up in the areas experiencing the most acute drugs problem to develop and implement an integrated response to the drug problem in those areas; and involve local <Col N="400" /> communities in the planning, design and implementation of that response. On assuming office, the present Government, recognising the links between social exclusion, drug misuse and alienation, decided to re-constitute the Cabinet drugs committee into a wider Cabinet committee on social inclusion, which would address disadvantage in the broadest sense. This committee seeks to pull together the various strategies to combat social exclusion &ndash; and resultant problems such as drug misuse &ndash; into a co-ordinated, targeted response.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile, the task forces have prepared action plans, focusing on the development of community based initiatives to link in with and add value to existing or planned drug programmes and services. The Government has allocated £10 million to support implementation of the approved plans which contain over 200 separate projects, approximately 88 per cent of which have, or are, drawing down funding at this point. Following a recent independent evaluation of the initiative, the Cabinet committee on social inclusion agreed, in principle, to the continuation of the local drugs task forces for the time being, on the basis of an appropriate framework being put in place which would enable the initiative to be measured in terms of outcomes and impacts in due course.</P>
    <P>Under a separate, complementary initiative, the Government has set up a young peoples' facilities and services fund and committed £30 million in Exchequer funding over the period 1998 &ndash; 2000. The purpose of this fund is to develop youth facilities, including sport and recreation facilities, and services in disadvantaged areas where a significant drug problem exists or has the potential to develop, with a view to attracting young people in those areas &ndash; at risk of becoming involved in drugs &ndash; into more healthy and productive pursuits. Of this Exchequer contribution, £20 million is being targeted at the local drugs task force areas, for which integrated facilities and services plans have been prepared and are currently being assessed by an assessment committee chaired by my Department, which will make recommendations to the Cabinet committee on the allocation of funding to support the implementation of these plans. A decision in this regard is expected very shortly.</P>
    <P>There are, as I already mentioned, a range of other recommendations in the two reports. These relate to other Departments and agencies and are being addressed by colleagues within their respective remits.</P>

      <P>My decision to suspend funding for the swimming organisations arises, as the House will be aware, from very serious incidents in the recent past relating to the safety of children in the sport. I will not, therefore, be in a position to consider applications for funding from Swim Ireland until the new Swim Ireland executive has been appointed and the wider membership has expressed its satisfaction with the new procedures and arrangements relating to the safety of the younger members in the sport. The annual general meeting of Swim Ireland is scheduled for 24 April 1999 and I would encourage all members of the new body, constituent clubs, and affiliates to participate wholeheartedly in the preparations for, and the conduct of, the upcoming AGM to ensure that this objective is achieved and confidence in the organisation of the sport is restored. Once this is achieved, applications will be invited under the grant scheme for national governing bodies of sport and under the international carding scheme in respect of its high performance members.</P>

      <P>URBAN is a community initiative of the European Commission under which assistance is made available for integrated development programmes for a <Col N="402" /> limited number of geographically defined deprived urban areas throughout the EU. The Operational Programme for URBAN in Ireland has total funding of about £21 million over the period 1994 to 1999 and operates in three areas: north Dublin, Ballymun, Finglas and Darndale; south Dublin, west Tallaght and north Clondalkin; and the northside of Cork City.</P>
      <P>Although the Commission's Agenda 2000 proposals do not contemplate the continuance of the URBAN initiative after 1999, the Government has decided that Ireland should press for the retention of the URBAN Initiative in the context of the overall package being sought for Ireland. Concern has already been expressed on behalf of the Irish government at the structural actions group and at the general affairs committee in Brussels that the type of schemes and projects assisted by URBAN in this round should not be neglected in the event that URBAN is not renewed. In response, the Commission has stated that the type of scheme and project now assisted by URBAN could also be assisted from within the general scope of the European Regional Development Fund and the ESF post-1999.</P>
      <P>The Commission is seeking to mainstream the lessons learned <i>via</i> its Framework for Action on Sustainable Urban Development which will influence urban programming in the future. The Framework for Action's main themes reflect those of Ireland's current Operational Programme for Local, Urban and Rural Development &ndash; LURD. Whatever the position with regard to the URBAN Programme post-1999, the Government has indicated that it will not be deflected from its commitment to tackle social exclusion in deprived urban areas. In relation to those programmes in the area of social exclusion, which are eligible for EU co-financing under the current round, the Government has indicated that it will, within the overall parameters of EU and other funding available post-1999, ensure that the objectives of these programmes remain a priority.</P>
      <P>The Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation is taking account of the experience being gained from the implementation of the URBAN initiative in the cities of Dublin and Cork, in the context of the formulation of its strategy for local development post-1999.</P>

      <P>The city and county enterprise boards &ndash; CEBs &ndash; are locally controlled enterprise development companies established in each county and urban authority area in Ireland. The function of the boards is to develop indigenous enterprise potential and to stimulate economic activity at local level. CEBs may provide grant assistance to micro projects &ndash; ten employees or less &ndash; in manufacturing, tourism and services provided the promoter can demonstrate that the project is viable, will not displace jobs elsewhere in the economy, will focus on new initiatives in fields where they can best fill gaps rather than duplicate provision, will involve the creation of sustainable employment, and requires grant assistance to enable the project to develop.</P>
      <P>Separately FÁS has a number of initiatives to assist persons to set up their own businesses and also to assist persons already in business. One of the key initiatives is the FÁS business appraisal training programme which directly assists persons to investigate a business opportunity and to bring it forward into the market place. A total of 316 persons in 1998 took part in this programme. The FÁS co-operative development unit also provides funding to assist persons form worker co-operatives in services and manufacturing. A total of 17 new co-operatives were established in 1999, creating 76 new jobs. Funding is available to assist recruitment and training. Existing co-operatives are also supported in their early stages of development. For persons already in business, FÁS offers financial support for training through its training support scheme in manufacturing and other sectors, including retail. The emphasis in the scheme is towards smaller companies, for example, 80 per cent grants are available for companies employing 20 persons or less. The Deputy's Question and suggestion will be brought to the attention of FÁS's retail industry training advisory committee.</P>
      <P>Officials of my Department have met the Irish Organisation of Market and Street Traders, a body established to promote the interests of street traders in the context of the casual trading legislation. The meetings have normally been concerned with discussions on the implementation of the Casual Trading Act, 1995, and problems encountered by traders with local authorities. The Casual Trading Act, 1995, devolved all operational responsibility for regulating casual trading to local authorities and this remains the case. Consequently it is the local authorities who now determine the implementation of the Act and it is to those authorities that representations should be directed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While this is not an exhaustive list of all the programmes available for businesses from agencies operating from my Department for traders and/or manufacturers I would suggest that the <Col N="404" /> Irish Organisation of Market and Street Traders, if they have not already done so, should contact the relevant agency with particular projects in mind.</P>

      <P>The community employment programme is designed to specifically target a severely disadvantaged group of unemployed persons, that is, those registered long-term unemployed whose principal or only source of income is an unemployment compensation payment or certain other social welfare means-tested payments. These are the persons who are at most disadvantage in the labour market. This targeting maximises the availability of places by part financing the programme from savings in social welfare payments. Married social welfare recipients can swap their entitlement with a spouse in order for that person to quality for community employment.</P>
      <P>A decision to alter the criteria under which the programme operates to include persons not in receipt of a qualifying social welfare payment would be contrary to the objective of community employment and also, given that the programme is operating at capacity level relative to available resources, at the expense of eligible persons waiting for a place on the programme.</P>
      <P>Persons signing on for credits &ndash; who in many cases would have been in employment relatively recently &ndash; can access the FÁS employment services, with a view to getting employment. They can also participate in a return to work course, or other FÁS courses if places are available, if that is the appropriate course of action for the individual. They can also attend full-time education courses while retaining eligibility for credits.</P>

      <P>The Companies Acts 1963-1990 require a firm using the word limited to be registered with the <Col N="407" /> Registrar of Companies. Failure to do so is an offence under section 381 of the Companies Act, 1963. The registrar informs me that Millennium Guttering Limited is not registered. Furthermore, there is a requirement under the Registration of Business Names Act, 1963, that a company operating in a name which is not its company name must be registered as a business name. The registrar has also informed me that Millennium Guttering Limited is not registered under that Act.</P>
      <P>If the Deputy can provide more precise details in relation to the company, the matter will be investigated further in the context of the Companies Acts.</P>
      <P>The Director of Consumer Affairs has informed me that she has no record of receiving a complaint about this firm. I, therefore, cannot comment on the allegation that it is offering shoddy or imaginary work and if the Deputy has received any complaints in this regard, he should communicate them to the Director immediately.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 40 and 41 together.</P>
      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the replacement of the Harbours Act, 1946, in the context that it is the statute under which Sligo Harbour Commissioners currently operate and are responsible for the management and control of Sligo Harbour.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, the Government's An Action Programme for the Millennium identifies as a key priority transferring small harbours to local control to develop marine leisure activities in the context of securing and enhancing the livelihoods of the coastal communities who depend on the sea for their future. Partnership 2000 commits to review the strategic options for the future development and management of declining commercial regional ports. The strategy statement 1998-2000 of the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources commits as a key objective to facilitate the restructuring of the roles of sub-regional ports.</P>
      <P>In this connection consultants have been contracted to undertake a review of State regional ports and harbours with a cargo throughput of less than 250,000 tonnes. Sligo Harbour is included in this review. The intention is to develop a general strategic framework for these ports and harbours, having regard to their differing conditions and potential, and to recommend generic and port/harbour related models and options which will best deliver the objectives of the strategic framework. The review will also critically address financing, port viability and future prospects.</P>
      <P>In relation to the Harbours Act, 1946, the position is that pending completion of the review and consideration of its findings the Harbour Authorities concerned including Sligo will continue to operate under that Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 42 to 44, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may be assured that the case to which she refers has been raised frequently through the framework of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference. Following further recent inquiries by the Department of Foreign Affairs, through the Anglo-Irish Secretariat, the British side have confirmed that seven people were arrested in connection with the case but all were subsequently released. There have been no charges as yet and the investigation is continuing.</P>
      <P>In relation to the specific question of an inquest raised by the Deputy, the British authorities have stated that the decision as to whether and when to hold an inquest is a matter for the discretion of the coroner. They add that the coroner is presently not in a position to consider whether to hold an inquest into the death of the person in question as he has not yet received all the relevant papers. The British side have also indicated that coroners in Northern Ireland usually await the outcome of any police investigation before deciding whether to hold an inquest. In this case, the coroner has been advised that the RUC investigation is ongoing.</P>
      <P>The British authorities have also indicated that the referral of a death to the coroner normally leads to some delay in the issuing of a death certificate. The principal reasons for this are the need for an investigation into the circumstances of the death which may ultimately lead to criminal proceedings, the need for a post-mortem examination and ultimately an inquest hearing. I can assure the Deputy that the Department of Foreign Affairs will continue to monitor this case closely.</P>

      <P>The CIE report, Public Transport Investment Needs Review for the Greater Cork Area, which was submitted to me in 1998 considered the question of re-opening the Cork to Midleton line. The conclusion reached was that, based on current population levels and commuter patterns, the necessary investment in the line could not be justified in the short to medium term, but that the option should be kept under review in the longer term.</P>
      <P>In a report I made to Government last week on the future development of suburban rail in Dublin and Cork, I suggested that the reopening of this line could be considered, not on the basis of current passenger demand but in anticipation of future developments. The Government agreed that I should arrange for the detailed costing and feasibility work on the various suburban rail proposals. The outcome of this work will be considered as part of the strategic transport needs for the country as a whole in the context of the preparation of the national development plan.</P>

      <P>As I stated in my December Budget Statement, the Government is conscious of the growing wish for a recognition of child care needs in the tax system. I took the opportunity in the Budget Statement to outline a number of the important and complex issues that the question of child care tax relief raises.</P>
      <P>The first of these issues is the question of equity between parents who stay at home to care for children and those who have to meet additional child care expenses when they go out to work. There is also the need for a balanced treatment of those who are in the tax system and those who rely on social welfare benefits and for finding the right balance between measures to help towards the cost of child care and measures to improve the supply and quality of child care facilities to meet the growing demand.</P>
      <P>The Government has already discussed these issues in some detail and proposes to examine the matter further. Certain measures were announced in the budget to facilitate and encourage the supply of child care places and these are provided for in the Finance Bill which is at Report Stage before the House today.</P>
      <P>The Government will, of course, take into consideration the views of the interdepartmental committee which the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has established to evaluate the recommendations made by the various expert groups that have reported on the child care issue. Any proposals in the taxation area arising from this committee's deliberations will be considered in the context of the preparation of the next budget.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
      <Quest>the amount of income he will raise in 1998 and 1999 from Irish residents who are in receipt of a US social security pension through the charges in section 200 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997; the reason the Government agreed the new double taxation convention with the USA; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[7528/99]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Provisions were included in the new US Double Taxation Convention (Article 18(1)(b)) to exempt US social security pensions paid to residents of Ireland from tax in the US. Such pensions had previously been subject to a final US withholding tax at a rate of 15 per cent up to January 1995 and at an effective rate of 25.5 per cent thereafter. This generally resulted in a much higher rate of tax in the US than would apply if the pensions were taxed only in Ireland.</P>
      <P>Although there are exemptions from US withholding tax on pensions in some of the US's older treaties, the exemption obtained for Irish recipients is a first in a modern US treaty. It was only reluctantly conceded on the basis that these pensions would be liable to tax in Ireland, subject to whatever allowances and exemptions applied. The US was concerned not to create a double exemption for such pensions. As a result, section 200 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1977, was amended in order to remove any doubt concerning the liability to Irish tax of these pensions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="418" /> It is unlikely that any additional revenue was raised in 1998 as a result of this change. It is impossible to make accurate predictions about the yield for future years. This depends on the amount of the pension payments and the particular position of the individual recipients in relation to any other income they have and their Irish tax allowances and exemptions. At the time the convention was entered into, however, it was estimated, on the basis of figures provided by the US, that US tax paid in respect of these pensions was around £5 million and that if Irish tax were paid instead it would be less than half of this, based on an estimate of the effective Irish rates involved.</P>
    <P>Ireland's original tax convention with the US came into force in 1951. It was Ireland's oldest and, perhaps, most important treaty. It had, however, become outdated in relation to business needs and the tax policies of both countries. For example, it did not include a capital gains tax article leading to the prospect of double taxation for capital gains. A number of attempts had been made over the years to update the convention and in 1986 a draft text was substantially agreed, but not concluded due to changes in US tax laws and personnel involved in the negotiations. Discussions recommenced in earnest in July, 1995 leading to the new convention which came into force on 1 January 1998.</P>

      <P>A nurse from the Philippines applying for registration with An Bord Altranais would be treated in the same way as any applicant from outside the EU. The applicant must forward a completed application form and the appropriate fee to the board. The applicant must then arrange for a transcript of education and training, verification of registration or licence and references to be sent directly from source to the board. Applicants are then assessed on an individual basis and will be approved if the applicant meets the standards or criteria set down by the board. Approval may be subject to the nurse completing a period of theoretical or clinical instruction or orientation. An application for registration will only be refused if the applicant fails to satisfy the board that his or her training was adequate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on means. Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board. Medical cards are issued to persons, who in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.</P>
      <P>Income guidelines have been drawn up by the chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these are revised annually in line with the consumer price index. However, these guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that his/her medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. Medical cards may also be awarded to individual family members on this basis.</P>
      <P>In view of this special provision, I do not feel it justifiable, nor did previous Governments, on health policy grounds to extend an automatic entitlement to a medical card to any specific group without any reference to their means. It is open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board if they are unable to provide these services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.</P>
      <P>Non-medical card holders are entitled to a broad range of health services including an entitlement to public hospital and public consultant treatment subject only to modest statutory charges and out-patient services free of charge. There are a number of schemes which provide assistance towards the cost of medication.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should also point out that, while I am appreciative of the contribution nurses make to the health services and the wider community, it <Col N="423" /> would not be appropriate to treat nurses any differently to other categories of health care workers in respect of access to health care.</P>

      <P>Since my appointment as Minister for Health and Children, and despite the many competing demands made on the resources available to my Department, I have consistently identified as one of my priorities the provision of the additional residential, respite and day services outlined in the document Services to Persons with a Mental Handicap &ndash; An Assessment of Need 1999 &ndash; 2001. This year I was pleased to be in a position to provide additional funding of £12 million, with a full year cost of £18 million in 2000, for the further development of new services in line with the needs identified in the Assessment of Need. At least £10 million capital funding from the national capital programme will also be allocated to support the development of these new services.</P>
      <P>Of this additional funding, £3.635 million has been allocated to the Eastern Health Board, with a full year cost of £4.61 million in 2000. Details of the precise services to be put in place in the Eastern Region from this additional funding, including services in south-east Dublin and east Wicklow, and the individuals who will benefit from these services are agreed by the central mental handicap planning committee.</P>
      <P>As a result of this process, I understand services in the south Dublin and Wicklow area are to receive additional funding of £585,000 in respect of 21 new residential/respite places and an initial allocation of £310,000 in respect of 31 day places. Further discussions are taking place to finalise the overall position regarding day services in 1999. The agencies who will benefit from this funding include St. John of God Services, Cheeverstown House, Stewart's Hospital, Peamount Hospital and Sunbeam House.</P>
      <P>A sum of £1 million has also been set aside by the Eastern Health Board for the management of emergency cases which will arise during the year. This will give the board the flexibility to deal with crisis situations as the need arises.</P>

      <Quest>if he will report on the anomaly which exists whereby pre-1953 contributions are not eligible for consideration for contributory old age pensions; the proposals, if any, he has to remedy the situation; and the numbers of people who are in this category.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>To qualify for the old age (contributory) pension, a person must (i) have entered insurance at least 10 years before pension <Col N="429" /> age; (ii) have at least 156 contributions paid; and (iii) have a yearly average of at least 20 contributions (or 24 in the case of a retirement pension) registered since January 1953 (when the unified system of social insurance came into effect), or the time they commenced insurable employment, if later.</P>
      <P>This yearly average condition was further reduced to ten contributions for the new pro-rata old age (contributory) pension which came into effect from 21 November 1997.</P>
      <P>The purpose of these qualifying conditions is to link entitlement to a pension with a reasonable level of contributions to the Social Insurance Fund during the course of a person's career.</P>
      <P>Prior to 1953, three different types of contributions were payable &ndash; national health insurance, widow's and orphan's pension and unemployment insurance contributions. These gave specific entitlement only to the benefits of the schemes under which they were paid.</P>
      <P>Social insurance contributions paid prior to 1953 can be taken into account for old age (contributory) pension purposes in satisfying the first two conditions, set out above, but cannot be used in calculating the yearly average.</P>
      <P>However, I am committed to ensuring the broadest possible contributory pension cover to as many people as possible, and in that context, my Department is currently carrying out a review of the qualifying conditions for retirement and old age (contributory) pensions. I would like to assure the Deputy that this review will pay particular attention to the operation of the yearly average test and the possibility of using contributions paid prior to 1953 will be specifically examined.</P>
      <P>Figures requested by the Deputy are not available at present.</P>

      <Quest>the proposals, if any, he has to increase the level of units to certain categories of pensioners who live alone under the free electricity allowance scheme where there is medical certification of extreme hardship whereby special heating or other needs arise; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The free electricity allowance is available to people, usually aged 66 or over, who are either in receipt of a welfare type payment or who satisfy a means test and who are either living alone or who otherwise satisfy this condition. It is also available to people with disabilities under the age of 66 who are in receipt of certain welfare type pensions. In addition, widows/widowers between the ages of 60 and 65, whose late spouses were in receipt of the allowance, retain that entitlement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="430" /> The free electricity allowance covers a standard number of units, up to 1,500 each year, in addition to the normal standing charges. VAT due on this standard allowance is also covered. The value of the allowance, if fully taken up, is £154.09 per annum.</P>
    <P>One of the qualifying conditions for the free electricity allowance is that the applicant must be living alone or living only with certain excepted people. If the applicant is disabled and residing with someone who provides them with full-time care and attention, medical certification of the applicant's disability must be supplied. Applicants for the free electricity allowance, who are living alone, are not required to submit any form of medical certification with their applications. The allowance is a standard one provided to all recipients and there is no provision in the scheme to vary this allowance to cater for special needs associated with the medical condition of the recipient.</P>
    <P>There are currently no proposals to change the free electricity allowance scheme. A major review of the free schemes has just commenced and the question of providing for special needs will be considered in the context of this review. The review will be completed later this year and will then be considered in a budgetary context.</P>
    <P>There is already provision for special heating needs through the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. Under this scheme, a person who has special heating needs due to ill health or infirmity, may qualify for a heating supplement which can be paid in addition to other social welfare payments, including the free electricity allowance. An application for a heating supplement may be made by contacting the community welfare officer at the local health centre.</P>

      <P>On 15 October 1998 the person concerned, who was receiving an unemployment assistance payment, applied to his local Social Welfare Office for child dependent allowance in respect of his dependent child.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The claimant and his wife are separated. His wife is in receipt of child dependent allowance on her deserted wife's benefit payment in respect of the child concerned. Where a couple are separated, child dependent allowance is paid to the <Col N="431" /> parent with whom the child is normally resident. It was necessary to interview the person concerned to verify the circumstances. In the normal course of events this would be done more quickly. However, in this case it proved difficult, mainly because he changed his address on a number of occasions and failed to attend for interview when this had been scheduled for him. He was finally interviewed on 5 March 1999.</P>
    <P>It has now been decided that the person concerned was entitled to a child dependent allowance in respect of his child from 24 September 1998. Payment of child dependent allowance and any arrears due will issue to him within the next ten days.</P>

    <P>Applications were invited in relation to the Equal Opportunities Child Care Programme in the national newspapers and the closing date for receipt of applications for funding under this two year programme was May/June, 1998. All funding is being allocated on the basis of applications received in advance of the May/June 1998 deadline. The bulk of this funding was allocated in July of last year and a further £450,000 falls to be allocated this year in respect of applicants which met the qualifying criteria under the Capital Infrastructure strand. The allocation of child care funding to my Department post 1999 has not yet been addressed.</P>

This process facilitates the identification of any gaps which may exist in the training area, and will inform Sports Council recommendations as to future initiatives at the level of governing bodies and the National Coaching and Training Centre to facilitate the effective development of sport in Ireland.</P>

      <P>The criteria for allocating financial assistance to recognised national governing bodies of sport is set out in sections 15 and 16 of the reference book of this Department under the Freedom of Information Act, 1997. Having regard to this criteria, a small number of major national governing bodies of sport were deemed to be self-sufficient in terms of their ability to meet their administration costs, primarily because <Col N="435" /> of their success in generating income from commercial sources. Therefore, the Irish Sports Council recommended that funding for these organisations should be directed at specific programmes provided by them, especially programmes aimed particularly at the development of, and increasing participation in, sports in disadvantaged areas, which also open up new opportunities for communities in such areas to avail of the organisational skills and expertise of these bodies.</P>

      <P>As and from January, 1999 the national governing bodies which represent swimming are Swim Ireland, which replaces the disbanded Irish amateur swimming association, and its affiliate, the Irish Schools Swimming Association. My decision to suspend funding for the swimming organisations arises, as the House will be aware, from very serious incidents in the recent past relating to the safety of children in the sport.</P>
      <P>I will not, therefore, be in a position to consider applications for funding from either of these swimming bodies until the new Swim Ireland's executive has been appointed and the wider membership has expressed its satisfaction with the new procedures and arrangements relating to the safety of the younger members in the sport. The Annual General Meeting of Swim Ireland is scheduled for 24 April 1999 and I would encourage all members of the new body, constituent clubs, and affiliates to participate wholeheartedly in the preparations for, and the conduct of, the upcoming AGM to ensure that this objective is achieved and confidence in the organisation of the sport is restored.</P>
      <P>Once this is achieved, applications will be invited under the grant scheme for national governing bodies of sport and under the international carding scheme in respect of their high performance members.</P>
      <P>I approved a special grant in 1998 to the Irish Amateur Swimming Association, now Swim Ireland, solely for the purpose of bringing forward the AGM from April to January. This sum was a contribution towards the legal and administrative costs of bringing forward the AGM and the creation of a database of members.</P>

      <P>In relation to tourism, liaison with tourism agencies and the industry is a prominent feature of arrangements for the operation of the EU Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-99 and, in particular, the Overseas Tourism Marketing Initiative. Furthermore, my Department is currently consulting with the agencies and industry about its outline strategy for the continued development of tourism in the context of the next round of EU structural funding covering the period 2000-06. The strategy includes a vision for the future, key objectives and targets and a proposed strategic approach in the areas of marketing, training and product. The aim is to develop a shared vision for the future, involving a partnership approach between the Exchequer, the European Union, the state agencies and the private sector which has proved so successful in the context of the two operational programmes to date.</P>
      <P>In the area of sport, consultations have taken place between my Department, the executive chairman of the Sports Council and the national governing bodies of sport in the context of their overall development plans and their five year strategic plans for the development of their respective sports.</P>
      <P>Apart from such specific consultation processes, my Department liaises with these bodies on an ongoing basis, both formally and informally, on a broad range of issues relating to tourism and sporting policy. In essence, I am satisfied with the level of contact between my Department, its agencies and tourism and sporting organisations.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 110, 111, 112 and 113 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the new national lottery funded sports capital programme, which was advertised at the end of 1998 following a review of the existing programme, funding will continue to be allocated on the basis of individual applications received. However, applicants are now required to consult with other clubs and community groups, including schools with sport and recreational facilities in their areas and the local authority before making an application for funding and to show the outcome of such consultations. The purpose of this is to ensure that regard is had to identified needs of the area and that the proposed development <Col N="438" /> does not result in overlap with and/or duplication of existing facilities. Sports clubs developing projects at national and regional levels are also required to ensure that their proposals are consistent with the priorities of their national governing bodies.</P>
    <P>In addition, my Department will consult as appropriate, when assessing applications, with other relevant departments and agencies, including the Irish Sports Council, with a view to ensuring co-ordination in the provision of sport and recreational facilities at local level.</P>

      <P>The staffing of a national school for a particular year is determined by the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous year. The enrolment at Burriscarra national school on 30 September 1997 was 56 pupils resulting in the school's current staffing of a principal and two assistant teachers. Additionally, the school has the services of a remedial teacher.</P>
      <P>The staffing allocations for primary schools for the 1999-2000 school year are in the process of being finalised. However, in light of this school's decline in enrolment to 51 pupils in September 1998, it is unlikely that the school will retain its second assistant's post in the 1999-2000 school year.</P>
      <P>When the staffing arrangements for the 1999/2000 school year are finally determined, I have asked my officials to review the school's entitlement and thereafter to correspond with the school's managerial authorities directly in the matter.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 124, 125, 127, 128 and 129 together.</P>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Deputy Bruton's Priority Question of 2 December, 1998 where I dealt with this matter at length. I have also dealt comprehensively with the issue in replies to subsequent questions on 3 December, 1998 and on 24 February 1999. In addition, I have offered access to the Department's file on the matter to any Deputy in the House with an interest in the case, this offer remains.</P>
      <P>As I indicated in my earlier replies, a letter of complaint regarding the principal in question was received by the Department in 1982. This letter referred to his removal from his former position as principal of a primary school as a result of allegations of abuse of boys in his class in the period 1965-70. The letter also indicated that the author had been in touch with the authorities of the secondary school in which the former principal was then teaching. I have been informed by officials of my Department that there is no record of an internal report submitted by an inspector in relation to these allegations. As I have clearly stated previously, I believe that the Department's response to this complaint was seriously lacking. The Deputy will appreciate that procedures for handling such cases are now significantly different.</P>
      <P>The safety of pupils in national schools is first and foremost the responsibility of the school and its management authorities. The role of my Department is to assist schools in carrying out their responsibilities by informing them of best practice and by ensuring, as far as practicable, that they adhere to such practice. Under current procedures relating to the safety of children in schools, my Department also ensures that any allegations are fully and properly investigated and acted upon, and reported to the Gardai or health authorities where appropriate. Procedures relating to the safety of children and in particular relating to sex abuse are kept under continuous review by my Department to ensure that children are protected. A full review of procedures is at present being carried out by my Department in association with the Department of Health and Children and I will ensure that updated guidelines will be issued to all schools following completion of that review, which I expect to receive in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am strongly of the view that a register of sex offenders would provide for greater protection of children from the actions of sex offenders. Last month, the Government approved the prep<Col N="443" /> aration of a Bill which will include provisions relating to the establishment of a sex offenders register, the principal focus of which would be offenders against children.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, the case she refers to has been dealt with in the courts following a Garda investigation and, accordingly, an inquiry has been conducted. This said, as I have stated in both Houses, I have asked for any information which any person associated with this case believes to be important to be brought to the attention of my Department and this will be comprehensively considered and acted upon if necessary.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to introducing mandatory reporting procedures and the Department of Health and Children is proceeding expeditiously with comprehensive public consultations before the finalisation of proposals. I believe that a system of mandatory reporting would have helped address the capacity for the person concerned to move from school to school. I believe that the procedures now applied by my Department in cases such as this would have a <Col N="444" /> similar effect in practice to such a legal requirement. It is also, of course, the case that a legal requirement on the school to report the allegations may have facilitated an earlier prosecution for the offences concerned.</P>

      <P>The investigation of cases of alleged sexual abuse by teachers is a matter for the health authorities and the Garda, and my Department has no function in such investigations. It does, however, offer all assistance that might be helpful in these circumstances.</P>
