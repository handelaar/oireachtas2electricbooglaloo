      <P>It is my sad duty, on behalf of the Government, to extend sympathy to the families and friends of the valiant members of the Air Corps who lost their lives in this morning's tragic accident, Captain Dave O'Flaherty, Captain Mick Baker, Sergeant Paddy Mooney and Corporal Niall Byrne. These are the first fatalities while on active service experienced by the Air Corps since the foundation of the State. It is all the more poignant that this tragedy occurred while the crew, having successfully carried out their role in a search and rescue mission, were themselves seeking safe harbour. It is a timely reminder of the risks undertaken daily by members of the Defence Forces in carrying out routine missions. Our thoughts are with the relatives and friends of the deceased and their grieving colleagues in the Air Corps and other branches of the Defence Forces. It is sad that they went to save and were themselves lost.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a deep sense of personal loss because I was flown on occasion by the men concerned when Taoiseach. The level of professionalism and dedication shown was at all times exemplary in the way in which it expressed the spirit of the Defence Forces and a sense of service to the people and democracy. This dreadful event is a sad reminder that when members of the Air Corps fly a helicopter they put their lives at risk to the point where their families would not have a father or husband. It is also a reminder to all those who put their lives at risk at sea that in so doing they are putting at risk the lives of those who may be called upon to rescue them. In this instance, those lives have been lost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We share the deep sense of loss of the wife of David O'Flaherty, the family of Michael Baker, the wife and three children of Paddy Mooney and the family of Niall Byrne. It is the responsibility of every citizen to ensure this does not happen again by not taking unnecessary risks and by providing at all times the necessary resources for <Col N="1022" /> those engaged in air-sea and other forms of rescue operations to ensure their safety.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party, I extend our deep-felt sympathy to the families of the four men who died this morning in the tragic crash. It is a sad but necessary reminder of the dangers faced by some of those who work on our behalf. In this instance, having achieved their mission of saving lives, they lost their own. I pay tribute to the professionalism of the Defence Forces and extend our deep-felt sympathy to the wife of Captain Dave O'Flaherty, the family of Captain Michael Baker, the wife and children of Sergeant Paddy Mooney and the family of Corporal Niall Byrne. It is a reminder that we can take things for granted. It is only when there is a tragedy that this harsh reality is brought home to us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Green Party, we were deeply sorry to hear of the deaths of the four members of the Air Corps killed in County Waterford. Our loss is deeply felt given our great admiration for the work of the Air Corps in routine and air-sea rescue operations. There was a recent example in north County Dublin which instilled in us a sense of pride. It is hard to comprehend that we are now thinking about the deaths of such brave people. We wish to say how sorry we are and to extend our sympathy to their families. Hopefully, attention will be given to whatever happened in this case to ensure that, in future, the risks taken by these people are minimised to the greatest extent.</P>

      <P>As a Deputy who lives in Tramore and has a long involvement with Waterford airport, I extend my deepest sympathy and the deepest sympathy of the people of Tramore to the relatives of Air Corps members Captain Dave O'Flaherty, Captain Michael Baker, Sergeant Paddy Mooney and Corporal Niall Byrne who lost their lives on Tramore beach. Their deaths are all the more poignant in that they were returning from a rescue mission when this terrible accident occurred. We will always be in debt to people such as these men whose work is dedicated, at great risk to themselves, to the rescue of those in distress. Ar dheis Dé go raibh siad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with other Members in offering deepest sympathy to the families of the four members of the Air Corps who tragically lost their lives last night. I have just been speaking to the Minister, Deputy Woods, on the telephone. He has extended deepest sympathy on behalf of all Members of the House to those on the ground. On behalf of the people of Waterford and of the south-east region, I offer deepest sympathy. I also wish to thank the rescue services in Bunmahon, Dunmore East and Tramore who were at the scene very quickly and were successful in locating the helicopter.</P>

      <P>On European affairs, I have repeatedly asked on the Order of Business when the Government will indicate the nominee for the position of European Commissioner. I am disappointed that this has not occurred. This is not due to a prurient interest in who will get the glittering prize. It is far more fundamental. Under the Amsterdam Treaty, the new Commission must be ratified by the European Parliament. President Prodi&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a motion that the Dáil should adjourn until 29 September. I believe legislation will be required to break the deadlock in the current talks in Northern Ireland and to give legislative clarity to commitments to decommission and to the consequences of failure to fulfil such commitments.</P>
      <P>As the institutions encompass this jurisdiction as well as the UK, such legislation should be passed here as well as in Westminster. This should be done quickly while the talks are still in progress and certainly before Drumcree. Therefore, the Dáil should not adjourn until 29 September but until next Monday to facilitate the possibility of such legislation being enacted. Obviously, it is a matter of judgment for the Governments as to whether that is necessary. However, the House should not decide to adjourn until the end of September given that there is a strong likelihood it will be necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of that but at that point there will be no possibility of making an alternative decision.</P>
      <P>This House will not be crowded between now and 29 September. The Government might take time to consider two possibilities that may emerge. The first is, as we heard from the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and from the Taoiseach, that there might be a necessity to enact legislative measures. These would have the support of all sides of the House and this party will be available to facilitate the Government as early as is deemed necessary.</P>
      <P>I am not attempting to be political in raising the second matter. In view of the difficulties surrounding the liquor licensing legislation, the Government should consider a one day sitting late in July to facilitate the work of the committees&mdash;</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Green Party, I want to express our opposition to No. b6. It is not appropriate for us to debate the Adjournment of the Dáil when there are other matters which ought to be discussed. Effectively, it is a waste of time discussing the Adjournment of the Dáil. We should decide to return next week to deal with matters relating to Northern Ireland, the fact that Ireland is in court over wildlife legislation and the Údarás na Gaeltachta legislation which yesterday we asked to be taken next week.</P>

I am sure everyone in the House will join with us in wishing and hoping the day's business there will go well. I appreciate the thoughtful way in which the matters were put and I can certainly give a commitment on behalf of the Government that if it is necessary to recall the Dáil to discuss legislation that will be done.</P>

The Minister should announce the proposal today in the House so that we can debate it. What is the Minister frightened of?

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 7, line 15, after &ldquo;FUNCTIONS to insert &ldquo;ALWAYS COGNISANT OF THE BASIC ROLE OF EDUCATION TO DEVELOP THE WHOLE PERSON&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is an amendment to the long title of the Bill. I tabled this amendment because an issue arose during Committee Stage in the policy area on whether the Bill laid sufficient emphasis on policy and if there was a sufficiency of wording that would make it clear that at the end of the day, education is about the development of the whole person. I have a certain fear that the Bill might be conceived as a reaction to the marketplace as distinct from a reaction to what is necessary in the context of our education system. Certainly the binary system, which has become an integral part of Irish education, has on one side, the university type education where there is a clearer definition in relation to the humanities and that aspect of education. I am interested to hear the Minister's response. This amendment would strengthen the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1032" /> There is an holistic aspect to education that relates to the development of the whole person, not to the development of particular skills and expertise. If that broadly based approach is not underpinning the development of the technological sector this deficiency could have a detrimental effect on the quality of the education provided in the technological sector over time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Shea has proposed that the long title of the Bill be amended to include &ldquo;always cognisant of the basic role of education to develop the whole person&rdquo; and his amendment No. 9 is similar. The amendment appears to imply that the Bill concerns education <i>per se</i> when in fact the Bill is essentially about qualifications and standards in education and training. The Bill does not endeavour to make a distinction between education and training. Clearly the Bill is about education but is also about training. One could enter into a long philosophical debate about the impact of training on individuals and the impact of education on individuals. There is a strong element of personal development in all education and training programmes.</P>
      <P>However, the Bill is not only concerned with the technological sector. It also deals with training undertaken by bodies such as FÁS, CERT and Teagasc, which have a strong vocational skills based content to their programmes. It sets out the qualifications framework for all these concerns and the programmes they provide. I am not in favour of the amendment for these reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Minister's point that the Bill is concerned with education and training and reaches back into other areas. However, education should be defined as it will apply to the legislation when it is implemented and as the proposed authority and councils are established. I seek a statement of intent which clearly defines and outlines what we mean by education.</P>
      <P>We discussed the lack of reference to policy in the Bill on Committee Stage. Perhaps it has become too technical and market oriented. The basic point of all education is that each individual is developed through the system to the fullness of his or her potential. While there may be a need for a segregation between education and training, I do not accept the amendment seeks to link the two, rather it proposes to amend the Bill as it provides for and deals with education. It does not propose any fundamental change to the Bill, but it focuses attention on the essence of education, which must be kept before the minds of providers at all times through whatever system the Department implements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a time of great technological advancement, where there are continuing skills shortages, we may develop a reactive approach to fulfilling a certain need but in doing so we may lose sight of the fundamental role of education which is concerned with the development of people, not only in the context of the workplace but in the context <Col N="1033" /> of their personal fulfilment, the communities to which they belong and the contribution they can make. I am concerned that the Bill is developing a focus too much weighted in the direction of the marketplace as against the essence of education and the fundamental philosophy underpinning it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is unfair to suggest that the passing of a qualifications Bill represents the domination of the marketplace over the education of the whole person. We must take account of the fact that the House enacted the Education Act, which is a fundamental Act in itself and is the first time we put education on a comprehensive legislative footing. It embraces many of the concepts articulated by the Deputy, which I share.</P>
      <P>However, this is a qualifications Bill. We should not highlight the education over the training sector in the context of developing a qualifications framework. The issues raised by the Deputy are valid in the context of overall education policy, which is always the preserve of the Minister of the day and which the providers and those who work under the aegis of the Department and the various institutions must take on board.</P>
      <P>I do not believe the Deputy's amendment is correct for this Bill where we have treated education and training in a combined way. At this late stage it would be wrong to highlight one over the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed with the Minister's response. Education and training cannot be segregated as they apply to a person because the person needs to be educated and needs to acquire basic skills, such as numeracy and literacy. However, in the case of apprenticeships the emphasis now is on standards reached as distinct from time served. This could mean that the education component of apprenticeship training can be too small.</P>
      <P>It is disingenuous of the Minister to suggest that I am trying to segregate training from education. Education is a foundation, whether it be in the context of further educational awards, training, apprenticeship or whatever. However, the role and input of education do not stop at that point. When people pursue apprenticeships, technological courses and so on, it is most important that there be a sufficient educational component that serves the requirements of the person at that time in his or her life.</P>
      <P>I am not critical of the Bill in the sense suggested by the Minister. I seek to ensure that when the legislation is interpreted by the proposed authority and the two councils, they will note from the Long Title, if it is amended as I propose, that we should never lose sight of the educational component of whatever is being provided, be it an educational or training course.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1034" /> In page 7, lines 25 and 26, to delete &ldquo;Qualifications (Education and Training)&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;Education and Training (Qualifications)&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I have resubmitted this amendment from Committee Stage. It is related to amendment No. 1. This is an education and training Bill. It is concerned with qualifications, but if there is no education and training to begin with there are no qualifications. I understand the Minister was involved in a similar debate within his Department before the Title of the Bill was decided. If I recall correctly, he said on Committee Stage that the working Title of the Bill in the Department was the one I seek here by way of this amendment.</P>
    <P>Education and training should be emphasised in the Title of a Bill that relates to those matters. Qualifications are important, but they describe what has been provided which is education and training. In that context, the Bill is inappropriately named and the cart has been put before the horse. Has the Minister had further thoughts on this issue since he responded negatively on Committee Stage?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is with great regret that I must respond negatively again, although I have reflected on the issue. The Title as drafted is the one which reflects most accurately what the Bill is about. It will lead to the establishment of a qualifications framework where quality assurance can be applied to the rich variety of education and training programmes that are provided and deals with the establishment of new mechanisms for the awarding of certificates, diplomas, degrees, etc. The Bill is fundamentally about establishing a qualifications framework with the education and training sector and the Title captures its essence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that a framework will be established, which will include quality assurance, etc. However, I stress that without education and training, qualifications do not arise. For example, if this were a nursing Bill, would it be called the qualifications (nursing) Bill? The nursing qualifications Bill would be the most apt title. The Title of this Bill is more general as it relates to education and training, but there is a danger that a marketplace and industry oriented framework could be developed to a large degree. There are skills shortages in a number of sectors, but people must be educated in the first instance so that they can aspire to the necessary level of training to enhance their qualifications and thereby be in a position to take up current skilled vacancies.</P>
      <P>In the context of inclusiveness and empowerment, education and training must be up front because qualifications just do not fall out of the sky. However, I am not critical of the Minister's intentions regarding the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>A wider debate is emerging and I contend that there is an attempt to put forward a <Col N="1035" /> view to a certain extent that suddenly education policy is becoming dominated by the marketplace. It is not, but there has always been a relationship between the worlds of education and industry. In recent times that has become more pronounced and there is less of the traditional isolationist approach whereby if one is touched by the world of work and education, one is almost contaminated. For example, architects, doctors, lawyers, technicians, engineers, etc. traditionally received a good basic education which was intended to develop the whole person but they reached a stage in their educational journeys when there was a focus on what was happening outside the education world in terms of the world of work and the marketplace in wider society.</P>
      <P>The Bill is not about the domination of one over the other but is in essence centred on the student. In accepting that education involves the development of the whole person, the Bill will advance that concept by giving all people on education or training programmes the opportunity to progress in a much more effective way than heretofore. There were too many barriers to progression in education for many people. If one did not pass the leaving certificate and secure a place in college at that time, it was a long time before one could obtain a place on a degree programme. When the framework of the Bill is established, it will do a great deal more for the education of the person as it is constituted because it will get rid of many barriers that existed previously in terms of facilitating progression.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously, the Minister and I are not <i>ad idem</i> on this issue but I ask him to reflect on the proposed membership of the qualifications authority. One person will be nominated by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and will come on board with an industry perspective. People will also be nominated by the universities, Forfás, IBEC and ICTU. IBEC and ICTU, by their nature, are focused on industry, employment, etc., and I welcome their inclusion on the qualifications authority. However, I am seeking that the remit of the Bill is clear in its Title and that its focus is on basic education and training and all that entails as distinct from qualifications which could be described as the pieces of paper which allows individuals to perform at a certain level. I accept the Minister will not accede to the amendment.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister's decision to include a provision in the Bill that information about drop out rates will be provided on a regular basis. I also welcome his decision to give the Oireachtas a role in determining the shape and details of information to be provided. This significant step forward is welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the way in which the Minister has defined completion rates is not the most revealing and interesting from the point of view of tracking what is happening in courses that are being validated. I maintain that the formulation I have offered in amendment No. 33, which refers explicitly to entry requirements, drop out rates and induction and support programmes for <Col N="1037" /> entrants from non-traditional backgrounds, would provide more relevant information. Nevertheless, I recognise that the Oireachtas will have the right to request this information if it wishes and I will not go to the wire on the matter.</P>
    <P>Completion rates tend to arise at the end of a programme and, therefore, in the case of a three or four year programme, the information to which the Minister referred will emerge three years down the line. It will not monitor drop out figures as a phenomenon or those who drop out. The tracking of drop outs is the type of information we want to develop over time. The Minister has provided a vehicle to allow further pursuit of these issues and while I hope he may be willing to accept amendment No. 33, I do not intend to call a division on the issue.</P>

      <P>This series of amendments is a progressive outcome to the debate on Committee Stage. I take the points made by Deputy Bruton. Completion rates in the technological and university sectors are of grave concern and the amendments are a move in the direction of providing more substantial information on this huge problem. I am interested in the Minister's response to Deputy Bruton's amendment. However, the Minister's amendments are progressive and I support them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies for their comments and acknowledgment that the amendments represent progress since the Committee Stage debate. One of the fundamental reasons for seeking data on completion rates is to inform policy and to allow for intervention in terms of the overall policy framework of an institution or a college where the rates are low or there is a difficulty. The inclusion of amendments in this area will facilitate that. Such data are compiled at second level and its principal impact has been in the devising of a new strategy to try to deal with the problems of low completion or poor retention rates. The position will be similar at third level. The Oireachtas and various awarding councils will be able to get this information every year. For example, in 1999 one can get information on the completion rates in 1998, 1997 or 1996. Once that information is available, people will be in a position to make decisions.</P>
      <P>Information on entry requirements is now public. All institutes and colleges must publish entry requirements to their respective institutions in terms of eligibility. I have no difficulty with the view that a tracking system is essential. I am confident that will be available in terms of ongoing policies.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 12, to delete line 2.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment deals with the membership of the board. As the Bill stands, it is proposed that <Col N="1038" /> the chief executive of the board will be a full member of it. However, the qualifications authority will be deliberative and will not have many day to day executive decisions to make. It will not have to make many detailed decisions on a regular basis. It will decide broad direction and in that context, there is not the same pressure or advantages in having the chief executive on the board.</P>
    <P>The balance of advantage may lie in not having the chief executive on the authority but leaving him or her on the two subordinate councils which will be much more day-to-day decision making bodies requiring the presence and regular advice of the chief executive. The authority will take submissions and input from the chief executive but have the opportunity to withdraw and consider the chief executive's viewpoint. Its view may or may not coincide with that of the chief executive. There may be a case for including the amendment and I am interested in the Minister's reflections on the issue since Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I reflected on the issue of whether the chief executive should be a member of the authority. On balance I consider that should be the case. As I indicated on Committee Stage, there are arguments on both sides. Throughout the technological sector, the chief executive is a member of the governing body. This has worked well and there is no reason it should not work in terms of the qualifications authority. There would also be consistency in the context of the overall sector with which the authority will deal. On balance, I am in favour of retaining the chief executive on the authority as proposed in the Bill.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 12, line 3, to delete &ldquo;two persons&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;one person&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>These amendments relate to the ministerial nominees on the Qualifications Authority, the Further Education and Training Council, and the Higher Education and Training Council. As I said on Committee Stage, there are strong points on both sides of this argument about whether there should be ministerial nominees. On one hand, we would wish to avoid the nomination of political hacks to the bodies while, on the other, allowing the Minister to nominate could enable him to make inspired choices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Education and Science may make two nominations to the Qualifications Authority and the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment may make one. Both Ministers may make two nominations to the Further Education and Training Council. On the Higher Edu<Col N="1039" /> cation and Training Council, the Minister for Education and Science has two nominees and the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment has one. This amendment seeks to reduce the number of ministerial nominees. I was unable to come up with an appropriate amendment to identify categories from which the Ministers could draw their nominees. It may not be possible to do that nor, perhaps, is it appropriate to legislation.</P>
    <P>I moved similar amendments on Committee Stage and we had a wide-ranging debate on them. I ask the Minister to share with us any reflections he has had in the interim.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>We had significant discussion of this on Committee Stage. My primary concern is that the membership of the Qualifications Authority and the two awarding councils should be balanced and cohesive. The bodies must be effective in implementing their objects and functions. We do not want big, unwieldy bodies which are too large to make decisions. I have endeavoured not to be prescriptive about the membership and to allow a certain measure of flexibility and direction. This Bill is not designed only for the next year or so, it will apply to future Ministers also, and it would not be wise to tie their hands in respect of nominating people to these bodies. The ministerial nominees will be people of high calibre with a particular contribution to make to the work of the bodies.</P>
      <P>I have qualified my original proposals to some extent, following Committee Stage discussions. Amendments Nos. 7 and 41 propose that one of the Minister's representatives on the authority must be a representative of voluntary and community organisations. This is in response to a Committee Stage amendment by Deputy Bruton concerning the third strand. One nominee to the higher council must be representative of providers other than recognised institutions. Deputy Bruton made such a suggestion on Committee Stage, we reflected on it and have now provided for it in amendment No. 41. To some extent I have qualified our position &ndash; it is not true in every case but one nominee will come from a certain sector &ndash; to reflect the Committee Stage debate.</P>

      <P>In page 12, line 45, after &ldquo;progression&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;throughout a person's life by in particular facilitating access to qualification for persons in the workforce, engaged in other duties that prevent enrolment in full-time courses, or with limited formal educational qualifications&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We had considerable discussion on this issue on Committee Stage. One object of the authority is to promote and facilitate access, transfer and progression. The Opposition felt this was a central issue, but the Bill's phraseology did not sufficiently emphasise that the authority was expected to break new ground in this area. Many people in the sector say they promote and facilitate access, transfer and progression within the education sector, but critics of the education system say this is not the case. It is important to make clear to the authority that its job is not to maintain the <i>status quo</i> but that it has a clear remit to open up access and opportunities for transfer and progression and to see where there are gaps and shortfalls in access, transfer and progression.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Bill becomes law it should make clear to the authority that this is what is intended. Accordingly, the amendment adds words which strengthen the import of the section. It will now read: &ldquo;.to promote and facilitate access, transfer and progression throughout a person's life by in particular facilitating access to qualification for persons in the workforce, engaged in other duties that prevent enrolment in full-time courses, or with limited formal educational qualifications.&rdquo;  This makes clear that the role of the authority is to reach down or out to those who have tradition<Col N="1041" /> ally found it difficult to get access to the education system, to ensure the awards, certification and validation mechanisms facilitate their entry. A statement of this kind would be welcome to make it clear that this is new ground we expect the authority to address as a priority. To leave such an explicit statement out of its objectives would be remiss of the Houses of the Oireachtas. The Minister will argue this is implicit but every educational institution in the country would say it implicitly promotes and facilitates access, transfer and progression, but the reality is that there are significant failings in this area. There is a need to go the extra distance to make our intention clear.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I see merit in the amendment proposed by Deputy Bruton. A concern recently expressed to me is that there is no explicit reference in the Act to lifelong learning. Another concern is that in terms of further and higher education, the legislation does not appear to link up with Government policy on adult education as enunciated in the Green Paper. I would like those issues to be addressed. That omission from the legislation could have repercussions in time. I support what is being proposed by Deputy Bruton.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 7 sets out the objects of the Qualifications Authority; I already outlined the principal objects. I favour as simple an approach as possible in the objects of the authority so that the intent of the Oireachtas in setting up the body is clear. I consider the concepts mentioned in the amendment are sufficiently included in the third object of the authority which is to promote and facilitate access, transfer and progression within the qualifications framework. It is very clear in all circumstances. That is the object of the authority. Essentially this is ensuring that the interests of learners and students can be met. I would not favour one aspect of progression being highlighted over another.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the authority must have regard to the objects of the Act in section 4(1) to &ldquo;facilitate lifelong learning through the promotion of access and opportunities for all learners, including learners with special educational needs&rdquo;. A further object of the Act refers to the need to promote the recognition of knowledge, skill or competence acquired through research, adult and continuing education, and training and employment. The points of view articulated by the Deputies are covered both in the objects of the Act, section 4, and in terms of the objects of the authority. In fact, they are explicit in the terminology in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly argue the contrary. The Minister only introduced the concept of lifelong learning being recognised on Committee Stage. The Department was happy to allow the Minister proceed without any reference to lifelong learning in the Bill until he was approached by others. The Minister then decided to include <Col N="1042" /> lifelong learning in section 4(1)(e). That amendment was welcomed on Committee Stage when the Minister introduced it. It was interesting that when he was describing the meaning of (7)(c) he could not let it stand alone. He had to add a clause to indicate that this was intended in all instances. That was very revealing. This is a defect.</P>
      <P>If we start at (c) and work our way back through the Bill to the meaning of &ldquo;learner&rdquo; and &ldquo;programmes&rdquo;, it could be argued that this means access to programmes traditionally not recognised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course it does.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The reality, however, is that no such access is currently being promoted, it is merely being explored. The novelty elements in the Bill are now confined to definitional phrases such as the meaning of &ldquo;programme&rdquo;. An educational programme does not mean a conventional course provided by an educational institution. It has been broadened to include something happening in a community or in the workplace. I acknowledge that as a positive development, and it means that the authority can do what I am talking about, but my point is that it is not required to do it under the existing provisions. It can take a more narrow view of its work and confine itself to doing what the traditional bodies now seeking certification are doing. The onus in the Bill is on bodies to approach the authority and the council seeking validation. Even in the case of non-traditional institutions, the onus is on the individuals who want validation to approach the authority.</P>
      <P>The reactive approach implicit in the Bill can colour the way the authority conducts its business. The issue of bringing in from the cold those who have traditionally found it difficult to progress through the system should be more explicit and not one to which the authority will react positively if certain proposals come forward. It should be made clear that the expectation of the Oireachtas is that it sees this issue as central to its remit and that it will not sit back and wait for non-traditional learners to knock on its door.</P>
      <P>There is a difference of emphasis here that would be welcome in the Bill. I know the Minister shares that view but he seems reluctant to make clear in the Act what is the consensus view of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is outrageous to suggest that the Bill is setting up institutions that will be reactive. The whole ethos of the Bill is quite radical. It represents a significant new departure in terms of progression and access to qualifications, particularly in the non-traditional area. We must also be mindful of development in recent years. The National Council for Vocational Awards, for example, has made a number of significant new departures in terms of creating a qualifications framework in its field of endeavour for people <Col N="1043" /> from the non-traditional institutions and groups. The foundation level 1 and 2, for example, of the NCVA has facilitated considerable access for many people who previously did not have access to education. It is wrong to say that an interpretation can be drawn from the Bill, as drafted, that the institutions could be reactive in terms of the discharge of their duties. I strongly refute that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>When one examines the functions of the council, they are mainly to determine standards of knowledge, recognise awards and issue awards. The onus is on people to approach the councils. I would like to see a more pro-active approach to the issue of the adult education sector. That is the reason I believe there is merit in having more pro-active language in the Bill. This is the most favourable place to insert it because if it is done early in the case of the authority, it will shape the whole approach the councils will take. That is the reason for my reluctance to go along with the Minister on this matter, although I applaud what has been done by the NCVA.</P>

      <P>In page 13, line 12, after &ldquo;procedures&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and policies&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This matter was debated on Committee Stage and the Minister of State, who was then handling the Bill, indicated that the Minister was open to consideration of this matter. I am concerned with section 8(2)(d), which deals with the procedures to be implemented by providers of programmes of education and training for access, transfer and progression. My concern is with codifying what is being done as one can simply codify what is being done without changing it. The determination by the authority in relation to what happens with access and progression should not solely be a matter of determining that these should be codified. The ISO programmes, for example, are about codifying and making sure that things happen as predicted the same way every time, but that is not enough. We want to see the authority influence the policies adopted by institutions of learning that will facilitate access and progression. One can have procedures that deny access and progression; those are valid procedures but they deny access and progression.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The policies that surround procedures are important and they must accommodate and support non-traditional applicants, certainly in the initial acclimatisation phase. That is why I have suggested that the authority should determine not only the procedures but also the policies. Alternatively, if the Minister feels that is going too far, the authority could recommend policies in <Col N="1044" /> relation to access and progression procedures. I would like to see the authority taking this brief seriously and pressing it with institutions, even those which might be recalcitrant in developing procedures and policies supportive of access and progression. I know the Minister has reflected on this amendment since Committee Stage and I hope he supports the change it suggests.</P>

      <P>I share Deputy Bruton's misgivings. To put it bluntly, procedures are about how one does things and policies are about what one does and the areas one wants to address. In the context of the authority's functions, there needs to be a lot more growth in the policy area. This is a deficit I alluded to on Committee Stage and again, it is the marketplace angle that I worry about. Procedures are about how one does things; policies are what one does.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>When one refers to procedures one is referring to rules and how one carries out one's functions. That is what this alludes to. There is a deficiency in this legislation regarding policy.</P>
      <P>I am not going to give a cheap preview of a later amendment I have tabled, but there is a need to make it clear that the authority will be developing policy as distinct from procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>That is clear in terms of the objects of the authority, though I am unsure of the exact wording in relation to policies. This section deals with the functions of the authority. Deputy Bruton's amendment seeks to determine the procedures and policies to be implemented by providers of programmes of education and training for access, transfer and progression, but we have the Regional Technical Colleges Act, 1992, and there is a significant degree of self-governance in the institutes. On Committee Stage we debated those institutes which wanted delegated authorities to make their own awards. If we now include the determination of procedures and policies, that would be a fundamental shift in the governance of many of the institutes and other providers and would represent a seismic shift in the way institutes and colleges govern their affairs. The key issue with quality assurance as well as access and progression is that clear procedures are laid down. We want the authority to provide the dynamic between and over the providers to ensure access and progression. I do not think it appropriate for the authority to deter<Col N="1045" /> mine policies that must then be implemented by the providers as I feel such policies are in the first instance the responsibility of both the providers and those who fund the providers. Ultimately, the Minister of the day will have to have a fundamental policy remit in issues related to access, transfer and progression. Policies would relate to issues such as setting aside a certain number of places for progression, quotas and so on.</P>
      <P>The procedures would include determining when a learner commences a programme with regard to the knowledge, skill and competence already attained. This would mean appropriate credits and not having to start at year one of a degree programme when a diploma course has already been completed. Other procedures could include the setting of minimum standards for entry to programmes.</P>
      <P>We can underestimate the issue of procedures to an extent, but proper procedures are essential to this matter and are central to the issues of access, progression and quality assurance. I feel that we have laid out the functions correctly and have stopped short of the authority literally running the providers and telling them what to do in every aspect of their policies. That would be a fundamental shift in the Bill and was never meant to be the function of this authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Minister's argument that we could go too far in allowing it to determine policy in every instance. On the other hand, one of the authority's objects is to promote access and transfer. The Minister is saying it will have the role to promote but will not have any tools to do so. The mechanism to work on this will be controlled by the Minister through his budgetary restrictions over colleges and so on as that will influence those colleges' policies. I accept that as an alternative viewpoint, but it belittles what the authority can do about promoting or facilitating access if it comes down to simply requiring that procedures are in place and prior learning is looked at and does not require colleges to make places available or not to downgrade those with prior learning in the competition for places. That undermines the effectiveness of the authority and perhaps the compromise position may be to determine the procedures and to recommend policies to be implemented. At least then the insight and experience about where access is blocked that the authority gathers from doing this work would allow that body to recommend policies to the institutes involved. That would be a half way house. They acknowledge the points the Minister makes but go beyond the arrid territory of rules and would be a more dynamic vehicle.</P>

      <P>It should be noted that the amendments tabled by Deputy Bruton do not seek to delete the word &ldquo;procedures&rdquo;. Is the authority to be a body merely for procedures? A later section of the Bill states that policy is determined by the Minister for Education and Science and other <Col N="1046" /> Ministers in agreement with the Minister for Education and Science. Therefore, policy is determined by Ministers.</P>
      <P>Neither Deputy Bruton nor I envisage the authority having the dominant policy role but it should have a defined policy role. The authority will deal with the various areas of education and training qualifications on a daily basis. Unless a clear policy mechanism is provided by the legislation, we will lose the valuable expertise of the authority. The Minister's concerns could be allayed by placing a limitation on the policy role of the authority. The development of policy should be an important facet of the work of the authority and this should be recognised in the legislation.</P>

That is too strong. The authority may, of course, recommend policies. That facility exists. We are agreed on that fundamental principle. The Bill strikes the correct balance between the role of the authority in facilitating access, progression and quality assurance and the responsibilities of the providers in that regard.</P>

      <P>We are agreed that my amendment is not entirely satisfactory but to make no amendment to this section is equally unsatisfactory. The Minister does not appear to be disposed to include the recommendation of policy explicitly in the Bill. The Minister says the authority can, of course, recommend policies. There is a difference between recommending policies when one is the validating authority and has a statutory right to do so, and being blandly allowed to do so.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1047" /> There was much discussion on Committee Stage about the need for the qualification authority to be up to date on international best practice. I propose this amendment to require the authority to keep itself informed in this regard. I will propose similar amendments to ensure that the councils keep themselves informed in the same manner. The requirement that the bodies be informed of international developments will, in turn, inform the performance of their functions. Furthermore, Deputy Bruton stressed the need for the two awarding councils to consult providers in the performance of their functions. The Deputy is aware that some of the amendments I proposed on Committee Stage address the issue of consultation by the new bodies. I will propose these amendments to ensure that the awarding councils consult, as appropriate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a significant step forward. Heretofore, there was no mention of international best practice in relation to the role of the authority and councils. We live in a rapidly changing environment. We must place a statutory obligation to be conscious of best practice on those who are responsible for validation.</P>
      <P>The Minister has been extraordinarily economical in phrasing this amendment. He simply requires the authority to inform itself of practices outside the State in respect of matters relevant to its functions. This does not appear to require the authority to go beyond being aware and to benchmark itself against what is happening elsewhere. We must ensure that we are at the leading edge of development. The Minister was unwilling to accept my Committee Stage amendments which would have made explicit requirements in this regard. My own phrases in amendment No. 18 are preferable to those put forward by the Minister. The requirement in amendment No. 18 that the authority inform itself of international best practice places the obligation on the authority to look beyond the neighbouring island. This can too often inform what is regarded as international practice.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 18 also requires the promotion of an international perspective in the development of the qualification system. It is important that the authority not only inform itself of what is happening internationally but also place obligations on providers who seek validation to be aware of what is happening in the international arena.</P>

These amendments broaden that provision. There was also international representation on <Col N="1048" /> the interim review group, chaired by Professor Donnelly.</P>
      <P>Neither Deputy Bruton nor I dispute the Minister's intentions. Our task is to make constructive contributions to the Bill so that it is framed as effectively as possible to last a long time.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's amendments and await his response to Deputy Bruton's submission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose the vagaries of the draftsman offer one explanation. My amendments encapsulate the views and concepts put forward by Deputy Bruton in his Committee Stage amendment. In my view, the Bill facilitates both the authority and the councils to inform themselves of international best practice but I am happy to table these amendments to copperfasten that and to make sure, as the Deputy said, that there is no room for any ambiguities or that any wrong interpretations can be taken. The draftsman advised this particular wording for the amendments and that is why I am putting them forward in this form.</P>
      <P>Teastas, which made recommendations to me about this legislation, informed itself of considerable international experience in the area of qualifications' authorities. Teastas consulted with people in Australia, New Zealand, Holland and the United States in addition to the United Kingdom. One can see that Teastas was quite busy informing itself of international best practice in the field of qualifications' authorities and that informed the content of the legislation.</P>
      <P>As Deputy O'Shea pointed out, the interim review bodies, which we have established in relation to the delegation of authority to institutes, have a strong international presence. The distribution of the £180 million research fund, for example, relies on an international panel of experts also. Therefore, there is already a strong culture of utilising, and informing oneself of, best practice within the system. As Minister, I have strong links with the Department of Education and the Secretary for Education in the United States and they have been very co-operative. They have made available to us their expertise, particularly in the field of special education. Their best experts are consulting with my officials about their experiences. There is a strong culture within the Department and the overall education field of being open to international influences, particularly international best practice.</P>
      <P>Under section 8(2)(h), there will be an obligation on the authority to &ldquo;liaise with bodies outside the State which make education and training awards for the purposes of facilitating the recognition in the State of education and training awards made by those bodies&rdquo;. Of course in all of that interaction people will be constantly informing themselves of international best practice.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 19:</P>
      <P>In page 14, to delete lines 1 to 4.</P>
      <P>This amendment was tabled on Committee Stage at the select committee. I note the Minister's amendment to this subsection. Under section 8(3)(b) the authority is charged with giving &ldquo;effect to policies relating to education and training which from time to time are established by the Minister, or by any other Minister with the agreement of the Minister&rdquo;. We are talking here about the policy making function of the authority.</P>
      <P>The Minister alluded already to section 8(2) and the functions of the authority. Section 8(2)(a) states the authority shall &ldquo;establish the policies and criteria on which the framework of qualifications shall be based&rdquo;. I submit that they are two different things. On the one hand the Minister is talking in terms of policy and criteria in relation to the framework but the ministerial directives, which, according to my reading of the Bill, will be the substantive and only source of policy making, allude to education and training <i>per se</i>. In other words, they refer to education and training as distinct from the qualifications framework. The other point which will be addressed by the Minister's amendment is the need for notification in writing of policy directives on education and training from either the Minister or another Minister.</P>
      <P>I still feel that what we discussed earlier, that is, the lack of a reference in the Bill to a policy making role in relation to education and training, needs to be addressed. I welcome the fact that other Ministers, with the agreement of the Minister for Education and Science, can effect policy or put in place elements of policy which must be given effect by the authority. For instances, I hope the authority would receive substantial direction regarding policy in the area of disability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1050" /> I know the Minister does not agree with my amendment, which would delete section 8(3)(b). However, there is the policy development role of the authority and how policy is developed and conveyed to the authority on the one hand and the reciprocal role of the authority in terms of it affecting policy based on its experience and its day to day working on the other. For instance, it is likely that there will be international expertise on the board. In fact, the authority must contain international expertise in terms of the two nominees of the authority, one of whom would need to have international experience. Here is an important resource, which is not being recognised and the benefit of which is not given a channel to influence the policy direction of the authority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>This was discussed in some detail on Committee Stage. Arising from that discussion, I propose to insert a further amendment, that any policies established in this section must be set out by notice in writing to the authority.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is still seeking the deletion of section 8(3)(b) but I feel it would be wrong to delete it. The authority should be in a position to give effect to the policies relating to general education and training which from time to time are established by the Minister or other Ministers.</P>
      <P>Ministers and Governments are elected by the people and we cannot predict what the state of society will be at any stage in the future. The Government has an ultimate right to establish policies in the field of education and training and the authority should give effect to those policies in the wider context of addressing education and training objectives for the country. Any such policy which a Minister might develop would have to be consistent with the provisions of the Bill or the Minister could not effect the policy without proposing that the House would amend the Bill. The fact that an amendment is being proposed to ensure more effective consultation between Ministers and the authority offers a safeguard and protection. This section was amended in the Seanad to provide for consultation with the authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I tabled the amendment because it appeared that the powers vested in the Minister in regard to the authority were too strong. I do not dispute that a Minister should have a clearly defined and essential role in policy development. Indeed, I welcome the fact that there is a vehicle through which other Ministers may influence policy, albeit by way of agreement with this Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the framework for the authority develops, the qualifications which issue from it must have international recognition. It must be visible to Irish people, potential foreign investors and various foreign academic institutions. Graduates who receive awards from the authority will find themselves in various places throughout the world and it is important that their qualifications would be recognised. I want to ensure that the authority will be clearly autonomous and capable of developing its status within the State indepen<Col N="1051" /> dently. Consequently, its status would be progressively enhanced over time and Irish qualifications will be viewed by the international community as being of a very high standard. Indeed, such recognition already exists but there is room for improvement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy seems to be acknowledging that the Minister should have a role in the development of policy. His amendment seeks the deletion of the section which would create an unacceptable vacuum as there would be no facility for the authority to give effect to the general education and training policies of the Minister of the day. I want to reassure the Deputy that the qualifications authority will have strong international credibility and recognition and will be enabled to achieve that in the overall framework of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I have no problem with the current Minister's assurances. However, Ministers will come and go and the dangerous possibility exists that some future Minister may adopt an overly intrusive role. We must consider that the legislation will have an ongoing effect. Admittedly, the early days of the authority will be very important in terms of its long-term perception. Is there any vehicle through which the authority could be given a more substantial policy development role which would not interfere with the Minister's legitimate policy development role? I acknowledge the Minister's amendment in regard to written instruction to the authority which makes its position much stronger through the removal of the possible development of a system of nods and winks. However, as far as the authority's autonomy and creative expansion in terms of policy development are concerned, there is a serious deficit in the legislation as it is framed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment. There is a matter which has concerned me for some time. Those who participate in community employment schemes, particularly in the caring areas, can acquire a high level of competence but have nothing to show for it by way of awards. Such awards should form part of a pathway of qualifications leading to further education and training, including higher education. There is a need for such links. It is in that context that the amendment has much merit. There is no career path available to those who acquire expertise in this way to enhance their qualifications.</P>
      <P>Much emphasis is placed nowadays on services for people with disabilities and senior citizens but money alone is not the answer.

      <P>I have looked at the amendment in detail and consider that the issues covered should not be added as a specific function as it is implicit that the council will fulfil this function. The council has a role to promote its awards. Learners may also approach it directly to seek certification or recognition of their existing knowledge, skill or competence under paragraph (c) under which the council will have the function of making or recognising awards where persons apply.</P>
      <P>It is a matter for the new awarding councils to determine how prior experiential learning can be assessed and they may seek the assistance of providers of education and training. I do not see a reason we should highlight one specific way to attain a standard of knowledge, skill or competence in the functions of the councils. This is the reason for the open definition of &ldquo;programme&rdquo; as any process by which learners may acquire knowledge, skill or competence. This encapsulates the point made by the Deputy. The amendment, therefore, is not appropriate or necessary.</P>

He has now said that participants in community employment and adult education programmes have a right to approach the council. That proves that the Bill is reactive in nature. It will be up to the relatively disorganised providers or participants in community employment programmes to mobilise and approach the council for recognition.</P>
      <P>By the time they have done it, the course will be over and the opportunity to secure recognition will not be there. The boot should be on the other foot. The council should be given the remit to seek to validate and provide awards and certification to those who are participating in programmes, such as community employment programmes, who have a right to expect they can progress.</P>

      <P>It does not. It can if it wishes. However, the Minister is leaving it as a reactive measure. If somebody approaches the council, it can validate the programme. It should be the other way around. The council should see it as one of its prime functions to promote not only awards in general but specifically to promote the recognition of awards for people who do not get awards at present.</P>
      <P>It is a question of whether one favours some form of positive discrimination or simply to leave it to the initiative of the poorly organised to come to the council and try to get this off the ground. I believe it is better to promote this function and my amendment gives that clear remit to the council.</P>

This is particularly so when dealing with matters which apply to people who, by definition, have not been successful under the formal education system. It is unlikely that they would come forward to the council seeking recognition for study already done. They might approach the provider. Rather than the initiative coming from outside the authority and its councils, the policy should be one of invitation.</P>
      <P>There should also be, within Government, an examination of the areas where shortages will apply and where there are people who currently do not have the requisite training standards or certification but who could aspire to these if proper programmes were provided and if they were invited to take part in them in the proper manner. The Minister was involved in vocational education committees and had experience in the area of adult education. He will be aware that when one advertises a programme most of the people who turn up for it wish to pursue certain courses&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not wish to sound impatient with the argument but the <i>raison d'être</i> of this Bill is to accommodate the people the Deputies have mentioned. This Bill represents a new era for people who do not have qualifications or who have never been through the formal education system. One of the objects of the Bill is &ldquo;to promote the recognition of knowledge, skill or competence acquired through research, adult and continuing education and training and employment&rdquo;. Everybody is covered. Furthermore, one of the functions of the council is to promote its awards and certifications.</P>
      <P>It is unfair to suggest that the Bill should be interpreted as creating an inert organisation that will be reactive or do nothing. That misses the context in which the Bill is going through the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>The Minister can rummage through the Bill and, if he is creative enough, he will find the remit to do what he wants. If one looks at how a programme is defined, one discovers that the council can do these things. The Minister took some time rummaging through the Bill to come up with these facts. That is what will happen in practice. When the members of the council sit into their soft seated boardroom to decide what they will do&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;they will look at the list of functions but will not see this among them. The council will have to look very hard to see that its remit is to deal with people who are getting no recognition and who are working in structured community programmes such as community employment or voluntarily organised community programmes. Even the use of the words &ldquo;to promote the recognition of . adult education&rdquo; conveys the notion of benches, chalk and talk and not the experiential education we are discussing and which occurs in these more structured community programmes. The Minister can, with creative use of words, claim this area is covered but the wording is not sufficiently directive to the council. I will press the amendment.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1058" /> The power to delegate awarding capacity was discussed on Committee Stage. I put forward the idea that the right to delegate authority to make awards should not be drawn up in such a way that a certain number of people will be inside and we then pull up the ladder and do not let anyone else in thereafter. The concept of delegating authority to make awards should be a continuing option for the council to use as time goes on, so that where significant providers emerge who have the breadth of experience and strong track record with the council, it would be open to the council to decide to delegate authority to such bodies.</P>
    <P>One must bear in mind that we are in a rapidly changing world of education. I could see the establishment of credible international bodies providing education in Ireland who would have gilt-edged credentials to be awarding bodies in their own right. I do not see why we should pull up the ladder behind the few that have been around for some time and have had legal recognition and say that is the end of it. It does not seem to make sense in any legislation that we would so circumscribe a power of delegated authority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>We had considerable discussion on this matter on Committee Stage. The amendment represents a major change in the direction of the Bill. I have consistently argued for the need to simplify the certification arrangements of the State and I consider the proposals for limits on the bodies that may seek delegation are consistent with that. Under the proposed amendment, any provider can seek delegation and end up having authority on the Statute to make awards. That was not the awarding system envisaged in publishing the Bill and it is not a vision for the development of national certification that I would share. The three bodies that may seek delegated authority are FÁS, CERT and Teagasc, which are national training bodies that have been involved in making awards for many years. Accordingly, I do not accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is misreading the intention of this amendment. It is not aimed at complicating matters but at making validated awards of the council. It would still leave the council in absolute control of those awards. It would evaluate and, if necessary, withdraw the award-giving authority. It would, however, allow a structure that could be developed over time. It would not require the council to maintain a large policing force in respect of educational institutions which it felt were up to a strong standard. If FÁS, CERT or Teagasc can establish that, it is certainly true that others may be able to do so. Because the national bodies have been around for some time and the Minister has not been able to get them to surrender their rights to the new authority, it seems he is making provision to keep them there. Either the Minister says that delegated authority is in recognition of experience, <Col N="1059" /> skill and competence to make awards that will have a national value, or delegation is simply a tool he has devised to keep happy a number of bodies that were unhappy their position was being usurped. The Minister cannot have it both ways. If he believes that delegation is worthwhile because some bodies have the skill, competence and track record to do this, then he should not confine it to two or three bodies that have been there for some time. If, on the other hand, he wants to have a simplified, authoritative and &ldquo;one size fits all&rdquo; authority, he should not have delegation in the Bill. It is quite clear, however, that the Minister's officials have had to settle for this situation, and he is trying to justify his position on fairly threadbare grounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not accept that argument. A considerable amount of work went into producing the Bill. The simplified model that has emerged is a very strong one. It is also realistic in terms of where we are and where we want to go. Put simply, there is nothing wrong with facilitating FÁS, CERT or Teagasc in future if they wish to see a delegated authority. The purpose of inserting that section was to facilitate three national training bodies. It is not something that will happen immediately but nonetheless the facility is there.</P>
      <P>In preparing the Bill I was conscious of the history of the sector. There have been many false dawns and the matter had been left hanging around for quite some time. If we start changing direction fundamentally at this stage, the potential for a framework like this to unravel quickly should not be underestimated. I am satisfied with the Bill which facilitates future growth and development. Accordingly, I recommend this section to the House.</P>

      <P>On Committee Stage the Minister indicated that one of the three persons to be nominated by recognised institutions would be the nominee of the Council of Directors of Institutes of Technology. Nothing has appeared from the Minister by way of an amendment that indicates this is the case. The Council of Directors of Institutes of Technology was not set up on a statutory basis. The initiative for establishing it came from within the sector. While I do not have a problem in principle with a nominee of that group being on the higher education and training council, it is important for that council to be set up on a statutory basis with objectives and procedures.</P>
      <P>It is important that the council, with objectives, procedures and so on, is set up on a statutory basis. For that reason I tabled the amendment.</P>

I was pleased the Minister indicated that one of the nominees would be a representative of the council of directors. I am slightly concerned about the bracketed part of Deputy O'Shea's amendment in that it would seem to defer the date of representation until new legislation was introduced to recognise this body. As such, I would have misgivings because it could be a long time before <Col N="1061" /> there is primary legislation to establish the Council of Directors of Institutes of Technology. I support Deputy O'Shea's amendment up to, but excluding, the bracketed part.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">

      <P>There may be a genuine misunderstanding here. I indicated on Committee Stage that it is my intention that the council of directors will make the nominations on behalf of the recognised institutions, of which there are three, and that I would make an appropriate regulation under the section to achieve this. In other words, when the Bill is enacted I will make a regulation whereby the council of directors will have the power to make the three nominations. That has been agreed with the council of directors in discussions and there is no hidden agenda. The issue of statutory underpinning of the council of directors is a much bigger and broader issue. We have not received any demand for that. I am not sure it is a good idea or that it is achievable in the short-term given that one would have to take on board the respective views of all individual councils. As of now the practical effect of Deputy O'Shea's amendment would be to delay the appointment. My understanding is that arrangements are being made to establish the council of directors as a limited company, but that will be separate from the statutory position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I would consider that to be setting it up on a statutory basis. If the council of directors goes down the road of registering a company, that involves becoming registered under statute. The various nominating bodies are statutory bodies. Where a nomination is being given to a board, the Minister and the Oireachtas should be clear on the composition of the organisation, its aims, objectives, policies and procedures. It is important that we know exactly what objectives are being pursued by this group. Heretofore, it could have been described as a lobby group on behalf of the institutes. I am quite happy that before the nominations would be made the company would be registered and that any member of the Oireachtas or the public could go to the Companies Office and see the aims, objectives and structure of this organisation.</P>

      <P>In page 33, between lines 13 and 14, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>(<i></i>a) its objectives and mission statement;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>These two amendments were debated on Committee Stage in the discussion on the establishment of charters for institutes of technology. The Minister, while sympathetic to the idea of these amendments, undertook to check with the draftsman whether the legal nature of charters would permit the more general statements set in the amendments. My amendment proposes that a charter would set out the objectives and mission statement of the institute. In that way it would cover a broad range of educational objectives for the institute and set out what it was trying to achieve. That would be an important statement for the development of the institute. I am also proposing that it should have arrangements for developing and updating its corporate strategy in partnership with all stakeholders affected by it. As the institute developed its objectives and mission statement into a clear strategy it would consult with those affected, whether students, those in the community or industry, and would have a consultative basis for developing and updating its strategy. This would be welcome.</P>
      <P>The existing provisions in relation to the charter are fairly arid. They are formal issues and not broad strategic areas, although some are of significant importance. They are the outcome of much strategic thinking within the institute. I hope the development of that strategic thinking would result in the items set out in the Minister's list being developed in partnership with all stakeholders and that the colleges would develop their mission and corporate strategy in consultation with the community affected by them.</P>
      <P>Institutes of technology are the key to successful industrial development in their areas. In recognition of this it is important that the charter seeks to consult widely and has a clear statement of its strategy. The areas of the country that do not have institutes of technology struggle while communities in which such institutes are well embedded experience a positive impact on their development. If we are to set up charters for these institutes, it is important that this element is enshrined within the charter as well as what is set out in the Minister's statement.</P>

      <P>As I indicated on Committee Stage, I am reluctant to oppose these amendments. However, there are legal issues arising which it has not proved possible to clear up before Report Stage. I will ensure that the proposals Deputy Bruton has made are considered in the context of adding to the regulations under <Col N="1064" /> paragraph (g), where the Minister may include other issues in the regulations so long as they are appropriate for the purposes of the charter.</P>
      <P>The parliamentary draftsman has advised against the inclusion of a reference to the objectives, mission or corporate statement in this subsection. It has been indicated to me that the matters already to be included in the charter are concrete matters. The parliamentary draftsman also takes the view that matters such as the objectives, mission or corporate statement are not appropriate for inclusion in the charter. He has further indicated that to agree to a draft amendment to that effect would require some research, which it has not proved possible to complete for Report Stage.</P>
      <P>I still have the wherewithal under subsection (2), where the Minister has power to make regulations, to add to the list. Subject to legal clearance, it is my intention to do that in accordance with the content of Deputy Bruton's amendment. I do not have any problem with including the subject of the mission statement.</P>

      <P>This amendment has been resubmitted from Committee Stage. This section was amended on Committee Stage in the Seanad, when I understand the phrase &ldquo;with the recognised institution&rdquo; was added to subsection (7). This tempers the wideranging powers the legislation confers on the Minister in the matter of revoking or amending an order made under the Act. The amendment seeks to ensure that when the Minister proposes to amend or revoke an Act he would do so at the request of a recognised institution or, where such a course of action by him would be necessary, that it would be done under the terms of the Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 55:</P>
      <P>In page 37, between lines 38 and 39, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;38.&ndash;On being delegated the authority to award its own national certificates and national diplomas, an Institute of Technology shall be given the same powers and stand-alone independence as the Dublin Institute of Technology under the Dublin Institute of Technology Act, 1992.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I have a strong constituency interest in this amendment. Following the recommendations of the interim review group under the chairmanship of Professor Donnelly, the delegation of the awarding of national certificates and diplomas to Waterford and Cork institutes of technology is to become a reality. The Bill is part of that enabling process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is under-provision of degree places and a low participation rate in the south-east region, including Waterford. The amendment seeks to provide that an incremental path be made available to institutes of technology to enable them apply for review under the Universities Act, 1997, <Col N="1066" /> for the purpose of being granted university status. The Bill copperfastens into law a specific role for the Dublin Institute of Technology. It is cast within the framework of the historical. The Regional Technical Colleges Act, 1992, and the Dublin Institute of Technology Act, 1992, divorces the Dublin Institute of Technology from the other institutes of technology in that it is given a stand-alone, independent existence.</P>
    <P>I am strongly of the view &ndash; it is shared in union circles &ndash; that if colleges are to make the progress they seek to make as rapidly as possible from the basis of having the validation of their qualifications rest with the national body, as happens at present under the NCEA, to validating all their own certificates, diplomas and degrees and, in effect, becoming a university, there is a need for a tiered, structured support system. Colleges that have reached the stage where they can award their own certificates and diplomas and remain in the resource pool used by the other institutes of technology are not given an independent existence outside of that group, as has happened to the Dublin Institute of Technology, which has applied for its review. That review is being carried out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been completed and published.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>The bottom line is that Dublin Institute of Technology has still not achieved university status.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of the review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that, but I said that the review had been carried out. However, the regional deficit which applies to the south-east means that there is a lower participation at degree level. In order to make the educational provision to meet that deficit, there must be another incremental step along the road. The Minister has indicated that it is his intention to introduce legislation which will devolve the disbursement of funding for all third level institutions to the Higher Education Authority. As one who represents a constituency in the south-east, that is all very well at this stage but, for example, the Government could fall or a reshuffle could take place etc. and it is possible that the next incumbent in the Minister's office will not have the same view in regard to the Higher Education Authority and the disbursement of funding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a proven road which the Dublin Institute of Technology has gone down to reach its current position. If other institutes are to travel that road as effectively and rapidly, the same structure which applied to Dublin Institute of Technology must be provided for them. Good luck to the Dublin Institute of Technology or any other institute of technology, but I have instanced the long-standing problem in Waterford. Over the past five years, there has been a substantial <Col N="1067" /> improvement but the college is still a long way from fulfilling its potential. Its capacity in terms of research and development will inhibit economic growth and this deficit can only be made good at post-graduate level.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I spoke strongly about this on Committee Stage and I must refute a number of arguments made by the Deputy. I get a sense that there is an element of political mischief making, perhaps not by the Deputy but by somebody else who is spreading the nonsense that somehow Dublin Institute of Technology gets more favourable treatment than other institutes of technology because it is governed by a separate Act. That is absolutely not the case. This can be seen by looking at the record of the Government over the past two years. It is a dramatic illustration that it is not the case. The funding for Waterford Institute of Technology has improved dramatically since the Government took office, with a series of projects being sanctioned through the science and technology investment fund. Capital funding and degree provision have increased along with that for sub-degree programmes.</P>
      <P>The Dublin Institute of Technology Act, 1992, was implemented in 1993 and we have moved beyond that. The Bill represents the dawn of a new era which will facilitate the growth of WIT. An external review group was put in place which assessed the institute objectively in terms of its procedures etc. and it recommended that it be given delegated authority to make awards at certificate and diploma level. The recommendation will be implemented as soon as this legislation is passed.</P>
      <P>The next stage for WIT is to apply for delegation of authority for degree status and, ultimately, to apply under section 9 of the Universities Act, 1997, if it wishes to become a university. A proper process is in place and the key issue is to ensure that it is objective. It is important that institutes concentrate on their strengths and on developing themselves as opposed to constantly looking over their shoulders at each other.</P>
      <P>I told various institutes of technology to look at the legislation under which Dublin Institute of Technology operates. It is not perfect and one could argue that it is very restrictive in some respects in terms of its governance. If the spectre of legislation for every institute that is delegated authority is brought forward, the entire process would be slowed. The framework that will be established by this Bill will be to the benefit of WIT and others. WIT has the physical space to develop. Significant additional facilities are coming on stream, capital funding has increased and it will grow to the extent that it will make an additional significant contribution to the socio-economic development of the south-east. The Government is actively pursuing that policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to be disparaging but at the same time I want to bury the notion that somehow a separate section in the Department looks after <Col N="1068" /> the Dublin Institute of Technology and nowhere else and allocates extra funding as a result. That does not happen and we do not have sufficient staff to do that. The staff cover the entire technological sector, including the Dublin Institute of Technology. The Dublin Institute of Technology has lost funding because of physical constraints. It has not been in a position to participate in a number of recent skills programmes because it did not have the space.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I refute any suggestion that I or anyone who made representations to me are motivated by mischief making. This is a serious matter and not one for mischief making.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>That implication was ungracious but I will settle for refuting it. When colleges move to the point where they validate their own awards, such as certificates and diplomas, they operate at a different level. The Minister can make all the broad stroke points he wishes about the Dublin Institute of Technology, but the colleges that have reached the stage of delegation of awarding degrees and diplomas will have a different agenda from those which have not reached that stage. The next step, obviously, is to seek a review at the appropriate time under the Universities Act, 1997.</P>
      <P>If in the short to medium term two institutes of technology have moved on to the next stage, competition for resources will not favour those because all institutes rightly will seek maximum funding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not endeavouring to disparage the Deputy but he has not explained how a college obtains additional funding when it achieves delegation of authority.</P>
      <P>It does not get additional funding. It gets funding in accordance with the degree to which it expands numbers in the college and the diversity and content of the programmes offered. There are various criteria regarding the basis on which funding is provided. However, if one delegates authority, but somebody else does not, it does not mean one gets a windfall. Officials work with the college on the basis of clearly set down criteria in terms of its needs on an ongoing basis.</P>
      <P>I do not fully understand the argument. It appears a view is being put forward that a benefit arises under the legislation if the two institutes receive delegated authority. The Bill deals with a qualifications and not a funding framework and it is disingenuous to suggest otherwise. It is not the case that the drawdown of funds will be limited because they are within a broad qualifications framework. That is not the position and it could not be so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>The basic point, in the context of colleges operating within a group at a level that is moving in that direction, is that best interests <Col N="1069" /> of the colleges which have progressed will not be served. The Minister said that Dublin Institute of Technology is funded on the basis of its requirements and proposed expansion. However, the Minister must consider if that happened because the Dublin institute was operating independently and validated its own certificates and diplomas. Validation of its degrees rested with Trinity College, Dublin. The Minister must consider whether more students wanted to come within the remit of the college because of what was offered.</P>
      <P>A comparison between one college and another is not the funding problem I am addressing. The issue relates to status. If more students want to attend a particular college, the resources to meet that demand will be sought and granted. As the prestige of colleges is raised, the issue is the number of students wishing to attend them and the range of programmes and services offered. One could argue the point that the Dublin Institute of Technology did not receive more because it was stand-alone and had its own legislation.</P>
      <P>Ultimately, the status of colleges and the number of students who wish to avail of the programmes and services provided by them is the main factor in their growth. When the two colleges in Cork and Waterford are delegated awarding powers, the public's perception of them will change. It will be perceived as an upgrading. The interaction between prospective students and the colleges will create demand and lead to the provision of resources which would not otherwise be provided if all the colleges remained within the same pot for funds. There will be much potential if the role of the Higher Education Authority is changed under the legislation and it takes on the funding of the technological sector. However, in the interests of the south-east and my constituency, the avenue proposed in my amendment is the best course in terms of maximising the educational provision at third level.</P>

      <Col N="1070" /> I move this motion in the absence of the Taoiseach who is still in Northern Ireland at the peace talks.</P>
    <P>As we approach the end of the century, the unprecedented strength of our economy is a legitimate source of national pride. The present period of high growth began in 1993-94 during a previous period of Government. The strong upward thrust has been sustained and reinforced beyond expectation over the past two years under the present Government. The recent OECD report on the economy contains a series of remarkable statements worth recording. This foremost international authority says:</P>
    <P>The Irish economy has notched up five straight years of stunning economic performance. No other OECD member country has been able to match its outstanding outcomes in a variety of dimensions . . . This is a far cry from the Ireland of the first half of the 1980s. At first glance it is astonishing that a nation could have moved all the way from the back of the pack to a leading position within such a short period, not much more than a decade in fact . . . To recapitulate, Ireland has enjoyed yet another year of very rapid growth, low inflation, declining unemployment and external and budgetary surplus. Such outcomes are the envy of countries round the world . . . It is little more than a  decade since Ireland was labelled the &ldquo;sick man&rdquo; of Western Europe . . . Today, Ireland is a world leader in a number of aspects of economic performance. For a number of years its economy has been termed the &ldquo;Celtic tiger&rdquo;, even though, following the financial crisis in Asia which began in 1997, its outcomes have clearly surpassed those of such etymological rivals in the 1990s . . . It has really only been in the past five years that the Irish economy has demonstrated peerless performance. Average output growth essentially doubled.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>We will send for the dictionary shortly. All this has been the collective achievement of the Irish people and of the social partners, which includes successive Governments since 1987. I am proud of the distinct and very positive contribution made by the present Government but I am also proud to have been there with my colleagues at the foundations, working with Mr. Charles Haughey, Mr. Ray MacSharry and Deputy Albert Reynolds, and with other parties at different times, to create social partnership, to negotiate massive levels of EU funding and to put the public finances and <Col N="1071" /> the whole economy on a sustainable path, that has subsequently enabled us to create hundreds of thousands of net new jobs and a prosperity without parallel in our history.</P>
      <P>For the first time since independence, we are approaching full employment, with every prospect of pushing unemployment below 5 per cent within less than two years. We have substantially more people employed than at any time in our history, with close to a 50 per cent increase over the past ten years. Even since taking office in mid-1997, employment has grown by well over 100,000. We are continuing to generate substantial net new industrial jobs, and to attract a substantial proportion of high quality US investment in the European Union. Emigration has been reversed. We have had growth since 1994 averaging 7.5 per cent. Our national debt will soon be below 50 per cent of GNP and we are running a substantial budget surplus that should be more than sufficient to fund our social and infrastructural priority needs without recourse to net borrowing.</P>
      <P>We have successfully navigated our entry into the single currency and, while Britain still continues to waver, we are for the present the only English-speaking point of the Union to be a member of that currency. That has advantages as well as disadvantages. Economically, we have been getting the best of a number of worlds. We are integrated into the huge European market. We are very competitive <i>vis-à-vis</i> our nearest market in the UK. In terms of investment and tourism, some of the dynamism of the US economy has been transmitted to Ireland.</P>
      <P>Most of us can remember all too vividly the difficulties and handicaps and the demoralisation, when we started out twelve years ago . We know that our economy will only continue to be strong if we keep to the successful formula that has brought us this far. We now must adapt social partnership to the new circumstances. We cannot afford to abandon discipline on either pay or public spending. Sceptical observers will be watching closely to see how much longer we can continue to defy the known laws of economics, or if we begin to show signs of coming off the rails.</P>
      <P>The potential and sweeping gains that we need to make, if we are to catch up with the main body of our European partners, depend on continuing our present steady course. While we now lead the countries of the periphery, we still only rank 12th out of 15 EU member states in terms of living standards by head. It is foolish to talk of having overtaken Britain, using unreal GDP figures. Our real income per head is now about 90 per cent of the EU average but we still have substantial leeway to make up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The critical factor in sustaining momentum will be maintaining confidence. That must involve a clear determination to keep down costs, expenditure and inflation. It also involves continuing the transition to a competitively taxed economy. If we are to maintain the size of workforce that we <Col N="1072" /> will need, we have to lower the undue and discouraging burden of personal taxation on individuals and families at all levels of income, but especially at or below the level of the average industrial wage. We also must urgently address the child care issue from both a social equality and an employment aspect, which I see as a main priority of the next Budget. We are expecting a report of the interdepartmental committee by the end of the month.</P>
    <P>The two main infrastructural constraints are housing and transport. We are building record numbers of houses, completing nearly 42,000 in 1998. The main answer to the housing problem is to increase supply, especially the supply of affordable housing for young people. I do not believe that the heavy-handed controls or taxes advocated in the past are the answers to the problem; they may even exacerbate it. It is the Government's firm plan to spread development around so that it is not just concentrated in and around Dublin city, perhaps to a radius of 50 miles, but that other main towns and cities around the country and their hinterland will benefit. The regionalisation of the country will help create a level playing field so that the counties of the west, the midlands and the Border can also get their fair share of development.</P>
    <P>One of the areas in which we lag badly behind our more prosperous partners is the relative lack of an established modern infrastructure, which is still incomplete. While we are making a great deal of important progress, much remains to be done to create a satisfactory transport system by different modes that will convey people rapidly, both within and between cities, and which will bring environmental services up to the highest standards.</P>
    <P>This Government has approved huge investment not only in roads but in public transport improvements &ndash; increasing our bus fleet, building the Luas, upgrading rail safety and extending rail commuter services. Over the summer, we will be working to finalise the national development plan, in which the European Structural and Cohesion Fund requirements will no longer be the dominating factor to the same degree. We will be concentrating on accelerating development and trying to telescope the extended delays that bedevil most long-term public projects. The new planning legislation will have a role in this, as will public-private partnerships which we now want to get off the ground.</P>
    <P>We are transforming many of our public enterprises so that they can confidently face a new competitive environment. Given their strategic importance to the Irish economy, our objective is to enable them to thrive, whether in their existing form, in strategic alliances or turning themselves into successful commercial corporations in private ownership.</P>
    <P>We need to remember that most public enterprises were established originally because of the absence or unwillingness of the private sector to invest in them. I am glad we will be able to <Col N="1073" /> give their employees, as well as members of the general public, a stake in them when their ownership is opened up.</P>
    <P>The Government has made much progress in this area, building on what a previous Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats coalition started in the early 1990s. Virtually all European Governments, whether of the left or the right, have embarked on this process. The attitudes of my party to this matter have never been driven by ideology.</P>
    <P>Achieving social inclusion, side by side with a strong economic performance, is one of the Government's highest priorities. Our success in creating employment is probably the single most important instrument of social inclusion. Between 1987 and 1994, we succeeded in reducing the depth of poverty.</P>
    <P>Having completed the programme set out by the Commission on Social Welfare, the Government has given particular priority to raising the incomes of pensioners, a comparatively neglected group in recent years, towards our target of £100 per week.</P>
    <P>We are tackling the drugs scourge head on and have succeeded in reducing crime levels by approximately 15 per cent, with the prospect of a cumulative 25 per cent reduction by the end of our third year. The drug barons can no longer operate with impunity and are now subject to a minimum ten years prison sentence. The pushers will also be rounded up. We are giving towards law and order the resources long denied them to provide extra gardaí to bring them up to a full complement of 12,000, to provide extra prison places and to make the criminal law and the prosecution of crime more effective. A new fraud Act will make a major contribution to tackling white collar crime.</P>
    <P>A full range of adequately funded social and community services is something to which we can now reasonably aspire. Since 1990 there have been large real increases in the funding of the health services. Numbers employed in the health sector have increased from around 56,000 to 68,000 in the period. In the past two years, for instance, funding for persons with a mental handicap has been doubled. Since coming to office we have secured an increase of 28 per cent in revenue funding and 43 per cent in capital funding in 1999 over the 1997 provision. We are committed to making further necessary improvements in both hospital and community care. Apart from the physically and mentally handicapped, we need to develop further our services for older people and to ensure that people with serious illnesses or who are in considerable pain receive treatment promptly.</P>
    <P>Cardiac surgery facilities are being developed through a nationwide strategy which will see £16 million additional funding spent by the end of this year. New facilities are being provided at St James's Hospital and University College Hospital, Galway, with children's services being further developed at Our Lady's Hospital for Sick <Col N="1074" /> Children, Crumlin. With these developments, capacity for adult cardiac surgery will increase by over 50 per cent and paediatric surgery will increase by up to 40 per cent. Preparations are also under way regarding the establishment of a heart and lung transplant facility in this country, to be based at the Mater Hospital.</P>
    <P>Since coming to office approximately £19.5 million has been made available to implement the provision of the national cancer strategy. This funding is helping to address the issue of regional imbalances in the availability of cancer treatment services outside Dublin.</P>
    <P>The importance of children's issues to this Government is highlighted by the fact that a major national child care investment strategy, costing £28 million, was announced last December. The establishment of the social services inspectorate on an administrative basis is also an important development.</P>
    <P>A dedicated counselling and related service is being set up to support the work of the commission we set up to inquire into childhood abuse. Improving services for older people is an important objective for the Government and this year alone a sum of £14 million is being allocated to develop capital projects in this area. Residential care units, rehabilitation, respite care and day care facilities across the country will be significantly enhanced as a result of this funding. Income guidelines for medical cards for persons over 70 were substantially improved in March of this year and the next two budgets will see a doubling of these guidelines.</P>
    <P>Those public patients currently on waiting lists are seeing improvements brought about as a result of the significant increases in funding provided by the Government under the waiting list initiative. Last year we increased this funding by 50 per cent over the previous Government's allocation and this year we have further increased this amount to £20 million. The underlying causes of waiting lists will also be helped through the further allocation this year of £9 million to services for older people and £2 million to the continued improvement of accident and emergency services. I am pleased that March 1999 saw the first decrease in waiting lists since December 1996 when the figure dropped to 34,996, a decrease of 1,887 over the previous quarter.</P>
    <P>More people than ever before are being treated by our hospitals. Between 1996 and 1998 there has been an overall increase of almost 38,000 in the number of in-patients and day cases treated by hospitals. In addition, in 1998 almost 1.25 million attendances were treated in out-patient departments. The OECD has commented favourably on the high productivity in Irish hospitals, and it is this Government's firm intention to ensure that hospitals continue to show the same efficiency in the years to come.</P>
    <P>We are proud of our record in education. Resources are being particularly concentrated in areas of disadvantage, but we are making general improvements on a broad front. Access to a full <Col N="1075" /> secondary education and third level is being improved. It is more and more understood that continuous education is the key to a happy and fulfilled life and to the advancement of our society. With the help of private contributions, we are giving a new and more ambitious cutting edge to our scientific efforts through the science and technology development fund.</P>
    <P>Social cohesion and social justice are essential to our concept of a successful country. Backward and impoverished societies are generally characterised by vast disparities of wealth. We did not become independent to escape from that, but the ability to spread wealth and achieve real improvements for all sections of the population depends on generating steady economic growth. The art of modern government is to foster that growth and extend its benefits to all sections of the population.</P>
    <P>We have successfully completed the Agenda 2000 negotiations which provide a satisfactory foundation for sustaining our economic advance. The outcome was of particular benefit to our agricultural sector, which could have fared much worse. The overall reform represented an estimated gain over seven years of £395 million, with a saving to consumers of £271 million. The take-up of the farm assist scheme is gradually improving and farmers know the Government will do everything reasonable within its power to tackle exceptional difficulties and maintain the viability of family farming.</P>
    <P>The same active approach is being shown towards our fishermen. For instance, the Minister recently negotiated a much better deal for them in Cologne on the blue whiting catch.</P>
    <P>Ireland intends to play a fuller and more active international role, in keeping with our responsibilities as a more prosperous country. We are one of the few countries increasing rather than reducing our development aid programme and we expect it to reach at least 0. 33 per cent of GDP in 1999.</P>
    <P>Joining Partnership for Peace as well as our agreement at Cologne to the further development of the Common Security and Foreign Policy means that we will in future be actively involved in European multinational peacekeeping operations that are based on international law.</P>
    <P>Good Government is not just about successful policy implementation and good administration. It is also about maintaining standards and integrity in public life. All members of the Government are fully committed to that. We have instituted and co-operated fully with inquiries and tribunals. We are operating in conditions of openness, transparency and accountability that did not exist previously. There are now more rules in place than ever before to prevent the abuse of power, improper influence or the concealment of potential conflicts of interest.</P>
    <P>We intend to publish a standards in public office Bill later this year, having canvassed Oireachtas committees for their views. Preven<Col N="1076" /> tion of corruption legislation will be published later this year to implement EU and OECD conventions. Local government reform will provide for annual disclosures of interests and related matters by local authority members and staff. We have also agreed to provide legislative protection for &ldquo;whistle-blowers&rdquo; who report serious misconduct by their members out of a sense of public duty. The position of former public servants in areas related to their work will also be properly regulated.</P>
    <P>While eternal vigilance plays an important role in any democracy, we in this House should be wary of manufacturing scandals for political ends, based on minor faults or mistakes, or even mere allegations, in a way that has a disproportionately devastating effect on individuals who have otherwise given exemplary service to the State. I think I am not alone in the House in finding the instant ruin of individual careers and reputations arising from the ruthless pursuit of political advantage or media overkill distasteful.</P>

      <P>The vast majority of people engaged in public service are neither corrupt nor dishonest, but carry out their duties to the best of their ability for the public good. All of us make mistakes from time to time. While I pay tribute to the genuine achievements and exposures of investigative journalism, I deplore the casual broad brush exaggeration that attempts to convey the impression of congenital sleaze, idleness and freeloading among politicians. Such denigration is very far from the unglamorous truth of a lot of conscientious very hard work for long hours with, in most cases, comparatively little reward.</P>
      <P>We will work to improve the functioning of our institutions, to engage in further constitutional reform and to strengthen the confidence of our people. All in all, we should be proud, not ashamed, of our democracy. It has weathered many storms, will withstand any challenge and is something to which our people are deeply attached.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;do adjourn&rdquo; and replace them with &ldquo;until 10.30 a.m. on Monday, 5th July, 1999&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I oppose the adjournment of the Dáil until 29 September because I believe the Dáil can play a key role in resolving the difficulties in the Northern talks. The Dáil should stay in session so that we can give legislative effect to the Government's timetable for decommissioning and the consequences of failure to meet that timetable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Legislation can provide the necessary certainty to break the deadlock and there was speculation overnight that legislative guarantees might be given to underpin commitments on decommissioning and to set out in incontrovertible language what would happen if those commitments are not met. The concept of legislative commit<Col N="1077" /> ments which could not be altered by Governments without further legislation has the potential to break the talks deadlock in my view, because it will create certainty where now there is nothing more than verbal assurances.</P>
    <P>Such legislation cannot, however, be enacted unless the Oireachtas is in session. I have, therefore, asked the Government to agree to the Dáil sitting next Monday to enact the relevant legislation. To sustain the momentum inherent in a successful talks process, it is important to enact the relevant legislation next week. I believe the argument about whether Sinn Féin speaks for the IRA or not is an interminable and unresolvable one and that it is necessary to step outside existing formulae to break this impasse. That is why we should use the route of legislation, which cannot be altered by Governments without further legislation, to set out responsibilities and consequences which are beyond doubt. Since IRA weapons are also held in this jurisdiction, any legislative guarantees should be passed by the Oireachtas and not just in Westminster. The imminence of Drumcree also argues in favour of clear assurances that such legislation be passed quickly before that confrontation is aggravated.</P>
    <P>Last night Sinn Féin said:</P>
    <P>Against the background [which they described] we believe that all of us, as participants acting in good faith, could succeed in persuading those with arms to decommission them in accordance with the Agreement. We agree that this should be in the manner set down by the Independent Commission on Decommissioning within the terms of the Good Friday Agreement.</P>
    <P>This language is similar to language used before by Sinn Féin on at least three occasions. Prior to the talks, all parties, including Sinn Féin and the Progressive Unionist Party, signed up to the Mitchell Principles in order to participate in the talks. One of the principles, which both Sinn Féin and the PUP agreed to in early 1997, was that they gave their &ldquo;total and absolute commitment to the total disarmament of all paramilitary organisations&rdquo;. Then, on 24 September 1997, a resolution which was adopted in the talks and accepted by all parties including both Sinn Féin and the PUP which stated: &ldquo;the resolution of the decommissioning issue is an indispensable part of the process of negotiation&rdquo;. On Good Friday, 1998 all parties, including Sinn Féin and the PUP, reaffirmed their commitment to disarmament as follows:</P>
    <P>all participants accordingly reaffirm their commitment to the total disarmament of all paramilitary organisations. They also confirm their intention to continue to work constructively and in good faith with the Independent Commission and to use any influence they may have to achieve decommissioning of all paramilitary arms within two years following endorsement in referendums North and South of the Agreement and in the context of the implementation of the overall settlement.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1078" /> Those successive and repeated commitments mean that Sinn Féin and the PUP have agreed on three occasions that they will use all the influence they have to achieve the decommissioning of all paramilitary arms within two years of the endorsement of the Agreement in referenda. In other words, both parties have already agreed three times that all the arms that belong to the IRA and the UVF will be put beyond use within a two year period ending next May.</P>
    <P>Regrettably, neither organisation has yet put any arms at all beyond use and we are over half way through that period. While some of the earlier commitments, particularly adherence to the Mitchell Principles, were unambiguously given on behalf of Sinn Féin itself alone, last night's statement is an expression of belief in what &ldquo;all of us&rdquo;&ldquo;could succeed&rdquo; in doing. As such, it is hard to see in what direction it shifts Sinn Féin's formal position. In any event, the shift hardly warrants the term &ldquo;seismic&rdquo;. I find it hard to reconcile this actual language in Sinn Féin's statement with the way their position was presented to us yesterday in the media. However, I have reason to believe, that although the words used by Sinn Féin last night and agreed by them over the last two years have hardly shifted at all, that the emphasis given to their words and the body language accompanying them has given those sitting across from them in Belfast genuine reason to believe that this time something will actually happen.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, tone and emphasis cannot easily be translated into robust contractual language. Those of the reformed religious tradition have a different approach to the interpretation of the emphasis put on tone and language than those of us of the Roman religious tradition.</P>
    <P>There is a real cultural difference which sometimes prevents sincere people on either side from understanding one another. Without casting doubt on anyone's sincerity, that gap could be bridged by legislation in both jurisdictions which would incorporate the two Governments' understanding of the implications of paragraphs 17, 18 and 19 of the de Chastelain report, which was published two hours ago, their understanding of what will happen if the requirements of those paragraphs are not met and their proposed mechanism for making the relevant judgments with regard to those paragraphs.</P>
    <P>This will not remove the issue entirely from politics but it will create a legal framework of certainty and objectivity within which those judgments would have to be made. That could create the assurance needed to break the current deadlock. Furthermore, I believe that the Members of this House have a fundamental vested interest in ensuring that paramilitaries disarm. Such disarmament is required by Article 15 of our Constitution and is necessary to prevent paramilitary arms falling into the hands of criminals or dissidents. If the war is over, why do loyalist and republican paramilitaries need guns? Any viable agreement must provide a reassuring answer to that question. If the answer cannot be <Col N="1079" /> obtained in sufficiently robust form from available interlocutors it should be provided in legislation that applies equally and fairly to all.</P>
    <P>For these reasons, I believe the House should not adjourn. Legislative provisions form part of the proposed settlement. The current proposal that such legislation be passed in Westminster only is not enough. Any such legislation should also be passed by the Oireachtas to underpin this solemn undertaking and give the assurance necessary to enable the Northern Ireland Executive to be set up before the weekend. The Executive should be set up before a confrontation occurs at Drumcree next Monday and the best way to ensure that this happens is for the Houses of the Oireachtas to meet next week to give legislative form to those guarantees. That is the way forward.</P>
    <P>The mechanisms for recalling the Dáil are somewhat cumbersome and it would be better if, instead of adjourning, we allowed ourselves to meet in the normal way next Monday, as I propose, or Tuesday, to pass the relevant legislation which, I hope, the Government will soon say it wishes to see enacted in one of the parliaments. The legislation should also be passed by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>During the course of exchanges this morning with regard to shareholdings in CRH by Mr. Justice Moriarty who is conducting a tribunal of inquiry into the affairs of Mr. Charles Haughey and Deputy Lowry, Deputy Gormley indicated that the Green Party had not been informed of Mr. Justice Moriarty's shareholdings in CRH. I had discussions with the Attorney General, Mr. David Byrne, last night in the course of which Mr. Byrne told me that he had informed all the party leaders. I accepted his word on that, although I have no recollection of it. Mr. Byrne also told me that he had arranged with the Taoiseach's office that they would inform the Green Party of the fact that Mr. Justice Moriarty had disclosed the shareholdings. That is what the Attorney General told me last night and the basis for what I said this morning. I have since spoken to Deputy Gormley who had also spoken, since this morning's exchanges, to the Attorney General. Just as I accept Mr. David Byrne's word, I now accept the word of Deputy Gormley that the Green Party was not informed of this. I have no reason to doubt that Deputy Gormley is a truthful person as is the Attorney General.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has set out, in reasonable terms, the successful position of the economy. He tended to mention Members from one party rather than others who were involved in creating the political conditions for this. I will not adopt that partisan approach. The foundation of our economic success can probably be attributed to a decision taken by the late Deputy Donagh O'Malley to introduce free secondary education. That, with the decisions to join the European Union and to guarantee a corporate tax rate of 10 per cent, which was taken by Deputy Desmond <Col N="1080" /> O'Malley, are among the foundation stones of our current success. It has nothing to do with the Minister for Finance in his current incarnation nor is it due to any action taken by me as Taoiseach. The foundations of our current economic success go back a long way. That is the nature of economic success and the current economic boom should not be used as an argument in favour of this or any other Government.</P>
    <P>We must assure the public that the conditions necessary for continued economic success will be maintained. They are predictability of political decisions and efficiency. The predictability of the corporate tax position in Ireland, which is guaranteed by all the main parties, is one of the key reasons for our success.</P>

      <P>If any party in opposition were to propose to change it, our economic position would be undermined. All parties are entitled to credit for this. Membership of the EU requires Irish Governments to adopt a pro competitive policy with regard to public procurement and the operation of State companies. Were it not for the requirements of EU membership we would not enjoy our current economic success.</P>
      <P>The other requirement for continued economic success is efficiency and there are serious problems of efficiency in the management of the structure of our economy. The clearest demonstration of the inefficiency of the political process is seen in the combined problems of traffic and housing, as we outlined in another motion earlier this week. The traffic crisis is a symptom of failure to plan, to provide adequate public transport and to provide houses near where people work and work near where people live. Because of bad planning, people live in one place and work in another some distance away. We have no co-ordinated settlement policy and we do not have the political instruments to enforce or require such a policy to occur. While the Government will undoubtedly publish a national development plan in the near future which will contain commitments to make a large investment in infrastructure, we do not have the means to ensure that the infrastructure is used to the full.</P>
      <P>An example of infrastructure not being used to the full can be seen by anyone who travels by train from Dublin to Maynooth, as I have done. On that journey one sees large areas of unsettled land. If one wants to guarantee that an inherently expensive rail service is used, one must ensure that people live close to the railway line.</P>
      <P>The houses are being built perhaps two miles from the railway line and if people have a choice of driving to the station, leaving the car there on a wet day and taking the train or driving straight to work, undoubtedly they will drive straight to work and not use the train. There is no co-ordination between decisions about the provision of either bus or train services and the provision of houses close to those services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1081" /> The NIMBY and the BANANA &ndash; build absolutely nothing anywhere near anything &ndash; factors combine to ensure that infrastructure is under-used where it is provided and over used in other circumstances. Any co-ordinated development plan must ensure that all the factors necessary, not just affordable houses but also houses in which people can live a civilised life, are provided. Providing housing without child care, bus services, schools, footpaths and play areas which will be maintained in a decent condition, is not any use. For example, there are well planned parks in my constituency which become health hazards because the county council does not have the means of maintaining them. Providing parks and houses and then not maintaining the parks obviously makes the houses less habitable and makes the people who live in them more likely to object to additional houses being provided. These people say they are not being provided with adequate services as it is, so why should there be more people living beside these unmaintained parks, inadequate child care facilities, overcrowded schools, etc. Unless we co-ordinate the provision of the social facilities, which are necessary to make houses habitable as well as affordable, we will not solve the infrastructural problem.</P>
    <P>What is wrong with the Government's approach to economic policy at present is not that it does not have the plans on paper and that it will not spend the money &ndash; no doubt it will spend the money &ndash; but that it does not have the legislative means of ensuring that all these things happen together in a co-ordinated way, and there is no political leadership. The Taoiseach is not interested in this problem and he has not taken a lead on it. When I was Taoiseach, I initiated Operation Freeflow to deal with traffic congestion by knocking together a succession of heads of Departments who hitherto had not been talking to one another in many cases. I do not make any great claims for what I have done because Operation Freeflow just dealt with traffic which is a symptom of a much wider problem. It requires the co-ordination of all infrastructural provision to make provision for affordable and habitable houses. That is the issue on which the Taoiseach should take a political lead. I hope that soon he will be able, as a result of his success today in the talks, to turn his attention for however long he remains in office to this infrastructural and settlement issue because it requires political leadership from the top. I pledge, in so far as my ambition is to occupy the office currently occupied by the Taoiseach, that I will ensure that that will be done and that the number one priority will be an infrastructural and settlement plan to ensure that there are enough houses which are both affordable and habitable for our people.</P>
    <P>We are clearly seeing serious social bottlenecks. I acknowledge the economic success to which the Minister for Finance referred but there are bottlenecks being created by that success. For example, physically disabled people who had <Col N="1082" /> immense intellectual and other capacities to contribute had to picket outside Dáil Éireann and promise to stay up all night there before they could get restored to them their means of travelling to and from work. They could not get to work or college because a service which was provided for them had run out of money. The only way they could deal with that was to picket the gates of Dáil Éireann. That is an eloquent testament to the failure of our political system to respond to emerging needs.</P>
    <P>There is a similar situation where we have provided railway lines and trains for DART and then services must be cancelled because there are not enough drivers to drive the trains. That is a political failure. FÁS has had to go overseas to get people to take up jobs. Meanwhile people like accountants, bio-chemists and teachers, who are here as refugees, may not work because the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will not allow it. That is a clear failure of the political system to respond to a real situation.</P>
    <P>In Wexford strawberries are rotting in the fields because the farmers cannot recruit enough people to harvest them. That is a metaphor which sums up in a sense the consequences of success. To date our political system has been geared to deal with the consequences of economic failure over perhaps 50 years of statehood but it is not geared to deal with the problems of success.</P>
    <P>Dublin Airport has one of the biggest and most expensive car parks in Ireland. People do not want to use it. They would prefer to be able to go by bus to Dublin Airport yet when a private bus operator applies to run a shuttle service between Dublin Airport and the city centre so that people will not have to leave their cars at the airport the application lies fallow on the shelves of the Department of Public Enterprise for more than a year. This is a failure of the political system to use an available means to resolve an infrastructural problem in the economy.</P>
    <P>Anybody looking at the streets of Dublin will see that there are not enough buses, the buses are overcrowded and come together in a bunch, and the service is not available when it should be. That should not happen. There are buses, which are available all day having done their school runs in the morning, which could be used to provide services in the middle of the day but the Minister will not allow it. She will not amend the Road Transport Act and will not use the freedom it gives her, if she studied it properly, to issue licences. This leaves people standing with an insufficient service.</P>
    <P>Public transport needs a dramatic increase in investment. CIE, Bus Éireann and Dublin Bus need money. There is plenty of work for those in the public and private sectors who provide public transport. There is no competition in the sense of a zero sum gain as between the two sectors in the provision of public transport. There is plenty of work for all. The obstacle, just as in regard to providing funds for Vantastic and to recruiting refugees to work in firms where jobs exist for <Col N="1083" /> them, is in this House and nowhere else. This is where the failure is in our political system. It is a political failure and we must deal with that.</P>
    <P>The Minister correctly diagnosed child care as a problem facing society and he has personal experience of this issue. It is a real problem. However, we must put it in its wider context. This is the most stressful time in history to be a child in Ireland. Children must cope with long delays getting to and from school. If they walk to school, they must cope with the hazard that they might be killed on the way to school by drivers who are stressed by their attentiveness to the important job of driving a car, which is a potentially lethal weapon, along a road where children may pass. In addition, children's playgrounds are being fouled by dogs or litter where the law is not being enforced. The playground or some of the play equipment on the playground, from which people could fall, may be closed to children because the local authority has been advised that it is liable to be sued by people claiming compensation for injury.</P>
    <P>The facility to make claims and incur liabilities of that nature is a legal question which, with the issue of the compensation culture, is not being addressed in this House.</P>
    <P>If we want to employ greater numbers of people and open more playgrounds and recreational facilities, we must deal with the issue of public liability insurance which is causing major problems. The issue has been on the agenda of successive Governments. It was on the agenda of the Government which I led and we did not find a solution to it. This Government has not found the solution either. The issue was doubtless also on the agenda of the previous Fianna Fáil-Labour and Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Governments. No Government has dealt successfully with the issue of the cost of public liability insurance and its effect.</P>
    <P>We are being forced to deal with it in one area, the Defence Forces deafness claims. That is only because the Government finances are under pressure. We have not bothered to do anything where the finances of sports organisations or local authorities, which wish to provide playgrounds, are under pressure because of excessive liability claims. It is dealt with only when it affects the budget forecasts of the Minister for Finance's advisers. That is not as it should be and I hope something will be done about it.</P>
    <P>The issue of affordable child care is a major problem. We should use schools in the evenings to allow child care to be provided for infants or for children who cannot go home until their parents return from work and who wish to stay on to do their homework. Insurance liability regulations are preventing us from doing that. The Ministers for Education and Science and Environment and Local Government could change those regulations in this House, but they have not yet done so. We must recognise that insurance costs are a major obstacle for crèche owners. <Col N="1084" /> Legislation has been imposed on them in regard to the space necessary for each child, but we have not provided finance to enable that space to be provided. We then wonder why there is a child care crisis. The crisis is the inevitable result of the lack of decisions made in this House.</P>
    <P>Decisions have not been taken in many other areas. I deplore the failure of the Minister for Defence to produce the promised White Paper on defence. I deplore the failure of the Minister for Education and Science to produce the long promised legislation on a children's ombudsman. I deplore the failure of the Minister for Agriculture and Food to produce the long promised White Paper on rural development at a time when we have unprecedented urban congestion. There has never been a greater need for the production of a paper on rural development.</P>
    <P>Certain political gaps are not being filled and the House should not adjourn until assurances are given that the issues I have outlined will be dealt with.</P>

      <P>A long shadow has been cast over this House today as it adjourns business for the summer recess, not alone by the loss of the lives of four Air Corps members but also by the continuing uncertainty in Northern Ireland. The tragic deaths of the four Air Corps officers &ndash; Captain Dave O'Flaherty, Captain Michael Baker, Sergeant Paddy Mooney and Corporal Niall Byrne &ndash; in Tramore, County Waterford, late last night has saddened us all. The grief is compounded by the fact that this was the first flight of the new helicopter for the south-east, the purpose of which was to save lives. The hope and expectation embodied in the photograph of officers O'Flaherty and Baker in today's <i>Irish Independent</i> further deepens the sad irony of the situation. Our condolences and support go out in the first instance to the immediate families, extended families and friends of each of the officers. However, we must not forget the impact which this sad event will have on the officers' Air Corps colleagues. It is the body's first experience of loss of life in action and it will mark them significantly.</P>
      <P>News of the tragedy at Tramore was accompanied on our radio this morning by further analysis of yesterday's events at Stormont. It is probably too early for a complete analysis of the events of recent days. Those of us outside the process cannot pretend to be aware of the detail and, more significantly, the nuances of what has occurred. Suffice it to say that the two Governments must be congratulated on the immense efforts they have put into the process in the past couple of weeks. Nobody can doubt their commitment to resolving the impasse which is holding up the implementation of the aspirations of the Irish people North and South and, I suspect, of all of the people on these islands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Good Friday Agreement is about the future. It is about shutting the door on a bloody and sorrowful period in our history. Unfortu<Col N="1085" /> nately, the reasons for the need for a settlement such as the Good Friday Agreement may become more apparent as the summer progresses. The imposition of a deadline by the two Governments, particularly by the British Prime Minister, has been the source of some debate. The strategy was certainly risky but, given the inability of both parties in this dispute to shift from long-stated positions until the last few hours, it was probably necessary. I, for one, will not second guess the decision.</P>
    <P>It is important that the progress which has been made in recent days is not lost. The onus now lies on the parties to resolve the outstanding issues. I do not envy the position of the Assembly members, particularly those whose obduracy lessens their party leaders' room for manoeuvre. The party leaders must return to their constituencies and explain why a fresh start for Northern Ireland has once more been delayed.</P>
    <P>Events at Stormont did not form the subject of the only debate about the future which took place this week. This House had an animated and interesting week in which two crucial issues were dealt with, namely, the manner in which available financial resources should be used and the manner in which the people who come from abroad to this country seeking refuge should be dealt with. I understand that these debates have largely gone unreported due to events elsewhere. However, that does not diminish their importance.</P>
    <P>For the reality to be grasped, it must be stated time and again that this State and society has come a long way in a short period of time. Since 1994, only five years ago, our wealth has grown by a massive 44 per cent. Everyone knows there is money around and that there are jobs to be filled. In that respect, I welcome the belated conversion of the Minister for Finance to a half recognition of the need to invest money and the rather tentative plan for a proposed investment of £25 billion in the region over the next period of the national plan. In particular, I welcome the comments made by the Leader of the Fine Gael Party on the need to co-ordinate such investment to ensure we achieve a synergy and a real value for its impact. I have been calling for this for the past 18 months. In July of last year, the Chambers of Commerce of Ireland issued a proposal for a decade of investment which would result in us systematically dealing with problems which have been identified in part, although comprehensively, by Deputy Bruton. The scale of the problem is so enormous that the Deputy could doubtless have spoken for a further hour.</P>
    <P>The Government has been a major beneficiary of economic growth. The Exchequer is enjoying a bounty which was unimaginable even three years ago when I had the honour of serving as Minister for Finance. Let me put it in the following stark context. The Minister for Finance, who introduced this debate, is doubtless busy elsewhere but is ably represented by the dauphin of the Fianna Fáil Party. In December of this year, the Minister will have a total of £5.5 billion or £55 <Col N="1086" /> billion of solid currency on his desk, equivalent to the entire proceeds Ireland received over the past six years from EU Structural Funds.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to state and restate the scale of the opportunities now facing us. As a society, we have yet to face up to the challenges posed by this new wealth.</P>
    <P>We have unprecedented choices to make and opportunities to fulfil. No previous group of elected representatives who had the honour to sit in this House was presented with the same opportunities. The debate this week in Private Members' time was about putting in place the economic infrastructure necessary to sustain economic development. Such a debate is timely and I welcome its broadening and the broadening of the participation in it.</P>
    <P>We cannot continue to allow the standards of the past to constrain our aspirations for the future. The Government stubbornly refuses to recognise the new opportunities and challenges. It smugly makes comparisons between its performance and that of its predecessors, as if the economic situation was remotely similar. The speech of the Minister for Finance was another chapter in that smug complacency. We have been transformed. References to the position two, three, four or five years ago are not relevant. The question is what will we be like in two, three, four or five years from now.</P>
    <P>The Government's response to the housing crisis is a good example and it can no longer hide behind the old excuse that it has only come into office. It has consistently sought to deny that there is a crisis; there is. The Drudy report commissioned by the Labour Party has identified &ndash; no one has challenged this figure &ndash; that up to 135,000 are in need of adequate or improved accommodation. The Minister for Finance said that 40,000 to 50,000 housing units will be built this year. The Government has refused to commission its own report and blithely adds that it has succeeded in slowing down the rate of increase in house prices and that more houses are being built.</P>
    <P>Little or nothing has been done to assist local authorities to acquire more land at reasonable cost and the 20 per cent social housing requirement in private development remains a pipe-dream. The chairman of An Bord Pleanála said that such a proposal contained in planning permissions is probably <i>ultra vires. </i>This task will have to be confronted by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.</P>
    <P>The deficiencies in our transport infrastructure &ndash; road, rail and otherwise &ndash; are becoming more painfully apparent. Over-reliance on private transport is choking our cities and towns, yet we continue to underfund public transport. The Minister for Public Enterprise did not have the courage to say this this morning but, rather than make buses and trains more attractive, she intends to sanction an increase in fares next week <Col N="1087" /> when the House is in recess further driving away potential passengers. That is political courage.</P>
    <P>The Government's refusal to invest the resources at its disposal makes no sense. It has earmarked a massive privatisation programme which pays scant regard to the overall strategic interests of the people or the companies involved. Despite warnings from many sources, it appears intent on creating private monopolies from public monopolies and selling off, for example, Coillte, the biggest land owning body in the State, for no apparent reason. Is it to reward the chief executives or because it needs the extra cash? What will it do with the extra money? The Government is ideologically driven. The Minister for Finance attempts to suggest that Fianna Fáil is a party with no policy. In this respect, whatever about the rest of the social democrats or populists who linger in Fianna Fáil, the right-wing ideology of the Minister for Finance is clear. Why is the Government contemplating selling off Coillte? What will it do with the £5.5 billion that it will have at the end of this year?</P>
    <P>The reluctance of the Minister for Finance to accept that public investment is now possible and back on the political agenda is not surprising. His are the politics of a decade ago. He appears intent on ensuring that no private finance will be allowed to tackle the problems created by his refusal to commit public funds. A report on public-private partnerships was presented to the Department of Finance over one year ago. The Minister for Finance announced six projects that would benefit from PPPs which the Labour Party supports. When asked if discussions had been held with financial institutions about possible participation the answer was &ldquo;no&rdquo;. The matter has been entrusted to a section of the Department of Finance which dislikes intensely and ideologically the idea of public-private partnerships. It is as if the Minister for Finance believes that complaints from economic bodies and the public are part of the general whinge about standards in public life which he views contemptuously.</P>
    <P>The problem is that the Government is doing so well it does not know what to do. It thinks it has created the economic boom.</P>

      <P>The Government is in charge of an economy that is doing so well that it does not know what to do. It thinks it is responsible. At the behest of Deputy Healy-Rae it has put more effort into securing additional Structural Funds for particular regions than it has into preparing the entire nation for the future. I welcome the securing of additional EU funds to which the State remains entitled. However, I worry about the continued and almost absolute importance attached to these funds. The matter needs to be put in context. This year's budget surplus will be equivalent to the total amount of Structural Funds received in the period 1994 to 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1088" /> Whatever else, the future of the west and Border counties as well as Ballymun and Knocknaheeny will depend on decisions taken in this House. Deputy Healy-Rae's influence on the Government should not be underestimated. It appears that Deputy Healy-Rae has the power to stir the Minister for the Environment and Local Government into action. The Bill to reform local government has not appeared despite the postponing of the local elections on more than one occasion to facilitate its publication.</P>
    <P>The performance of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government at the recent EU conference on genetically modified organisms shamed him and the Government. It highlights the ongoing drift from environmental issues which started with the scaling down of the campaign against the Sellafield nuclear reprocessing plant. Ireland recently joined Spain in vetoing moves towards EU harmonised green or eco taxes. Despite the fact that Ireland is already in excess of the agreed levels of CO2 emissions arising from the Kyoto Summit and subsequent EU decisions, the Ministers for the Environment and Local Government and Finance appear confused as to who should take responsibility for an issue which we all acknowledge will bear heavily on future generations.</P>
    <P>Standards in public life have dominated this Dáil session. The Taoiseach has shown, at best, disregard and, at worst, contempt for his responsibilities to this House on more than one occasion. Despite the Government's best wishes, this issue will not go away. It has some way to go &ndash; I include the Progressive Democrats in this &ndash; before it is given a clean bill of health.</P>
    <P>What is most disappointing is that the Government continues to pay lip-service to this issue, for example, its decision not to cap local elections expenditure was despicable and contrary to the thrust of measures taken by the House in recent years to protect the reputation of the profession of politics. Only two days ago, less than one month after the Taoiseach's special adviser was forced to resign arising from a conflict of interest between his directorship of a PR firm and his position in the Taoiseach's office, the Government voted down Labour Senator Gallagher's Bill in the Seanad on the registration of lobbyists.</P>
    <P>Again, I sense the hand of the Minister for Finance in that decision. There was no Cabinet meeting this week and no decision was taken in respect of the Bill. The Minister for Education and Science is obviously not aware that a unilateral decision was taken to vote down the Bill in the Seanad.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The decisions of the Cabinet are not confidential. If the Minister for Education and Science is attempting to suggest he is debarred from announcing decisions of the Cabinet, his role as Minister with responsibility for education has further to travel.</P>
      <P>Worse still, it was the right hand, in more ways than one, of the Minister for Finance that vetoed Seanad support for Second Stage of legislation providing for a register of lobbyists. Shame upon it if a Cabinet chose to veto this measure less than four weeks after the Taoiseach, out of the corner of his mouth, said it might be necessary to register these activities. Is it any wonder we are cynical about the utterances from that side of the House?</P>
      <P>The real irony is that the Government voted down a Bill to register the activities of lobbyists and then caved in to the biggest lobby group in Ireland. The publicans of this country and in this House have the Government by the proverbials. They made ducks and drakes of the Fianna Fáil Party over the last 48 hours. This is directly relevant to the registration of lobbyists' interests. This was achieved by the six or seven publicans who are members of the Fianna Fáil Party and others. If ever the country sought evidence of an inside lobby group nobbling a Government at the last moment, this was it. What a contradiction and a farce. This Government has talked about standards in public and political life but, when put to the test, its actions have fallen far short of its words.</P>
      <P>The Government and, particularly, the Taoiseach have shown great sensitivity when the Opposition raises issues of accountability. I have been accused of engaging in personality politics. I reject that. The role of an Opposition party is to act as a watchdog on behalf of the people. If the Taoiseach fails to carry out his legal responsibilities as an employer and to lodge with the necessary offices, including the Oireachtas Library, documentation relating to the terms and conditions of the people he employs and if we do not ask about that, who else will? What does the Government think is the role of an Opposition Deputy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is a garda operating a personal vendetta if he attempts to arrest somebody who is committing a wrong? Is a teacher carrying out some form of personality politics in a classroom if he attempts to correct a pupil who does something that is manifestly wrong? Yet when an Opposition poli<Col N="1090" /> tician holds a Taoiseach to account for manifestly failing to do something which he is legally obliged to do, he is accused of engaging in some form of personality politics. That is nonsense and poor politics. It is weak and defensive.</P>
    <P>Over the past year this Taoiseach has had to come to the House on more occasions than any of his predecessors to deal with questions of political judgment and accountability. Rennicks, Sheedy, Gilmartin, Duffy and Flynn refer to just some of the controversies that have arisen on his watch and in respect of which he has had to be held to account to the Dáil. Whether he responded in many cases in either a comprehensive or convincing manner is his problem, not that of the Opposition. We are not engaged in personality politics but in the politics of opposition until we return to the other side of the House.</P>
    <P>The tribunals currently sitting are an important part of a process that is necessary to restore public life in this State. The revelations may be painful and costly but they are necessary and my party will continue to support them. Another political lie in the Minister for Finance's contribution should be nailed. He claimed that the Government instituted the tribunals, as if it came to the House and said &ldquo;Would it not be a wonderful idea to set up a tribunal to investigate Ray Burke and Charles Haughey?&rdquo;. The Government was dragged screaming and kicking into the House. It fought many amendments, including one which would have included the Glen Ding controversy in the remit of the Moriarty tribunal. The attempt by Fianna Fáil to suggest that it voluntarily proposed the establishment of tribunals is a political lie and I use that word advisedly.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the debate on economic infrastructure. It is an important debate but only on one side of the coin. Hand in hand with preparing our physical infrastructure for the new millennium is, according to citizens, the type of rights that have been denied to them for too long. It is a scandal that queues for basic social services continue to grow at a time of plenty for many. Unemployment may be decreasing in terms of numbers, but a massive amount of investment is still required to restore confidence and support to the communities which it ravages and continues to damage.</P>
    <P>The drugs problem remains enormous. It not only damages the individual that it corrupts but has an overall corrosive effect on the community. The recent ESRI report on anti-social behaviour in local authority housing estates and the drugs problem are interlinked. The drugs problem in our prisons is also an issue that must be tackled, particularly in Mountjoy. I invite the Government to look again at the second report of the ministerial task force on measures to reduce demand for drugs. The perception that this problem has been tackled with any degree of finality is misleading and it is not the experience of those in communities still ravaged by the scourge of drug abuse. Methadone maintenance is not and cannot be an end in itself.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1091" /> We cannot allow access to health care based on ability to pay rather than on an assessment of medical need to continue into the next century. This is an important issue and we must address it. I see no sign that this Government is attempting to do so. Planning and preparation for the care of our elderly are also crucial. Within ten years Ireland will have 88,000 more people over the age of 66 years in its population and no planning or provision is being made for them.</P>
    <P>The debate on immigration is a significant issue which this country must face. Let nobody misunderstand the passion which fuelled the debate in the House this week. Immigration has long since overtaken emigration in our society. Anybody who canvassed during the local elections will have noticed the increased number of non-nationals living in Ireland, drawn by high-tech computer industries and the attractiveness of living in the youngest country in Europe. As a society we do not appear to have a problem with these people. For the most part, they are European and, perhaps more importantly, white. However, it is different if the colour of their skin is not white.</P>
    <P>This republic, learning to live at last with its own divisions, has transferred some of its animosities to these new outsiders. Our immigration services patrol our borders with vigour, policing their coming and going. The irony is that reports of labour shortages in key industries continue to grow. The latest report of shortages of labour in the beef processing industry is a case in point. Our response, which is supported by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform &ndash; a man from County Kerry which is known to have its people scattered across the globe &ndash; has been to systematically prevent people who are seeking asylum from working. This policy has been confirmed time and again, even this week in the context of the Immigration Bill, by the Minister.</P>
    <P>When this period of time is studied by historians the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will not come out of it well. For two years he ignored a call to implement the Refugee Act, including a motion to this effect which was passed unanimously by the Dáil in December 1997. Having dithered for two years, he then chose to use the opportunity presented by the Immigration Bill to produce a 16 page amendment to the Refugee Act. Such an amendment is, in effect, the equivalent of an entirely new Bill. It is totally unacceptable that such an important matter which has such serious implications for the rights of asylum seekers should have been treated in this way.</P>
    <P>Even at this stage the independent procedures recommended by all agencies dealing with refugees, and provided for in the Refugee Act, are still not in place. An Act passed by the Oireachtas and signed by the President was bypassed for nearly two years by the Minister and his Department. It has been a deeply shameful experience.</P>
    <P>The way in which the Government pushed the Immigration Bill and the amendments to the <Col N="1092" /> Refugee Act through the Oireachtas suggests that the human rights of asylum seekers do not rate very highly on the Government's political agenda. We have evidence to confirm that. The fact that one year after the signing of the Good Friday Agreement the Government still has to introduce legislation to establish a human rights commission suggests to me that the civil rights of our own citizens do not rate very highly either. A solemn commitment was made by both Governments in that Agreement that a human rights commission would be established. The British have honoured that commitment. The Labour Party published a Private Members' Bill to give effect to the same commitment. In Britain, the necessary legislation was passed by Westminster before the end of last year and a chief executive was appointed. We, however, have got no further than the Government producing the heads of the Bill, which is the preliminary stage of the legislative process. We cannot, with any moral authority, criticise others for the failure to meet their obligations under the Good Friday Agreement when our Government has shown such a cavalier disregard for honouring its commitments.</P>
    <P>We are told that the Government intends reviewing its programme for Government over the summer. There is clearly a need for a radical overhaul of that programme. The opportunities facing us are momentous. A programme to prepare this society for a new century, to radically change our attitude to certain sections of our community is what should be presented to the social partners as part of the preparations for a new national programme.</P>
    <P>As long as the Government continues to pursue, in tandem with the British Administration, a balanced approach to the search for a political solution to the problems of Northern Ireland &ndash; and I say this formally to the members of the Government present and to the Fianna Fáil Party &ndash; the Labour Party will continue to provide the constructive support it has given over the last two years.</P>
    <P>In all other areas, however, we will continue with a policy of vigorous opposition. This is a Government with all the resources and no ideas. The Government now has the financial resources to make this country the envy of Europe in the next millennium, but instead it seems transfixed, immobilised and incapable of rising to the challenge. This is a Government under which a modest semi-detached house has moved way outside the price range of most families.</P>

      <P>I also wish to convey my sympathy to the families of the members of our Air Corps who were so tragically killed yesterday evening. It was with great shock that we learned of the tragedy and I am devastated for the families concerned.</P>
      <P>The Adjournment of the House provides us with an opportunity of evaluating the developments of the last legislative session and to see how we have progressed. Above everything else, from my own perspective, I think the performance of the Government in relation to the peace process, and particularly the performance of the Taoiseach, stands out as one of the Government's great achievements so far.</P>
      <P>I pay tribute to the Taoiseach for his skill, perseverance and incredible devotion of time and personal energy towards finding a resolution, with others, to the conflict on this island. I want to pay tribute both to the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister for the extraordinary efforts they are making with the other parties this week in Belfast to reach a resolution of outstanding issues. Ultimately, the prize of bringing peace to this island must be the Government's central objective. It is the litmus test for all of us in the House. I welcome the support from other parties for the Taoiseach's endeavours. We wish him, with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, and others who are currently involved in the negotiations, every success.</P>
      <P>The Government has much to look back on with pride and to look forward to with confidence. Across the full range of activity, major strides have been made to develop public services, to promote social inclusion and empower individuals. When taken together with the initiatives launched over the last two years, there is a record of substance which will stand the test of time and serve as a comprehensive rebuttal to the rhetoric of those who showed no imagination for or commitment to tackling issues when they had the opportunity only a short time ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1094" /> Comprehensive action has been taken to reverse the neglect of housing policy. Local government has been put on a sounder financial footing. Our health services have received unprecedented investment and our social services have been developed to focus innovative programmes on helping those most in need.</P>
    <P>In the field of education we have implemented a range of initiatives which are already ensuring that our education system is stronger and more inclusive. We are currently implementing the largest ever concentrated modernisation programme in the history of Irish education. Almost £300 million has been allocated to school capital projects. This is benefiting communities throughout the country which have had most of the burden of local fund raising lifted from them. We are bringing to an end the era of substandard school accommodation and are working hard to reach the day when every child can attend school in an environment which can help their learning rather than hinder it.</P>
    <P>We are also modernising what happens within our schools. New curricula have been introduced allied to extensive teacher development, and we have implemented one of the most ambitious school information technology programmes in the world. Going from a very low base, we have connected every school to the Internet and by the end of this year over two thirds of our teachers will have participated in IT training courses.</P>
    <P>Turning to third level, the position is just as impressive. The £250 million education technology investment fund represents an unprecedented investment in developing crucially important areas of education. This is the golden age of third level building, with campuses throughout the country being reborn with world class facilities. Added to this has been a real commitment to support excellence in research, which will make a huge contribution towards keeping Ireland at the cutting edge in a global economy where knowledge is the key ingredient.</P>
    <P>It is not just the physical infrastructure of our education system which is benefiting from major investment. The last Government's freeze of school funding has been abandoned and this year has seen the largest ever increase in direct current funding for our primary schools.</P>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Pupil-teacher ratios have also been cut and the first increase in teacher numbers in many years is being implemented. After two years of asking, I have yet to hear an explanation why the 1997 budget included a proposed plan to cut back teacher numbers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Added to these system-wide improvements, we have shown an unmatched commitment to tackling important issues of disadvantage. The 1999 budget has given us the opportunity to implement a plan to tackle disadvantage at all levels of the system. Involving £57 million over two years, this <Col N="1095" /> package has allowed a level of innovative and comprehensive action which could not have been possible with the type of mind-set we saw both in the 1997 budget and in previous years.</P>
    <P>A series of initiatives to identify and help children at risk of dropping out of school and getting caught in cycles of disadvantage have also been implemented. The Education (Welfare) Bill, currently before the House, will help us to put in place a radical new approach to school attendance and early school leaving.</P>
    <P>The discredited enforcement-led model will be replaced with one focused on the individual education needs of the child. The Bill will help address the damaging impact of dead end jobs attracting marginal pupils out of education.</P>
    <P>The issue of adult literacy has been subject to much lip service over the years but action is now being taken. Funding has been almost trebled and more people are participating in adult literacy programmes than ever before. One of the greatest concentrations of educational disadvantage in our society is among the travelling community. A representative committee has been established to advise on policy development and we have significantly improved the range of services and resources for this group.</P>
    <P>In September, for the first time ever, every school in the country will have a remedial service available to it and every disadvantaged school, at primary and second level, will have a home-school liaison service.</P>
    <P>The initiative of which we can be proudest is a scheme based on the right of children with disabilities to the teaching and child care support they need to benefit most from education. This has included the first ever recognition of the education needs of children with autism. It is difficult to comprehend that before last December such children did not have automatic entitlement to recognition in the education system. Every week the High Court has fewer special education cases on its list and every week more children are being given the opportunity to develop to their full potential. That is real action which resonates louder than the empty rhetoric of lightly given empathy.</P>
    <P>The opportunity to participate in higher education has been expanded greatly with a 9 per cent expansion already. Further education has increased by one third. We have introduced a new grants scheme to support students who want to attend post leaving certificate courses. The legislative programme which we have implemented has also helped to strengthen our system. For the first time in our history we have a comprehensive Education Act on the Statute Book, establishing the rights and responsibilities of each person and group. It provides an enabling framework for protecting what works and tackling what does not. The Qualifications (Education and Training) Bill, 1999, which hopefully will be introduced shortly, will promote a system of further and higher education with allows flexi<Col N="1096" /> bility, supports inclusion and progression but insists on quality.</P>
    <P>In addition to a body of smaller items of legislation, the Education (Welfare) Bill will be regarded as a landmark. The vocational education committee Bill, which will be introduced in the next session, will help to reinvigorate a crucial element of the second level education system. The teaching council Bill is with the draftsman and it is hoped to introduce it in the next session. It will radically change the professional status of the teacher in the Irish education system. The Scientific and Technological Education (Investment Fund) (Amendment) Act, 1998, which was a radical departure not only in terms of legislation but in providing for a multi-annual system of capital funding for third level education, gives value for money and has ensured significant projects for the institutes of technology and the universities over the next two to three years. Within a short period the policy framework of Irish education will be on a much sounder footing.</P>
    <P>The idea of working to protect and promote quality has informed our actions in a range of other areas as well. Teacher training has been brought to the fore with pre-service training receiving critical attention and in-service training brought to a new level in terms of resources and activity. Curriculum options have been expanded.</P>
    <P>Central to the entire education programme has been the commitment of the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance. The support which the Minister for Finance has given to education, in the short time in which he has been in office, contrasts sharply with the criticism he has received today in the House. He is a particularly visionary Minister for Finance and I look forward to continuing to work with him in expanding the education budget and the services that will flow as a result.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>Our deliberations today are taking place in the shadow of, hopefully, an historic breakthrough in Northern Ireland. Such a breakthrough for peace would be the most important privilege ever bestowed on our country and it would be acknowledged for a long time to come. We also meet at a time when the economy is roaring ahead. The figures for job creation and those at work are impressive. There are fewer people on the dole, interest rates are lower and the export figures are good. In other words, it is a good all-round performance based on many years of planning and much hardship. I would not like to think the Government would take all the kudos for what is happening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, within this excellent set of economic circumstances many groups face a very low horizon. For example, the sick must queue for hours on end at our hospitals, those who need eye and hip operations must wait for up to four to five years and one night this week the disabled had to protest outside the House to draw the attention of the Government. The group I know best, the <Col N="1097" /> 150,000 farming families, are going through a living hell.</P>
    <P>On behalf of Fine Gael I deplore the manner in which the Government has turned its back on Irish agriculture. I am fully aware of the negative aspects &ndash; the incidence of BSE, the resultant loss of markets, the food scares and so on. There is no reason agriculture should be relegated to the second division. Agriculture was the first Celtic tiger and this seems to be forgotten by many people. Generations of Irish farmers played a vital role in developing export markets all over the world. Irish farmers and their families provided a supply of good quality food at reasonable prices for the population. Farming families, with others, provided a balanced population base in rural areas which counteracted, to some degree, the great shift of population towards towns and cities. Above all else, Irish farmers are the custodians of the environment which, if allowed to deteriorate further, would affect everybody in the State.</P>
    <P>It is against this background that I speak of the importance of injecting hope and confidence into what was once a proud industry. In my lifetime I have not witnessed a depression as bad in the farming community. It is facing another horrific year &ndash; the signs are not good for 1999. Cattle prices, in particular store cattle prices, are as depressed as in the dark days of November and December 1998.</P>
    <P>To illustrate how the asset value of livestock has collapsed let us take the case of a medium farmer with 100 cattle &ndash; 40 suckler cows, 40 weanlings and 20 other cattle. In 1997 the average value of his animals was £54,000; today the value of that herd is £34,000. We talk about bad days on the stock exchanges. Should the value of shares collapse on the stock exchanges to the same degree as the values in the livestock industry there would be pandemonium all over the world.</P>
    <P>The Government has convinced itself that there is nothing it can do. It is beaten at home and away on agriculture and it stumbles from one crisis to another. For example, in the pig sector the Minister for Agriculture and Food and the Minister of State spoke about a real turnabout last December, later it was forecast for March-April and now it is not sure &ndash; it might happen in October and it might not. Terrible damage has been done to farming families who are outstanding pig farmers but could not take the financial crisis.</P>
    <P>The cattle trade looks set for another bad autumn. The only bright spot, the export of live cattle to the Continent, is under threat daily. There was the problem of inadequate shipping but that seems to have been overcome to a large degree. We now find the Spanish Government has arbitrarily imposed a ban on live exports of cattle over 12 months of age. Seemingly its Health Minister wants the backbone and ganglia classified as special risk material in its fight against BSE. This is completely out of kilter with the veterinary regulations in all the other EU <Col N="1098" /> countries. It would not be a practical proposition to export our weanlings, which would have to be killed at under 12 months, to Spain if it continued down this road. Neither the Government nor the Minister has taken this problem as seriously as they should.</P>
    <P>The next crisis arose last week and concerned the question of veterinary controls on the export of live cattle. The Government had intended to implement these yesterday, on 1 July. The problem was it did not tell anybody and huge ongoing problems about interpretation of the health certificate arose. However, let no farmer be in doubt that there is an attack on the live cattle trade from many sides. I hope the new exports certificate will not mess up our livestock exports this year.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister and his Department to be more sensitive in their interpretation of this regulation. We proudly boast of having the best health status for our national herd of any country in Europe. The controls now in place should be enough to convince even the most discerning buyers that our product is the best.</P>
    <P>Whether it is real or imaginary, many livestock farmers believe there are forces in this country who want to stop the export of live cattle. We will export 180,000 live cattle this year, which is considerably more than last year. There are now almost eight million cattle in the country, which is a record. All are agreed that we have very poor export outlets lined up for the rest of this year. It would be nothing short of financial suicide if we were stopped or impeded in any way from exporting cattle, dead or alive. That is our job. We are an exporting country. If we get a market, in no matter what part of the world, we sell. That must be the buzzword, not just now but in two months or five years. That message has not yet hit home.</P>
    <P>We are a member of the EU where the principle of free trade has been an established cornerstone for many years. We have a product that can be sold and is sought after in other countries. There is no reason unnecessary impediments should be placed in the way of that trade.</P>
    <P>This is a time for great political leadership in the farming industry. Those who are not farmers do not understand the severity of this crisis. That is acceptable. However, despite the booming economy, the farming community is going through a horrific time. I make a special plea to the Minister and the Taoiseach to give an undertaking to every farming family that everything will be done in the short term to try to get our agricultural community through the ravages of the next six to 12 months.</P>
    <P>We have much work to do, including extensive planning in the agricultural economy. We must do things over the next couple of years we never attempted before. We must completely rearrange our breeding policy because the breeding programme is not good enough to meet the new demands. We must also do a huge job on our marketing across the world. Against this back<Col N="1099" /> ground I wish to make it clear that old friends are best. Many people are flying the flag for some of the new industries, which I hope we will have for another 100 years. They are very important. However, we should never forget old friends. The day for Irish agriculture will come again. We must give a chance to those young people who genuinely want to make a sustainable living from the land.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>While our average income <i>per capita </i>has now reached European norms, our national housing stock is only two thirds of the European average in relation to population. We have the incomes and the borrowing capacity but we lack the supply of housing that should correspond to our European level of incomes and increasingly European demographic profile.</P>
      <P>The Government's overriding housing strategy of increasing housing supply derives from this reality. We may need to build up to half a million new housing units over the next ten years and I hope we can see annual housing output rise to 50,000 units per annum over the next few years. In recognition that the availability of suitably serviced development land was a major constraint on the development of housing, a range of key initiatives are being implemented by the Government to provide services to open up land for residential development. The serviced land initiative alone has provided £39 million from the Exchequer, which, with £60 million investment by private developers, will open up 100,000 additional housing sites. The budget provided for a rural towns initiative aimed at providing badly needed water and sewerage facilities in towns and villages that have not been accorded priority under existing programmes.</P>
      <P>Overall capital expenditure on water and sewerage services under the national development plan, 1994-99, will amount to more than £960 million, which is far in excess of the £605 million envisaged when the plan was agreed. The Government is determined that the infrastructural deficit will be radically addressed in the new national development plan, 2000-06, which is now at an advanced stage of preparation. This plan will provide the framework for the best utilisation of Exchequer, EU and private funding to carry out a seven year infrastructure programme unprecedented in the history of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Housing represents the largest infrastructural deficit of all. From day one, in July 1997, we set out our key priorities in our action programme, including a continuing house construction programme by local authorities and voluntary groups, refurbishment of existing inadequate housing, improvement and extension of social housing schemes, maximum co-ordination of housing policy and local authorities developing serviced sites to accelerate the supply of new <Col N="1100" /> houses to meet rising demands and deflate escalating house prices.</P>
    <P>We have achieved remarkable progress in expanding housing output, tackling house prices and putting in place a series of measures to provide for a significantly expanded social housing programme. The overall policy framework, within which housing measures are being pursued, incorporates the key objectives to secure sustained house price stabilisation as quickly as possible through accelerating housing supply and to provide an effective strategy for development in the medium and long term.</P>
    <P>Not only is it necessary to maximise the supply of serviced land, it is also essential to maximise the potential of that serviced land. This necessitates appropriate levels of residential density, which will secure the efficient use of serviced land and, at the same time, further the objectives of sustainability and help reduce the problem of commuter-generated traffic congestion, especially in the Dublin area. The recently published draft planning guidelines on residential density will make a major contribution to securing these objectives. Local authorities have been asked to implement them even in their draft form, and I emphasise that they and An Bord Pleanála will be obliged under law to have regard to the guidelines when they are formally issued.</P>
    <P>My Department is reviewing the possibilities for increasing the supply of land for a greatly increased social and affordable housing programme and actions by the Government in this area will not be constrained by any left or right-wing ideology. Meeting increased housing demands in a balanced and sustainable fashion requires not only increased private housing supply but providing for tenure choice.</P>
    <P>The Government is acutely aware of the importance of the private rented sector and the need to maximise its potential in meeting our housing objectives. The perceived difficulties in this sector, together with its importance in the context of current housing needs, demand action on a broad front. The issue of security of tenure cannot appropriately be considered in isolation from other key issues, such as rents, supply and quality of accommodation, investment return, market considerations and existing constraints to the development of the sector. These all impact on the optimum operation of the sector.</P>
    <P>It was for these reasons that I decided that a commission on the private rented residential sector should be established. The aim is that the commission will produce recommendations which will have a positive overall outcome and contribute to achieving a thriving, more diverse and well managed sector. I am pleased to inform the House that Mr. Tom Dunne of the Faculty of the Built Environment, Dublin Institute of Technology, has indicated his willingness to act as chairman of the commission. The membership of the commission will comprise nominees of the Law Society, the Bar Council, Threshold, St. Vincent de Paul, the Irish Property Owners' <Col N="1101" /> Association, the Irish Auctioneers and Valuers Institute, the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Ireland, the Irish Association of Investment Managers, the Attorney General's office and relevant Departments. The commission will report to me and will be serviced by my Department.</P>
    <P>The Government's commitment to the provision of social housing is reflected in the significantly increased funding for social housing since it took office.</P>
    <P>In two years the Government has increased Exchequer spending on housing by a massive 45 per cent. This year's capital provision will allow 4,500 new local authority housing &ldquo;starts&rdquo;, the highest number in 13 years.</P>
    <P>To meet the expanding social housing needs and to help deliver local authority housing more efficiently, a new four year multi-annual local authority housing programme of 22,000 additional houses will commence next year &ndash; the equivalent of an increase of more than one fifth on the existing local authority housing stock. In addition, we believe the voluntary housing sector has the capacity to provide some 4,000 units of accommodation per year.</P>
    <P>This will, of course, require a greatly increased level of support from my Department and local authorities, not least in terms of the availability of land. In overall terms, the target is to expand social housing output through the range of local authority and voluntary housing programmes to cover the needs of more than 16,000 households per annum over the next few years, thus delivering social housing to almost 60,000 households over the next four years.</P>
    <P>The targeting of social deprivation and dereliction in cities and towns also forms the basis of our new approach to urban renewal. The new urban renewal scheme which I launched in February, and which will benefit 38 towns and five cities, has a more focused approach based on preparation of integrated area plans. The new scheme includes an overall objective of ensuring that at least 15 per cent of additional bed spaces provided in an IAP area should be social housing. Many of the IAPs will co-ordinate with the local authorities redevelopment and refurbishment programmes which have already been approved.</P>
    <P>The business incentives available under the new scheme &ndash; the introduction of which were deferred pending receipt of EU approval &ndash; were brought into operation with effect from yesterday. This decision removed the climate of uncertainty which had existed for some time regarding the extent to which commercial-industrial tax incentives could be applied for the new urban renewal scheme.</P>
    <P>I expect to be in a position to circulate guidelines for the new town renewal scheme by the end of this month. This scheme, which is aimed at the restoration and conservation of townscapes in smaller towns, will make the benefits of renewal tax incentives available in up to 130 towns throughout rural Ireland with populations of <Col N="1102" /> between 500 and 6,000 and forms an important part of the rural renewal programme.</P>
    <P>The Government has now been in office for two years which is not bad when one considers that, in June 1997, a Fine Gael Minister in the outgoing rainbow Government told people he confidently expected to be back in government within six months. He is still waiting and might do so for a while yet.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats Party can look back with a real sense of achievement at its last two years in government. It has put privatisation back on the agenda. One only has to look at the surge of public interest in the Telecom Éireann flotation to see that privatisation is hugely popular with the people. It is a shame that conservative forces on the left resisted moves towards privatisation for so long and kept it off the national agenda for several years. It is a remarkable coincidence that flotations of State companies seem to occur only when the Progressive Democrats Party is in government. We have made real progress on liberalising the economy. The telecommunications market has been opened up to full competition and the demerger of Cablelink &ndash; again resisted by the conservatives on the left for several years &ndash; will open up new and exciting opportunities for consumers.</P>
    <P>We have reduced taxes. The halving of capital gains tax was a spectacular success and has greatly increased the revenue take from this tax subhead. In our first budget we reduced both rates of personal taxation by 2 per cent. Again, it is one of those remarkable coincidences that the top rate of tax only ever seems to come down when the Progressive Democrats Party is in government. We have reformed the tax system. The introduction of tax credits in the last budget was the most fundamental and positive reform to our personal taxation regime in a generation. Left-wing parties talked about tax credits; we delivered them. Job creation has reached record levels since Deputy Harney took over as Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. All regions of the country &ndash; Galway, Limerick, Cork, Waterford, etc. &ndash; benefit from inward investment.</P>
    <P>The Minister's employment action plan ensures that rising employment translates into falling unemployment. She has taken real action to help unemployed people, especially the long-term unemployed, back into work. When the plan was first announced last year it was roundly attacked by some Members opposite. Today, it is seen to be spectacularly successful and the critics are silent. We have delivered on our promises to old age pensioners. Two years ago we said we would raise the old age pension to £100 per week. We have given record increases to pensioners in the last two budgets and we are on track for the £100 per week target within the lifetime of this Administration.</P>
    <P>Diversity is the essence of democracy. The electorate must have real choices if the democratic system is to function effectively. Media <Col N="1103" /> commentators say the centre is crowded and that all parties are the same. Parties have shifted their positions in the face of a rapidly changing social and economic situation in Ireland but I do not accept that all parties are the same.</P>

      <P>I join other Members on all sides of the House in expressing my condolences to the families of the four members of the Air Corps who tragically lost their lives. As spokesperson for Health, I am conscious of the manner in which the Air Corps worked with the health service providers over the years and has saved lives. This was a great tragedy for the families of those who lost their lives, and for all members of the Air Corps. It is right that we extend our condolences to them.</P>
      <P>The two year term of the current Minister for Health and Children has been marked by a period within the Department of paralysis, paranoia, internecine warfare and legislative inertia. In a time of economic plenty and unprecedented Exchequer returns, the Minister has failed to obtain, and the Government has failed to provide, the essential resources necessary for a modern, responsive, patient-centred health service.</P>
      <P>No serious attempt has been made to implement the promise contained in the programme for Government &ldquo;to tackle the crisis in hospital waiting lists&rdquo;. The Government has presided over a 20 per cent increase in hospital waiting lists during its term of office. On 31 March 1999, 35,000 people awaited in-patient hospital treatment compared to 29,000 on 31 March 1997. In the midst of an economic boom, and with the Exchequer coffers overflowing, the Government regards it as acceptable to treat the section of our community reliant on public hospital services with contempt and has through its policies institutionalised a two-tier health service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is appropriate that the debate was opened by the Minister for Finance. Lauding the economic achievements of the State, he referred to the stunning economic performance that has occurred as if in some way it is the consequence of Government policies as opposed to those implemented over a number of years by successive Governments and the hard work and sacrifices of many people outside the House. It is particularly appropriate because the performance of the Government and the Minister for Health and Children in the health area can be described as falling substantially short of stunning. Paralysed by inaction, that Department has to date failed to implement the majority of the recommendations contained in the Department's report of July 1998 on the waiting list crisis. It has also, <Col N="1104" /> of course, failed to implement the detailed proposals and recommendations contained in the Fine Gael policy document &ldquo;Patients First&rdquo;, which was the first document published to address problems in this area. The recommendations, if implemented, would radically improve hospital waiting lists.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has been committed to confrontation rather than consultation in dealing with health service providers. Nurses who are the front line of the health service have been regularly forced by the Government into unnecessary confrontation to have the value of the work they do properly recognised. There is a growing shortage of nurses, particularly within the Eastern Health Board area, and as a consequence hospitals are unable to deliver essential services which require full nursing capacity.</P>
      <P>Just a few weeks ago, there was the extraordinary sight of junior hospital doctors conducting a lunch time protest because of the Government's failure to understand the pressures under which they work, the impact on their health of having to work 60, 70 and sometimes 80 hour weeks, and the dangers posed by the level of work to patients who come into their care.</P>
      <P>The Government agreed to a period of 13 years to implement a basic proposal to give junior hospital doctors a 48 hour week, the type of work schedule which currently should be in force and which is required to ensure the best possible medical care is provided for patients who need it.</P>
      <P>The Government programme states: &ldquo;Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats in Government are committed to radical change to ensure that the needs and aspirations of people with disabilities, their families, carers and advocates are comprehensively addressed&rdquo;, yet, three times in the past seven months, the Government has voted down Fine Gael Private Members' motions calling on it to accelerate the rate of change. The Government appears to prefer making people wait. It has adhered rigidly to timetables agreed when resources were not so plentiful. It prefers to act like Lady Bountiful, patronisingly doling out pocket money in dribs and drabs when easily affordable capital injections and increased revenue funding could radically improve so many lives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the Government advocates integration, independence and empowerment for people with disabilities, what they, their families, carers and advocates continue to experience is marginalisation, exclusion and powerlessness. They continue to be denied basic rights, such as the right to leave home and travel on a bus without having to be carried on or having to crawl on; the right to personal assistance services for help with dressing and feeding and the right to residential or day care for children or adults who have an intellec<Col N="1105" /> tual, physical or sensory disability. Basic rights for carers are also denied, such as the right to respite care. The sight this week of so many disabled people again protesting outside Leinster House simply to maintain the existence of a special travel service illustrates the bankruptcy of the Government's appalling failure. The disabled and their carers have been betrayed by the Government which has abysmally failed to comprehensively address their needs although it has all the necessary resources to do so.</P>
    <P>At a recent meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children to consider this year's Estimates for the Department of Health and Children, there was the extraordinary sight of the Minister for Health and Children bewailing the lack of adequate funding for his Department and acknowledging that when compared to the funding allocated to health services by our European Union partners, the State finds itself at the bottom of the league. The Minister seemed to lose sight of the reality that it is his job to ensure the funding required is allocated by Government to his Department. It is his job to ensure that Ireland is at the top and not the bottom of the health service league. His extraordinary public acknowledgement of failure surprisingly attracted no media attention or comment. It is time it was understood that the Minister for Health and Children has publicly acknowledged that adequate resources to meet essential health care needs are not currently being provided by the Government.</P>
    <P>The manner in which health policy issues are addressed by the Government is a national scandal. Neither the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, nor the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, regard any issue as of sufficient urgency to require immediate action. Plans and programmes announced are either postponed or abandoned once the media spotlight shifts to another issue. Vital breast screening and cervical screening programmes which should have been functioning by the middle of last year will not now come on stream until the new millennium. Legislation to establish a social services inspectorate, which was said to be a Government priority in 1997, has never been published and has now been shelved. Vital adoption legislation originally promised for 1998 has been inexplicably delayed and will not be seen for at least another year.</P>
    <P>The legislative record of the Minister for Health and Children and his Department during the Government's term of office is deplorable. No health legislation of a substantial nature has originated during the lifetime of this Government and currently there is no published health legislation awaiting consideration by Dáil Éireann. The three measures which have been enacted were all under preparation during the lifetime of the previous Government.</P>
    <P>The health area of Government is locked in a state of legislative paralysis and a broad range of issues that require attention remain unaddressed. <Col N="1106" /> These include the need for a new medical practitioners Act, a new mental health Act, a new nursing Act and an Act to implement in the State the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and International Co-operation in Respect of Inter-country Adoption. The Government has also failed to publish the long promised child abuse guidelines and to introduce any new measures which may be required to ensure their effectiveness. The failure of the Minister for Health and Children to oversee and develop any coherent legislative programme addressing a wide variety of outstanding health issues raises serious doubt about his commitment to his brief and his competence to preside over the Department of Health and Children.</P>

      <P>Earlier Deputy Quinn referred to the lobbyists Bill and he accused the Government of being against such a measure. However, that is not the case. The Government's position on the Bill was enunciated in the Seanad and it agrees in principle with the rationale behind a register of lobbyists. The Labour Party's Bill was not accepted because it was extremely badly drafted. It was simply a copy of a Canadian Bill. This was the level of work put into it by the Labour Party. The Government will introduce its proposals in that regard in the future.</P>
      <P>I am delighted to have this opportunity to set before the House the achievements of this Government in my area of responsibility in the two years since we came into office. In our action programme, we promised to build an inclusive society and we are doing so. We promised to bring the old age contributory pension to £100 by 2002 and, as previous speakers mentioned, we are already well on course to achieve that. In addition, in this the UN Year of Older People, my colleagues, the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, and the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, have taken 15,000 older people out of the tax net and are doubling the medical card eligibility limits for people over 70. This will make a real difference to people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It shows that we are working as a team across Departments to achieve our objectives unlike the Deputies opposite when they were in government, who spent more time leaking to the newspapers than implementing policies. We have also worked as a team to support carers. I introduced measures in the Social Welfare Act which will improve payments for all people on carer's allowance and will bring in over 3,000 more new people. The money available for the carer's allowance was increased by 40 per cent in one year. My colleagues, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, and the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, are introducing measures <Col N="1107" /> to make extra respite care available, to support carers' groups and to improve the disabled housing grant so that more people can stay in the community where they belong.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste and I have worked together to make sure that people have a real opportunity to take the jobs which are now available. The live register has fallen by 60,000 since we took office, which is an unprecedented fall. It was one of the promises we made before we came into office. The employment action plan has been very successful in helping our young people into work, training and education. Six out of every ten people referred to FÁS under the employment action plan since last September have left the live register. Youth unemployment is falling at record speed and we are extending the employment action plan to people over 25. I welcome the largest ever seasonally adjusted decrease in the live register of over 4,000 in one month.</P>
    <P>We are conscious of the need to support people who have been unemployed for a long time and who will need help to get a job, even in today's climate. I will shortly introduce a special back-to-work scheme for very long-term unemployed people to support them in making the transition back to work. We set up a Cabinet committee on social inclusion, chaired by the Taoiseach, and this has been a great success in co-ordinating social inclusion policies across Departments. As Deputies will be aware, I recently announced that the main poverty targets established in 1997 have been already largely met in the two years since we took office. The Government has set even more ambitious social inclusion targets. In particular, we will cut consistent poverty in half over the next five years.</P>
    <P>We have adopted a &ldquo;families first&rdquo; approach, quadrupling support for the family mediation service which has increased from two to eight centres since we took office. We massively increased funding for family counselling by approximately 300 per cent and set up a range of family and community centres. We have achieved much in the last two years, but we are not complacent. We know there is much to be achieved in the coming three years. Caring for children is a particular priority area. The arguments about child care have been well rehearsed. We do not need to be convinced of the need for action; we want to make sure that we put in place an equitable and effective solution which meets the needs of all parents in our society and we intend to do this.</P>
    <P>Securing the future of our older people is another priority. I will introduce legislation early in the new year to establish a new personal savings retirement account and the Government is very aware of the need to plan for the future of this and the coming generations. I categorically deny Deputy Quinn's assertion that the Government is not planning for the ageing population. Those who are interested in this matter should wait and see.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1108" /> Since coming into office we have carefully planned across Departments. We promised to cut taxes, dole queues and crime, and we have achieved all three. We have given back over £1 billion in personal taxes, we have cut the dole queues by 60,000 in two years, and crime is down by at least 20 per cent. Those are independent figures. We are moving to the next phase in our programme of building an inclusive society. We are setting national investment priorities to address social as well as economic needs. As we move into the new millennium, we are building a country we can be proud of, which we can rightly call a republic. I am proud to be part of this Government, which has delivered a huge amount of the commitments we made in our programme for Government within only two years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>The major development in adult education in the last year was the publication of the Green Paper, which sets out the role of adult education in promoting competitiveness in employment, addressing poverty and disadvantage, supporting community advancement and participation in society, and meeting the challenges of change. It sets out the case for concerted investment in adult education as a key component in lifelong learning and makes a range of recommendations on how the sector can be developed.</P>
      <P>We have already begun the process of implementing some of those recommendations even as we prepare for the publication of a White Paper. An extensive consultation process has been initiated by education and community organisations, national bodies and vocational education committees. This has been supplemented by six regional seminars, hosted by my Department. Written submissions have been invited and a series of national consultative meetings with major stakeholders is scheduled to take place in the coming weeks. The consultation process will culminate in a plenary forum to be held in Dublin Castle in September, to be followed by publication of a White Paper on Adult Education before the end of the year, it is hoped.</P>
      <P>In the interim a number of important developments have taken place. We have ensured, for the first time in education, the introduction of a State-funded child care service for participants in VTOS, Youthreach and traveller programmes, in order to remove barriers to access. We have removed the 10 per cent quota limiting participation in VTOS of lone parents, people with disabilities and dependent spouses. We have equalised the rate of training allowances with the back-to-education allowance scheme. In co-operation with FÁS, the local employment services and a consortium of major IT companies, we have secured VTOS participation in an exciting, industry-led, fast-track IT-FIT initiative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have established a working group to make recommendations on the implementation of part-time options on VTOS, Youthreach and PLC <Col N="1109" /> programmes. A sum of £500,000 has been provided this year to support 900 places across the three programmes on a pilot basis. This initiative will play an important role in encouraging more flexible delivery in reaching a wider client group who are not in a position to gain access to full-time programmes, and enabling literacy and basic education to be better integrated under VTOS. We have introduced provisions for guidance and introduced expanded national certification for people to qualify as trainers of adult tutors.</P>
    <P>When we came to office two years ago, the amount being spent per annum by the previous Government on basic literacy was £815,000. It is now just short of £6 million. Deputy John Bruton lectured and castigated the Government for its alleged lack of courage in taking small decisions which would mean a lot to many people. All Deputy Bruton provided for basic literacy was the grand total of £815,000, even though he had in his possession for six months, but did not publish, an OECD report which revealed that 25 per cent of the adult population had literacy problems. To increase the provision to the level which we have provided was a small decision in the context of a multi-billion pound budget. Why did he not take that decision?</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton presided over a system in which only one in 20 of our school buses carrying children with special needs, physically and mentally disabled, was equipped with a harness, an essential safety measure. The amount allocated by the previous Government for this area in every year since 1993 was £150,000. We have solved this problem by providing £3.4 million. This was another small decision. Why did Deputy Bruton not take it?</P>

We listened to many speak with pride of their achievements. What had most impact on me were the three protest marches by people with disabilities, from Parnell Street to the gates of this House, looking for essentials like wheelchairs and access to transport, and the two all-night vigils, again by people in wheelchairs, one outside Heuston Station, to lobby for wheelchair accessible transport to be provided among the 150 new buses, and the other this week, when people in wheelchairs froze in the cold outside Leinster House, seeking the resumption of the Vantastic transport scheme.</P>

    <P>We should hang our heads in shame. I agree with the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, that we are not a proper nation if we do not provide accessible transport for people with disabilities. No one in the House could have seen those protest marches, passed Heuston Station on that cold December night or come into the House this week without a feeling of shame at the most vulnerable in our society having to make these protests. To quote our President, we have failed our <Col N="1110" /> people with disabilities and in the process have seriously damaged our society.</P>

      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Joe Higgins. As we go into recess the most important issue is Mr. Justice Moriarty's statement that he was precluded from investigating the sale of Glen Ding because he held shares in CRH, and that the Attorney General had informed the party leaders of this matter. The Green Party was not so informed and I thank Deputy John Bruton for correcting the Dáil record. We put forward an amendment &ndash; which was defeated by 76 votes to 66 &ndash; to the tribunal's terms of reference to have Glen Ding fully investigated. The sequence of events after this is important. The Attorney General then approached Mr. Justice Moriarty, who stated he was precluded from investigating Glen Ding because he held these shares. The Attorney General said that we would get back to him but he would first contact the party leaders. He did so and the party leaders, for their own reasons, said this was all right.</P>
      <P>This is an extremely important matter. To quote from the Committee of Public Accounts report:</P>
      <P>Following its examination the Committee was not satisfied on a number of matters; specifically, while noting and appreciating the reasons advanced by the Department for not opening the sale to public tender, it did not accept the Department's explanation as credible.</P>
      <P>We need a tribunal to investigate Glen Ding. When this was debated in the House, I said we wanted to know why sand and gravel deposits, estimated to be worth a minimum of £48 million, were sold for £1.25 million.</P>

        <b>:</b> I protest at the Socialist Party and Green Party being routinely and outrageously squeezed out of these debates. The Dáil must meet next week to consider the crisis into which the Moriarty tribunal has been thrown. The incredible position is that the Government consistently misled the Dáil, leaving Deputies in a fool's paradise thinking that Glen Ding could be investigated, when it knew the tribunal chairman had ruled himself out. These are the standards of a tinpot dictatorship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government called for an investigation into the golden circle in Irish politics and business, which was feathering its nest at taxpayers' expense. The Government appointed a chairman who was the owner of a golden egg firmly established in the same nest, and it did not tell us. The leadership of Fine Gael and the Labour Party connived with the Government to keep the truth from the Members of the Dáil and prevented us being aware of the situation. That is an incredible position. The Ceann Comhairle has a responsibility to rectify the wrong that has been done to <Col N="1111" /> Members of the Dáil. The Government must make a statement&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government's first priority has been to secure peace in Northern Ireland and to implement fully the Good Friday Agreement. I would like first to recount briefly how we have arrived at the current situation.</P>
      <P>I thank the Opposition parties for the way the matter was put forward this morning about the North. The Taoiseach has asked me to convey to the House his apologies. Until about an hour and a half ago he hoped he would have made it back here, but he has not been able to do that. Perhaps that offers a little hope to all of us.</P>
      <P>The past two years have seen great progress as well as effort by the two Governments and all the parties concerned. Within a little over three weeks of our return to office, the IRA ceasefire was restored and has been firmly in place. Inclusive negotiations led to the Good Friday Agreement, subsequently endorsed by the people of Ireland, North and South. Substantial progress has been made in implementing large sections of the Agreement. Broadly, in the areas that fall within the responsibility of the two Governments, the Agreement is being substantially implemented. The policing and human rights commissions have been established. Prisoners have been released and the equality agenda is being pursued.</P>
      <P>The establishment of all the institutions depends on the formation of an executive. This has been seriously delayed for reasons that are well known. Sinn Féin, in particular, has made the counter argument that there are no preconditions in the Agreement.</P>
      <P>Over the past year, the Irish Government, working with the British Government, has made strenuous and continual efforts to clear the obstacles in the way of the implementation of the Agreement. Last December an agreement was reached, for example, on North-South bodies. The Governments undertook initiatives at Hillsborough and Downing Street to try to resolve the issue of what should come first &ndash; the executive or the start of the decommissioning process &ndash; or whether they could in some way be made to happen together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given the increasingly circular and repetitive nature of the arguments, the British Prime Minister, with my support, decided it was necessary to make one final effort to secure implementation of the Agreement before demoralisation, discouragement and dissident violence gained a grip. We <Col N="1112" /> are approaching the height of the marching season, where tension rises and there are maximum opportunities for sectarian violence and for the opponents of the Agreement to destabilise the peace process. Accordingly, an absolute deadline for reaching agreement was set for 30 June, accepting, as is normal in such negotiations, that discussions might run on, as happened on Good Friday, by a day or two.</P>
    <P>A preliminary round of negotiations took place last Friday. From that emerged agreement by the parties on three key principles: first, an inclusive executive exercising devolved powers; second, decommissioning of all paramilitary arms by May 2000; and, third, decommissioning to be carried out in a manner determined by the Independent Commission on Decommissioning. In this week's intensive negotiations, the difficulty has centred around the order and sequence in which these commitments need to be implemented.</P>
    <P>As President Clinton pointed out at his press conference with President Mubarak of Egypt yesterday, it is difficult to think of any agreement where everyone is agreed on the key principles, and that agreement breaking down over timing and sequencing. He correctly said that such an event would be a tragedy. As far as the Governments are concerned, the precise order or sequencing is not of major intrinsic importance once it is clear that all principles will be implemented and the institutions established within the terms of the Agreement.</P>
    <P>In the minds of some, there has been doubt as to the political will of others to establish inclusive partnership institutions. In the minds of others, there has been doubt as to whether there is any real will or commitment to decommissioning. The will of the people is that both should happen.</P>
    <P>There was one development of great importance earlier this week, the indication by Sinn Féin that &ldquo;all participants could succeed in persuading those with arms to decommission them in accordance with the Agreement&rdquo;. All the discussions are premised on the basis that, in the context of the establishment of an executive, the process of decommissioning can be completed by May.</P>
    <P>The importance of this development cannot be overestimated. The British Prime Minister has described it as a &ldquo;seismic shift&rdquo;. It represents a sea change in the whole debate and holds out the prospect of permanent peace, reconciliation and removing the gun from Irish politics for good. Actual movement, however, critically depends on the full Agreement and its institutions being put into operation.</P>
    <P>As I speak, very difficult discussions are continuing between the two Governments and the parties. It is not possible to predict the outcome, but the House can be assured that whatever the outcome, the Government will continue to do all in its power to bring the full Agreement into force as soon as possible. It represents the only plan and is balanced and comprehensive. It would not be sensible to divert energies into other channels or into working out other alternatives. It is <Col N="1113" /> the Government's judgment that the potential for advancing the Agreement is the only way forward.</P>
    <P>Like my colleagues in Government, and I am sure all Members of the House, I wish the Taoiseach and his team and all the other participants every success today in overcoming the remaining obstacles. We look forward to being able to work at an early date with an inclusive executive in the North-South body.</P>
    <P>I would like to repeat what I said this morning on behalf of the Taoiseach and the Government. This House will be recalled to progress any legislation that may be necessary to assist the successful completion of the peace process.</P>
    <P>I wish you, a Cheann Comhairle, your staff, all Members of this House, all members of the media <Col N="1114" /> and all who work in the two Houses a safe and happy holiday period. I know the Chief Whip would wish me to say that the committees will be working during July and September. Much important legislation is before those committees for debate and ratification.</P>
