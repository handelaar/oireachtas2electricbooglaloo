      <P>It is proposed to take No. 9, motion re. Council of Europe Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities and No. 1, Local Elections (Disclosure of Donations and Expenditure) Bill, 1999 [Seanad]: Second Stage. It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that the proceedings on No. 9, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion after 60 minutes and the following arrangements shall apply: the speech of a Minister or Minister of State and the main spokespersons for the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party shall not exceed 15 minutes in each case; the speech of each other Member called upon shall not exceed five minutes; and Members may share time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>A resolution or legislation is required. The Minister is considering that matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Why did the Minister not say that in the House when he announced these pension gifts, worth up to £1 million in the case of Mr. Justice Kelly, and, before this gift was promised, was an assurance obtained from Mr. Justice Kelly that he would provide answers to the House as to why he took the course he did in this case, who spoke to him about it and why?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Mr. J. Bruton: Unless assurances of full co-operation were given, then the gift should not have been made by the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It will require a resolution or <Col N="1022" /> legislation. I understand this matter is up to the House. No gift can be made until a resolution or legislation is passed here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In negotiating this gift to former Judge Kelly did the Minister ask the judge as a condition of this gift, to agree to give answers and to explain to the House why he interefered in this case in the way he did? If the Minister did not ask for that assurance, surely he was in dereliction of his duty? We do not have the answers and we are entitled to them. Before State money was promised to any individual the co-operation of that individual with the agencies of the State, in giving answers that have not yet been given, should have been obtained.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>None of these matters holds until the legislation is passed. What the Minister put the other day in this case was his proposal. In the course of his speech he said &ldquo;I commend these matters to the House&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach answer the question? Did the Minister get an undertaking from former Judge Kelly that he would give answers to the questions that are not answered as a condition for the House being asked to pass this legislation? Unless these assurances of co-operation were obtained I can assure him the Fine Gael Party will oppose this legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It all relates to legislation promised. It has now been revealed on foot of a question asked by the leader of the Fine Gael Party that legislation is required to give effect to a commitment that was clearly made to former Mr. Justice Cyril Kelly in return for his voluntary resignation. When will that legislation to validate the deal done between the Minister for Justice, Equality <Col N="1023" /> and Law Reform and and former Mr. Justice Kelly come before the House?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is considering whether it will be by resolution or legislation. One way or the other it will come before the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>We were told that the terms of Mr. Justice Kelly's voluntary resignation were being negotiated.</P>
      <P>I presume conditions were laid out in any such negotiations. Will they be revealed in the form of either a resolution or legislation that will be brought before the House?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will make a statement on it whenever it comes before the House. The suggestion this morning that there were negotiations about a deal is entirely wrong. It was not a question of doing a deal.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Mr. Justice Kelly asked. It was made known that a lower figure was being talked about. The Minister then put his proposal to the House which must be ratified in due course before it can be paid.</P>

      <P>If we did not get an assurance that that person, who will get something worth £1.5 million, will co-operate in telling us all the things we do not know, then the Minister who gave him that undertaking was not doing his job and is not fit for his job.</P>

      <P>The decisions taken over the weekend avoided a longer and comprehensive debate on impeachment which would have been required in this House. If no such undertakings were made by Mr. Justice Kelly about answering questions, will the Taoiseach give an undertaking that he will introduce legislation to amend the Committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Compellability, Privileges and Immunities of Witnesses) Act, 1997, to enable the House to require a former judge to come before an appropriate committee of the House to answer questions which may arise?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>We did not anticipate what would happen. I recommend we do not open that lid. We want to find out what happened so that the unanswered questions posed by every citizen about this mysterious affair can be answered. The person who can tell us what happened is former Mr. Justice Kelly. Under existing law, he is exempt from being compelled to come before a committee of this House. Will the Government, with its current majority, give an undertaking to amend this legislation so that a former judge can be compelled to come before a committee of this House, if it is not prepared to reveal the terms of this negotiated present? We have drafted a Bill which I can give to the Taoiseach.</P>

      <P>When will the Health (Amendment) Bill be introduced and will it include procedures for updating the vetting of doctors coming here from abroad? I am particularly concerned about the fact that a doctor is working in Bantry who was banned from practising in Canada because of improper sexual relations with a woman patient. Can the Taoiseach confirm that procedures will be tightened to ensure that such a situation does not arise again and that notifications to the Medical Council will be sent to the Department of Health and Children or to the health board which employs such doctors?</P>

      <P>I understand the Minister for Health and Children has requested a report from the Southern Health Board concerning the employment of a consultant psychiatrist at Bantry General Hospital while being suspended from practising medicine by the British Colombian College of Physicians and Surgeons in Canada for two years with effect from April 1996. The consultant psychiatrist concerned has been employed in Bantry General Hospital since August 1996. The Minister is awaiting that report.</P>

Intensive discussions are continuing with the UK authorities on this matter to try to finalise the text to set up a commission for the location of the remains of victims.

        <b>: </b>Four weeks ago the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform indicated he was going to amend the Intoxicating Liquor Act to extend pub opening hours to 12.30 a.m. all year around, with a half hour drinking up time, and to end Sunday afternoon closing.

    <Title>Council of Europe Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Éamon Ó Cuív)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the terms of the Council of Europe Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities, signed by Ireland on 1st February, 1995, a copy of which was laid before Dáil Éireann on 23rd March, 1999.</P>
      <P>The Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities is part of the Government's commitments under the Good Friday Agreement and our effort to advance the cause of peace on this island through the provision of a comprehensive framework of human rights protection. It is another step towards peace and accommodation between all the people of this island.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The framework convention originated with the Council of Europe's Summit of Heads of State and Government in Vienna in 1993, where it was resolved that a framework convention should be drawn up to specify principles for the protection of national minorities. The draft framework convention was opened for signature on 1 February 1995 and Ireland was among 21 Council of Europe member states who signed the instrument <Col N="1033" /> on that occasion. On ratifying the document, Ireland will be the 24th member state to do so.</P>
    <P>This framework convention sets out a comprehensive set of principles regarding the protection of national minorities, elaborating the obligations which states undertake in ratifying the convention. States which accede to the convention are obliged to ensure equality before the law and equal protection for all their peoples. Religious tolerance, the right to assembly and the right to the use of minority languages are all specific commitments within this document.</P>
    <P>In addition to making these commitments on paper, states which accede to this framework convention are subject to monitoring by the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe. Within 12 months of ratification, Ireland will submit a report to the Secretary General of the Council of Europe regarding the situation in this jurisdiction. We would expect to furnish our initial report by May 2000, with further periodic reports submitted every five years thereafter. These reports will be subject to scrutiny by an advisory committee of the council, consisting of between 12 and 18 independent experts, who will make recommendations to the Committee of Ministers as to the effectiveness of our efforts to implement the convention. This committee will be free to draw its information from a wide range of sources and it has already been indicated that information provided by non-governmental organisations could play an important role in its work. We look forward to working with the committee to ensure that Ireland meets the highest possible standard of human rights in this regard.</P>
    <P>The framework convention does not define a &ldquo;national minority&rdquo;. This was a deliberate decision. By not providing a definition, the drafters of the framework convention recognised that each situation and state is unique, but that we share a common underlying goal, the protection and promotion by states of the legitimate rights and interests of their national minorities.</P>
    <P>Given that all the situations and states are unique, it is not necessarily appropriate that an individual state should have the responsibility for identifying or labelling any particular national minority as being such, rather, the question of national minorities must be considered in the context of clearly applied external criteria. These must take into account not only the opinion of states but, in particular, the views of such communities and the right of individuals to choose whether to be treated as members of a national minority.</P>
    <P>In part for this reason, the Government has decided not to make a declaration as to which, if any, groups are considered national minorities. Legally, it is considered that no national minorities within the context of the framework convention exist in Ireland. That is not to say that Ireland does not have minority ethnic or similar groups, or that such groups or communities may not emerge in the future. In any event, the Government considers that existing legislative <Col N="1034" /> measures meet the requirements for the implementation of the framework convention.</P>
    <P>In the larger European context, this framework convention points the way towards an accommodation between the various peoples of Europe. It is the first legally binding multilateral instrument concerned with the protection of national minorities in general. Its aim is to protect the existence of national minorities by creating conditions which will enable them to preserve and develop their culture and to retain their identity. Oppression of language, culture and of religion has proved time and again to be a cancer which destroys societies and causes conflict. Events unfolding in the Balkans underline just how important an issue this has become. Two world wars and many savage conflicts during this century have made evident the ways in which ethnic conflicts deeply affect international politics. Third party countries become involved in such conflicts, particularly when their co-religionists of other groups with which they identify are involved. Conflicts spill across frontiers and refugee flows affect other countries in serious ways.</P>
    <P>As we have witnessed all too often in recent years, many of the causes of inter-ethnic conflict have their roots in policies and practices directed by a particular ethnic majority against a minority. The protection and promotion of minority rights is, therefore, a key component in ensuring that ethnic tensions do not result in violence as well as an essential key to finding long-term solutions in situations where conflict has already occurred. Safeguarding the rights of national minorities has, therefore, long been seen by the international community as being of vital importance to stability, democratic security and peace in the world.</P>
    <P>The Council of Europe Framework Convention on National Minorities is part of a developing body of international legal instruments concerned with these matters. They include the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the European Convention for Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Copenhagen Document of the OSCE. Ireland plays an active role internationally in ensuring that these standards are applied and, in ratifying the framework convention, we are taking a further step in underpinning the rights of groups and individuals. The Government is actively pursuing the ratification of all the core international human rights instruments and will shortly bring forward regulations which will enable us to move to ratify the UN Conventions on Torture and All Forms of Racial Discrimination.</P>
    <P>It is important that Ireland should choose the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the Council of Europe to ratify this important instrument given that we have been intimately involved with the organisation since its foundation. On 5 May 1949 Ireland was among a group of ten states which put their names to the Treaty of London to establish the Council of Europe. The organisation has changed greatly in the intervening per<Col N="1035" /> iod. It now encompasses 41 member states and the importance of its work in human rights and democratisation has taken on renewed importance since the collapse of communism in Europe.</P>
    <P>The Council of Europe has taken in the former Eastern Europe, including the Russian Federation, and has developed a new model of partnership and co-operation in the greater European region. Now, half a century on from its foundation and during this anniversary, it is fitting that Ireland further demonstrates its belief in the Council of Europe and its standard setting work in human rights through the ratification of this important convention. In doing so we can add another piece to the jigsaw of reconciliation on our island while, at the same time, making an international declaration of our desire for accommodation and mutual respect between the different cultures and nationalities which share our Continent. It is also appropriate in this anniversary year that Ireland will take up the reins of leadership in the Council of Europe by assuming the chairmanship of the Committee of Ministers of the Council. From November 1999 until May 2000, it will be the responsibility of this State to direct the progress of the organisation's work.</P>
    <P>Through agreements such as this convention, Ireland, in common with other member states of the Council of Europe, is engaged in an attempt to build an agreed framework for the future. The upheavals of European history have shown that the protection of national minorities is essential to stability, democratic security and peace in this Continent. A pluralist and genuinely democratic society should not only respect the ethnic, cultural, linguistic and religious identity of each person belonging to a national minority, but also create the appropriate conditions to enable them to express, preserve and develop this identity. Through the creation of a climate of tolerance and dialogue, cultural diversity can be a source and factor not of division but of enrichment for each society. There are few guarantees in this world but at the very least agreements such as this convention can make a valuable contribution to ensuring a minimum level of human rights and of human dignity for all the peoples of Europe. At a time when the need for such measures could not be more apparent, this convention commends itself to the House. Leis sin ba mhaith liom a mholadh go nglacfar leis an rún seo. Creidim gur rud an-tábhachtach é.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the ratification of this convention. It is timely that an instrument of this nature should come before the House at present. It serves to focus our attention on the need to recognise the position of minorities and to recognise that they are not entitled to rights as determined by majorities but entitled to rights as determined by all of the people. The same rights should apply to minorities and majorities. That is not to say that one or the other should be disad<Col N="1036" /> vantaged. It would be useful to ponder the effect of such thinking in the past in this country.</P>
      <P>Perhaps legislation on incitement to hatred should go hand in hand with a procedure such as this because, nationally or internationally, incitement to hatred can be the first step towards discrimination against a minority. That has happened throughout the world. There is no reference to the other side of the coin &ndash; the promotion of intolerance by those with a specific interest. The two are closely related. If one looks at the Balkans, and it is useful that we should have this item before us, the protection of minorities and their interests is foremost in the minds of everyone looking at the news over the past weeks. We should ask what we have done and what we can do other than wring our hands. Usually the intolerance which has manifested itself in the hostilities in the Balkans does not start overnight, it festers for a long time.</P>
      <P>I wonder if this procedure will address this issue in a dramatic way. It will focus people's attention when reports emanate from the relevant member state but will the minorities have the opportunity to make a realistic and worthwhile submission into the contents of such reports? Will the report be conducted by the Council of Europe or an independent group of inquirers who can then produce a report which will clearly address the issue and examine the plight of the minority from its point of view? There are plenty of minorities in this State. Our attitude to refugees could be examined, our ability to recognise that other human beings have rights which are equal to our own.</P>
      <P>One must ask if this gesture, and it is a positive gesture, from the Council of Europe will have any impact on the hostilities in the Balkans. For years we watched minorities being treated in a deplorable fashion. I heard President Milosevic suggest this morning that the recent bombing was the only thing which caused the flight of the refugees. That is not true. The minorities were being treated in a deplorable fashion for years. No great importance is attached to that by the authorities in Kosovo.</P>
      <P>Closer to home, it is appropriate that an issue of this nature should have emerged in respect of the Good Friday Agreement. That is useful. Unless, however, there is a degree of authenticity which will enable the reports to stand up to impartial scrutiny, bias in a report of this nature will completely undermine the worth of future reports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a good idea to examine the effect of propaganda. In Rwanda the outbreak of hostilities was generated by a personality in a radio station who poured out bitterness and hatred for months, ultimately culminating in the slaughter of thousands of innocent people. I hope this proposal on the protection of national minorities will have some impact outside the Parliaments, that it will proceed along the route of tackling the prejudice and incitement to hatred which in turn lead to a serious diminution in the rights of minorities. I <Col N="1037" /> hope that the Council of Europe will initiate procedures which will be useful in that area.</P>
    <P>Minorities everywhere have a right to be protected and they should not have to depend on the majority. Their rights should be encompassed in legislation and provided for in all events. That would be a positive step forward but I am concerned that if importance is not placed on legislation to ensure that incitement to hatred is not allowed to prevail, it will be more difficult to protect the interests of minorities. I am disappointed that the Minister of State did not make any reference to this important aspect. How often have we heard inflammatory statements made on our own island which resulted in loss of life because armchair generals gave their views in a way which militated against the rights of the individual, particularly where they concerned minorities?</P>
    <P>I welcome the measure as proposed. The Council of Europe is being progressive in recognising this issue. The Good Friday Agreement correctly identified the need for the ratification of the proposal. I hope it will be of some benefit, particularly to legislators in their efforts to ensure that the rights and interests of minorities are protected.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom ar dtús fáilte a chur roimh an Bille seo. Tá sé déanach ach ag an am céanna is ceart dúinn glacadh leis an mBille.</P>
      <P>This needs to be welcomed, particularly as we first signed the convention in 1995 and as this is the 50th anniversary of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights which is referred to in the framework convention. We are doing this, however, in an extremely minimalist way. Point 5 of the briefing document I received from the Department of Foreign Affairs, dated 23 March 1999, states:</P>
      <P>Prior to signature of the Framework Convention, the then Attorney General advised that he did not believe that any of the minorities which exist in Ireland could be regarded as a &ldquo;national minority&rdquo;. Therefore, it is not considered that any specific legislative or other measures need to be taken to implement the provisions of the Convention in Ireland.</P>
      <P>In other words, it is conceivable that somebody else could give a legal opinion that there is a national minority in Ireland, and we do not have the legislative framework to deal with it. We are putting a convention in place and we do not have any legislative framework to deal with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us assume, for instance, that the current numbers of refugees continue to come to Ireland and the Government decides it will be less restrictive in allowing them to remain here, or we introduce a migration policy which encourages large numbers of people of other nationalities to come here to live. We do not have the legislative framework to guarantee them the rights this convention is offering and which we are saying offers such rights to people. It is not clear from the conven<Col N="1038" /> tion whether refugees and asylum seekers are covered by the convention but it is clear that the way the Government is dealing with refugees and asylum seekers to Ireland is grossly inequitable and contrary to human dignity. It is not clear either whether travellers in Ireland, for instance, could be regarded as a national minority. Travellers claim a distinctive ethnicity but I do not know whether they can be defined as a national minority. I am not a lawyer. If this convention is to offer protection to minorities in Ireland, we need legislation to do so.</P>
    <P>The statistics in relation to travellers is appalling. The travelling community generally continues to face hostility and prejudice here. Travellers die younger. Only 1 per cent of travellers are over the age of 65. By contrast, 11 per cent of the total population is in this age group. At the last census there were 147 travellers over the age of 64, with 414,000 of the rest of the population over 65. Many traveller families still do not have access to toilets or running water. The infant mortality rate for travellers is close to three times the level for the population generally.</P>
    <P>I have a case on my books of a family living on the outskirts of Finglas which has been trying for two years to get a loan &ndash; not a grant &ndash; from Fingal County Council to buy a new caravan because of the dreadful state of the caravan in which they live. I had to use the Freedom of Information Act to get information from the council as to the basis on which they refused the loan. Eventually I received the information that the refusal was based on a report from a caravan company which the council had sent to assess the state of the caravan. The report stated that the caravan was uninhabitable yet the loan was refused.</P>
    <P>It is not sufficient for us to pretend that we are dealing with human rights and giving people their dignity when there is this institutional form of discrimination against a section of our society. They are our people whether we like it or not. They are part of who we are. We need to be honest with ourselves when we ratify conventions of this kind. We need to take them seriously.</P>
    <P>The UN Declaration of Human Rights contains an extraordinarily simple and straightforward definition of human rights. It states that they are those basic standards without which people cannot live in dignity. We cannot pretend we are a country which respects human rights while an identifiable section of our society has the highest mortality rates among infants, 65 year olds and older and no sanitary facilities. Education, which is provided through the goodness of many religious orders and some local authorities and health boards, is grossly inadequate. We need to get serious about this issue.</P>
    <P>I presume religious minorities in general do not come under the definition of national minorities, although it could be argued that they should. We have seen, from the foundation of the State, the dramatic decline of the Protestant minority. The Jewish minority in the State has declined almost <Col N="1039" /> to the point of extinction. In order to survive, go to school or get married they must go to Britain and they remain abroad. There have been major campaigns in Northern Ireland against anti-Catholic discrimination, yet the Catholic population continues to grow. Part of the reason the Protestant minority in Ireland declined was because of the State's implementation of the dogmas of the majority Church. That is less the case today but it had a major impact on the Protestant population.</P>
    <P>Petty instances of discrimination remain, even in this House. The House starts the business of the day with a prayer. I have no objection to that but the prayer is specifically Christian. In this convention we claim to be a pluralist society. The House represents that society, yet the prayer which begins the business of the House does not acknowledge that other members of this society belong to different religions. We do not recognise that in the simplest way possible &ndash; by changing the prayer which opens the business of the House. This may seem a minor matter but it reflects a mindset which needs to be addressed.</P>
    <P>The convention does not seem to address the question of refugees. I would like to put on the record in the House the comments of refugees who have come to Ireland looking for safety and security. These accounts highlight the problems refugees face in Irish society. I do not suggest that every Irish person is racist &ndash; the vast majority are not. However, there is a view that all refugees and asylum seekers are illegal and, perhaps, criminals. This impression is due to the fact that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform said that, in his view, 90 per cent of those who applied for asylum are not entitled to it, are illegal immigrants and, as a result, are in some way criminals.</P>
    <P>The statements I will quote are contained in a document commissioned by the Pilgrim Foundation &ndash; a Roman Catholic group which is concerned at the position of refugees and asylum seekers. This group carried out a survey of attitudes called <i>When I Was a Stranger &ndash; Racism and Exclusion in Ireland, A Christian Assessment of the Situation of Asylum Seekers and Refugees</i> published in 1999. The survey concluded that, while most people had never met a refugee or asylum seeker, they are of the view that they are not entitled to be here.</P>
    <P>A male Nigerian said:</P>
    <P>How can I have any real hope of being allowed to stay? I do not know anyone whose application has been accepted. It is all rejection. I am an accountant. It is very difficult not to be able to work, to feed my wife and child. It is demeaning to receive money for which you did not work. If we are allowed to work we will not need welfare and we can pay taxes. The days are long and painful. People can check my records in Nigeria, see that I have worked but I cannot go back there.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1040" /> A Somali male said:</P>
    <P>I am a man of no education but I'm strong. I have two kids, they need to be able to stand behind me and say, &ldquo;that is my father.&rdquo;  I need to be able to work for them to say this. I need education but when I say this to the authorities they say first you need status. With no status I can't work and to work I need education. You tell no one where you are going or that you are going &ndash; I paid a Yemeni to leave Mombasa, I didn't know where I was going, he just told me somewhere safe, a good country.</P>
    <P>A male Nigerian said:</P>
    <P>Three policemen took me from a phone box and began to shout at me, &ldquo;what are you doing in Ireland, who were you phoning.&rdquo;  They made me dial the number again to verify what I told them. Then they searched me, taking my wallet and going through it. They said that they had the right to do what they were doing. I felt helpless and could do nothing. I couldn't even complain.</P>
    <P>An African male said:</P>
    <P>My brother was beaten up and had his head cut with a broken bottle. He couldn't take anymore of the assault so when he recovered he returned to Africa.</P>
    <P>A Nigerian female said:</P>
    <P>We can't work, study, do anything. One day when making a phone call I left my baby in the buggy. A couple was passing by and began shouting, &ldquo;oh, look at the baby &ndash; who owns the baby monkey?&rdquo;  Years ago you (Irish) went to America when things were different here. You knew what it was like to be oppressed and to be in need. Now we come here to begin a new life and you stand back and fold your arms.</P>
    <P>A Congolese male said:</P>
    <P>I have been called a lot of names &ndash;&ldquo;you black, get back where you belong.&rdquo;  I was refused accommodation after being promised it on the phone. When I went to the house I was immediately told there was no room and the door was closed in my face.</P>
    <P>A couple from Cameroon said:</P>
    <P>We are in a really bad situation. We have professions but cannot study and cannot work and contribute to society.</P>
    <P>A male from Angola said:</P>
    <P>I thought Ireland was a good country to come to but now I know its not a good place, its very racist. I was on Fleet Street today and five people shouted, &ldquo;nigger, go back to where you're from.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>A Nigerian male said:</P>
    <P>I was beaten up on the street and that doesn't make any sense. I was calling and call<Col N="1041" /> ing the guard. The guards took the two guys who did it and let them go. They did nothing and I had to present myself so many times and they said that was because I didn't have status and I was here only two months.</P>
    <P>A Nigerian male said:</P>
    <P>They do not read the cases person by person, they decide only on the basis of what they think themselves.</P>
    <P>An Angolan woman said:</P>
    <P>We know about Ireland's past and now we see so many Irish racist and hostile.</P>
    <P>A Somali male said:</P>
    <P>I know I have a very good case but I have learnt that it means nothing &ndash; we are totally at the mercy of the people handling the cases.</P>
    <P>The report goes on in a similar manner. This is the hidden face of how we deal with refugees &ndash; we are denying them the right to work and the right to education. We are taking an inhuman approach to people who come here and see Ireland as a friendly place &ndash; Ireland of the welcomes. This country has suffered from oppression in the past and sent millions of its people to America and Britain who in turn suffered racism. The Government has a responsibility to lead and to make it clear that those who come here will be treated as decent human beings, not criminals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>As Chairman of the Irish parliamentary delegation to the Council of Europe I am glad to have this opportunity to speak on this important motion. I compliment the Minister of State on introducing the motion. I wish to underline its importance in dealing with the issues raised by Deputies and broader issues which concern the Council of Europe.</P>
      <P>This motion is timely as the 50th anniversary of the Council of Europe occurs on 5 May. I wish to make a few comments on the Irish delegation. Since we last discussed these issues the untimely death of Pat Upton took place. He was a distinguished member of the delegation. On behalf of the members of the delegation I express our profound sympathy to his widow and family. Pat Upton made a significant contribution to the deliberations of the Council of Europe and was very involved in its committees. He is not only sadly missed in this House but also by many of his colleagues in the Council. We have also had the benefit of the diligent work of Deputies Aylward, Browne, Enright and Gregory and Senators Rory Kiely and Connor. I understand Deputy De Rossa is to replace the late Deputy Upton.</P>
      <P>Invaluable work was done in the Council of Europe by the Irish parliamentary delegation. Although it receives very little publicity, its Members are very dedicated. The plenary session is due to take place next weekend and will involve a variety of committees dealing with many matters of importance to Ireland and to other member states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1042" /> It is important as we approach the presidency that we clearly identify our priorities for that period. We should also try to create a greater awareness of the Council's work which has generally been overshadowed by the work of the European Parliament and the European Commission. In an effort to create greater awareness of and familiarity with the Council and its work, it is proposed to bring four young people to the plenary session in Salzburg next week where they will take part in a youth assembly.</P>
    <P>Young people have a great interest in this area. The numbers of young people who have been involved in humanitarian efforts in Kosovo and other places clearly indicates they are deeply conscious of the difficulties being experienced by minority groups in Europe. Young Irish people want to see Ireland, as a member of the Council of Europe and other international organisations, playing an increasingly central role in the provision of assistance to refugees and in the provision of additional finances to deal with international crises.</P>
    <P>The culture and education committee of the Council of Europe adopted a resolution in 1998 to deal with problems in the Russian Federation in regard to the preservation of its people's languages and cultural identities at a time when the federation is undergoing an unprecedented economic crisis.</P>
    <P>A total of 23 million people throughout the world speak Uralic languages; some 3.4 million of them live in the Russian Federation in sub-Arctic conditions and on subsistence levels of survival. Many of their ethnic cultures are currently threatened. In the Russian Federation, teaching is carried out in up to 75 national languages. In some cases, language teaching is purely oral and there are no written texts. There is a certain urgency about the situation owing to the prevailing economic climate. There is an acute shortage of teachers and school materials and even though there has been provision for the preservation of culture through education, the necessary financial resources are not available.</P>
    <P>I have cited the example of the Russian Federation because the Minister of State referred to it in his speech. Italian minorities in Croatia are also being discriminated against; a treaty was drawn up between Italian and Croatian authorities to ensure the protection of Italian minorities in Croatia. These examples indicate the broad range of problems being experienced throughout the Council's area. Deputy De Rossa referred to some of the problems being experienced in Ireland but they fade in comparison to the enormous problems being faced in Europe today.</P>
    <P>Since the bombing commenced on 24 March, Europe faces the real prospect of another world war. Some people feel that is inevitable and its possible consequences would shake the entire international community. Every effort must be made to avoid that. The Council of Europe, through its political affairs committee, has worked diligently for the past two years in a sub<Col N="1043" /> committee chaired by Mr. Andras Barsony of Hungary, to find a resolution to the Kosovo problem. At the end of the day, agreement must be reached through the UN, NATO or a combination of both as Mr. Milosevic's conduct cannot be tolerated. If agreement is not reached, we face the prospect of an escalation throughout the entire Balkan region and into Germany, Italy, Greece and Turkey. That would represent a real human catastrophe.</P>
    <P>Motions such as the one tabled here today will help to create stability, underline and underpin democracy and provide security and above all a lasting peace in Europe. It represents a milestone in the protection of minorities and it is very fitting that it should be introduced on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of our membership of the Council of Europe.</P>
    <P>Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (</P>
    <P>Éamon Ó Cuív): I thank Deputies Durkan, De Rossa and Daly for their contributions on this important motion. A number of issues were raised. First, I would point out that we have incitement to hatred legislation in this country. Deputy De Rossa referred to national minorities and how they might be defined. He referred in particular to travellers. We all recognise that difficulties are experienced in relation to travellers in Ireland and we must deal with those. We have existing and pending legislation on this matter. Whether travellers wish to be treated as a national minority or as an integrated group with special characteristics is something they must answer. The Equal Status Bill is to be reintroduced in this House in the near future.</P>
    <P>As an Irish speaker, duine den dream a labhrann Gaeilge gach lá, an mionlach muid sa tír ná an cuid den phobal náisiúnta a labhrann Gaeilge muid? Déarfainn féin agus déarfadh an cuid is mó againn, go mór-mhór pobal na Gaeltachta gur chuid de ghnáth-phobal na hÉireann muid agus go bhfuil ár gceartanna mar Ghaeilgeoirí le cosaint.</P>
    <P>Mar sin tá sé i gceist agamsa Bille Teanga a thógaint isteach chun a chinntiú go mbeidh a gceartanna le fáil ag lucht labhartha na Gaeilge taobh istigh den tír.

    <P>There are many complex issues involved. In a sense we are talking about a framework through which we are opening up to examination from outside. One of the real benefits of the convention is that there will be a mechanism for people from outside to come here and examine whether we are treating the disparate part of society, particularly other national minorities, fairly.</P>

      <P>Under the convention people from outside can come to Ireland to monitor the situation. If they find we have national minorities which we have not declared they will be able to make recommendations. This is the mechanism established under the convention. In addition to outside monitoring, the framework provides for the making of reports. Therefore, there is an external audit mechanism. If it is found that we are not complying with the convention people from outside the jurisdiction will be able to give an opinion on the matter. I think this is of considerable merit, particularly in light of the issues raised by Deputy De Rossa.</P>
      <P>I thank those who contributed to the debate. Deputy Daly gave a very interesting exposition of the far greater problems in relation to minorities in other countries, and I thank him for his contribution.</P>

    <Title>Local Elections (Disclosure of Donations and Expenditure) Bill, 1999  [  Seanad ]  : Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo; The main purpose of the Bill is to provide for a statutory scheme for the disclosure of election expenditure by candidates, political parties and third parties at local elections. In addition, candidates will be required to disclose the sources of funds used to meet election expenses including the disclosure of any donation over £500 received by them in connection with the election. The Bill removes the disqualification for membership of a local authority of chairpersons of Oireachtas Committees and also makes provision for research into electronic methods of recording and counting votes using the ballot papers from the European and local elections to be held in June this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of commencing section 72 of the Electoral Act, 1997, under which the Minister may make regulations to provide for a scheme of disclosure of donations and election expenses <Col N="1045" /> comparable to that which operates at Dáil, European and presidential elections has been given detailed consideration. However, it has been decided that the arrangements envisaged under that section would not be appropriate for local elections for reasons which I wish to outline.</P>
    <P>Local elections differ from Dáil and other elections in a number of major respects, most notably in terms of scale. At the local elections in June of this year, there will probably be over 3,500 candidates. This compares to 484 in the 1997 general election and 52 in the 1994 European elections. Similarly in relation to constituencies, there are 268 local electoral areas compared to 42 Dáil and four European Parliament constituencies.</P>
    <P>There are also major population differences. The population of local electoral areas varies greatly, but the average is around 13,500 with some areas having a population of little more than 1,000. This compares with Dáil constituencies where population ranges from 62,000 to 115,000 and European Parliament constituencies which have populations ranging from 668,000 to over one million. Finally, due to the smaller size of constituencies and the local nature of the elections, extensive expenditure would not be necessary and expenditure by each candidate would be lower than at a Dáil election.</P>
    <P>If section 72 was commenced and regulations made under it, the size and complexity of the administrative undertaking would become even clearer. For example, each candidate would have to appoint an election agent; about 3,500 election agents would have to make election expenditure statements to the Public Offices Commission within 56 days of the election in respect of elected members and unsuccessful candidates; expenditure limits would have to be set either for all candidates for election to each local authority or different limits would have to be set for candidates for different classes of local authorities. If different limits of expenditure were set for candidates in different areas, the question of equality of treatment would arise; 1,627 elected members would have to make donation statements to the Public Offices Commission by 31 January 2000 and every year thereafter; and about 1,900 unsuccessful candidates would have to submit donation statements to the Public Offices Commission within 56 days of the election.</P>
    <P>Not surprisingly, given what I have outlined, the Public Offices Commission would need extra staff and resources to carry out the extra work involved at a cost of about £300,000. Another major feature of a section 72 scheme would be its central focus &ndash; all documentation would have to be brought to Dublin rather than remaining in the relevant locality. I think it is clear, therefore, that a scheme under section 72 would not be appropriate for local elections and the Bill provides for an alternative which can meet the objectives of the Electoral Act, 1997, through a less bureaucratic and local arrangement.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that each candidate will submit an income and expenditure statement to the <Col N="1046" /> local authority for which he or she is a candidate for election. Details of any donation over £500 received to fund election expenditure will also have to be disclosed. Political parties, likewise, will submit a statement of total expenditure by their headquarters in local elections to a specified local authority in the Dublin area. Expenditure by a political party at local electoral area level will have to be disclosed by a designated person of the political party to the local authority concerned. Thus, there will be two levels of disclosure for political parties and one for candidates.</P>
    <P>I would like to point out that political parties are already obliged to disclose donations over the specified limit received during a local election in their annual donation statements. For this purpose, parties are deemed to include any branch of the party, candidate of the party at a local election, member of the party who is a Member of the Houses of the Oireachtas or member of a local authority or representative in the European Parliament or any officer, member, or agent of the party or of a branch or subsidiary organisation. Members of the Oireachtas who stand as candidates at the local elections will have to furnish statements to a local authority. There may be some duplication in this situation but it should not be too onerous on any individual. If a Member of the Oireachtas who is a candidate at the local elections was excluded from submitting an expenditure statement to a local authority, there would not be a complete picture of expenditure at the election and this could give rise to concern that some candidates were not being treated the same as others.</P>
    <P>An important feature of the scheme proposed in the Bill is its local focus. All documentation will be kept locally for inspection by local people. It would run counter to the major programme of local government reform which is under way if the documentation, for example, was stored centrally in Dublin. Why should the public in Bantry or Buncrana have to travel to Dublin to inspect the relevant records?</P>
    <P>Before I outline some of the main elements of the Bill, I would like to briefly mention existing provisions and some current developments in relation to conflict of interest and ethics at local authority level. I am very conscious of the need for a new ethical framework for local authorities which is both robust and workable and which takes account of the recent legislative changes within this area. As members are aware, ethical provisions have been in operation in the local government planning service since the enactment of the Planning Act, 1976. That Act applies to both members and officials of local authorities in so far as any planning, land acquisition and disposal functions or any dealings or interests in land are concerned. The provisions involve registration of interests, a public register of interests, declarations at meetings along with penalties for non-compliance, etc. However, it is now time to widen and strengthen its scope.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1047" /> The major local government Bill in preparation in my Department provides an ideal opportunity for a review and preparation of an ethical framework for the local government service. This review will include the widening of ethical provisions to all local government activities and not just the planning area. It will take account of the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995, and the work of the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service on the draft standards in public office proposals. It will also take account of similar legislation in other jurisdictions. Additional areas to be considered include provision of a code of conduct, the widening of existing disclosures and annual declaration provisions. For these reasons, it is not proposed that elected members of local authorities should furnish annual donation statements under the terms of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The local government Bill will also provide for the elimination of the dual local authority/Oireachtas mandate from a future date. In the interim, pending the coming into effect of this general disqualification, it is proposed to remove the current disqualification applying to the chairs of Oireachtas committees and joint committees for the local elections in June 1999. Such persons will then be free to stand for election.</P>
    <P>Regarding the main sections of the Bill, section 6 contains the definition of election expenses and is based on section 31 of the Electoral Act, 1997, which applies to Dáil and European Parliament elections. Election expenses are defined as any expenditure incurred in connection with a local election to promote or oppose, directly or indirectly, the interests of a political party or the election of any candidate or to present or oppose the policies of a party or candidate. The section provides that certain expenditure will be deemed not to constitute election expenses. These exceptions are the same as those which apply at Dáil and European elections and details of them can be found in the Bill and in the explanatory and financial memorandum.</P>
    <P>An expenditure limit for candidates at the local elections is not being proposed. Such a limit would make the scheme very bureaucratic for candidates and political parties and would add to its cost. Because of the smaller scale of individual local election areas compared to other elections, expenditure should not be as extensive. The general principle of disclosure contained in the 1997 Act is maintained and all candidates will also have to disclose the sources of funding used to meet election expenditure. It is intended to analyse expenditure at the elections and this data will be useful to see if an expenditure limit is necessary in future, especially if different limits should be set for candidates and political parties contesting elections in differently sized authorities. Most EU countries do not have election expenditure limits for local elections.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1048" /> The most frequently asked question is the period in which election expenses incurred have to be declared. Section 6(3) states that the period commences on the date of the polling day order and ends on polling day. This is generally four weeks before polling day which will be 11 June next. However, election expenses incurred before the date of the polling day order for use during the election period must be included in the election expenses statement. This section also provides that third parties who have no connection with political parties or candidates and who intend incurring election expenses either at a national level or at local electoral level will have to register with a local authority and make an election expenses statement after the election.</P>
    <P>Section 7 requires a political party, other than a political party registered to contest elections in part of the State, which proposes to present candidates at a local election to appoint a national agent. He or she will only be responsible for national expenditure because it would not be possible for such a person to keep track of local expenditure without an army of staff in party headquarters. Section 8 provides that each political party will be obliged to appoint a designated person who will be responsible for furnishing a statement of election expenses incurred by a political party at local electoral area level.</P>
    <P>Section 13 provides for the furnishing of the statements in prescribed forms by national agents, designated persons, candidates and third parties within 90 days of polling day. There is also provision that, where a candidate or third party dies before the submission of a statement, it will not be necessary for the personal representatives of that person to submit a statement.</P>
    <P>An essential element of the scheme in the Bill is openness, and section 14 provides that election expenses statements received from designated persons, candidates and third parties for expenditure at local level must be given to the elected members of the local authority concerned. The statements by political parties and third parties for expenditure at national level will be available for inspection at a local authority in the Dublin area, and I acknowledge the co-operation of Dublin Corporation in this regard which has agreed to act as the specified local authority. Section 18 obliges a local authority to register and acknowledge every statement it receives. Section 19 requires an authority to publish a notice in a newspaper circulating in its functional area stating the time and place the statements can be inspected. The notice will also include the names of those who have not furnished statements.</P>
    <P>Section 18 also provides that a local authority will issue guidelines to candidates and political parties on matters covered in the Bill. This should assist candidates and others in understanding the Bill's requirements. I would like to see the guidelines issuing to candidates and others as early as possible and my Department will issue draft guidelines to local authorities as soon as the Bill is enacted.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1049" /> Disqualification, offences and penalties under the Bill are contained in sections 20 and 21. The penalties for non-compliance or furnishing false or misleading statements by a national agent, designated person or third party are the same as those which apply at Dáil or European elections. A different regime is proposed for unsuccessful and elected candidates. Where an unsuccessful candidate fails to furnish a statement of election expenses or a statutory declaration within the specified period, the person shall be disqualified from membership of a local authority during the remainder of the term of office of members of local authority elected at that election.</P>
    <P>Where a member of a local authority fails to furnish a statement of election expenses or a statutory declaration within the specified period, the member shall be automatically suspended from membership of the authority for seven days commencing on the expiry of the time specified. If at the end of such seven days the member has not complied with the requirements of section 13, he or she shall be disqualified from membership of a local authority during the period of the remainder of the term of office of members of a local authority elected at that election. So that there is no misunderstanding of the position of elected members, I will ask local authorities to issue a notice at the first meeting of the new councils to remind them of the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 24 provides for the necessary amendment of section 6 of the Local Government Act, 1994, to remove the disqualification applying to the chairs of Oireachtas committees and joint committees for the June local elections.</P>
    <P>Section 25, the final section, makes provision for research into the feasibility of introducing electronic methods of recording and counting votes under the present PR-STV election system. This provision will not introduce electronic voting and counting at elections, which would require separate legislation. Counted ballot papers can only be inspected by obtaining a High Court order when the court hears a petition questioning an election. Counted ballot papers are normally destroyed six months after an election. The section makes provision for the use of counted ballot papers to assist in the examination of the feasibility of introducing electronic voting and counting. This is necessary to test the equipment to be used for electronic voting, including any minor changes in the counting rules necessary, and to establish the effects of such changes. Extraction of data from the counted ballot papers will be restricted to this purpose and the ballot papers will be destroyed in the normal way once the information is recorded.</P>
    <P>The scheme proposed in the Bill is a local one appropriate to local elections. It will be less costly, less bureaucratic and simpler to operate than the scheme for Dáil and European Parliament elections. Crucially, it will embody the principles of the Electoral Act, 1997; all expenditure will be disclosed and candidates will have to dis<Col N="1050" /> close the sources of funding used to meet election expenses together with any donation over £500 received. The obligation on political parties to disclose donations, as currently provided for under Part IV of the Electoral Act, 1997, will continue. This Bill is a sensible, workable and comprehensive approach to the disclosure of donations and expenditure in respect of local elections. I commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister's officials for briefing me and Deputy Gilmore when the Bill was first published. Following the suggestion made by Deputy Gilmore on the Order of Business, I recommend the Minister and his officials brief us on the legislation to enact a constitutional referendum and the wording of that referendum before it comes before the Dáil, That would be important.</P>
      <P>My party is in favour of the maximum disclosure in terms of election expenses and donations to all candidates and we support the Bill in that respect. However, we believe the Bill to be seriously flawed in a number of respects. For that reason we will abstain on the question whether the Bill should be submitted to the select committee. If it is submitted we will introduce substantial amendments on Committee and Report Stages to make it more effective and transparent.</P>
      <P>We all recognise this is a difficult time for politics, both locally and nationally, in view of the revelations occurring on a daily basis in Dublin Castle. We must ensure that the political system we have in place at local level, in the Dáil and at the European level is above board and beyond reproach. That is why the principles enacted in the Ethics in Public Office Act and the Electoral Acts will, in the long run, be to the benefit of politics. We need maximum disclosure, not a minimalist response. I am afraid that many of the provisions in this Bill are minimalist in nature. Politics needs to be opened up. In view of this, we should not create different levels of disclosure and different levels of expenditure because this creates suspicion, which is not good for politics.</P>
      <P>The Government has a nerve introducing legislation of this kind seven or eight weeks before the local elections. Last year the Government postponed the local elections until the holding of the European elections this June. Since it knew this type of legislation would have to be enacted before the local elections, why has it taken two years for the legislation to be presented to the Oireachtas? It means that, seven weeks before the elections, the Bill must be railroaded through the House within a few weeks. That is not the way to do business and the Government's approach is disrespectful to the House. This kind of legislation needs detailed consideration and it is important that this be done. However, we will not have an opportunity to do this and the Government stands indicted on that count.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fine Gael believes there needs to be a consistent approach to the mechanisms of declarations between local, European and national elections. <Col N="1051" /> We are opposed to the idea that, in terms of what is proposed under this legislation, all the information should exist at local level. While this should be substantially improved, we welcome the provisions on disclosure which are a central part of the legislation and should allay public concern about the levels of funding received by candidates and parties at elections.</P>
    <P>When the Bill was before the Seanad the Government dropped the ball on this issue when it decided to help the electoral considerations of Deputy Healy-Rae from the Kerry South constituency who is chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment and Local Government. The position of committee chairmen was not mentioned until it was quietly inserted in the Bill when it was before the Seanad. The motivation of the Government must be questioned when it stitches into the legislation a provision that will be used by Deputy Healy-Rae, and perhaps others, despite the consensus reached in the House some years ago that committee chairmen should not be members of local authorities.</P>
    <P>We believe that much of the information being sought by way of this legislation should be kept at the level of the Public Offices Commission, which is relatively new to the world of politics. However, we are beginning to recognise its role and to become used to its functions within the political system. It is wrong to keep two separate levels, one for statements by local election candidates at local level and another for statements at Public Offices Commission level for national and European elections.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that information would be kept locally and the county secretary will have the responsibility to gather information from local election candidates. Could this lead to conflict for county secretaries and managers who are senior officials within the local government system? The idea behind the Public Offices Commission was to create an independent body charged with the responsibility of gathering donation statements on a regular basis. By giving this responsibility to senior management figures within the local government system are we burdening them with a function that should not be within their domain? I ask the Minister to comment on this in his reply.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he could not envisage a situation where the Public Offices Commission would have to deal with these kinds of donation statements because it would impose additional expenditure of £300,000 and would lead to a vastly increased number of staff in the commission. That is nonsense. If the Government considers that the commission is doing its job correctly in terms of national elections it should be given the same functions for local elections. This would lead to increasing expertise and knowledge within that body.</P>
    <P>The Minister repeated the ludicrous argument he made in the Seanad regarding the Buncrana <Col N="1052" /> to Dublin line. His argument is that people will not travel to Dublin to see the donation statements of local election candidates. Why was the same argument not used in terms of Dáil elections when the Government implemented the Public Offices Commission? If people in Buncrana are interested in ascertaining the donation statements of local election candidates should they not also have the right to the same facility in respect of their general election candidates? Are people in Cahirciveen, or wherever, expected to travel to Dublin to ascertain the donation statements of their Dáil candidates in an age of e-mail, telephone and facsimile communication? The information should be kept by the Public Offices Commission. This would mean that people could get information on the declaration and donation statements of a local election candidate by telephone, e-mail or facsimile.</P>
    <P>Why are we creating this two tiered approach between local and national elections? It is not good enough. The argument in favour of it must be faced down. If Dáil election candidates can make their declaration statements to the Public Offices Commission so should local election candidates. The Minister maintained this was in the context of giving more powers and functions to local government. However that is ludicrous because it puts more work on the local government system when there is a well functioning independent body in place, the Public Offices Commission. The Government must think again about this argument.</P>
    <P>My party's central disagreement with the Bill concerns the absence of expenditure limits. That is wrong. Most political parties and people involved in politics realise that capping election expenditure is a good thing. We are all sick and tired of the continuous fund-raising which goes on behind political parties. Much of that fund-raising is wasteful expenditure on elections. The level of expenditure set for general elections and European elections is perfectly adequate and will reduce the burden on fund-raising for political parties. Why, therefore, has the Government not continued with that consistent principle in this legislation? The Minister claims it is unworkable. I do not accept that.</P>
    <P>We are all beginning to get used to the capping of expenditure at general elections. We have had particular knowledge of this by way of by-elections in this Dáil already. It is a normal part of our political procedure and it is good for politics. Why, when it comes to local elections, has this area been overlooked? We all know that a small minority of local election candidates spend considerable sums of money at local elections and do not get many votes for their trouble, but to have this problematic principle in the Bill where there is one set of standards for general elections and European elections and another for local elections is not good enough. I ask the Government to think again on that issue.</P>
    <P>With regard to the donations statements, the Minister is also wrong to limit the requirement in <Col N="1053" /> the Bill for statements on donations over £500 to local election candidates to the course of the election. Every member of a local authority and public official should have to declare on an annual basis whether they received donations over £500 from various sources. It would require all councillors to fill out forms which Members of the Dáil have had to complete over recent years. That is not an onerous task. I do not know why the Government has dodged this issue. We could have a situation where an individual gives £4,000 or £3,000 to a candidate before a local election campaign starts but he or she would not have to declare it because the Bill applies only to the three or four weeks of the campaign.</P>
    <P>It is also wrong that significant moneys may be given to councillors outside the scope of a local election and need not be declared. That seems bizarre. I do not accept the Minister's argument that this is just unworkable administratively and could not be put into effect. We will have to revisit that issue in particular. People expect that local politicians, like national politicians, should have to make declarations on donations they receive. If people have nothing to hide, they would not be afraid to make a donation statement. It is also madness that Members of the Dáil who stand for local election must make double declarations. That must be overcome on Committee Stage. As a Member of the Dáil, I make an annual statement but it does not make sense that I should have to make another statement if I stand for local election.</P>
    <P>How effective is the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1976, which requires all officials and members of local authorities to declare an interest or significant sums of money which they would have received from various parties when they are taking a decision? Have there been many examples of local councillors declaring an interest before they vote one way or the other on various issues which come before local government?</P>
    <P>I also think it is wrong for the disclosures Bill and the ethics standards Bill, to which the Minister referred, to come at separate times. I would have thought it more sensible that we would have dealt with the ethical issues connected to local government at the same time as we were talking about the issue of disclosures.</P>
    <P>There is a level of public disquiet about certain named officials who have been operating in the world of planning and at senior management levels of local government. We have a responsibility to revisit the prevailing legislation related to disclosures by county managers, senior planners and senior management people within local government. If there is a law for politicians, the same law should apply to senior management figures in local government who on a regular basis must make important decisions affecting huge sums of money and great change within local government. I wonder is there the same level of disclosure by senior management figures within local government. I do not think so. In light of what has come <Col N="1054" /> out of the tribunals in Dublin Castle to date, that entire area must be revisited. It is wrong that senior public service officials do not have to make regular disclosures in the same way that politicians must do so. The Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dan Wallace, who was a distinguished member of Cork Corporation for many years, would know that significant powers exist within the management systems of local government. I would be interested in hearing his observations on when he proposes to make amendments in that regard.</P>
    <P>Earlier I described this legislation and the way in which it was stitched up in the Seanad as an attempt to appease Deputy Healy-Rae. Yesterday I heard the views of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, on the dual mandate at a meeting of the Joint Committee on the Environment and Local Government. He referred to the fact that he wants to abolish the dual mandate but I seriously question whether this House has a right to deny a Member of the Dáil, or any citizen of the Republic, from standing for local elections. Is it constitutional? I ask the Minister to continue to discuss this matter with the Attorney General's office. When that constitutional litmus test is put to it, the Government will be seen not to be on the right road in this area. If the Fianna Fáil Party or other parties want to abolish the dual mandate, let them take that position at a policy level within their parties and more luck to them, but I believe legislation to abolish the dual mandate would be unconstitutional. Ultimately it is a matter for the Irish people to decide for themselves whether they want to elect a Dáil Deputy as a councillor. That is their prerogative I wonder about the constitutional implications of Minister Dempsey's repeated statements in this regard.</P>
    <P>While the Minister's views on this subject are well known, he is putting off the abolition of the dual mandate to another time. If he believes so much in this, why did he not introduce the necessary legislation in the past two years? Does the Minister have certain placating reasons for not implementing this? We must find out.</P>
    <P>With regard to third parties, on Committee Stage we need to get a good deal more clarity from the Government as to whether the scheme proposed in the legislation is workable. For example, I recently took a firm decision, as did the Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy Flood, Deputy Rabbitte, and the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, to back proposals for a methadone addiction centre in my constituency. As one would expect, we were pilloried and local protest meetings were held. At the end of one of those, a gentleman told me he would fervently canvass against me and that he would distribute leaflets to this effect because I was in favour of the location of the addiction centre in Tallaght. I told him he was entitled to do so. Under this legis<Col N="1055" /> lation does that person with a bee in his bonnet about me and perhaps other TDs require a certificate from the local authority before he can distribute leaflets in Tallaght saying what an awful politician I am? We are on a slippery slope in this regard. I know there is no expenditure limit and I presume I could respond immediately to his 1,000 leaflets asking people not to vote for me. However, who will police this? Will that person be taken to court? Are we giving unimaginable power to local authorities?</P>
    <P>There are more cases now than ever where groups or individuals will campaign against a politician because they do not agree with him or her. How can we possibly monitor this? We need to look again at the section which deals with third parties. Is it constitutional to put a limit on the right of people to oppose candidates or political parties? The gentleman who said he was going to canvass against me and distribute leaflets has every right to do so. However, will this legislation curtail his right?</P>
    <P>What about the implications for newspapers? While the legislation covers newspapers, periodicals and magazines, will newspapers, particularly local ones, be more circumspect in taking a neutral position on local elections than they ought to be? Will they require a certificate from a local authority before they declare for one candidate or party in local elections? How will this be policed?</P>
    <P>I wish to speak about the provisions at the end of the Bill for the introduction of electronic voting. I am aware from recent demonstrations that the Minister is using these elections as a dry run. Where will this dry run take place? I understand the ballot papers from local elections will be used. Where will this superficial count take place? Will it be in the Department of the Environment and Local Government? What will happen to the papers, which I understand are to be kept secret? On a related matter which has been highlighted in the media in the past number of weeks, how long does the Department of the Environment and Local Government hold ballot papers? I presume the same will apply to electronic voting.</P>
    <P>Is it correct that if this measure is enacted nationally, in terms of the distribution of surpluses, the pure PR-STV form could be enacted in local, general and European elections? At the moment we have an imperfect system under which if one candidate has a surplus only a certain number of ballot papers in that pile are taken into account. The Seanad system is a perfect form because it takes all ballot papers into account. Will electronic voting allow the perfect form of PR-STV to be implemented?</P>
    <P>This Bill needs to be looked at again on Committee Stage. My party is in favour of the maximum disclosure in local elections and we will not frustrate the passing of the Bill. However, we want the Bill to be more comprehensive and to provide for more accountability.</P>
    <Col N="1056" />
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>This Government has been in office for almost two years. The programme for Government which heralded the election of the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrat Government contains a section which deals with local government. It proclaims that Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats in Government are committed to the restoration of real decision making and power to local authorities and local people. It goes on to list a series of aspirations &ndash; improving efficiency throughout the system, enhancing the concept of customer service in local government, removing the democratic deficit by restoring real power to the elected members and facilitating a new partnership with the community and voluntary sector.</P>
      <P>Given these lofty aspirations we all had reason to expect this Government would have flooded this House with legislation to reform local government in the two years in which it has been in office. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government seemed to indicate on a number of occasions that this might happen. He has made a succession of declaratory speeches at meetings with various local government bodies &ndash; the General Council of County Councils, the Association of Municipal Authorities and the Local Authority Members' Association &ndash; telling them about his extensive plans to reform local government. He even took the theme on tour. One must wonder whether his extensive visitation of local authorities was about the reform of local government or something else.</P>
      <P>After two years of talk about local government reform &ndash; we saw another example at yesterday's meeting of the Joint Committee on the Environment and Local Government where the Minister treated us to his thoughts, aspirations and long-term wishes for local government &ndash; this is the first local government legislation produced by this Government which has appeared on the Order Paper. It is very defective legislation, as Deputy Hayes said, and I will deal with it later.</P>
      <P>We will hear about local government<i> ad nauseam</i> for the next six or seven weeks. Local government is 100 years old today and it shows its age. There is probably no aspect of the governmental and administrative system which requires modernisation, change and reform more than the centenarian local government system. There is hardly any significant interest in local government &ndash;  elected members, staff, various associated organisations and certainly the long suffering public who must deal with a very outdated system &ndash; which does not wish to have it reformed.</P>
      <P>The intention of this House was that local government would be reformed before the next local elections. The local government elections to city and county councils, which were due three years ago, were postponed so that legislation could be introduced to reform local government and that when elections took place they would be to newly reformed bodies. That has not happened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1057" /> There are 26 year old people in this country who have never had the opportunity to vote for the members of their city or county council, to cast a vote for the people who make critical decisions about how land is zoned, the environment is planned, waste is dealt with, where roads are built, traffic management and all the other services and functions performed by local government. People in their mid to late twenties have never had the opportunity to vote for the people who make these decisions because we were waiting for the holy grail of local government reform, which has not happened.</P>
    <P>We are now going to proceed, according to the Minister, with local elections on 11 June to elect members to the old unreformed local councils and, perhaps a couple of weeks before those elections, the Bill on local government reform will be presented in a way which suggests it is the Fianna Fáil manifesto for the local elections. We are going to have all kinds of reform of local government, with quality service and the end of the dual mandate, except where it counts, which is in reality. Before every local election we get a flurry of interest on the part of the Government about reforming local government but as soon as the polls close at 9 p.m., it is forgotten about for another period of years.</P>
    <P>It is an absurdity that the Bill which is intended to reform local government will not be enacted until after the local elections. It is not the only legislation impacting on local government which is delayed by the Government. For example, a Bill was promised to reform the appointment of vocational education committees, all of which will be appointed by local councils before the middle of July, following the local elections. We were supposed to have statutory representation for parents and teachers on vocational education committees. That legislation will now not be produced until after the local elections and after the vocational education committees have been appointed under the old system. We were supposed to have a planning Bill, which would have major implications for the councils elected on 11 June. The public is entitled to know, at the very least, what powers the people whom they elect on 11 June will have in relation to planning, not least because of the degree of public concern which exists at present, some of it emanating from the revelations in the planning tribunal in Dublin Castle.</P>
    <P>Yesterday the Minister for the Environment and Local Government told a committee that social housing is a cornerstone of local government. There are 130 pieces of legislation on the Government's legislative programme but there is not a single Bill to deal with any aspect of the housing crisis affecting many families at present. There is no legislation to tighten up landlord and tenant law, to provide for affordable housing or to deal with the gazumping of house prices and the profiteering which is taking place in that area but there are plenty of declarations about what the Government is going to do about social hous<Col N="1058" /> ing, much of which seems to be repeated at very considerable length by what appears to be a highly uncritical press as far as this Department and area of public policy are concerned.</P>
    <P>We have also had the debacle about regionalisation. We now have layers in different regions dealing with different functions. On top of that, the Government is going to lay down group regions to correspond to its wish to maximise EU funds rather than basing it on any real sense of regionalisation.</P>
    <P>This Government, which will talk very loudly and extensively over the next number of weeks about local government reform, has done nothing to reform the system of local government in the two years it has been in office. It is interesting to compare the inactivity of the Government in reforming the local government system of this State with the performance of the UK Government which, in the same period, has managed to introduce huge constitutional and governmental changes, with the establishment of assemblies in Scotland and Wales, the elected body in Northern Ireland and the arrangements for the election of a Mayor of London. In that two year period, while this Government has been doing nothing to reform local government and the Minister has been visiting councils all over the country talking about local government reform, the government of the neighbouring state has got on with the job and shown what can be done by a government that is serious about conducting its business.</P>
    <P>The only piece of legislation dealing with local government with which we are left is this one, which admittedly provides for the declaration of expenditure incurred and donations contributed, essentially in the month before the local elections, but which provides for no limit on the amount a candidate may expend in the local election campaign. The Minister of State said in his speech that this is in keeping with the principles of the Electoral Act, 1977, which it is not. The Electoral Act, 1997, and the various legislation enacted by the previous Government to deal with the declaration of electoral expenditure and donations and the capping of electoral expenditure, was a package which provided for, first, limits on the amount an individual candidate or party could spend in an election so that we would have fair elections and, second, a declaration from where that money was coming and what was being spent so that there would be public transparency.</P>
    <P>To introduce one element of that package in relation to the local elections without the other is really trying to make a bird fly on one wing or applaud with one hand. It does not make sense to have the declarations of donations and expenditure without having a cap on expenditure as well. It is a nonsense for this State to have a regime where there will be a cap on the amount spent by candidates for the European Parliament or the Dáil but no limit on the amount spent by candidates for urban councils, town commissions or county councils. It is for that reason I am pro<Col N="1059" /> posing, on behalf of the Labour Party, a Second Stage amendment to the Bill.</P>
    <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P>To delete all the words after &ldquo;that&rdquo; and to substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann,</P>
    <P>deploring the failure of the Bill to provide any limit on the amount that a candidate may spend in the local elections;</P>
    <P>noting that this will now create an anomalous situation in which there are strict limits on the amounts that candidates may spend seeking election to Dáil Éireann or to the European Parliament but none on those seeking election to a local authority;</P>
    <P>declines to give a Second Reading to the Bill&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The reason we are given for the lack of a cap on expenditure does not stand up. The Minister says it is for administrative reasons because it will create too bureaucratic a system, with all local candidates having to make declarations of the amount they spend over the limit. That does not make sense. The procedure which would control the limit on expenditure is already provided for in the Bill. Every candidate in the local election will have to make a declaration of the amount they get and the amount they spend. Not only will every candidate have to do that, but every party will have to do so. As Deputy Hayes pointed out, not only will every party have to do that but so will every residents' association which sends a circular to the 200 or 300 houses in its membership, naming the councillors who were of help to it in a rezoning controversy or any other local issue and seeking support for those councillors. They will also have to make a declaration of the amount they spend.</P>
    <P>Where is the difficulty in including a provision which states that there shall be a limit on the amount a candidate may spend? One can control the limit by reference to the declaration of expenditure which candidates will be required to make. This is not an administrative difficulty but a political decision by the Government to provide a regime for these local elections which is manifestly unfair and will provide an unfair advantage to wealthy candidates or to candidates who have wealthy backers.</P>
    <P>It is particularly serious that this is happening in local government. While we have limits for spending in Dáil elections, there are few issues that come before the House and which are decided upon by direct vote of the House, as distinct from governmental decisions, which impact on the financial well-being or otherwise of individual citizens or companies in the way they do in local government. The inquiries in Dublin Castle, for example, particularly the Flood Tribunal, deal with matters that pertain at local government level, such as planning permission <Col N="1060" /> and rezoning of land, which are capable of turning small farmers into multi-millionaires if they own land in the vicinity of a large expanding urban conurbation.</P>
    <P>Developers can make huge sums of money from decisions made by local authorities. We have seen press reports and heard stories recently about developers. I recall one story, which was not denied by the principals involved, where a developer provided £0.5 million to a consultant to pursue planning permission for a development and associated matters. There is nothing in this Bill to prevent a developer funding to the gills a candidate or a number of candidates in a local election who will pursue their material, financial and beneficial interests once they are elected to the council.</P>
    <P>This is particularly serious in local elections. We all know from political experience that the poll in local elections is significantly lower than that in a general election. The potential, therefore, to distort the outcome of a local election by having a candidate or a group of candidates who are highly resourced, have access to considerable amounts of money and who can spend that to the benefit of their favoured candidates is building into the local election system an unfairness which is not tolerable in a democracy.</P>
    <P>This Bill is making the local elections on 11 June unfair before the first vote is cast. The concept of local democracy is to allow citizens at local level to elect people whom they know and who live among them to sit on their local councils and to govern their local areas. It should not be possible to have a regime whereby one candidate, if he is based in a community which does not have resources, is at a disadvantage compared to another candidate who has huge amounts of money to spend on the campaign. That is an unfair election. This needs to be put right before these elections are held on 11 June.</P>
    <P>I propose that the House does not give this Bill a Second Reading in the absence of a cap on expenditure. If the House votes to give the Bill a Second Reading, then I will propose on Committee Stage that limits on a scaled basis, depending on the size of the local authority and the electoral area, be put in place for the local elections on 11 June.</P>
    <P>The decision to omit the cap on spending is not an administrative decision but a political one. The political agenda the Government is pursuing was inadvertently dropped by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government when he spoke on Committee Stage in the Seanad. When my colleague, Senator Gallagher, asked the Minister what was the point in having limits on spending in Dáil elections and not in local elections, the Minister replied that it was his intention to remove the limits on spending in Dáil elections as well in the next Electoral Bill. Has this Government, particularly the largest party in it, not learned anything from the tribunals, investigations and public concern about the relationship <Col N="1061" /> between money, politics, property, planning and the other matters under investigation at present? </P>
    <P>I am concerned about some of the exemptions in this Bill which should be explained on Committee Stage. Section 6(1)(b)(iii), for example, states that &ldquo;the reasonable living expenses of a candidate or any person or persons working on behalf of the candidate on a voluntary basis&rdquo; will not be included for expenditure in this Bill. Does this mean, for example, that if a well resourced candidate pays subsistence to and buys meals for an army of people that is not included in election expenses? </P>
    <P>We need some explanation of section 6(1)(b)(v) which deals with the non-inclusion of resources which might be available to a candidate either through membership of this House, the European Parliament or a political party. The principle which must be followed in the conduct of local elections is that every candidate, irrespective of whether he is a member of a big or small political party or none or whether he is a Member of the Houses of the Oireachtas, should be able to contest the local elections on an even basis.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Hayes about the loophole in the Bill which only confines the declaration of donations and expenditure to the period between the declaration and the conduct of the poll. That must be widened to ensure that donations given to a local election candidate or to a member of a local authority at any time over the limit of £500 are capable of being declared in the same way as they are capable of being declared by a Member of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I also agree with Deputy Hayes about the section which will put this requirement on people and bodies who are not candidates or political parties but who express and circulate material either in support of or in opposition to candidates in a local election. I can recall immediately residents' associations which for the information of their members may wish to indicate which candidates or councillors in an outgoing council voted in a particular way on controversial matters. They are perfectly entitled to do that. That is part of our system of public accountability. Will that be considered to be the circulation of material in favour or in opposition to particular candidates? </P>
    <P>If residents' associations in my constituency around Stepaside, Rathmichael, Shankill or any of the other areas which were concerned about the protection of green belt areas circulate material indicating that certain members of Dún Laoghaire Rathdown County Council voted for the rezoning of this land from green belt to housing or whatever, will they be required to make a declaration? Will that be considered to be material which is circulated in opposition to particular candidates? There are other examples also. Where does this leave the newspapers and freedom the of press? Is freedom of the press only of concern to large monopoly newspaper owners? Does it not apply also to the freedom of citizens or groups of citizens to publish and circu<Col N="1062" /> late material which is of public interest and expressing public opinions?</P>
    <P>If the Independent group of newspapers were to do a repeat of what it did at the last General Election where it editorialised in all its publications for at least a week in advance of the General Election in support of the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrat combination in opposition to the three parties in the outgoing Government and offer the advice that the electorate should vote in a particular way, will it be required under this legislation to make a declaration on the cost of publishing it?</P>
    <P>I refer to the little provision which was slipped in on Committee Stage in the Seanad which will allow Oireachtas chairpersons to contest the local elections. I have no hard opposition to Oireachtas chairpersons contesting the local elections. However, I have to comment on the sly, political underhand method used to facilitate Deputy Healy-Rea and possibly other Members who are Oireachtas chairpersons and who may wish to contest the local elections. It would have been far preferable if the Government had stated clearly to this House, the other House and the public that it had a political problem which it wished to address and that it was proposing to do so by way of legislation rather than this pretence since we are not proceeding with the dual mandate legislation until 2004. If we are going that far why do we not allow Senators and TDs to be chairpersons of local authorities? A similar argument could be made for the lifting of that provision.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that half a dozen weeks before the local elections a Government which has been in office for two years and has talked us to boredom about local government reform, has not produced local government reform legislation. At the last minute it introduced defective legislation, which gives the pretence that it will provide for an open regime in local authorities, which is riddled with loopholes and does not contain the essential provision required in legislation of this kind, to put a limit on the amount that individual candidates may spend in the local elections.</P>
    <P>This Bill should not be given a Second Reading. Either it should be thrown out at Second Stage or the Government should come back with proper legislation or, alternatively, the Minister should give a commitment to amend it to provide for limits on spending to ensure fair elections on 11 June rather than a manifestly unfair electoral regime under this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>We are living in the age of openness, transparency and accountability. As we approach the end of this century and the end of this millennium it is reasonable to reflect on the changes which have taken place in the last 100 years. The changes which have taken place in the past ten years have been remarkable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our adoption of openness, transparency and accountability has profound implications for politics, the Judiciary, the churches and so on. I wel<Col N="1063" /> come this change to a totally open, transparent and accountable system. In the political arena we have introduced the Ethics in Public Office, Act, to allow for a registration of interests and the Electoral Act, 1997, to allow for disclosure of donations and expenditure with regard to elections etc. We have decisively adopted the principle of disclosure. This Bill is another step in that process and I welcome it.</P>
    <P>Much discussion has already taken place on the need to put in an expenditure limit for candidates and parties. That would have been desirable but I accept the Minister's comments that this can be impractical for a number of reasons. For example, it would involve massive bureaucracy. Given that there are 268 electoral areas consisting of 75 single areas with memberships of between nine and 12 members and populations of 1,095 to 19,056, county councils and county boroughs which are divided into 193 local electoral areas with membership of three to seven members and population ranges from 3,992 to 63,173, there is a difficulty in treating all candidates equally. This would not be easy for local elections. Clearly a single limit would not be equal for all candidates. Alternatively one could attempt to devise different limits for different size electoral areas or different authorities and for each local electoral area within a county. Even if it were decided to have expenditure limits, the actual limits would have to be decided. It is a complicated task and should be kept under review.</P>
    <P>The Joint Committee on the Environment and Local Government recently produced a report on local government reform which states:</P>
    <P>The sub-committee recognises that issues of ethics in public office require some consideration. The sub-committee notes the existing requirements in relation to declaration of Members' interests in planning matters.</P>
    <P>The sub-committee also recognises the generally high standards which exist in this area. The sub-committee felt that consideration should be given to a proximate extension of the Ethics in Public Office Act and Electoral Acts to members and officials in local government.</P>
    <P>I subscribe to that view.</P>
    <P>The existing provisions in relation to the Planning Acts and councillors are inadequate. For example, a councillor who is a member of a local authority in Dublin but adjacent to another local authority would not have to declare an interest under the existing system. This is unsatisfactory and I would welcome an extension of the Ethics in Public Office Act and the registration of interests generally to local authorities as outlined in the report I mentioned.</P>
    <P>There has been much talk about the dual mandate. The Minister is on record as saying that it will be abolished before the elections which are due to be held in 2004. This will be included in legislation which is due to be published shortly.</P>
    <Col N="1064" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Never. Someone else will deal with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>A provision under which Oireachtas Members will not be permitted to chair local authorities will come into effect in 1999. The position in relation to Oireachtas chairpersons going forward for election to a local authority is dealt with in this Bill and it will facilitate that move. The report on local government reform dealt with this matter well. It states:</P>
      <P>Regarding the issue of the dual mandate, the sub-committee felt that the exclusion of Oireachtas Members from local government should only take place in the context of the dual mandate having been replaced by appropriate procedures for communications and access for Deputies and Senators to local authority documentation and processes, including the right to have representations answered, delegations met and documents and reports received. Provision should be made to allow Deputies and Senators attend and be allowed to contribute to local authority meetings at the discretion of the chairman.</P>
      <P>The report continued:</P>
      <P>The sub-committee also felt that, in the interim, partial restrictions on the functions of Oireachtas Members on local authorities, restrictions on accepting certain positions, etc, are entirely unacceptable.</P>
      <P>I subscribe to that point. If the dual mandate is to be abolished as suggested by the Minister, in the interim all members of local authorities should be treated equally. Arbitrary rules should not be placed on some local authority members because they are Members of the Oireachtas and not on others.</P>
      <P>Deputy Hayes said that the Fine Gael Party is not in favour of abolishing the dual mandate for constitutional reasons. This is an interesting point which can be clarified. However, in the interests of modernising Government generally and local government in particular, this side believes that the dual mandate will have to be abolished in due course. The current position is similar to a person saying, &ldquo;Make me good, but not just yet.&rdquo;  However, there is now a definite commitment to take that course and I understand the legislation will be published shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill also allows experimentation in relation to electronic voting mechanisms. This is long overdue. We live in an age of electronics and information technology. One only has to consider how business is conducted in the House and the procedures used for divisions to understand the merits of the provision. The bells ring for eight minutes and Deputies must physically come to the House and walk through the division lobbies where the details are recorded by hand by the various clerks assigned to this work. It is a cumbersome and archaic procedure and there must <Col N="1065" /> be a better way to do it through some form of electronic voting mechanism.</P>
    <P>The system used for counting ballot papers in elections is also archaic. A culture has built up around it. The counting of ballot papers is often left until the day after polling and there are media reports about first count results being due around lunchtime and teatime. It is all very civilised and the tally men are to the fore. If the system is to be changed, this mechanism of determining results in advance will also be changed. However, we must accept that this system is outdated. I welcome the initial steps which have been taken to introduce some form of electronic voting and a new system for the counting of votes because we are behind the times in that regard. I welcome the Bill's provisions which will start the process of investigating alternative systems.</P>
    <P>The Minister gave a firm commitment that a constitutional referendum will be held on the view that local government is an integral part of Government and to give constitutional recognition to the role of local authorities. I welcome this move. It is a good idea to hold a constitutional referendum on the same day as the local elections. This will increase awareness among the electorate of the local and European elections. The discussions taking place in the context of the referendum will encourage the electorate to turn out on polling day. I welcome the move to include this provision in the Constitution. Local government has been forgotten and the tremendous role played by councillors in the political system often is not recognised.</P>
    <P>I do not intend seeking election to the Seanad and I am not offering the standard platitudes of Seanad candidates in praising councillors. However, the role of councillors deserves constitutional recognition and I welcome the fact that legislation in that regard will be published shortly. Will the Minister clarify whether the Referendum Commission will have to put the arguments for and against this proposal? It would be difficult to come up with arguments against inserting a provision relating to the role of local government in the Constitution. Will the Minister clarify whether changes are necessary to the mandate of the Referendum Commission in that regard?</P>
    <P>Even at this stage, a low turnout for the forthcoming local and European elections can be predicted. I do not know why that is the case. Many theories have been put forward but I will not deal in detail with them. Any reason offered for a low turnout can be controversial. We all have a duty to mobilise the electorate to turn out on 11 June for the local elections.</P>
    <P>Local authorities are failing to tackle the litter problem in the streets and countryside. Darndale estate in my local electoral area has many social problems. Much has been done to alleviate those problems but the litter in that estate is appalling. The responsibility for dealing with that falls to the local authority but the job is not being done by the cleansing division of Dublin Corporation. <Col N="1066" /> We cannot tolerate that anymore. There must be value for money. Resources are being spent but the job is not being done. That is only one area. This is happening in every street and in every part of the countryside. In the forthcoming reform of local government, we must focus on what is supposed to be done by local authorities. That is an example of where they are not doing their job. We must ask why. Perhaps if the balance of power is tilted away from management towards councillors there would be a chance that what we are supposed to do will be done.</P>
    <P>The Minister put on the record that he subscribes to the idea of a directly elected mayor. This has been discussed by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Environment and Local Government, although a clear consensus has not emerged. We are moving towards the position where local authorities should have directly elected chairpersons and mayors. There has been constitutional reform and reform of local government in the UK which provides for the election by the people of a lord mayor of London. A person elected by the people would have a strong mandate to govern, would be accountable and would have a moral authority to govern. It would redress the balance between management and elected members and that would be desirable. In the interests of modernisation we should proceed along those lines and given the reforms we are putting in place that is inevitable. People in the existing system do not like change because they know how it works. If we set a target date for the introduction of major reform, we would all work toward that end.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister for the Environment and Local Government and the Minister of State for the reforms which have been put in place. I disagree with Deputy Gilmore when he says that no reform took place. The financing of local government, a thorn in the side for many years, has now been decisively dealt with. Local government now has the finances and resources to carry out its functions &ndash; this Government dealt with that. The forthcoming local government Bill will herald many new reforms which will be in place for implementation by the local authorities elected in June. The strategic policy committees and area based committees brought forward by the last administration are now being established. New proposals have been brought forward for the integration of the local development agencies with the local authorities. State agencies operating in certain local authority areas will be brought into the local government planning system. I welcome the consultations undertaken by the Minister with local authority members.</P>
    <P>This is the centenary year for local government, a very exciting year with all the major changes planned. I welcome the principle of disclosure in this Bill and all that it means for transparency and accountability.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this legislation. It is a unique day to do <Col N="1067" /> so &ndash; the day when the local authorities will celebrate the centenary of their first meeting with a meeting this evening. I read the minutes of the meeting in question and many things have happened since.</P>
      <P>Before the local elections in 1991, as many dual mandate members will recall, the boundaries of all towns were extended to allow the urban district council town commissioners to be elected by the people they would represent. Those elected in 1995 were to be given the opportunity to represent those people. From these benches the current Minister talked <i>ad nauseam</i> about the reforms he would introduce to give those bodies and individual members the power to represent their towns. In Navan the elected representatives represent one third of the population who elected them. The position is similar in Kells and in Trim. It is interesting that the Minister, who hails from there, was an elected representative and chairman of both bodies, yet two years on there has not been any reform to deal with what was anticipated would happen at that time. Extending the boundaries and giving people an opportunity to elect representatives was a good idea at the time but we in this House have failed to deal with that issue. I am annoyed about that because on the doorsteps we are giving people false hope that, for the first time, their local representatives will have the opportunity to negotiate on their behalf.</P>
      <P>It would be wrong of me not to mention my annoyance about a perception of events that have unfolded over the past year and a half. I am annoyed that senior figures in some local authorities have sufficient power to advise a council not to rezone land because it cannot be serviced when behind the scenes they are putting pressure on councillors to draw on section 4 to rezone the land or section 26 in terms of material contravention. I have given serious thought to that since the various disclosures came to light. That practice has done a great deal of harm to local politics. I take serious exception to a senior official of a local authority using his or her power to influence certain decisions or put pressure on local authority members.</P>
      <P>Is it any wonder we have a housing crisis when one considers the pressure put on people not to rezone land? A year and half ago, Meath County Council rezoned almost 1,000 acres in the town of Navan on the basis that it could be serviced and that approval for the infrastructure was granted by the Department of the Environment in 1995, 1996 and 1997. More importantly, the level of demand was the deciding factor in terms of whether the land was made available for housing. Part of the problem of the lack of available land for housing is the effect of councillors preventing the rezoning of land. If there was enough land available, the market would find its own level. I have no doubt that will happen over the next 12 months due to some of the decisions that have been taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to recognise that we must <Col N="1068" /> rezone more land than will be built on over the next five years to reduce the level of demand. That has not happened in Meath, Louth, Wicklow, Kildare or in the greater Dublin area where over one-third of the total population resides. The majority of local representatives, either at urban or county council level, have been responsible over the years. I have been a member of the Meath local authority for almost 25 years and none of the members I dealt with in that time, regardless of their political persuasion, did anything other than work on behalf of the people they represented in the best interests of the county. Mistakes were made but in general much good work was done.</P>
    <P>Another factor which has contributed to the increased price of housing is the lack of understanding on the part of planning officials to allow people build in rural areas. I come from an area of north Meath in which, according to the last census, there are 17 parishes with a reduction in the population from the previous census. That tells me that I am not doing my job effectively as a local authority representative in convincing the powers that be that we want people to live in these parishes. We want to keep the schools open and the football clubs in operation. In encouraging people to live in our towns we have contributed to the increased demand for housing for people who do not have the luxury of owning land. That problem is escalating and no one, either in this House or elsewhere, will say it is a contributing factor to the demand for housing because people living in parishes where there is a reduction in the population who have their own land have been refused planning permission. I am talking about an area that is only an hour and ten minutes from the capital city if the traffic is light, although I spent 25 minutes sitting in traffic in O'Connell Street this morning.</P>
    <P>The Minister had an opportunity over the past year and a half to debate the reform proposals at length in this Houses and in committee and allow us have a major input into the proposed changes. Instead, we must ask people to re-elect us on the basis that we will tell them about the changes when they come into effect.</P>
    <P>I listened with interest to Deputy Haughey say he was in favour of direct elections for the positions of Lord Mayor and the chairmen of councils. The Minister has focused on many issues but particularly on the interest of the councillor or the representative. This is another nice idea which will allow 30, 40 or 50 people to be elected around the country for a specific period and the Minister will be able to say this is wonderful reform. Much more reform is required before the Minister can have direct elections to the chair of my council. The people I represent want greater change than that proposed by the Minister. His proposal is a sop to elected representatives in his party and others lucky enough to be elected. That is not the kind of local government reform which is required.</P>
    <P>The nature of local authority funding has <Col N="1069" /> changed over the past few years. Deputy Haughey commented on how well local authorities are being funded. Given the hundreds of thousands of new vehicles sold over the past few years, generating a large amount of VRT, is it not right that people's money is going to their local authorities to be spent improving roads which have been neglected for 15 years? While Minister for the Environment, Deputy Michael Smith once stated that he did not have money to fix the potholes in Navan and the people had to repair them themselves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>That was not so long ago. It was not until Deputy John Bruton became Taoiseach that we put together a five year plan to start the ball rolling. The Minister has not had time to introduce proper reforms because he is busy having his photograph taken all over the country and at every available opportunity to publicise the money being provided and the plans being put in place. However, the local government reform Bill has still not been produced.</P>
      <P>What is happening here is similar to what happened to a Bill I introduced 14 months ago concerning supervisors in the security industry. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, promised a Bill by October. To which October was the Minister referring? That Bill is as far away as ever.</P>
      <P>When we talk about reform we should talk about a commitment to real reform and not just discuss what councillors may or may not get. The dual mandate has been a major issue. However, the Minister's backbenchers said that the proposal was not on so he ran away from it and postponed a decision until 2004 when someone else can deal with it.</P>
      <P>It is becoming more difficult to get people to run for local elections as a result of the changes in the running of authorities and the involvement of local groups on SPCs which has led to an increase in the number of meetings. How does one approach reform? One can either end the dual mandate, and I have no problem with that, or one can pay local authority members. This is the way forward. It would be a positive step as it would compensate those who have to take time off work to attend meetings. There is pressure on local councillors and it is becoming more difficult for them to take time off work because they often lose money. That is no way to run a system which is over-stretched. As a result, many people who would make excellent public representatives will not make the effort to get involved in local politics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not understand why the Bill did not stipulate a cap on expenditure. It is a lame excuse to claim that it would cost £300,000 to check the returns. If £500,000 or £1 million is needed in some part of the country it will be found some<Col N="1070" /> where. If we want to be realistic about ethics in public life and proposed changes concerning disclosure of expenditure in general, local and European elections, I cannot understand why the Department could not come up with a formula based on the population in each constituency and stipulate allowable expenditure. This could easily be done if the will exists.</P>
    <P>During the last local government elections some people spent between £10,000 to £20,000. We are not prohibiting people from doing so. However, what if a candidate owns a printing company and can produce as much literature as they wish? Such people have an advantage over other candidates. This is one of the greatest disadvantages faced by some candidates.</P>
    <P>It is unacceptable that we have not introduced a scale. It makes no sense for the Minister or the Minister of State to claim that it would be impossible to implement such a system. We are depending on them to run a Department responsible for spending hundreds of millions of pounds.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatCarey" hpid="Mr. P. Carey Mr. P. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is fitting that we are afforded this opportunity to discuss local government, albeit the question of funding, expenditure and the disclosure of donations. This is the centenary of the establishment of local government and I wish to pay tribute to the thousands of councillors of all parties and of none who have rendered sterling service to this country, their local authorities and their communities over the past 100 years.</P>
      <P>I pay particular tribute to councillors who have decided not to stand for re-election. It is a pity that the allowance they are being given as a token of appreciation for their work is being referred to as &ldquo;a scrappage scheme&rdquo;. However, we cannot blame people for lampooning such issues. These councillors have rendered a great service which should be acknowledged.</P>
      <P>I was elected to Dublin Corporation in 1985 and had the privilege of serving with such people as the Taoiseach, Deputy Ahern, Deputy Quinn, Deputies Jim and Gay Mitchell, Deputy Richard Bruton and Deputy Haughey. They were all earnest and diligent workers on behalf of the city.</P>
      <P>A former Leas-Cheann Comhairle, Jim Tunney, also rendered enormous service to this city. Some of those I mentioned have represented the city as Lord Mayor and brought their unique vision of the city and local government to bear. I also pay tribute to city managers. I am most familiar with Frank Feely and John Fitzgerald but I also know other managers in the Dublin region. A forward surge has occurred in the development of the Dublin region through partnership between officials and elected representatives. It is too easy to criticise people for what they have not done; people do their best.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Local government has been bedevilled by a stop-go approach to reform. I recall that a former Minister for the Environment wanted to take O'Connell Street out of Dublin Corporation's jurisdiction and hand it over to a quango. I am glad that decision was subsequently reversed by <Col N="1071" /> a Fianna Fáil Minister. There have been occasions in recent years when quangos &ndash; some of them set up for good reasons &ndash; have eroded the functions of local government and assigned unto themselves functions which more properly belong in the local government structure.</P>
    <P>The present Minister was the first during my tenure in Dublin Corporation to come and listen to the elected representatives and I pay tribute to him for that. Representatives of all parties gave him a rough time on issues such as housing, traffic and the environment but he was well on top of his brief and responded by providing us with funding mechanisms. We should not forget that the greatest reform in local government in recent years has occurred in regard to funding, with local authorities being allowed to raise some of their own finance. We, in Dublin Corporation, are not satisfied with the amount of money we have and need a lot more. However, we are in a happier position than we have been for many years and have undertaken a number of important initiatives. They would not have been possible without the support of the Minister and the Ministers of State.</P>
    <P>The integrated area plans are being viewed with a great deal of interest. The O'Connell Street plan is up and running as is the HARP plan in the historic Smithfield area. There are also plans for the Liberties, the Coombe, Kilmainham, Inchicore and, of course, the rebuilding of Ballymun, which is the biggest house building project in the history of the State involving over 2,000 new houses. That represents real local government reform. Lest it appear that nothing at all has been happening, the measures contained in the<i> Towards Better Local Government</i> document which was issued some time ago are being implemented on an incremental basis. I pay tribute to the previous Minister for the work he did in that regard.</P>
    <P>Dublin Corporation has set up its six strategic policy committees which are meeting on a regular basis. We are particularly privileged to have organisations such as An Taisce, the Irish Road Hauliers Association, the Chamber of Commerce and the City Centre Business Association working with us in real partnership on the strategic policy committees. Those bodies have a wealth of wisdom and a depth of expertise which councillors, with the best will in the world, do not have. Deputy Farrelly pointed out rightly that the amount of work councillors are now called upon to do necessitates assistance from other bodies. We will have a much better system of local government when the strategic policy committees are totally up and running after the local government elections.</P>
    <P>In Dublin, we are almost ready to set up area-based committees &ndash; local committees which will result in the delivery of services much closer to the customer. The Finglas ward, which I represent, will be twinned with the Ballymun/Whitehall ward and local area man<Col N="1072" /> agers will be recruited to deliver services at local level. This devolutionary initiative has hit something of a rocky spot on the industrial relations front and that is regrettable. I hope that trade unions and management at national and local level will get together before 11 June to resolve any outstanding difficulties in the interests of local communities and the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, radical initiatives have been taken by the manager and councillors of Dublin Corporation. For example, the first regional office has been set up in Ballymun and officials are delivering services there. Over £1 million is being spent on the building of a dedicated office in Ballyfermot where services will be delivered to the local community by people who are familiar with it and who understand the concept of partnership and subsidiarity. Subsidiarity aims to provide services as close as possible to the consumer at the most effective level. I am pleased that a regional office will be opening in my ward in the next two months. I pay tribute to Mr. Dave Kenny and his staff for the work they have being doing in recent months. They are working out of the boots of their cars morning, noon and night. In the past week alone, five meetings have been held to discuss local issues with local people. That is what local government reform is all about.</P>
    <P>One could be led to believe from listening to Deputy Gilmore's earlier comments that he had never been near a Department. As I recall, he was a Minister of State in the previous Government. He came up through the local government system and had an opportunity to make a significant input but I cannot recall any radical changes occurring during his tenure in office.</P>
    <P>It is easy to complain about what is not happening. Deputy Gilmore complained about the vocational education committees. Indeed, many stones have been thrown at vocational education committees over the years. I am a current member of a VEC and was privileged to be Chairman of the City of Dublin VEC for a number of years. I found that educational interests were pre-eminent across all parties. There is parent representation on the committee since 1991 and students have been represented since the establishment of the Dublin Institute of Technology some 20 years ago.</P>
    <P>It is important to copperfasten those principles. They are probably pinned down in the Education Act, 1998, in any event. I would be disappointed if the principle of partnership which is key to that Act is not carried through in the setting up of the vocational education committees. I believe the difficulty will arise in deciding whether one needs one VEC for the entire Dublin area or separate ones for each local authority area. I am open to suggestions in that regard. I am not certain we should be setting up additional bureaucracies when the view of the previous and current Ministers is that we could benefit from some rationalisation of the VEC structure.</P>
    <P>It is easy to overlook the role played by the regional authorities. I am a member of the Dublin <Col N="1073" /> Regional Authority, a very small organisation staffed by three or four people who engage other contract staff. When it comes to preparing position papers it is second to none. It can take much of the credit for the origination of thinking on the strategic planning guidelines which have recently become part of Government policy and which were launched recently by the Minister, Deputy Dempsey.</P>
    <P>Highlighting the needs of parts of the Dublin region in the context of regionalisation has largely been done by officials of the regional authority and its members. This is a matter of real reform and the proof of the pudding is in the eating. We have made a fair degree of progress and can be proud of what we have done.</P>
    <P>I understand why it was decided not to cap expenditure. I would have been happy if a cap were imposed, but the Minister put forward practical and good reasons as to why it was not possible. I hope a mechanism will be developed following this first experience to limit in some way the amount of expenditure. Deputy Hayes mentioned that in the Dublin area canvassing has been going on apace for the past number of months. How will the expenditure incurred in this context be reflected in returns? I do not want officials of local authorities or the Public Offices Commission endlessly and needlessly tied up examining every return of every candidate, even those who only receive 100 votes. However, in the long-term it would be preferable if there was a limitation on expenditure.</P>
    <P>Electronic voting has been mentioned. We are at the leading edge of technology and it is time we examined electronic voting. Perhaps the sentimentalists amongst us might ask what will happen the tally men and women and how many radio and television presenters will be made redundant, but we should try to develop a system whereby electronic voting becomes the norm.</P>
    <P>It is wise that after 2004 the dual mandate will be ended. However, in the meantime it is important that the local government and national legislative systems are not seen to be crossing over as at present. In many cases Members spend an inordinate amount of time on issues germane to local authorities and do not have enough time to devote to legislation &ndash; I have probably fallen into that trap. The establishment of Comhairle by the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs and the provision of a legislative base for the network of citizens advice centres throughout the country is a good initiative. Citizens need to be able to call to offices where they can have their concerns mediated, rather than always having to call councillors or Deputies to advance their entitlements. The question of a dual mandate should be clarified by 2004.</P>
    <P>The direct election of chairs of local authorities, mayors and lord mayors would directly engage the citizens of a local authority area in a meaningful way. There are difficulties with regard to who might be eligible for election. I would have no problem if, as somebody said to me, Mr. <Col N="1074" /> Brendan O'Carroll decided to run and was elected lord mayor. I would see nothing particularly wrong with this or with the election of anybody else. The principle of allowing the electorate of a region to elect their chairperson or mayor is good.</P>
    <P>An important issue in the Dublin area relates to the boundary between the city and local authority areas. There has never been a satisfactory clarification of the relationship between, for example, Dublin Corporation and Fingal County Council. There is ongoing interaction between both authorities on landfill sites, for example. Dunsink tiphead is in my area for all intents and purposes but is in the administrative area of Fingal County Council. It proved enormously difficult to have any real input into how it might develop and be wound down. It was only with the intervention of the European Commission that the issue was finally settled.</P>
    <P>The interests of the Finglas community will be very germane to how the Dunsink regional park, as it may be, is developed. I pay tribute to the Fingal county manager and some of his officials who are very open to the notion of discussions with people from Finglas about facilities as basic as football pitches, bowling greens, land for pony and horse clubs, etc. However, a formalised mechanism is necessary. While some Members might not agree, my view has always been that the M50 ought to form the northern boundary of the Dublin Corporation and Fingal County Council areas. The matter should be revisited.</P>
    <P>The power to make by-laws which are enforceable in terms of the reform of local government has concerned members of Dublin Corporation and others. The Department of the Environment and Local Government must examine how the by-laws interface with local government legislation in general. Dublin Corporation is in the process of introducing by-laws to prohibit drinking in public places. Similar by-laws have been introduced by local authorities in Cobh and Cork and they are common in different areas in Northern Ireland. However, we are not at all certain how enforceable these by-laws will be. The by-laws implementing the Control of Horses Act, which was passed by the House &ndash; I commend the members of the previous Government who brought the legislation into force &ndash; are proving difficult and need to be tightened. The same can be said about by-laws concerning the control of dogs legislation.</P>
    <P>For good reasons area based partnerships and drug task forces were set up in areas of high unemployment and with high levels of drug abuse throughout the country.There were probably good reasons for doing it at the time, but there seems to be a difficulty in allowing local authority members or any elected members to be participants. It is not uniform. Some of the partnerships in the Dublin area have recently asked that councillors be represented on their boards. One asked for six, another asked for three. There is no uniformity and that needs to be addressed. Dublin <Col N="1075" /> Corporation asked that the partnerships be represented on one of its strategic policy committees. We are still waiting for representation.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on introducing the Bill, which is a good first step. I understand why this line is being taken and look forward to its successful implementation.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Leas-Cheann Comhairle would be kind enough to interrupt me at that stage, that is if we have time to finish our speeches without some cataclysmic or climactic development, such as the sky falling in. The Pope is this afternoon meeting the leader of the Ulster Unionist Party, who is an Orangeman, and the two are being brought together by the former General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Mr. Gorbachev. Such a development should at least be marked by something like the sky falling in.</P>
      <P>In my first election in this State, in a comment I made which received some publicity at the time, I referred to the cynicism I encountered on the doorsteps of Dublin West about politicians and the political process. I said this cynicism was more dangerous to our political institutions than were the efforts of the Provisional IRA using the bomb and the bullet to political institutions in the North. Some people thought I exaggerated the amount of cynicism I described and I wondered when the electorate complained to me if they were exaggerating their fears and misgivings. Almost ten years later, it turns out they underestimated what was happening as far as politicians, business people, the Church, the legal profession and almost every stratum of society were concerned. What will be next? Will it be journalism? In what other section of society will exposures take place? I sometimes quote the Frenchman, De'Lambert, who said political office is like a high mountain, only eagles and reptiles reach the top. I disagree fundamentally with that quotation, as most sensible people would, but I understand what he means and I understand the increasing cynicism among the electorate. We must do our best to diminish that and restore the confidence of the public not only in politics but in other bastions of society. We must make people believe there is a basic integrity in public life.</P>
      <P>I oppose the dual mandate, and it ought to be abolished. Deputy Haughey misquoted Deputy Hayes when he alleged he said it would be unconstitutional and that he was against the abolition of the dual mandate for that reason. Deputy Hayes did not say that. He questioned whether it would be constitutional and that is as far as he went.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>He questioned if it might be unconstitutional and that is as far as he went. I checked that with him since he made his speech. Being a member of a local authority is a full-time job for many councillors. I sometimes wonder how they survive and raise families without being paid and only receive a councillor's expenses. I am in favour of paying councillors. I want it to be a full-time job where required. That is the case in Dublin and councillors there ought to be paid for doing that full-time job. Some councillors seem more interested in national than local affairs. There is no doubt there are some who, the moment they are elected to a council, see the magic letters &ldquo;TD&rdquo; after their names. Some of them neglect the job they were elected to do and to fulfil the ordinary functions of a councillor because of their pursuit of national issues. They are aiming at other things and should not be allowed do that.</P>
      <P>Even in the ten years I have lived in Dublin, there has been a dramatic expansion in the work of councillors. In my constituency developments have taken place around Lucan and in Dublin 15, the greater Blanchardstown area, with thousands of houses built, traffic jams every morning, colossal litter in some areas and other ancillary problems. I have been told there has been more housing development in my constituency than in any other part of the European Union. Most of my constituents would believe that as they try to leave their housing estates in the morning and to return in the evening, These developments have placed tremendous additional responsibilities on councillors. They should be paid for doing a full-time job.</P>
      <P>There should be a cap on expenditure for local government elections. It is illogical that there is a cap on Dáil and European elections but not on local elections. Corruption is more likely in local government than in Dáil or European elections. The incentives and opportunities exist at that level which are not open to Members of the House. A planning decision can mean millions of pounds and that amount of money relies on the votes of councillors and-or the recommendations of council officials. The challenge is obvious. It is illogical to say we are concerned about these matters and not impose a cap on expenditure in local government elections. In many instances colossal amounts of money are being spent to get people elected to councils. It is being spent not only during the election campaign but between elections. For example, An Post is paid to deliver expensive glossy literature while professional firms are engaged to drop leaflets. In addition, there is expensive advertising in so called free newspapers. God only knows what else goes on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fought my first election in 1989. According to evidence submitted to the planning tribunal, at <Col N="1077" /> least £30,000 was handed over to one individual allegedly for the purposes of fighting an election. The person concerned admitted in this House that this was just one of the donations that was received. At the time I spent £3,000 to £4,000, which I thought amounted to a fortune. What is being spent on elections now? It must be capped.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that some councillors are in too close a relationship with developers. Given the smaller number of electors involved in council elections, the expenditure of large sums of money has an inordinate effect on the election outcome. This must be watched very carefully. Expenditure should be capped.</P>
    <P>Unequal expenditure undermines democracy. It is unfair if one candidate has apparently unlimited resources while another is an ordinary working class man who has no such resources. Candidates for election are supposed to start on an equal footing with regard to this aspect. Otherwise there is an abuse of democracy and a possible undermining of the democratic process.</P>
    <P>I do not accept the reasons outlined by the Minister for not having a cap on expenditure. It appears a decision was taken not to have a cap and subsequent attempts were made to excuse and justify this. References to expenditure and other matters are excuses. We are told about the great trouble, inconvenience and expenditure that would result from a cap on expenditure in local government elections. However, there is great trouble, inconvenience and expenditure in democracy and in running elections. If that is the logic of the Government's argument why not abolish elections and save money? I will return to this subject later and I will vote in favour of a cap on expenditure.</P>

        <b>:</b> Táim buíoch den Teachta Currie. It is not good enough that this Bill is presented at the eleventh hour relative to the holding of the local elections on 11 June. There has been not one, but two postponements of these elections. It is eight years since the people had the opportunity to pass judgment on the councillors they elected in 1991 or replace them with new councillors who, on many issues, might be more sensitive to their wishes.</P>
      <P>There has been blatant, undemocratic manoeuvring about the holding of local elections and I have no doubt the postponement of these elections under cover of the reform of local government was done to save councillors who had acted blatantly against promises they made in the 1991 elections from the wrath of the electorate. This was most notoriously in evidence in the Dublin area over the introduction of water charges.</P>
      <P>The introduction of the Bill a few weeks before the holding of elections amounts to a dereliction of duty by the Government. It suggests that the Government is not taking local government in all its aspects seriously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1078" /> The failure of the Bill to specify a control on the amounts that can be spent by candidates is a major anomaly. It cannot be defended by the Government and is especially inexplicable in view of the controversies that have engulfed local government, especially in view of the recent controversies and allegations of corruption in local government planning, especially with regard to the rezoning of land.</P>
    <P>Decisions by elected members of local government have made millionaires of many people. Some of us who fought against the tide of never ending and unjustified rezonings and who had deep suspicions that money was passed under the counter to secure the votes to rezone find it incomprehensible that people can effectively buy their way into local government through the forthcoming elections.</P>
    <P>In 1991 I watched as a candidate for the local elections in the Dublin-West constituency spent at least £30,000. The electorate had the good sense to reject the candidate. However, one can see the possibilities in such a system. It must be rectified.</P>
    <P>I would have been happy if, at the eleventh hour, the Government had utilised the Bill to rectify a number of issues relating to local government. Some have been alluded to by speakers. The way local government deals with its present and future workers must be looked at. For example, some 150 wardens have been treated shamefully by Dublin Corporation and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Following agreement with their union that they would transfer from the Department to the corporation they have been told that the corporation only wants 30 wardens.</P>

Only 30 have been taken on as traffic wardens after interview while the remainder were told that jobs would be invented for them in Dublin Corporation. This disdainful treatment should not be allowed by local authorities. It is shameful and scandalous. An opportunity to implement an imaginative solution to Dublin's traffic problem has been lost. On the question of expenditure controls, I was astounded to hear a previous speaker blaming councillors who opposed unjustified land rezonings for the housing crisis when it is speculators who are to blame. Those same speculators will be further facilitated by the failure of the Government to include controls on the amount of money spent by people standing for the local elections. Those speculators can finance candidates or seek election themselves to secure decisions at the local authority by which they can amass riches.</P>

      <Quest>the reason for the delay in informing 6,000 women who were tested under the hepatitis C national screening programme that the anti-D they received was partially infected; and the arrangements being made for them to be re-tested.</Quest>
      <QRef>[10659/99]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I established an expert group in September 1997 to make recommendations to me on the clinical and non-clinical management of women who received anti-D which was infected or potentially infected with hepatitis C, but who tested negative for the virus.</P>
      <P>As a result of the deliberations of the expert group the following priority groups were identified as requiring further review: those women who tested ELISA negative but who reported a history of jaundice within six months of the administration of anti-D; and those women who tested ELISA positive but negative on a confirmatory RIBA test. The women in these categories have been referred to their general practitioner, offered further testing and referred to one of the designated hepatology units for any necessary follow up.</P>
      <P>A further group involves women who received infected or potentially infected anti-D in 1977-78 or between 1999 and 1994 but who have not come forward for testing. Women who have not been tested and may have been exposed to infected or potentially product remain a priority group. A further national campaign was initiated by the Blood Transfusion Service Board in October 1998. The optional screening programme for those who have not come forward remains in place and I have ensured that sufficient resources are available for this purpose.</P>
      <P>The remaining group of women are those who tested ELISA negative and received either infected or potentially infected product. The level of infection was on average 25 per cent in product manufactured in 1977 and 1978. Product manufactured between 1991 and 1994 was less than 1 per cent infectious. The BTSB has carried out an extensive cross-matching exercise between those women who were identified from available anti-D cards and from checks of hospital patient records as having received infected or potentially infected anti-D and those women who tested ELISA negative under the national screening programme. As a result of this exercise over 5,500 women have been identified. The current position is that any woman who wishes to be advised of available information on the serological status of the anti-D they received may do so by contacting the BTSB.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following careful consideration of the complex <Col N="1080" /> medical, legal and ethical issues involved, the group decided that these women should be directly informed by way of consultation with their general practitioner. The purpose of the consultation is to inform the person that they received an infected or potentially infected anti-D, to re-confirm that the patient is serologically negative for hepatitis C using the ELISA test and to reassure the patient that she is not currently infected. Repeat testing will be available as a precaution, if the person so wishes, although expert medical opinion is that there will be no change in their serological status.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, given the numbers of women involved there is considerable preparatory work necessary in advance of the commencement of this programme. This work involves the completion of the text of the scientific and medical documentation for the information of general practitioners, ensuring accurate linkage of recipient names to their individual general practitioner and having in place the necessary support services, including counselling if required. As soon as these arrangements are finalised, the programme will be launched. I am sure the Deputy will agree it is important that the programme is organised and managed in an efficient and effective manner in the best interests of the women concerned and avoids any unnecessary anxiety.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of the 5,500 women to whom the Minister referred, was it not known at the time they were tested that they had been given a batch which was potentially infected? Consequently, why would they not have been informed of this fact at the earliest possible opportunity, which was then?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>What was known at the time was that far more potentially infectious product or vials of product had been given out than was reflected in terms of those who came back in for testing. In other words, before one could inform people on an individual basis the cross-matching, which I addressed in my reply, had to be carried out. The board had to be able to get the list of those who tested ELISA negative, then find out from the anti-D cards which batches they received and then cross-match those with the persons concerned who tested ELISA negative. That is a long, tortuous process because of the lack of good data in many circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The priority group remains those who received product but who have not come forward for testing. There were two other smaller groups, as I mentioned earlier. Those women who tested ELISA negative but who reported a history of jaundice within six months of the administration of anti-D have to be contacted. It is a much smaller group &ndash; I think there are 32 cases. The number of women who tested Elisa positive but negative on a confirmatory RIBA test was 68. The first category is far larger. The number of <Col N="1081" /> vials concerned would indicate that it is an ongoing process.</P>
    <P>People have a right to be informed on the basis that an analysis of the legal authorities examined in the report of the expert group looking at this matter suggests that, when an individual receives either medical treatment or a medical product from either a doctor, a hospital or a manufacturer, and where that initial treatment poses a subsequent danger which was previously unknown but now is known or merely identified, the individual is owed a duty of care to be informed of that risk, even where that risk is theoretical, minimal, distinct or remote.</P>
    <P>We want to make sure we launch a campaign with all the necessary components in place to avoid any unnecessary anxiety. To be called back and given this particular information will obviously cause some anxiety to people but, as I said, the medical evidence suggests that the serological status of the people concerned is not likely to change. As I understand it, there will be no change.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that. Is it not the case that many of these women were tested as far back as 1994? Why has it taken five years to realise that the duty of care was to provide these women with information which should have been made available at the earliest possible opportunity? I do not see how this position could have been adopted by those advising the BTSB or, indeed, the Minister.</P>
      <P>Did the cross-matching exercise unearth information other than that women, who already had been tested negative, had received potentially infected product? If so, what action has been taken on that? What steps is the Minister putting in place to trace the 13,000 women who have received potentially infected product but who have not yet reported for testing?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last point, continuing efforts are being made by the BTSB through the targeted look-back programme and the optional screening programme to try to identify those people and to have them come forward for testing. Those efforts are continuous. It is a priority group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the notification being given now rather than then, apart from the work which had to be done on the cross-matching of individual cases it is important to point out that the result of the initial testing in 1994 was Elisa negative. On foot of these results, the woman's GP was notified of a hepatitis C anti-body negative result, which is in line with international practice. As this cohort of women were negative for hepatitis C they were not a priority group for the BTSB which was concentrating on identifying and tracing persons who had not come forward for testing. When the BTSB had addressed the priority groups it was in a position to intensify the extensive cross-matching exercise which was necessary to identify those who had definitely received an infected or poten<Col N="1082" /> tially infected product and who had tested ELISA negative.</P>
    <P>I set up the expert group in September 1997 with the specific brief of deciding whether this cohort required further follow-up. In the course of its deliberations the expert group examined and made recommendations in relation to other groups which it considered to have higher priority, to which I referred. It was necessary for the group to examine the legal and ethical issues involved in informing the cohort they had received an infected or potentially infected product. Having decided the women should be informed the group must consider how best to do this and what the protocol should be in relation to the clinical management of this cohort. Those are the reasons this issue has arisen now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am puzzled that 6,000 women have tested negative and 13,000 have not yet been tested. It seems the tracing programme has not been a great success. Does that concern the Minister?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not possible to say how many women will eventually be found to have received infected product and are ELISA negative. However, it is known that 4,062 infectious or potentially infectious vials of anti-D were manufactured and issued in 1977-8 and a further 17,545 such vials were manufactured and issued in 1991-4, giving a total of 21,607 infectious or potentially infectious vials of anti-D which were manufactured and issued. Of the 1991-4 vials, 1,208 were returned to the BTSB leaving 20,399 vials with varying levels of infection.</P>
      <P>There will be a significant number of cases where, due to lack of hospital records and the non-return of anti-D cards to the BTSB, it will not be possible to confirm whether an individual did or did not receive infectious or potentially infectious anti-D. Accordingly, the documentation issued to the GPs as part of this programme will contain advice on how to treat any women who, although not identified in this programme, are worried about their position and require information. Once this programme has been completed it is intended to notify all GPs of the protocol in dealing with any women who are concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Each subspeciality in pathology operates to its own professional standards and <Col N="1083" /> guidelines. For example, the Irish Association of Clinical Cytology has produced guidelines for cytology testing which are available to all pathology laboratories. Laboratories are staffed by qualified personnel and ultimate responsibility for the quality of the work lies with the consultant pathologist. Quality control procedures currently in place include primary screening by trained cytotechnicians, rapid rescreening of all smears by another cytotechnician and double screening of abnormal screens.</P>
      <P>Ireland, in common with most other EU member states, is currently developing a formal laboratory accreditation scheme in consultation with the relevant professional interests. I understand that only the UK and Holland have such schemes at the moment. My Department proposed on 9 March last a number of accreditation models to the joint working group involved and has requested a response to the proposals as a matter of urgency.</P>
      <P>When health boards enter into contracts with third parties it is a matter for the health board to satisfy itself regarding the services to be provided. In this case the North-Western Health Board contracted the private laboratory in 1997 to read a backlog of 2,115 smears on the basis that the laboratory would adhere to accepted clinical practice. The health board was assured that quality control practices such as primary screening of all smears, rapid rescreen of smears and review of abnormal smears above borderline by a consultant pathologist would be adhered to.</P>
      <P>The possibility of a problem was identified by the North-Western Health Board during its routine quality control process. The board is carrying out its own investigation into what happened and has not ruled out legal action against the laboratory involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Why has it taken since 1996, when the joint working group submitted its report to the Department, until 9 March this year for the Department to put forward models for an accreditation system and to look for an urgent response? It seems anomalous that there is such a different attitude now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister about two aspects of the North-Western Health Board experience and his response. He said that in terms of controls a pathologist must review tests which show any abnormalities. In the instances where a technician was working outside her normal working hours and doing this privately, will the Minister assure the House that any tests which should have been referred to a pathologist were referred? Will he also reassure us that, where a consultant pathologist reviewed those smears, public facilities were not used by her or him to support a private laboratory which was being paid for by a health board? Will the Minister make that commitment? The understanding is that the procedures were correct in so far as the checks and balances required by the Department <Col N="1084" /> were in place. The question is how those checks and balances were applied. Were public facilities in a public hospital used?</P>
    <P>The Minister has carried out a review of the smear tests which were conducted and has gone one step further in relation to the 5,000 smears in St. Vincent's Hospital and the Bons Secours. Has he found a laboratory willing to undertake those tests? Is he ensuring a control is included in the review so we know for definite that there were inaccuracies and mistakes were made, other than the normal inaccuracies which exist? We all understand that this form of screening is inexact in its nature. We need to know if there have been inaccuracies over and above the normal margin of error. Has the Minister put a control system in place so we can assess the true nature of what has happened?</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>That process is ongoing. Reviews of smear test results are being undertaken as a result of the instructions which have been given to the various institutions where we believe it is prudent that that should be done as a precautionary measure.</P>

      <P>In the same way as Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, and Beaumont Hospital have been asked to carry out reviews, those reviews will be carried out. The same instructions have been given as regards the 5,000 smears.</P>
      <P>We are currently developing a formal laboratory accreditation scheme in consultation with the relevant professional interests. It is because of the need for this consultation that we have not yet reached agreement on those issues despite the fact that we suggested accreditation models last March, which predated this issue entering the public domain. The idea that no proactive action is being taken on accreditation does not stand up to scrutiny. Work on this matter is ongoing.</P>
      <P>The relevant professional interests concerned are clinical pathologists, medical laboratory technicians and biochemists. They are represented by a joint working group comprising of representatives from the Faculty of Pathology, the Academy of Medical Laboratory Science and the Association of Clinical Biochemists. The objective of these discussions is to develop and implement a formal accreditation system for pathology laboratories.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards consultant pathologists looking at borderline smear tests, I understand that was the case. There are legal issues involved in exactly how that happened and there are disputed versions of events by individuals, which must be <Col N="1085" /> resolved by the employer concerned before a final report can come on that matter.</P>

      <P>On accreditation, I accept that 9 March predates this information about the North Western Health Board coming into the public domain. However, can the Minister state it predates any information coming to anybody in his Department?</P>
      <P>I am intrigued there are legal problems relating to this because nobody has heard of it before. Is the Minister saying he cannot assure us that public facilities were not used to, in effect, make profit for a private laboratory?</P>

      <P>The facts in relation to the circumstances regarding the involvement of people in this issue are disputed by the parties concerned and must be resolved. In regard to accreditation, the consultation with the professional interests also predates 9 March, which was the date when accreditation models were suggested to them as a result of a great deal of ongoing discussions to see if we could bring this matter to a conclusion.</P>
      <P>In regard to the information being made available to the Department, the Department would have been informed about the quality review proceedings which went on in the North Western Health Board and that 2,115 smears would have to be re-examined. The question of what to do about it did not arise until that was assessed by an independent laboratory in Glasgow &ndash; as the Deputy said, it is an inexact science.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware from a number of questions I have answered in the House about this drug in the past, the Irish Medicines Board, which has statutory responsibility in this area, carried out a full review of the safety and efficacy of this product as part of the assessment of the renewal of the product authorisation in 1998 and as a result of new safety information regarding the development of neuropsychiatric reactions, including depression, suicide and suicide ideation.</P>
      <P>As a result of this review, the board required that the summary of product characteristics in relation to the product be amended to reflect the new information which had become available. In particular, the revised warnings approved by the board for inclusion in the prescribing data and patient information leaflets included the following:</P>
      <P>Special Warnings and Special Precautions for Use:</P>
      <P>Roaccutane may cause depression, psychotic symptoms and rarely suicide attempts and suicide. Discontinuance of Roaccutane may be insufficient and further evaluation may be necessary. Particular care needs to be taken in patients with a history of depression and all patients should be monitored for signs of depression and referred for appropriate treatment if necessary.</P>
      <P>Undesirable Effects:</P>
      <P>Depression, psychotic symptoms and rarely suicide have been reported with Roaccutane.</P>
      <P>A letter, approved by the board, drawing attention to the possible development of depression and suicide was issued by the company to physicians in May 1998. In addition, the Irish Medicines Board drug safety newsletter of September 1998, which is distributed to doctors, dentists and pharmacists, also contained details of the revised warnings.</P>
      <P>I would stress that it is a condition of the product authorisation that availability of this drug is subject to its prescription and monitoring of its use by a consultant dermatologist. While I would emphasise to patients that they should read carefully the patient information leaflet supplied with the drug and consult with their physicians concerning any problems or difficulties that may arise in the course of its use, there is also a responsibility on physicians prescribing the drug to ensure that their patients are fully advised as to the possible side effects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the second part of the question, there is a legal responsibility on the company, as a condition of its product authorisation, that it <Col N="1087" /> keep a record of reports of adverse effects associated with the use of the product and that it furnish the board with copies of any such reports of which it has a record or of which it is aware. A further condition of the authorisation requires that the company should inform the board of any information received by it which might alter the validity of the data provided in support of the authorisation or which would further the understanding of the substance or its effects or may alter the directions for the use of the product.</P>
    <P>I am advised by the Irish Medicines Board that it currently understands that all information on Roaccutane, required under the conditions applicable to its product authorisation, has been made available to the board by the company. At the same time, the board has had ongoing discussions with the company regarding its pharmacovigilance responsibilities, i.e. the monitoring and reporting of adverse reactions, and it is continuing to monitor the functioning of the company's pharmacovigilance unit.</P>
    <P>I want to stress that the board continues to monitor the safety of the use of Roaccutane and, to this end, it has asked the company to undertake a surveillance programme to monitor the use of the product in Ireland. Details of this surveillance programme are currently being finalised between the board and the company. The board is also aware of ongoing epidemiological research into the safety of Roaccutane. The results of these programmes and studies will be fully evaluated when available and the board, in line with its statutory responsibilities, will take whatever action may be deemed necessary in relation to this product.</P>

How did this new information come to light about the potential side effects, which were not known to the board at an earlier stage?

      <P>The Irish Medicines Board conducted a full review of the efficacy and safety of this product, as it would other products in the normal course. Revised warnings were approved by the board for inclusion in the prescribing data, as I outlined, as a result of that review. I presume that relates to the product itself and what, if any, adverse reactions and symptoms were emanating from its use.

Can the public be satisfied that everything was done with the best probity on all sides?</P>

      <P>The Irish Medicines Board is very much aware of the situation and has taken all prudent steps to inform the public about the product, which is a vitamin A derivative used in the treatment of acne. It is authorised by the Irish Medicines Board for the treatment of severe acne unresponsive to other treatments. Its availability is limited, in that it must be prescribed and its use monitored by a specialist dermatologist. My reply also points out that physicians have the responsibility to inform patients of any possible side effects that might occur.</P>
      <P>It is also clear from my reply that the Irish Medicines Board, as the regulatory authority, is satisfied that the requirements and the conditions of the product authorisation are being met by the manufacturer. Having said that, it is conducting a surveillance programme, the results of which are being finalised at present. It appears to me, on the face of it, that the Irish Medicines Board is meeting its statutory responsibilities in this matter and seeking to point out the specific circumstances in which this product is available and the conditions under which it should be prescribed and used.</P>

      <P>The advice given by the Department of Health and Children is that sunbeds should be used in moderation and that people should seek the advice of their family doctor before doing so for the first time. In certain circumstances, exposure to sunbeds may constitute a hazard. Sunbeds should not be used by children under 18 years of age, persons who burn easily or tan poorly, those taking drugs or cosmetics thought to be photoactive, those suffering from skin disorders induced or aggravated by exposure to sunlight, those with a history of skin cancer and those with risk factors for cutaneous melanoma. A consumer information sheet on possible risks from tanning equipment and the appropriate precautions to take is available to the public from the Irish Cancer Society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sunbeds are widely used in beauty salons by beauty therapists who offer cosmetic tanning as part of their services. Guidelines on the use of sunbeds in beauty salons were drawn up by the <Col N="1089" /> Society of Applied Cosmetology which represents beauty therapists. These guidelines incorporate advice from the Irish Medical Organisation and the Irish Cancer Society on appropriate precautions to be taken by sunbed operators to protect the health of clients.</P>

Does the Minister consider it appropriate to introduce the licensing of personnel to ensure people are familiar with the guidelines from the Irish Cancer Society and the operation of such equipment so that consumers, who may not have an opportunity to read the guidelines, do not have to make their own decisions?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Deputy is referring to a section of An Action Programme for the Millennium which refers specifically to people with disabilities. As set out in the programme, the Government is committed to ensuring the needs and aspirations of people with disabilities, their families, carers and advocates are comprehensively addressed.</P>
      <P>The health agencies with which people with disabilities would have most contact are the health boards. To ensure the smooth planning and delivery of services and to provide a clear channel of communication with the various bodies representing people with disabilities, co-ordinating committees for mental handicap services and for physical and sensory disability services have been established in each health board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Within the mental handicap services, the regional co-ordinating committee structure has greatly assisted the planned development and management of the services. The role of the co-ordinating committees, which are representative <Col N="1090" /> of health boards, voluntary service providers and parents and families of persons with a mental handicap, is to agree a plan for the development of services in each region, to identify priority needs and to co-ordinate the delivery of services, including new services, as resources are made available.</P>
    <P>The report of the Review Group on Health and Personal Social Services for People with Physical and Sensory Disabilities, Towards an Independent Future, was published in December 1996. This report recommends the establishment of co-ordinating committees for physical and sensory disability services. These committees have basically the same functions and aims with regard to the development of services in this sector as those for the mental handicap services. My Department has commenced a review of the operation of these committees which are relatively new. This review should be completed in the next month.</P>
    <P>The other major health agency dealing with people with disabilities is the National Rehabilitation Board. As the Deputy is aware, the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs is currently engaged in implementing the report of the establishment group of the National Disability Authority, as agreed by the Government in July last year. The report gives effect to a number of recommendations put forward by various expert groups and qualified commentators in recent years, not least the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities. The guiding principles of the establishment group are those set out in the Commission's report, namely, equality, maximising participation and enabling independence and choice through a social model of disability.</P>
    <P>If the Deputy is aware of any specific instances of unnecessary bureaucracy in relation to the delivery of those services, I will be pleased to have them examined if the relevant details are supplied to me.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his response which dealt with the structural arrangements in relation to the planning and delivery of services from the point of view of the service providers.</P>
      <P>Do the co-ordinating committees exist and are they operational in all health boards? Can the Minister guarantee people with disabilities that there will be a limit on the waiting or recall times for occupational therapists and for the receipt of a disabled person's grant, for example? We must remember that people with disabilities use the health agencies in the same way as the rest of us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is the Minister aware of a disturbing report by the INOU about the difficulties experienced by the long-term unemployed, who want to come back into the workforce, in accessing accurate information about their medical card entitlements? Surveys have shown that people are not getting accurate information not to mention their medical cards. Guidelines were drawn up by the Department of Health and Children, but are they <Col N="1091" /> being followed by the chief executive officers and staff in all health boards? They affect everyone, including people with disabilities. This is a disturbing issue. While we understand there are staff shortages, we cannot understand health board staff giving out inaccurate information.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree there is no reason for any health board or agency to give out inaccurate information. I am not aware of it being an endemic problem. People are usually well informed of their entitlements and how to access them, particularly through the community welfare officer scheme. The reply does not fully answer the Deputy's question about the standardisation of documentation, the need to computerise our services and improve the interface between people and the health boards. Much work needs to be done in this area.</P>
      <P>We have a devolved system of health administration in that we have given the operational responsibility for the health services to the regions. There are varying degrees of success in the administration of one programme in a health board area compared to another. That seems to indicate that best practice models are not used consistently and uniformly throughout the health system. I am not aware of any problems in the disabled person's grant scheme in the Midland Health Board, yet I have met Deputies who claim there are delays in other health boards. This is sometimes due to the personnel concerned and the fact that operational issues, such as the visit of an occupational therapist, may not be as proactive in one health board area as compared to others.</P>
      <P>I am contemplating the need to do an audit of all forms, documents and applications. Despite the fact that all health boards implement the same schemes, they probably have different formats and levels of information on application forms. We should try to address that issue as it would reduce the confusion experienced by public representatives not to mention the public.</P>

My Departmet's priority is to provide mental handicap services and physical handicap services to those who do not have a service. The groups on behalf of disabled persons would have as their priority the need to ensure everyone has a basic service. Subsequent to that one could begin to bring forward individual service plans. We are making progress with the provision of 600 new places between residential, respite and day care services for the mentally handicapped. We are working to a model and planning the services and developments in a less <i>ad hoc</i> fashion than heretofore. Having attended the NAMHI conference at the weekend, I consider that the provision of services to everybody is the top priority. The individual models suggested by the Deputy would become a priority, subject to achieving that basic policy objective.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8, 23, 24, 97 and 98 together.</P>
      <P>I have commissioned an independent consultancy to review the foreign adoption assessment procedures in the eight health boards with the aim of ensuring that an efficient and standardised assessment procedure which accords with best practice in the field operates across the country while at the same time having regard to the priority that must be attached to other areas of the child care services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A draft report was submitted to my Department last month and was referred to the advisory committee established to oversee the consultancy. The advisory committee met to discuss the draft report and subsequently met the consultants. I expect to receive the final report at the end of this month. The report contains detailed descriptive and statistical information such as that sought by Deputy O'Keeffe. I am looking forward to reading the report and examining its <Col N="1094" /> recommendations in detail before commenting further in the matter. I intend making the report widely available.</P>
    <P>In regard to the views of prospective adopters, I understand that the consultants did not advertise for submissions but that a sample of 60 couples whose assessments were completed during 1998 were contacted through the Adoption Board, requesting that they provide their views on the assessment process on an anonymous basis. Interviews were also held with a number of individuals who had adopted a child from abroad and who contacted the researchers on their own initiative. The main stakeholders from whom data were collected by way of interview, questionnaire, etc., included the Adoption Board, the health boards and organisations representing adoptive parents and inter country adopters, birth mothers and adoptees.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the obvious defect in the way in which it conducted its business and did not seek submissions from members of the public who have been affected, will he make arrangements for his Department to advertise for submissions between now and presentation of the final report, so that their views can be properly furnished rather than on the basis of some sampling procedure? Will the Minister give an indication of the length of delays in the different health boards? Is it not the case that the Minister has previously furnished to the House information which suggests there are extremely long delays in the Eastern Health Board, where many of the applications are made? Is it not also the case that parents who are adopting for a second time have to go through the same procedure again with the same lengthy delay? Will the Minister be more forthcoming in his reply and advertise for submissions because many of those people want the Minister to be aware of their concerns?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am fully aware of their concerns and I have had submissions from many people who are dissatisfied with the manner in which they have been treated by health boards. I do not propose to advertise for submissions as that would delay the whole process. We decided to proceed with submissions from a sample of 60 couples whose assessments were completed in 1998. Many other people have submitted their views on the matter. We are fully aware of the difficulties in the Eastern Health Board. Action has been taken to right those difficulties. I am satisfied that the action which will be taken on foot of the report will result in a much improved assessment procedure.</P>
      <P>The timescales for assessment have fallen dramatically. The Eastern Health Board which had a major problem now has a waiting period of nine to 12 months. The Southern Health Board also had a major problem. Extra social workers have been appointed to both health boards as a result of increased funding. The waiting period for adoption assessment is less than 12 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1095" /> I am satisfied we have tackled the problem and are making progress towards ensuring prospective adopters have their assessments carried out in a reasonable period. There is a need for a rigorous assessment of adoption in the context of overall priorities where social work requirements are given priority over adoption.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Entitlement to health services in Ireland is based primarily on means. Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board. Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.</P>
      <P>Income guidelines have been drawn up by the chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these are revised annually in line with the consumer price index. However, these guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that the medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. Medical cards may also be awarded to individual family members on this basis.</P>
      <P>In common with previous Governments, this Administration does not feel it is justifiable on health policy grounds to extend an automatic entitlement to a medical card to any specific group without any reference to their means or, in the case of children, to their parents' means as a general rule. It is open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board for health services if they are unable to provide these services for themselves or their dependants without hardship.</P>
      <P>Those who do not hold medical cards are entitled to a broad range of health services, including an entitlement to public hospital and public consultant treatment, subject only to modest statutory charges and out-patient services free of charge. There are a number of schemes which provide assistance towards the cost of medication.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a pity that the Minister tends to go back in history. I am aware that this was not done by previous Governments. Does the Minister agree that we have reached a point where we should look more closely at the needs of people with chronic illnesses, such as arthritis, <Col N="1096" /> diabetes and asthma? Although there are difficulties regarding the definition of asthma, there is a problem where some people who suffer from chronic asthma do not qualify for a medical card.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister agree there is a need to consider the general medical scheme in terms of investing more money to keep people out of hospital? I welcome the improvement in relation to people over the age of 70 because it recognises the fact that some people in society have greater needs and must be judged differently. For example, diabetes is recognised as a long-term illness and people are placed on a long-term illness book. Supports are already in place and, therefore, the principle does not have to be conceded.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to consider whether it is possible to continue to extend the encompassing nature of the GMS or the long-term illness scheme. I would settle for that in certain circumstances. Such changes would mean that more people with chronic illnesses are included. I am sure the Minister is aware that some people are badly affected by the demands placed on them, such as the need to visit a doctor, and occasionally individuals end up in hospital unnecessarily as a result. It makes good sense financially and in terms of managing long waiting lists because if a person can get free hospital care, it does not matter if he or she is waiting three or four years to access it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>This policy issue has confronted successive Ministers for Health and arguments have been put forward. We are all aware of cases where we consider that, although a person may be over the income guidelines, he or she should have a medical card, even for a short time such as three or six months. It behoves public representatives to challenge the public administration system, which in some instances hides behind guidelines as if they were axiomatic rules. Chief executive officers have discretion to take into account personal circumstances. However, it appears that some chief executive officers use that discretion with a greater sense of good judgment than others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This discretion was put in place for a good reason. While the criterion of means is maintained on equity grounds as a prerequisite for eligibility, discretion is available to cover individual family circumstances. Taking all matters into account, it should be possible for discretion to be <Col N="1097" /> used positively. Health board members and public representatives should discuss this issue with administrators to a much greater extent. From an administrative point of view, it is much easier to use the guidelines as the rule in all circumstances. However, it is not a conscientious exercise of the guidelines as set out.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also referred to the elderly. I was glad to be in a position to ensure that the eligibility limits will be doubled over this and the next two budgets. This move was justified and it was a good proposal. However, it did not negate the basic principles of the scheme. The decision was to double the eligibility limits rather than move towards automatic entitlement because questions of inequity could arise. Elderly people with means should not be automatically entitled to a medical card when there are many people who are under 65 and slightly over the limits who are not automatically entitled to a card.</P>
    <P>One can make cases for specific groups and one would have sympathy with many of the arguments. However, more has been done in this area by this Administration than any other Government. This matter is ongoing and the arguments will be raised when I am in Opposition and there is a different Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a chronic condition and the scheme is a form of medical cover under the GMS. It was the subject of Deputy McManus's supplementary question but it was not addressed by the Minister. I have been in politics for almost 20 years and I cannot understand that position. It has been said that memory is an affliction in politics. However, I remember a health commission report published by the Department in 1984 which recommended that such changes should be made. It recognised that some treatments prevented the need for some people to be institutionalised and that they should be made available on the basis of the condition. I do not understand why, in common with his predecessors, the Minister and the Department are unwilling to take that on board. Alzheimer's disease is only one of many examples where drug treatment avoids the need for other forms of care and should be made available.</P>

Once an improvement is made, it is somebody's job to suggest other possible improvements. These policy matters can be reviewed from time to time and I am prepared to consider whether it is possible, in the context of constantly changing priorities, to make adjustments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Policy on developing a national medical genetics service was set down in the 1990 report of a committee which had been established for that purpose. The report recommended the establishment of a medical genetics centre in Dublin in a paediatric environment and made suggestions for further developments in this field.</P>
      <P>In line with this recommendation a national medical genetics centre was established in 1993 on the campus of Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin, and has continued to be developed to date. Considerable capital and revenue expenditure has been invested in the centre and a second consultant appointment was recently made in recognition of the central role which the centre plays, and will continue to play, in the practice of medicine.</P>
      <P>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>There may have been a mix up in the wording of the question &ndash; I wanted to ask about the expansion of the service. There is one centre in Crumlin. There is a waiting list for genetic counselling. Does the Minister not feel that it is a service which should be extended to other centres? Is the Minister aware that, in certain circumstances, when people receive genetic counselling, by changing their lifestyle they can prevent certain conditions arising? Genetic counselling is an important part of preventative medicine. Does the Minister accept the need for expansion on a national basis to ensure genetic counselling is provided as a matter of course?</P>
      <P>The Minister said that the centre is situated in the grounds of Our Lady's Hospital, Crumlin. Does it come under the control of the hospital board? The Archbishop is chairman of that board and I wonder if that gives potential for difficulties. Is there a separate board structure for the genetic centre?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>My understanding is that the centre would come within the remit of the board because it is on the grounds of Our Lady's Hospital. I am not aware of any other authority being responsible for its governance. I will confirm that for the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the expert view on this issue that service development which might weaken, fragment or <Col N="1099" /> duplicate the functions of the national centre should be discouraged. Therefore, there is a need for us to improve the services on the site rather than dissipate effort over a range of sites. The appointment of a second consultant post there recently is testimony to the recognition of the need for improvement. The expert advice is that we should improve the national centre because the provision of medical genetic services has been lacking and remains behind that of other European countries. There is strong support in the medical community and lay groups for the development of this field. In answer to the question about other places doing similar work, while I know we have this problem in Dublin in relation to a range of services, it is not the way to go.</P>

      <P>Work has started on the preparation of a national children's strategy. A memorandum will be submitted to Government shortly setting out my proposals in this regard and also indicating the likely publication date.</P>
      <P> The publication of a comprehensive strategy document on issues affecting children is an important step which will have far reaching implications for the health, education and welfare of our children and I look forward to progressing this issue. I intend to consult widely with regard to the preparation of the strategy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that the biggest problem in relation to services for children is fragmentation because responsibility is spread over a number of Departments? Does his strategy deal with this problem? Will he propose that all matters relating to children should come under the auspices of one Department?</P>
      <P>There are serious problems with juvenile crime but it is not clear which Department has responsibility. Although the Department of Education and Science has some involvement, nobody takes responsibility for pre-school services. There are all kinds of <i>ad hoc</i> arrangements in place for the small amount of funding the pre-school sector receives. Will these matters be addressed in the strategy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>All those matters have been addressed and will be further addressed in the strategy. It is accepted that there is a need for greater long-term planning and co-ordination of children's services. When I took office there was no strategy or action in many of the areas. I began <Col N="1100" /> by putting immediate action in place in the most urgent areas.</P>
      <P>There is a problem that responsibility for children is spread over a number of Departments. However, matters have improved since the appointment under the last Government of Deputy Currie to three Departments. My own appointment crosses three Departments. There are outstanding difficulties in the arrangements, although I am satisfied that the Departments are working well in co-ordination with each other on areas such as juvenile justice. In the national strategy we will address the improvement of structures and co-ordination, and whether one Department should have overall responsibility for children.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister support the integrated service initiatives at local levels? These involve people drawn from the social work department of the health board, the school attendance service of the Department of Education and Science and the juvenile liaison service of the Garda, who work on a case review basis to provide a comprehensive service to a family at risk. Is he aware that the main obstacles to such initiatives tend to stem from the parent Departments which are not willing to delegate responsibility to those local teams? Would he give a directive to all agencies under his control to co-operate in such initiatives?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am greatly in favour of the integrated service initiative. The hallmark of my efforts since entering office is to bring about co-ordination and co-operation at ground level between all agencies. I agree that the single most serious impediment to progress is that agencies are working independently from the top down. The emphasis is now on an integrated approach. The springboard projects are based on an inter-agency approach. At the first meeting of the springboard initiative, which all the key players attended, a senior official from one Department admitted it was the first time he had sat down with the other five Departments with responsibility for children.</P>
      <P>There was a problem in the past but it is addressed. There is still room for improvement, but these projects are being evaluated and central to that evaluation will be co-operation between Departments and agencies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider locating some of the services in schools? That would make it clear to those on the ground that the Minister expects integration and will put the service where children are most likely to be found.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that if a strategy is to be implemented, a senior Minister is needed to drive it. The most serious problem <Col N="1101" /> in children's services is the lack of adequate funding. Does the Minister of State accept that we need somebody at the Cabinet table to ensure funding is secured? Will he accept that the best way of ensuring children's rights are upheld is to appoint an ombudsman for children?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that integration of schools in all services is vitally important. There is school and teacher involvement in all the project work, and the work involving health boards, now taking place. Some difficulties exist with the Department of Education and Science because of the lack of a local structure but we are dealing with those issues. In regard to the point about one Minister, I have a very supportive senior Minister&mdash;</P>

      <P>He speaks well at Cabinet about children and so do his colleagues which resulted in £28 million being allocated this year across the three Departments. While there may be an argument in favour of having a senior Minister with responsibility for children, the current system works well, whereby one Minister of State is responsible for three Departments and three Ministers argue the toss at Cabinet. There is no difficulty with that arrangement. One aspect that might be examined is that the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs has responsibility for the family and the Department of Health and Children has responsibility for children. Perhaps there is a need for some co-ordination in that regard.</P>

      <P>As part of one of the most significant initiatives ever taken on homelessness we are providing £1 million this year to the Eastern Health Board and a series of new facilities for homeless children. This has come about as a result of a demand to keep children in their own areas, and the Dublin local authorities have responded positively. They see the provision of five or six houses as a vitally important part of their role. We hope to have this initiative in place shortly which will provide houses in areas like Tallaght, north Clondalkin, Ballymun and Darndale for young homeless children in particular who will not be allowed to go into the city thereby preventing them becoming part of the long-term homelessness problem. This is a major initiative and that the local authorities and the Eastern Health Board are involved is significant. We will provide the money for this project as well as money for a series of other projects which will be announced shortly.</P>

If the Minister had been prepared to provide funding to purchase houses in the areas he referred to they would be in the system by now? The Minister of State should not expect the local authorities to do that. The Minister, Deputy Cowen, made a great deal of noise in his post-budget announcement and there was a general understanding that he would provide funding.</P>

      <P>I have established a steering group with representatives from the Departments of Health and Children, Education and Science and <Col N="1104" /> Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Irish Foster Care Association to set up and monitor a pilot project for an alternative remand service. The project will examine the feasibility of providing special non-institutional placements for children and young persons who, but for the availability of such placements, would be remanded by the courts to St. Michael's Remand and Assessment Unit. I have allocated £200,000 for this project this year. When the pilot project has been established it will be evaluated with a view to identifying the feasibility of establishing a national alternative remand service. The group is currently finalising the protocol for the study. This project is one of a number of projects I have initiated to strengthen community services, support vulnerable children and their families in the community and tackle the problems of social exclusion experienced by these families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>We all accept that progress has been slow in increasing the number of available foster families. Is the Minister aware that a serious problem for foster families is the enormous difficulty they face in getting funding for anything out of the ordinary? They receive the normal fostering allowance but what if a child needs something special for school or wants to go on a school trip? If foster parents want to get even £50 extra for some special need they must go through a long process with the health board and it takes a long time for the money to come through. We hear that complaint from many foster parents. Is the Minister aware of the problem and what steps is he taking to deal with it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>The most positive work done in the child care section of our Department is in the area of foster care. We have significantly increased the weekly allocation to foster parents. We gave a once-off payment of £100 for every child in foster care at Christmas. We put an end to much of the bad practice that existed prior to us taking over in Government. The specific issue the Deputy mentioned was one of the first I tackled. A mountain of paperwork had to be gone through for every item a foster parent had to purchase. I set up a working group to deal with a series of foster care issues and I told the group I wanted a change implemented in this area. That has been done and money will be made available to foster parents with the quantum of costs agreed on a national basis. That will put an end to the bureaucratic system of submitting invoices and more money being spent on making the payment than the actual payment. We have addressed that and other issues. This is a novel idea in that 70 per cent of children locked up in St. Michael's remand centre are inappropriately placed and should not be there. Many were committed through the courts as there was no other mechanism. This is a national scandal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1105" /> This project will enable us to take quite a number of those children out of secure residential care and place them in foster care and provide them with intensive day care support while on remand. This will include education and therapy and, hopefully, move them on to a continuum of care which will get them back into mainstream society and out of their difficult situations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that this is a national scandal. However, would the Minister of State agree that devoting £200,000 to tackling this scandal is wholly deficient? The High Court and judges in other courts are constantly pointing out that we are short 155 high-support places for children who should be off the streets. The Minister of State said that he could take some people out of St. Michael's House. By any calculation one would need to spend an additional £7 million to £8 million to address this problem. How can the Minister of State hope to make an impact by spending £200,000? It is insulting to suggest that one is confronting a national scandal with the scale of operations envisaged by the Minister of State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is confusing two separate issues. The issue he raised is being dealt with in a different way. We are spending about £13.5 million this year and next year on units to deal with the children to which he referred. We received an additional £4 million in the budget across the Departments of Health and Children, Education and Science and Justice, Equality and Law Reform to deal with the problems of children and young people in secure accommodation. We want to try to stop them going into such accommodation and get children who are already there out more quickly. This is one small element of that £4 million expenditure.</P>
      <P>We are also involved in similar projects with other institutions. This will result in preventing a considerable number of people from entering secure accommodation at a cost of up to £70,000 per year.</P>

      <P>It is a pleasure to speak in this debate even though I am not and do not intend to become a member of a local authority. At last the role of local government is being recognised by a Government and we are giving it the attention it deserves. In my short time in national politics I have come to appreciate the role played by local councillors. They give voice to their communities' wishes and desires and play a valuable role in connecting people with what can often appear as grey bureaucracies.</P>
      <P>Local authority representation is so important that it should be a full-time, paid occupation. Deputy Currie stated that he was in favour of a full-time role for councillors, perhaps even paying them to fulfil that role. This view is in contrast to Deputy Hayes who favours the dual mandate and is seeking election to a local authority. I agree with Deputy Currie that there is no place for the dual mandate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has signalled his intention in this regard which is to abolish the dual mandate after the coming election. It is good news for local government and our democracy that we can devolve real power to local level and, over a period, upgrade the quality of representation by giving proper payments and expenses to local authority members.</P>
      <P>I had the honour of serving an elected education authority &ndash; the Inner London Education Authority &ndash; which had an elected membership, committees and an executive. It was striking to note that, in local government in London, it was technically possible for members to make a living from the expenses and small emoluments which accompanied that level of representation. This is a good idea as it would mean we would have a core of full time, local public representatives to carry out valuable committee work and other functions associated with local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the problems with the Minister's proposals is that, while providing for more involvement and more power at local level, it may be difficult to secure the kind of representation <Col N="1107" /> which is motivated enough to participate in the new structures. We will have to consider some method of rewarding that kind of involvement. This work should be full time for some of those involved. I do not suggest that those with outside interests should not be involved in local government, in many cases people with other professions or trades add to the essence of central and local government.</P>
    <P>Some of the most knowledgeable people have concluded that local government has become a haven for petty corruption. I do not share or relish that conclusion but that was how it was when the British Government was in control of this country. Local government became more corrupt as it became more localised. The danger is that as one brings local government closer to the people, the smallness of the country will dictate that the cross-involvement of people will discredit local authorities.</P>
    <P>The Flood tribunal is investigating allegations of serious corruption in the planning process in Dublin in the 1980s. The perception that local government is, or could be, a haven for corruption is damaging and dangerous. Unfortunately that image exists because of the practices which emerged in the 1980s during the rapid development of the city and the requirement for additional rezoning for houses. That was regrettable and it is time to move on. This legislation indicates that the Minister has decided to move to an era in which a distinction will be drawn between those who serve on local authorities and those who serve in the Dáil. The dual mandate will be gone within a matter of years and real power will be devolved to the local authorities to conduct their work. In tandem with that process of renewal, change and modernisation, we must put in place mechanisms to police local government on behalf of the public to ensure it does not become a haven for petty or serious corruption. The Bill will bring to local authorities the kind of controls we introduced at a national level in regard to disclosure requirements. They are a minimum requirement now in the practice of politics. If we are to renew and sustain politics in the long term, it must be seen to be transparent and honest, not a business conducted for private gain. This Bill will achieve that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Currie referred to the failure to impose a cap on local authority election spending. I do not believe that will cause serious problems in the forthcoming local elections. Anyone who spends huge amounts of money in a local election will be spotted very quickly and people will ask questions. We have a very vigilant media who would quickly pick up on the tell-tale signs of a candidate who was spending excessive amounts of money. Controls were in place for the first time prior to the last general election but it was not possible to <Col N="1108" /> monitor what went on prior to the legislation coming into effect. The introduction of that legislation was a definitive turning point and from now on all election spending will be increasingly scrutinised. A great deal was spent by certain candidates in my constituency but there is no point in dwelling on that.</P>
    <P>I do not believe the lack of a spending cap will be open to abuse but I agree that the Minister should perhaps consider this issue in the longer term. I understand the Minister's argument that, from the taxpayers' point of view, it would be very bureaucratic and expensive to put such a cap in place as it would require an expensive policing requirement. I am sure the Minister will consider the issue prior to the local elections which will follow those in June.</P>
    <P>People concerned about this issue should remember that other parts of this Bill provide for disclosures in regard to spending; candidates will be required to provide statements outlining how much they spend. To that extent, a degree of transparency is provided for in the Bill. That is only proper in view of the alarming disclosures which have been made in the planning and other tribunals. It is important that the public is reassured.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Fleming, has entered the Chamber which brings me neatly to my next point. Deputy Fleming initiated the idea that we are now moving towards full State funding of political parties. This would be a welcome development and we should move quickly towards that position. It would serve to guarantee people that politics are honest. We should also ban corporate and company donations to individuals or political parties. The perception that business might have an undue influence on public policy is very damaging and we should seek to do away with it. I am not suggesting that individuals be prevented from making contributions but we should impose a cap on the amounts involved. I expect the Minister to be in a position in the not too distant future to bring forward radical proposals of that nature. An upper limit of £1,000 might be imposed on individual contributions. Anything greater would be excessive and might lead to the perception that such an individual would have a disproportionately greater influence on public policy than the ordinary man or woman on the street. Such a perception would be very dangerous. State funding of political parties, an absolute ban on corporate donations and the imposition of caps on individual contributions would be progressive moves in regard to national and local government.</P>
    <P>The dual mandate must go. Nobody could do two jobs well under the new system of reorganised government. It is far preferable to do one job well than two badly. My limited experience of politics to date has shown that the workload involved at local authority level is enormous and <Col N="1109" /> time consuming. The new committee structures which are to be set up within local government will require people to be focused fully on their jobs. They should not have to run from the local authority chamber to the Dáil. We are charged with huge responsibilities in this House; we must legislate for all people, not just our constituents. It is important that we be given the time and resources to do that job well.</P>
    <P>This Bill represents a real step forward for local government. Local government will become more real and true for the public. I would like to see the Minister instigating a system whereby mayors would be directly elected. The current system under which county managers enjoy huge executive powers and are, to a large extent, unaccountable is a bad one. Mayors should be directly elected and, if necessary, should be paid to run local authorities for specified periods. This view has been taken by the Labour Party in Britain and a mayor is to be directly elected there. Dublin, at the very least, deserves that. I expect that there would be support for a directly elected mayor for the corporation area as well as other local authorities in Dublin and throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Local government has turned the corner. Damaging revelations have been made in public tribunals about rezoning practices and other matters pertaining to local government. We must raise political standards and practices to reassure the public that people are not in politics for private gain or to line their pockets on foot of valuable land rezoning decisions.</P>
    <P>I view this Bill as a first instalment, not as a frozen piece of legislation. We have a long way to go before we can restore the kind of public confidence in politics we enjoyed until relatively recently. This legislation is a step in that direction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFleming" hpid="Mr. Fleming Mr. Fleming">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fleming</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Local Elections (Disclosure of Donations and Expenditure) Bill, 1999, as it is an area of particular interest to me. This Bill must be viewed in the general political context of where we are in regard to political funding, donations and expenditure at national and local level. There is widespread agreement among the general public and politicians that we must restore and improve standards in public office. It is vital that we do so if we are to restore some of the confidence which has been lost in the political system. That the Government has come forward with proposals for standards in public office is a clear commitment to action. All political parties and Independents in the Oireachtas share this concern. These proposals have been presented to the Committee on Finance and the Public Service and a sub-committee has examined them in detail over the past number of weeks. I was pleased to be a member of that sub-committee which will <Col N="1110" /> publish its report on 29 April. The report will be referred to the Government with a view to it considering our comments, suggestions and proposals and bringing forward legislation before the summer.</P>
      <P>In recent years a number of tribunals have been established to investigate matters of public importance, including the beef tribunal, the McCracken tribunal, the Moriarty tribunal and the Flood tribunal. A common theme in all these tribunals is the link between business donations and politicians and political parties. The disclosures in relation to these matters arising from the various tribunals have caused concern among the entire community. It is right that all these matters should be fully and properly investigated by tribunals which have very important work to do and everybody should co-operate fully and voluntarily with the tribunals so they can get to the bottom of the matters under investigation. Any wrongdoing highlighted by the tribunals should be investigated by the Director of Public Prosecutions and should ultimately lead to prosecutions.</P>
      <P>As elected politicians we have a primary role in restoring public confidence in the political system. We all acknowledge the tribunals have important work to do. Nevertheless, politicians have a clear role to fulfil in our own right. They must bring forward proposals to restore confidence in public office &ndash; the public expects nothing less. Currently there are several matters with which we as politicians should deal. The essence of a democracy is that elected representatives represent the people. The role of the citizen and voter must be pre-eminent. When people vote in elections their decisions must be respected and there should be no hidden influences on the political system. Revelations in recent years have highlighted links between business and politics. We should separate business and corporate donations from politics and politicians. We should bring forward legislation to outlaw once and for all business donations to politicians and political parties. We should ban all financial contributions from all forms of businesses, be they limited companies, partnerships, co-operatives, representative organisations or other groups. We must also ensure no organisation or umbrella group is allowed act as a collection agent for funds for onward transmission for political purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a democracy citizens are entitled to show support for a candidate, politician or party of their choice by voting for them on polling day, working for them during an election campaign and assisting them with their time, energy and expertise as may suit the individual concerned. There is a belief that individuals have a constitutional right to financially support a politician or political party of their choice. Legislation should be introduced to limit total donations to a maximum of £1,000 per year per individual. <Col N="1111" /> Members and supporters of parties should be free to pay membership fees and participate in local fundraising activities, etc., subject to an annual maximum contribution of £1,000 from any one individual.</P>
    <P>In recent years there has been a significant increase in Exchequer funding for political parties. This year £3.17965 million is being made available by the Exchequer to the various political parties and Independents as follows: £2.59901million under the party leaders allowance scheme and £1.4864 million under the Electoral Act, 1997. These figures may not be widely known. Given that the Exchequer has gone a substantial way towards subventing the political system, we should complete the process and provide for full funding of all parties. An estimated additional £4 million would be sufficient to fully finance all political parties. This would give a total Exchequer subvention of approximately £7 million per annum to be allocated between the various parties.</P>
    <P>In the context of public funding for parties, all party accounts and financial records should be published, laid before Dáil Éireann each year and be open to public scrutiny. The Comptroller and Auditor General should report on the accounts on an annual basis. New legislation should provide for funding for new candidates, those who failed to be elected and new political parties. If no such mechanism existed the legislation would be biased in favour of established political parties.</P>
    <P>There is a widespread belief that business donations to politicians and political parties are not healthy and should be stopped. The country is almost on a permanent tribunal footing in the context of investigating these donations. We are spending many millions of pounds per annum on various tribunals, the root cause of which in many cases are payments to politicians. We would be far better off investing some of this money in providing full public funding for parties and eliminating all corporate donations.</P>
    <P>Sooner or later the political system will have to accept that corporate donations to politicians and political parties are no longer acceptable. We should take the lead at this time. I propose the enactment of legislation to ban all financial donations by businesses to politicians and political parties, to restrict financial donations from individuals to politicians and political parties and to provide for full funding and accountability for all political parties and candidates.</P>
    <P>This is the essence of the points I raised at the sub-committee of the Committee on Finance and the Public Service last week when we considered proposals by the Government for standards in public office. It is appropriate that these points be restated in the Chamber during this debate.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1112" /> I welcome the general thrust of the Bill and am happy that it has been brought before the House. I expect it will be enacted before the forthcoming local elections. I also hope all candidates and potential candidates will be given an easily readable summary, in simple English, outlining their obligations. The Bill sets out onerous obligations and I would not like anybody to be in contravention of it as a result of not understanding the various measures included in it.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides a statutory scheme for the disclosure of election expenses at local elections by candidates, political parties and third parties. In addition, candidates will be required to disclose the source of funds used to meet these election expenses. Any donation over £500 will also have to be disclosed. These provisions are good. Some controversy has resulted from the fact that no limits have been mentioned in terms of expenditure in local elections. This is the first time we are applying these provisions to local elections and it is appropriate that we establish a full picture as to what is happening and use that information for future purposes. Perhaps we will examine the issue of expenditure limits at a later date, although I am not in favour of them. People are free to spend as much money as they like advertising Coca-Cola, McDonalds, cars, etc. I place a higher value on the political process and on being elected to public office than on buying some of these consumer goods. To my knowledge the advertisement of cigarettes is the only other area where there are major restrictions on the basis that cigarettes damage health and can lead to death. It is incongruous that the only other area where expenditure on advertisement and promotion is restricted is in the context of general elections. I do not want to see excessive expenditure, but the approach is fatally flawed and demeaning to the political process. Voter turn out and the numbers who vote on polling day has been mentioned. I would like the Department of the Environment and Local Government to spend a great deal of time, energy, resources and funding on conducting detailed questionnaires and surveys of the public on why they do not vote. The turn out in recent general elections has been in decline. There was a time not so long ago when the turn out was more than 75 per cent. In the last election it was 66 per cent. That means one in three of the electorate, which is almost one million people, decided for one reason or another not to vote. That concerns me, and I would like research and information on that so politicians can address the reasons people do not vote. That would be a good service to the political system.</P>
    <P>Another provision in the Bill I am pleased to see is the fund for research into the electronic <Col N="1113" /> recording and counting of votes in future elections using ballot papers from the forthcoming local and European elections. We should only count votes electronically. I would not be pleased to see a mechanism which meant one had to vote mechanically or electronically in polling stations. A number of people might find that off-putting, older people especially. None of us has a problem filling out the ballot paper. What causes the public concern is that it can take several days to obtain a result, especially if there are recounts. A system of counting votes electronically would solve that problem, but the ballot paper would have to be designed to facilitate that.</P>
    <P>Some ballot papers may not be capable of being counted accurately electronically. That small percentage can be counted manually and included in the overall figure. I would like to see the emphasis on the counting of votes. It is remarkable that it can take several days to obtain a general election result here whereas the result in the UK is obtained in the early hours of the morning after voting and the new Prime Minister is in 10 Downing Street by lunchtime the next day. I would like to see that happening here. I see no reason for the delay.</P>
    <P>A matter I would like to see addressed in future legislation on local elections is a provision for the election of the person with the power at local level. If that is to be the county manager, the county manager should stand for election. I am pleased with the suggestion of an election for the chairperson of each local authority, but it is a facade unless the chairperson is to have power.</P>
    <P>There is a myriad of legislation covering election expenditure and ethics in politics, such as the Electoral Act, 1997. We now have the Bill and the Government is proposing further legislation on standards in public office which will be published before the summer. It will be necessary before long to have consolidating legislation dealing with this. Every six months when there is a new crisis concerning political matters or when an election is to be held, we introduce legislation to deal with the problem at hand. There is so much legislation, it is safe to say that some of it is contradictory. I would like to see consolidating legislation introduced as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The essence of local elections is that people in a county should have the right to vote for the local authority or county council by which they will be administered. There is a major problem in County Laois. The Local Government Boundaries (Town Elections) Regulations, 1994, provided for the extension of the boundaries of a number of towns, including Carlow, for the purposes of local elections. The boundary of Carlow Urban District Council extended into County Laois for the urban district council <Col N="1114" /> elections. In the local elections in June this year, people in County Laois who are governed and administered by Laois County Council and who are in the Dáil constituency of Laoighis-Offaly will vote in the Carlow County Council elections. That is wrong and is almost unconstitutional. The 700 people in the Greycullen area of County Laois have no vote in the forthcoming local elections for Laois County Council even though they are in County Laois and will be serviced by Laois County Council. It is an anomaly that they will only have a vote in Carlow County Council which will have no administrative authority over them. The relevant statutory instrument should be withdrawn and the legislation repealed. It may have been introduced for good reasons at the time, but it serves no useful purpose any longer and should be withdrawn.</P>
    <P>I support the legislation and look forward to it being incorporated in consolidating legislation in coming years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the measure. The Minister said it provides for a statutory scheme for the disclosure of election expenditure by candidates, political parties and third parties at local elections. In addition, it requires disclosure of the sources of funds used to meet election expenses, which is an innovation. It also requires all donations of more than £500 to be disclosed by those persons within its scope. Other matters dealt with by the Bill relate to disqualification of chairpersons of Oireachtas committees from contesting local authority elections and research on electronic methods of voting. I welcome these reasonable objectives.</P>
      <P>The legislation supplements the existing corpus of legislation dealing with other elections which was introduced in 1997. It is important to bear in mind that, no matter what legislation is enacted, the people cannot be protected if they insist on electing venal characters and fools to Parliament. We only have to examine the McCracken report to see that no amount of legislation can deter that type of conduct &ndash; the use of offshore accounts and cash payments. No amount of legislation will protect the people if they elect knaves to high office. That is an inescapable fact and is important in terms of the dispute the Labour Party has with the Bill. I understand it proposes to divide the House on the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The approach taken by the Minister of insisting that all election spending be disclosed is correct. It is better to require a candidate to disclose all election expenditure than to require him to travel with a chartered accountant during an election campaign to ensure he remains within certain spending limits. If there is an insistence on candidates making a full disclosure of their spending in an election, a great deal <Col N="1115" /> will come to public notice and it will be easy for voters to identify when a person has not made a full disclosure. The system is an effective one. The new requirement that a candidate disclose his sources of funding is also valuable because we will see how candidates raise their funds, be it from private means or from contributions by others. That is a welcome provision.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that it would have been possible for the Minister to implement the type of scheme envisaged in section 72 of the 1997 Act in a local election context. That option was open to him but he decided not to exercise it and to introduce this simple Bill instead. It retains the principles of disclosure of donations and controls on expenditure through full disclosure but prevents the development of a large bureaucracy in this area. The Minister pointed out that there are 268 electoral areas, a great number of councillors, a large number of electoral contests and a huge variation in size between different electoral areas. It would have been difficult to devise limits on expenditure in that context. Neither do we have any information in that context. One of the merits of the scheme of disclosure proposed in the legislation is that we will now develop a body of hard information about what happens at elections. That is the best basis upon which we can draft legislation. If specific abuses come to light it is open to us in the House to amend the legislation and deal with them.</P>
    <P>For present purposes the legislation puts local government elections on a solid foundation as far as the disclosure of expenditure and donations is concerned. It is very important that be done. Without casting a slur on local government I would have thought this was the first and not the last area that should have been attended to by recent Governments because that is where the local and personal contact and the conflict of interest are most apparent. We should, therefore, have introduced this legislation in the first place for the protection of councillors.</P>
    <P>I was not a Member of this House when some of the legislation affecting Members was passed, but since I have had to complete the declarations, I have often been struck at how much of it appears to be theoretical and unreal. There are no real conflicts of interest relating, say, to the work of a backbench Deputy and the kind of ethical requirement imposed by the legislation. However, in local government these conflicts arise every day, inevitably where councillors have powers to vary, add to and enhance the value of property through the provision of local services. It is vital, therefore, that councillors be protected through a scheme of legislation of this type which puts their candidature and election operation beyond question.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1116" /> The Labour Party is anxious to provide for expenditure limits. However, to operate that scheme in a local election context would involve the creation of a massive bureaucracy. The alternative option the Minister has chosen to exercise in introducing this Bill and the provision for the devolution of this matter to each council is appropriate. The initial responsibility for counting the votes has always rested with the local authority so this new policing regime will also be attended to by the relevant local authority. That is a desirable way of proceeding in this matter.</P>
    <P>In some respects I regard this legislation as a substantial improvement on the 1997 legislation. The Bill provides for a realistic system of accountability. The national party must have an agent, as must the local party in the specific electoral area and the candidates. That reflects the reality of the electoral system and how campaigns take place today. A clear accountability is imposed on the party at national and local levels and on a candidate to make the level of disclosure required by the legislation.</P>
    <P>I have already welcomed the fact that the sources of funding must now be disclosed. It is an innovation that was not provided for in the 1997 Act. The disclosure of all expenditure in principle is a far better approach to this problem than requiring candidates to observe a limit which I fear would, in many cases, only lead to evasive practices. I also fear that under any systems of limits and limitations, attempts would be made to evade them which would in turn bring politics and public life into disrepute. By contrast, a scheme of broad and total disclosure, as provided for here, would foster an attitude among politicians and candidates where they must make clear everything they spend in an election campaign.</P>
    <P>On the general political question I agree with Deputy Fleming's remarks on the proper relationship between political parties and public life and money and influence. This has been the subject of much debate because of the tribunals. The key point here is that political parties are volunteer organisations. We as politicians must foster a greater recognition that they are an essential feature of democratic debate and democratic life in this State. There is a need to recognise this at every level of our legal system.</P>
    <P>The all party committee on the Constitution is examining whether there should be a constitutional recognition of political parties &ndash; they are not referred to in the Constitution. However, they play a vital part in the proper operation of our democracy. There is a need to recognise that principle enshrined in the Constitution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed. Many modern constitutions in continental jurisdictions contain an express recognition of the importance of political parties in the civic culture.</P>
      <P>We must also foster an opinion in which it is understood that political parties are essential to democratic debate and are essential if people are to exercise real authority over the organs of government that are established by them in the Constitution. In a country like ours, with a political system that is prone to much fragmentation and to placing the emphasis on the personal consideration rather than the principled argument or policy, it is essential that we promote the idea that political parties have a central part to play as voluntary organisations in developing a healthy democracy.</P>
      <P>If we are to do that we must address in a radical way the question of money and influence. We must set a limit on the amount anyone can contribute to a political party. In a voluntary organisation it is desirable to have fundraising. It is also part of the spirit of any political party to have some fund raising, but there must be a monetary limit which necessarily entails far greater public provision for the political parties themselves in the form of funding. In saying this I have gone beyond the strict scope of the Bill, but it is very important for our public culture that we recognise this problem because we must also recognise that we have brought onto ourselves a degree of disrepute because of the tribunals. With no disrespect to Independent Members, we must foster political parties.</P>

      <P>We as a House and as legislators, through the type of constitutional change I have referred to and by legislating for the funding of political parties. If we do not address this issue civic life may be the poorer.</P>
      <P>I welcome the legislation and I accept the Labour Party raises a legitimate point on the capping of expenditure at elections because there is the danger that the candidate with a vast amount of money can, in effect, purchase his or her way to an elected authority. I assume that is the danger the party is trying to address.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>However, I have always seen a constitutional problem with this. Suppose in our modern electronic age I am seriously defamed in the course of an election on television and in the national newspapers. Have I not the right of reply and, if my supporters believe I have been defamed, have they not the <Col N="1118" /> right of reply? A very large amount of expenditure might be available to exercise that right, yet it could not be taken under a system which imposes expenditure limits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no cost involved in that, but one may wish to make one's position clear through the distribution of appropriate literature and, if necessary, the taking out of advertisements in the national newspapers, which is a very expensive operation.</P>
      <P>However, there is a practical problem with excess expenditure in that it enables very wealthy individuals to effectively purchase their way in if they spend enough money. That problem must be addressed. Nevertheless, experience under this legislation will enable us to legislate where specific abuses exist and we can, in appropriate cases, decide that certain forms of election expenditure should not be permitted.</P>
      <P>Realistically, the areas of high expenditure in elections relate to advertising in newspapers and outdoor advertising. The old fashioned poster campaign is the poor man's outdoor advertising campaign. The cost of procuring advertisements from companies such as Adshel &ndash; I have never had the benefit of it &ndash; is very substantial and the quotations supplied by advertising agencies are very expensive. That kind of expenditure means spending a great deal of money and if one candidate can afford to buy a lot of newspaper space and conduct that kind of very high quality advertising campaign, it gives that candidate a great advantage over other candidates. Ultimately, however, the people retire to the ballot box and make their decision.</P>
      <P>The legislation proposes to undertake research on electronic voting and for that purpose there is a legal necessity to permit the use of the ballot papers which are collected after the elections for the purposes of research. The Bill is carefully drafted to safeguard the secrecy and anonymity of that operation.</P>
      <P>I have reservations about the introduction of electronic voting at polling places. The famous legend of Mayor Daly's intervention in Chicago in 1960, that the police were requested to assist in some of the electronic polling places, was alleged to have affected the result of a presidential election.</P>

      <P>Yes, but the electoral system, like the judicial system, must be seen to be beyond reproach. I am not convinced that the replacement of the manual system with some <Col N="1119" /> form of electronic system would protect the electoral system from reproach.</P>
      <P>I agree there must be scope for improvements in the operation of the count. However, I have always questioned the basic rules at general elections because the non-use of fractions in the computation of surpluses is wrong and the manner in which the physical surplus is transferred is wrong. Again, it is outside the scope of this legislation but Deputy Fleming raised it.</P>

      <P>The Minister has chosen to make two or three miscellaneous amendments in the electoral code and I suppose it is legitimate to point out one or two other ones which could be made. If research on electronic voting is to be conducted, it is clear there will have to be certain changes in the electoral rules for the computation of the votes.</P>
      <P>I extend a broad welcome to this legislation. The Minister has tried to devise a practicable scheme which will address the concerns which have arisen in recent years.</P>
      <P>There has been a great deal of debate in recent times about whether Members of this House should contest local authority elections. It should be left to the individual Member. I have chosen not to contest the forthcoming local elections but it should be open to a Member who wishes to contest an election to do so. While a Minister is disqualified from being a member of a local authority because of a conflict of interest, it has not been suggested that there is a conflict of interest between the position of a backbench Deputy or an Opposition Deputy and the position of a councillor. We are not unique in this respect. I think President Mitterand retained the mayoralty of a tiny village in the south of France throughout his later political existence.</P>

      <P>The involvement of national politicians in local politics is common in other lands. I am not certain that it is desirable to prohibit Members of this House from contesting local elections. After all, many backbench Deputies on the Government side have little influence over policy, and the fact that they may contest a local election and play a part in the development of their communities through a local authority is important to them and provides a natural focus of leadership in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also have doubts about the constitutional propriety of prohibiting people from contesting <Col N="1120" /> elections but that issue has not been considered in this legislation. The chairpersons of Oireachtas committees are allowed to contest elections under this legislation. That matter is under consideration.</P>
    <P>Part IV gives the legislation teeth. It is important to note that not alone are there criminal offences involved but that, in the event of a local election petition if the breach of the Act materially affected the result, the election could be set aside. That is an important sanction which ensures there will be substantial compliance with the legislation. With the knowledge of a possible petition &ndash; there is nothing like a hanging to concentrate the mind &ndash; no doubt candidates contesting the local elections will realise that if a breach of these provisions materially affects the result, they may be unseated on petition. That is a powerful deterrent and will ensure the implementation of the legislation.</P>
    <P>While I welcome this Bill, we must tackle the broader problem of addressing the central role of political parties in the civil culture of the State recognising that through the Constitution and appropriate statutory provisions.</P>

      <P>This important matter reveals further serious problems in administrative procedures in the courts and highlights the need for urgent action on the part of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to streamline procedures and prevent further errors of this nature occurring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1121" /> On 9 April last, I received a letter from a constituent serving a four year sentence in Wheatfield Prison, Clondalkin, Dublin. The prisoner stated that he had made an application for a writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> to the High Court on 1 April 1998, at which time he was in the Curragh Prison, and asked me to inquire why the application had not been heard.</P>
    <P>I tabled a written question to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform asking the reason for the delay in hearing the application. When I received the Minister's reply, I was greatly surprised to learn that the application had been heard by the High Court on 14 May 1998 and rejected, but the prisoner was not notified of the outcome of his case due to what the Minister described as &ldquo;an administrative error&rdquo;. In his reply, the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue said that he regarded &ldquo;such a system failure as very unfortunate&rdquo; and took &ldquo;a serious view&rdquo; of the matter.</P>
    <P>The right of any person to contest the legality of his detention by the state, by seeking a writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>, is a fundamental principle of our constitutional system and is specifically guaranteed by Article 40 of the Constitution. I make no judgment on the validity of the application made by the prisoner concerned but I find it absolutely unacceptable that a prisoner should not only have not been informed of the outcome of the case, but does not even appear to have been notified that the application was being heard.</P>
    <P>The prisoner comes from a disadvantaged area of Dublin. I cannot help but wonder if he came from a different area or social background, would he have been treated in such a cavalier manner by the court system? While the Minister indicated that the prisoner has now, almost 12 months later, been informed of the outcome of the case, not a word of apology or regret is forthcoming from the Minister in his reply.</P>
    <P>While this is clearly not of the same magnitude as the events which led to the dramatic events of the past week, it will add to public concerns about the manner in which the courts are administered. We need a more comprehensive explanation from the Minister as to the reasons for this serious failure in the system and the steps he is taking to ensure that similar events do not occur in the future.</P>
    <P>There are a number of issues that arise from this case and the Minister's reply to my question. In his reply, the Minister states: &ldquo;The applicant was not present or legally represented during consideration of the application and this is the usual procedure&rdquo;. Is he satisfied that it is appropriate that such matters should be decided on the basis of papers only and in the absence of the applicant?</P>
    <P>There are also a number of specific questions <Col N="1122" /> I would like the Minister to answer when replying. Who was the High Court judge who considered the application? Was any acknowledgement issued in respect of the application when it was received in the central office of the High Court on 6 April, 1998. Why was the applicant not notified that his application had been considered and the application had been rejected? Who is normally responsible for notifying applicants of the result of such cases? Is he satisfied that where an application of this nature is received from a prisoner who is not represented by a solicitor, it is treated by the administrative system of the courts with the same seriousness as an application received from a prisoner with legal representation?</P>
    <P>When was this &ldquo;application by post&rdquo; procedure for <i>habeas corpus</i> introduced into the prison system? Is it applied only to prisoners who do not have legal representatives? Are applicants in such circumstances informed of their right to be heard in person in the High Court, or is the view of the authorities that there is no such right? Is it not the obligation of a judge of the High Court &ndash; even on an <i>ex parte </i>application &ndash; to give reasons for his or her decision? If so, what procedures are in place for notifying individuals in the position of this applicant, of the reasons? I know the Minister is taking careful note of all my questions.</P>
    <P>A further serious matter arises from this abysmal failure of the administrative system of the courts. As I understand it, the prisoner would have been entitled to appeal the decision of the High Court to the Supreme Court within 21 days of the original High Court decision of 14 May 1998. However, as he was not informed of the decision due to a failure on the part of the State, he has been denied the option of appealing the matter to the Supreme Court. What steps does the Minister intend to take to compensate the prisoner for the injustice that has been done to him? I suggest that the very least that the Minister must do is to provide legal assistance to the prisoner, through the Attorney General's scheme or some other mechanism, should he wish to reopen this matter before the courts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The application in question was a written request from a person in prison custody for an order of <i>habeas corpus</i> and made under Article 40.2 of the Constitution. Such applications are required to be by way of sworn affidavit and accompanied by a copy of the relevant warrant. These applications are a form of preliminary inquiry and are considered by a judge in chambers prior to delivering a ruling in open court. In cases of this kind where the judge considers that there is<i> prima facie</i> merit in the application he or she <Col N="1123" /> can direct the Governor of the prison to produce the prisoner in court and certify in writing the grounds of detention. Unless directed by the judge, it is not usual for the applicant in such cases to be present or legally represented at the delivery of the judge's decision on the preliminary inquiry.</P>
      <P>I am informed that the application in question was received in the central office of the High Court on 6 April 1998. It was sent by post from the prison in the ordinary way. The application was registered and the papers were checked to see if they were in order, in the usual way, before being placed before Mr. Justice Carney. He judged it right to remit the file to another judge and it was passed to Mr. Justice Kinlen. Mr. Justice Kinlen refused the application in open court on 14 May 1998. The applicant was not informed of this decision.</P>
      <P>I directed my officials to inquire into the matter on foot of the parliamentary question tabled by Deputy Rabbitte for written answer on 20 April. They established that due to an administrative error in the central office of the High Court the applicant was not notified by the court of its decision. Such notification has now issued. This clearly should not have happened. While it did not impact on the applicant's case for liberty because the Judge had decided to refuse it he was entitled to have formal notification of the outcome. Following a direction to my officials to make contact with relevant senior court staff in the central office to address the shortcoming exposed by this incident, they have informed me that a meeting has taken place today with the Chief Registrar of the High Court.</P>
      <P>I have asked my officials to look at the potential of the major courts IT programme currently under way to assist in eliminating human error of this kind in courts administration. At today's meeting with senior court officials an undertaking was given to review the application of procedures for the notification of the outcome of <i>habeas corpus</i> applications to the applicants so that the risk of a repeat of the systems failure in this case can be avoided in the future.</P>
      <P>I have also drawn the administrative lapse to the attention of the chief executive designate of the new Courts Service which will become fully operational in the near future and will then have full responsibility for dealing with administrative shortcomings of this kind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have this opportunity to raise the U-turn by the Government on the abolition of ground rent. Despite the commitment given in the programme for Government and the repeated promises by Fianna Fáil to <Col N="1124" /> abolish ground rent I have discovered the Government has no intention of abolishing this unjust and archaic rent.</P>
      <P>This scandalous about turn is particularly obvious in the case of Fianna Fáil and the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Woods. In March 1997 he initiated the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rent Abolition) Bill. This Fianna Fáil Private Member's Bill received the support of the Dáil on Second Stage and was subsequently referred to the Select Committee on Equality and Law Reform. It is worth highlighting to the House what the Minister, Deputy Woods said on that occasion:</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil is convinced that the time has now come for the historic reform of home ownership, for the final abolition of ground rents and the introduction of a simple system of registration in the Land Registry.</P>
      <P>He went on to say:</P>
      <P>The onus is on us as legislators to repeal these outdated ground rents. I welcome the fact that the Government has accepted this important Bill proposed by me on behalf of my party. There is now an onus on the Government to join us in ensuring its passing all remaining Stages without delay.</P>
      <P>If it was right and proper for Fianna Fáil to propose legislation to abolish ground rent in 1997, why can it not be enacted in 1999? We are told that other priorities are being attended to in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The Taoiseach informs the Dáil regularly on the Order of Business that there are constitutional difficulties with the abolition of ground rents. Once again, Fianna Fáil says one thing in Opposition and something completely different in Government. Why can the Minister, Deputy Woods's, Private Member's Bill not be reintroduced by his party, now in Government, following the two year time lapse?</P>
      <P>The situation is more outrageous when one considers that only this week pensioners living in Rialto, Dublin, received demand notices from solicitors acting on behalf of landlords.</P>
      <P>Will the Government now recommend that people should not pay demands for ground rent? I understand about 250,000 homes in this jurisdiction are still liable for ground rent. Between 300 to 400 householders annually are still dragged before the courts in relation to this matter. This shameful situation is further compounded by the hypocrisy of a Government which received support from this House to abolish ground rent two years ago but has to date decided not to fulfill its promise to the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I call on the Government to reintroduce the lapsed Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rent Abolition) Bill, 1997, immediately. To do other<Col N="1125" /> wise would make a mockery of Parliament and further increase cynicism in politics.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already indicated to the House, by way of reply to questions on 17 February 1999, that the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No. 2) Act, 1978, already provides a statutory scheme for the acquisition of the fee simple by the owners of dwelling houses.</P>
      <P>Part III of the Act provides a special procedure operated at low cost by the Land Registry, whereby owner-occupiers of dwelling houses may acquire readily and relatively inexpensively the fee simple in their property. The purchase price in most cases at present is about 13 times the ground rent. The Act contains provision for the determination of applications for the purchase of the fee simple in cases where the consent of all the necessary parties is not forthcoming. In such cases the Registrar of Titles will determine the application by arbitration. The Act also makes provision for the circumstance that the ground rent landlord cannot be found. There is no obstacle to a tenant negotiating directly with the owner of the ground rent for its purchase without reference to the No. 2 Act. Almost 68,000 ground rent tenants have availed of the low cost purchase scheme.</P>
      <P>The details of the Bill entitled the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rent Abolition) Bill are being examined in my Department at present&mdash;</P>

A difficulty which successive Governments have accepted over the years is that abolition of ground rents without appropriate compensation would not be in keeping with constitutional requirements.</P>
      <P>Given the complexities involved, I am not yet in a position to indicate when the examination will be completed, but any proposals which may emerge will be announced in the usual way. I might add that successive Governments have accepted that the abolition of ground rents without appropriate compensation arrangements would not be in accordance with constitutional requirements.</P>

      <P>In conclusion, I refer to a matter in connection with ground rents that was reported very recently in the media. It was suggested that a ground rent tenant could be evicted for failure to pay ground rent. However, <Col N="1126" /> the position under the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents)(No. 2) Act, 1978, to which I have already referred, is that it deprives a ground rent landlord of the right to repossess a dwelling house for non-payment of ground rent, on foot of a covenant in the lease. The landlord is left simply with the right to sue for any arrears as a civil debt.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform for taking this matter. I must declare an interest in this as my two adult children were pupils in this school, my four and a half year old is due to start his primary education there next September and I was involved in its parents support group for a couple of years in the mid-1970s. Therefore, I am intimately familiar with the issues involved.</P>
      <P>What is required here is a clear indication from the Department as to when moneys will be sanctioned and the necessary authorisations given to enable this school to build the additional accommodation which the Department itself considers to be necessary. Following an inspection, it was recommended the accommodation be extended to provide the additional facilities of a new classroom, an ancillary room, a remedial room and an office for the principal.</P>
      <P>The letter from the divisional inspector, Mr. Padraig Ó Loinsigh, dated 16 February 1999, stated that, due to the limitations of space on the site, it may be necessary to provide the additional accommodation as a second storey on the existing building. Given that the building is in use, it would be necessary for such work to commence in the summer period. Therefore, there must be forward planning in relation to this. Authorisation to go to the next stage in the planning process has not been received from the Department of Education and Science.</P>
      <P>What is the present situation in relation to this school? This is a growing area. There is a waiting list for children to get into this school, as is true of many primary schools in the inner city area. My constituency has lost national schools over the past number of years while, at the same time, household formation and the primary school going population has increased in real terms. There is a chronic need for a response from the Department of Education and Science.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A request was made in 1996. There has been repeated correspondence from the management of the school and Reverend Bertrand, the school manager, to the Department of Education and Science. It is necessary, at this stage, for the Department to give a very clear indication that it agrees with the inspector's report, that the additional accommodation which he <Col N="1127" /> recommends as being required is accepted by the senior authorities in the Department, that the necessary architectural drawings are prepared, that the necessary permissions are obtained and that a clear commitment to finance is given in sufficient time to enable the school authorities to proceed to organise the construction of this accommodation at a time which meets the academic timetable of the school.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister is in a position, on behalf of his colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, to give me a clear indication of the precise position at this time.</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>Mr. O'Donoghue: I have been asked by the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Martin, to apologise sincerely to the Leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Quinn, for his inability to be here this evening. He is unavoidably absent and asked me to take his place.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputy Quinn for raising the matter since it affords the Minister an opportunity to clarify the position regarding the provision of additional accommodation for St. Matthew's national school in Irishtown.</P>
    <P>This three classroom school currently has an enrolment of 99 and is staffed by a principal and three assistant teachers. The school management applied for additional accommodation in <Col N="1128" /> 1996. Following examination of that application, the school authorities were informed the Department was not in a position to approve funding for the proposed scheme due to funding constraints.</P>
    <P>Since then, this Government has given a priority to investing in the development and modernisation of school building and the level of funding provided has been increased from £27 million in the 1997 Estimates to over double that amount this year. As a result, many more long delayed and much needed projects have been able to be sanctioned. In addition, the Government has significantly reduced the fund raising burden placed on local communities in relation to school capital projects.</P>
    <P>The school authorities in this case renewed their application for additional accommodation in January of this year. The Department of Education and Science's planning unit has reviewed the accommodation needs of the school and has established the school will require four classrooms plus appropriate ancillary accommodation. A technical examination of the existing school is currently being carried out. I have been asked by the Minister for Education and Science to assure Deputy Quinn there will be no unnecessary delays in dealing with this project.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.05 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 27 April 1999.</P>

    <P>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen): I have no statutory role in relation to the private hospital system. The level of provision of health services at private hospitals is determined by private health care providers in association with the health insurance industry.</P>
    <P>On 30 March my Department was informed by the congregation of the Sisters of Mercy, who are the owners of St. Michael's private hospital, Dún Laoghaire, that the hospital is to close in the coming months. The order indicated that the decision was taken after a lengthy assessment. In particular, it referred to the unsustainable financial position of the hospital which has apparently put it at a competitive disadvantage in relation to other similar facilities.</P>
    <P>The Sisters of Mercy have indicated that several alternatives have already been considered for the premises and that the disposal of some or all of the property is considered essential. The Eastern Health Board has statutory responsibility for the provision of public health services in the eastern region and the board has indicated that it will be contacting the order to determine any possible interest by the board in the site. When these contacts are completed I would expect to hear further from the board in relation to any resulting proposals.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that St. Michael's public hospital is also located on the same campus as the private hospital and is unaffected by the closure.

The report, the first of its kind in this country, focuses on two cross-sectional studies, SLÁN &ndash; survey of lifestyles, attitudes, and nutrition involving adults aged 18 and over and HBSC &ndash; health behaviour in school-aged children &ndash; involving schoolgoing children aged nine to 17 years. I am delighted that this information is now available because it will allow those involved in planning and implementing educational, promotional and preventative strategies that seek to improve people's health to undertake this task on the basis of sound reliable data. For the first time, we have a comprehensive set of data that relate to the health behaviours and beliefs of Irish adults and young people. The report gives gender, age and socio-economic breakdowns. The information contained therein will allow for a greater targeting of interventions given age and socio-economic associations with health risk behaviours identified in the survey.</P>
      <P>It is my intention that this survey will be repeated at regular intervals and this will allow us to determine trends and allow for comparisons at regional and international level. This report will also be used, in the first instance, to inform the review of the 1995 health promotion strategy document which is now under way with a view to introducing a new health promotion strategy for the years 2000 to 2005.</P>

      <P>All medical and dental practitioners employed in the health service are obliged, as a condition of their employment, to be indemnified against claims for negligence arising out of their work for the public health services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since 1992 non-consultant hospital doctors, public health doctors, dentists employed by health boards and some other small groups of salaried doctors have been covered by a group medical indemnity scheme. The scheme was originally conceived as a measure to deal with industrial relations unrest among NCHDs who were dissatisfied with the then existing reimbursement scheme. On the basis that these groups are salar<Col N="1132" /> ied doctors and dentists with little or no private practice, it was decided to remove from them the obligation to hold individual indemnity cover and to devise a group scheme to purchase cover for them.</P>
    <P>The medical indemnity scheme was never intended to replicate the indemnity cover being provided by the medical defence organisations. Rather, it provides indemnity for the financial consequences of negligence arising from work undertaken as part of the doctors'/dentists' activities in a post approved by the Department of Health and Children in the public health service.</P>
    <P>In the years since 1992 the scheme has been amended to deal with problems arising during that period. Originally it did not provide representation at coroner's inquests. This has now been included. It was further amended in 1997 to remove ambiguities relating to cover for needlestick injuries caused to persons other than patients. The medical indemnity scheme does not provide cover for representation before the Fitness to Practice Committee of the Medical Council. It may, in certain circumstances, provide representation in other disciplinary proceedings. The Department is strongly of the view that an employer should not be put in the position of paying for a service such as this. It would not be in the interests of hospitals or doctors that they should do so, as, in certain circumstances, the hospital may be the body initiating a complaint against a doctor. It is in the doctor's own interest that he or she has a source of independent professional advice and representation. NCHDs should also be aware that they expose themselves to risk when they diagnose treat or prescribe for a relative or friend. They need to provide themselves with appropriate cover for this area of their practice.</P>
    <P>In 1992 both the Department and the Irish Medical Organisation emphasised the importance of NCHDs and others covered by the scheme taking out supplementary cover for those aspects of their professional lives not covered by the scheme. This is available from the Medical Defence Union, Medical Protection Society and the St. Paul Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department has made additional resources available to the Southern Health Board for the development of its orthodontic services in accordance with the dental health action plan. The board has now a consultant led orthodontic service in place. Six dentists with appropriate support staff provide orthodontic treatment under the overall direction and supervision of the consultant. The service is based at St. Finbarr's Hospital in Cork city. Satellite units have been developed in Mallow, Bantry and Tralee. The board provides a service of high quality and achieves a high level of service.</P>
      <P>The health boards are responsible for the provision of orthodontic services and the maintenance of waiting lists. I have had inquiries made of the Southern Health Board concerning the treatment waiting lists in its area. I have been advised by the board that currently the board can commence the treatment of approximately 1,200 new patients every year. However 1,500 &ndash; 1,600 new patients become eligible for treatment every year. At present the board is commencing the treatment of patients that were placed on the list for treatment in August-September 1996 and just over 4,000 children are awaiting orthodontic treatment.</P>
      <P>At the suggestion of my Department, an orthodontic review group was set up by the health boards to prepare a report and make recommendations on the orthodontic services. The objective of this review is to ensure equity in the provision of orthodontic treatment throughout the health boards having regard to the additional resources provided to health boards over the past few years under the dental health action plan. The group has recently made a report to the chief executive officers of the health boards who now have the report under discussion with my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1134" /> Any additional requirements for the development of the Southern Health Board's orthodontic services will be considered in the light of the report of the orthodontic review group and the outcome of the present discussions.</P>

      <Quest>the action, if any, he will take on foot of the alarming increase in E.coli infection detailed in the recent report of the Food Safety Authority of Ireland; if he has satisfied himself that sufficient information is available to the public regarding the health dangers of undercooked meat products, particularly burgers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>While there has been an increase in the number of detected cases of E.coli 0157 infection in recent years, this has been due in part to a system of reporting which was put in place in late 1996 by the new specialists in public health. They requested all laboratories to inform public health Departments of detected cases of E.coli 0157; the criteria used by laboratories to test for E.coli 0157 were expanded; and new laboratory techniques were employed. These developments contributed to an increase in the number of E.coli cases detected from eight in 1996 to 76 in 1998.</P>
      <P>I welcome the publication by the FSAI of the report titled &ldquo;The Prevention of E.coli 0157 Infection &ndash; A Shared Responsibility&rdquo;. The report notes that there is no simple solution to the prevention of VTEC (including E.coli 0157 infection) but that risk reduction measures are simple and can minimise the risk of VTEC. A preventive programme requires collaboration between all links in the food chain and notes that over-reliance on any one sector will result in a false sense of security.</P>
      <P>My Department is, as a matter of urgency, examining those recommendations in the report relevant to its area of responsibility. The FSAI will also be seeking the observations of the other relevant agencies with a responsibility for food safety. It has arranged a course of meetings with professional-industry groups and other relevant third parties to discuss the report's recommendations.</P>
      <P>The FSAI has already been building on the report's publication. The report is being distributed to over 1,700 public health personnel, comprising environmental health officers, veterinarians, public health doctors and nurses, laboratory personnel, other Government departments and agencies. Industry groups and representatives are also being issued with a copy of the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The following six user-friendly leaflets have been produced and launched by the FSAI on the same day as the report: Reducing the risk of E.coli 0157 on the Farm; E.coli 0157: Preventing the spread of infection in the Abattoir; E.coli <Col N="1135" /> 0157: Preventing the spread of infection in the Food Factory; E.coli 0157: Preventing the spread of infection in Catering and Retailing; Preventing E.coli 0157: protecting yourself and your family; E.coli 0157: protecting vulnerable groups.</P>
    <P>Five of the six leaflets specifically address the issue of adequate cooking of minced meat products. Advice on the proper methods to be observed when cooking burgers is contained in the two leaflets aimed at consumers and the farming community. The FSAI have also opened a freephone line at 1800 &ndash; 336677 to respond to inquiries from members of the public which may arise as a result of the publication of the report.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 20 and 93 together.</P>
      <P>I am very concerned that anybody engaged in sporting activities would consider using illegal substances to improve their sport related performance. It is, of course, extremely important that we try to get across to everybody, but particularly our young people, that the use of drugs in sport to enhance performance is neither laudable nor acceptable. In this context the health promotion unit of my Department has been involved with programmes that relate to this area and one of these initiatives is the health promoting school initiative referred to by the Deputy in this question.</P>
      <P>In 1991 three international agencies in Europe &ndash; the European Commission, the WHO Regional Office for Europe and the Council of Europe &ndash; launched an innovative project with the idea of integrating health promotion into every aspect of the school setting. To date, 38 European countries, with over 500 pilot schools and more than 10,000 teachers and 500,000 pupils, have joined to form the European network of health promoting schools. Ireland was one of the first countries to join this network and has been a member since 1992.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effects of various substances on the body, which include the use of drugs such as steroids in <Col N="1136" /> attempts to improve sport related performance, will be covered by the health promoting school. Schools are greatly aided in this process by using, at second level, the substance abuse prevention programme produced by the health promotion unit of my Department in conjunction with the Department of Education and Science and the Mater Dei counselling centre and, at primary level, by using the &ldquo;Walk Tall&rdquo; materials which were recently launched by my colleague the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Martin.</P>
    <P>I have no hesitation in saying that Ireland has been a very active member of this European network and last month my Department and the Department of Education and Science, along with the Marino Institute of Education, held a national conference on the health promoting school entitled Learnings from the Network. This conference sought to disseminate the learnings from the schools involved in the project to date to a wider audience and my Department officials, working with colleagues from the Department of Education and Science, are reviewing the progress made to date with this concept with a view to national dissemination enabling many more schools to participate in this initiative.</P>

      <P>In December 1997 the Government established a Cabinet committee to oversee the work of an interdepartmental working group whose task it would be to prepare a Green Paper on Abortion. Work on drafting the Green Paper is proceeding. The process involves consideration of the constitutional, legal, medical, moral, ethical and social issues which arise regarding abortion. When the drafting has been completed, I intend to convene another meeting of the Cabinet committee, when it will commence consideration of the draft. Publication of the Green Paper must await a final decision of the Government in due course. I acknowledge that the process is taking longer than expected but I would point out that any dates given by me are at all times indicative, pending final approval by Government. It is the Government's intention to refer the Green Paper, when completed, to the All-Party committee on the Constitution for consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The office for national statistics, London, has indicated to my Department that statistics on the number of abortions carried out in the final quarter of 1998 will not be available until the end of <Col N="1137" /> May. Provisional figures for the period from 1 January to 30 September 1998 indicate that 4,473 women who gave Irish addresses had abortions in England and Wales in that period. A total of 5,336 women who gave Irish addresses had abortions in England and Wales in 1997.</P>
    <P>I have made an additional £1 million, e1,269,738, available to the health boards in 1999 for the further development of family planning and pregnancy counselling services. The health boards have been asked to concentrate this additional funding on measures aimed at reducing the rate of unplanned pregnancy in women aged between 15 and 34 years, as the majority of abortions performed on Irish women involve women in this age-group.</P>

I understand from the South-Eastern Health Board <Col N="1138" /> that a full emergency ambulance service is provided to patients in County Waterford. It is understood that recent changes in practice in the deployment of ambulances in the county have been aimed at ensuring that an emergency ambulance on duty is available to respond quickly to calls in the area that it is scheduled to serve. The effective and efficient use of ambulance vehicles in this manner is crucial to providing a satisfactory emergency service to people in need.</P>
      <P>As regards transferring patients home from hospital, an ambulance can be requested for this purpose through the normal channels if it is deemed necessary by the medical staff at Waterford Regional Hospital.

      <P>I am aware that there has been a significant growth in the numbers of patients attending for renal dialysis treatment at Beaumont Hospital over the past few years. The hospital provides a haemodialysis service on a 24 hour basis and they perform 22,000 treatments approximately per annum.</P>
      <P>Over the past year or so, officials of my Department have been in discussion with the hospital regarding the development of this service with a particular emphasis on improving access and conditions for patients. As part of these discussions, my Department has stressed the importance of collaboration and co-operation between Beaumont Hospital and other service providers in the delivery of this service, particularly for patients within its immediate catchment area. Arising from these discussions, the North Dublin Nephrology Network has been formally established which is aimed at fostering collaboration between the Mater and Beaumont Hospitals in the delivery of the service within North Dublin.</P>
      <P>This year, my Department has made substantial additional funding available to the Mater and Beaumont hospitals specifically for the development of dialysis services with a view to improving access for patients. In tandem with this, my Department is undertaking a review of renal dialysis service requirements nationally, in consultation with service providers and user groups, in the context of the preparation of Estimates for year 2000.</P>

      <P>The Report of the International Narcotics Control Board for 1998 noted that there has been a significant increase in the use of legal tranquillisers and legal stimulants among the 152 States that are parties to the UN's 1961 Convention on Narcotic Drugs. The prescribing and consumption of these drugs depends on the clinical judgment of doctors, who determine that such drugs are required for the treatment of specific medically diagnosed symptoms. The board advised Governments who have recorded high levels of consumption of these drugs &ldquo;to raise the awareness of medical practitioners to the need to use such substances in a more rational manner&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In common with a number of other countries the use of tranquillisers and stimulants has increased over the years in Ireland. In some cases, this is due to the introduction of new medicines which have proven effective in the treatment of severe pain and other ailments. I am aware, however, that in some cases there has been a concern about over-prescribing of certain controlled drugs. Under the Misuse of Drugs Acts, 1977 and 1984 I have the authority to curtail or prohibit the prescribing or supply of controlled drugs by medical practitioners or pharmacists, where a need for such curtailment or prohibition is indicated.</P>
      <P>As a result of the board's report my Department will be writing to all general practitioners in the near future to advise them of the need for caution in the prescribing of controlled drugs, with particular reference to tranquillisers and stimulants.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 30 and 99 together.</P>
      <P>Article 4.3 of the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations, 1993 provides that a person who commences residence in a registered nursing home after the date of commencement of the regulations, and who has not made an application for a subvention prior to his or her admission may not apply for a subvention sooner than two years from the date of his or her admission, unless the chief executive officer of the health board determines otherwise.</P>
      <P>This provision is designed to ensure that health boards can assess the dependency of an applicant prior to entering a nursing home as a board may be able to arrange for the person concerned to be maintained at home. However, the regulations allow for exemptions from the provisions of Article 4.3 at the discretion of the chief executive officer of a health board. The chief executive officer may accept an application for subvention from a person after their admission to a nursing home where such admission is deemed to be an emergency.</P>
      <P>The health boards have assured me that where people have been funding their own long-term care and these funds have run out, they are not refused a subvention where such a refusal would cause hardship. Alternatively, an offer of accommodation in a health board extended care facility may be made. I am satisfied that the chief executive officers exercise their discretion in a sympathetic manner but if the Deputy is aware of a particular case he would like me to look into, I will be happy to ascertain the facts and report back to him.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 32 and 100 together.</P>
      <P>I was pleased to announce in recent weeks that an agreement has been concluded with the Freeman Hospital, Newcastle for the treatment of Irish patients requiring a lung or heart and lung transplant. This agreement is for a two year period and came into effect on 1 April 1999. Under the terms of the agreement with the Freeman Hospital, I am satisfied that the prospects for Irish patients requiring a transplant will be significantly improved. The agreement provides for a total of 30 transplants to be performed over the next two years, with a minimum of ten transplants to be performed in the first year, subject to the availability of sufficient and suitable organs.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Programme for Government, An Action Programme for the Millennium, contains a specific commitment to support the establishment of a heart and lung transplant facility in Ireland. I reinforced that commitment through the announcement last year of a National Initiative on Cardiovascular Health and Cardiac Services.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that significant progress is being made in advancing this commitment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year I announced that the Mater Hospital, Dublin, has been designated as the surgical site for the programme. A project team has been appointed at the Mater Hospital to plan the development of the transplant unit as part of a <Col N="1143" /> wider development programme at the hospital. A critical factor in the establishment of a successful programme in Ireland will be the training of appropriate surgical, medical, nursing and support staff. In this regard, a further agreement is being entered into with the Freeman Hospital, Newcastle, for the training and education of staff for the Irish unit, prior to it's repatriation, Irish transplant programmes have previously benefited from similar training and mentor type arrangements with established centres in the UK.</P>
    <P>The process of recruiting staff for the programme is under way. In this regard, funding has been approved by my Department for the appointment of a consultant transplant surgeon and funding is also available to support the early appointment of a consultant transplant physician for the programme. Other key appointments at the Mater Hospital which my Department is supporting include a business manager and a clinical co-ordinator who will be dedicated to the transplant programme. The overall level of staffing for the programme is at present being finalised by the Mater Hospital.</P>
    <P>I am committed to ensuring that the Irish programme, when introduced, will be in a position to match the highest international standards in lung and heart-lung transplantation. I am confident that the measures which I have outlined will facilitate this objective.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The report in question is Abuse, Neglect and Mistreatment of Older People in Ireland: An Exploratory Study, which was recently published by the National Council on Ageing and Older People. The study was commissioned by the National Council following a request from my Department that it investigate the question of elder abuse in Ireland and advise on how it should be evaluated and responded to.</P>
      <P>One of the main recommendations to emerge was that a working group should be established to advise on policy, procedures and guidelines on elder abuse in Ireland. In September 1998 my Department requested the national council to arrange for the publication of the report and suggested that an expert group be appointed, under the direction of the Council, to prepare guidelines and advise on appropriate procedures for dealing with the matters raised in the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the time there were a number of vacancies in the membership of the National Council and it <Col N="1144" /> was without a Chairperson. Because of this and the importance of the subject, the council decided to defer further action on the matter until it was back to full strength. The new appointments were made at the end of December 1998 and I understand that at a meeting of the council on 10 February 1999, the establishment of an expert group was discussed. Subsequently the matter was considered by a group of council members at a special meeting and certain proposals to progress matters were put to my Department. My Department has arranged to meet the National Council on 6 May and I expect that the functions and membership of the expert group will be agreed at this meeting.</P>
    <P>I would like to assure the Deputy that I regard any type of abuse of an older person in a serious light. What I hope will emerge from this exercise is a clear set of definitions, policies, guidelines and procedures which will lessen the possibility of abuse of an older person and where there is a suggestion that it might have occurred, agreed mechanisms for a full investigation and any appropriate responses, where required.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>An Action Programme for the Millennium identified support for older people in the home, as well as support for carers, as fundamental to improving the quality of life for older people. This is also the consensus view of the various organisations which represent the interests of older people. Accordingly, I have taken a number of initiatives this year to provide greater support to older people in their homes.</P>
      <P>The home help service is a key component in supporting dependent older people in their homes. It is generally accepted that there are a number of problems relating to the organisation and development of home help services which need to be addressed in order to realise the full potential of this service. In order to deal with the most immediate problems surrounding this service, I have earmarked a sum of £1.5 million for the development of the home help service. This allocation will be used to extend the coverage of the service by providing more hours, as well as improving training courses for home helps.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have allocated approximately £3 million to health boards this year to bring the minimum rate of payment, for all home helps, up to £3.00 per hour from 1 April 1999. I see this as part of a phased improvement in the rate of payment for home helps, the remaining phases of which I hope to implement as resources permit. The Government has decided to increase, significantly, the <Col N="1145" /> income guidelines for entitlement to medical cards for persons aged 70 years or over. This improvement, which will be introduced over a three year period, began on 1 March this year, with an increase of one-third in the guidelines.</P>
    <P>I have provided over £3 million for the further development of specialist assessment units for older people which play such an important part in the effective treatment and care of older people. This allocation is also being used to improve staffing levels in a number of extended care and day care facilities, with a view to optimising the use of these facilities. The benefits of having specialist-led services for older people attached to general hospitals are well documented and I have provided additional funding of £300,000 in 1999, to allow four additional Physicians in the Medicine of Older Age to be recruited &ndash; two in Dublin and one each in Cork and Galway. This will bring the total number of Physicians in the Medicine of Older Age to 31. I might also mention that the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs has taken measures to improve assistance to carers through the carer's allowance. He has increased by £6 the care allowance for carers over 66 years and by £3 the allowance for carers under 66 years. There will also be a once-a-year payment of £200 towards the costs of respite care. On the health side, I allocated a sum of £1 million as part of the Budget allocation for older people to health boards, specifically for the support of carers. This fund can be used for the benefit of carers in a flexible manner, based on local needs. The improvement of liaison and support for individual carers and local voluntary groups who promote the interests of carers are examples of the type of support envisaged. The Budget allocation will also enable more paramedical and nursing staff to be recruited and assigned to home care of older people which, in turn, will also assist carers. The sum of £800,000 is being earmarked for this purpose.</P>
    <P>This package of measures for older people is a continuation of a development programme which was initiated last year, with the announcement of a greatly improved capital programme for services for older people. This programme will result in significant improvements in facilities for older people. It will address what has, heretofore, been an imbalance in resources allocated between institutional and community care. The funding now assigned to the home help service, to the recruitment of additional paramedical and nursing staff in the community and to carers' support is a clear indication of this Department's intention to address the service shortcomings in the provision of appropriate community based services to support older people at home.</P>

Dental teams provide services under the overall direction and supervision of the consultant. The consultant-led service ensures a high quality of service and high service levels. Additional resources have been made available by my Department to the health boards over the past few years to enable them to develop their orthodontic services in accordance with the action plan. Seven health boards have established a consultant-led orthodontic service and all boards have achieved considerable progress under the action plan.</P>
      <P>At the suggestion of my Department, an Orthodontic review group was set up by the health boards to prepare a report and make recommendations on the orthodontic services. The objective of this review is to ensure equity in the provision of orthodontic treatment throughout the health boards having regard to the additional resources provided to health boards over the past few years under the dental health action plan.</P>

      <P>It is vital that the techniques used in screening for cancer are proved to be medically effective and accurate before screening programmes, covering large segments of the population, are introduced. Reliable screening techniques for breast cancer and cervical cancer are now well established internationally. In Ireland, the National Breast Screening Programme hopes to commence screening in the Autumn and a pilot screening programme for cervical cancer is at an advanced stage of preparation in the Mid-Western Health Board area. In both programmes, the emphasis is on quality so that the greatest possible impact can be made on deaths from these cancers.</P>

I understand from the board that all requests for emergency and urgent ambulance calls for the Dublin metropolitan area are responded to from Central Control, Townsend Street, which is staffed by controllers from both the Dublin Fire Brigade and the Eastern Health Board since February 1998.

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 38 and 88 together.</P>
      <P>While the recruitment of nurses is primarily a matter for individual employers, the overall issue of the availability of nurses is being kept under review by the Health Service Employers' Agency. The HSEA established a task force in 1998 to examine the full nature of the difficulties in recruiting nursing staff and to make recommendations on appropriate action.</P>
      <P>A HSEA survey of Dublin hospitals showed 448 vacant staff nurse posts on 15 January 1999. However, a survey of the same hospitals carried out one week later by the Department revealed a significant reduction in the number of vacant posts &ndash; down to 384 on 22 January 1999. A further survey carried out during the week ending 5 February 1999 provided an almost identical result, 384.9 vacancies.</P>
      <P>This downward trend is consistent with the increase in the number of nurses applying to An Bord Altranais for registration. The returns indicate that there is a particular difficulty in recruiting nurses for specialist areas such as theatre, intensive care, coronary care, accident and emergency and paediatrics.</P>
      <P>Health board and voluntary hospitals outside of the Dublin area have indicated that they have no difficulty in filling permanent nursing posts, but occasional problems arise in recruiting temporary or locum staff to cover sick leave, annual leave and maternity leave. The survey returns reinforce the indications given to the HSEA by hospital management that nurses are leaving Dublin and taking up positions in rural areas. The cost of housing and traffic gridlock are seen as disincentives to taking up nursing posts in Dublin.</P>
      <P>The strength of the economy is also having an impact on the availability of nurses. Nurses have enhanced mobility by virtue of their education, training and skills. In the current economic boom, they are much sought after by pharmaceutical and related companies in the private health sector, as well as by commercial concerns in other sectors. Ireland is not in a unique position in relation to the shortage of nurses. The reality is that the United States, the United Kingdom and most other European countries are also experiencing a shortage of nursing personnel. Pay rates for staff nurses are higher here than in the UK and a number of other European countries, including Germany and the Netherlands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is worth noting that An Bord Altranais report an increase in the number of nurses applying for registration which would suggest that nurses are returning from abroad. In 1998, the Board received 1,400 applications for registration from nurses abroad, compared with 939 in 1996. Conversely, the number of Irish nurses going <Col N="1149" /> abroad dropped from 1,079 in 1996 to 850 in 1998. Arising from the work of the task group, the HSEA outlined to the nursing unions in November 1998 a number of initiatives to address the shortage, including the standardisation of overtime rates and full incremental credit on permanent appointment for relevant previous nursing experience both at home and abroad.</P>
    <P>In addition, the HSEA is committed to the introduction of more flexible working arrangements for nursing staff. At present, the only options for permanent employment are full-time work or jobsharing. The absence of more flexible attendance patterns has been identified as a major obstacle to attracting nurses and midwives with family responsibilities back to work. The HSEA circulated a discussion document on a revised scheme of working arrangements to the nursing unions earlier this week. This initiative is being undertaken under the programme for partnership.</P>
    <P>My Department has engaged a nurse researcher to specifically study nursing needs for the coming years and to carry out research on the reasons why nurses are leaving their profession. When this research has been completed, my Department will be in a better position to further address the issue of nursing shortages.</P>
    <P>In relation to negotiations with the nursing organisations, the Deputy will be aware that the Labour Court recently recommended significant improvements in existing allowances for nurses working in specialised areas and who hold special qualifications. The court also accepted that there are grounds for improvements in the pay of Ward Sisters and higher grades to reflect the new roles proposed for those grades in the Report of the Commission on Nursing. It recommended that the parties enter into immediate discussions on implementation of that report, with those discussions to be completed by 1 May 1999 at which stage the parties were to report back to the court.</P>
    <P>I announced on 10 February that the Government was prepared to accept these Labour Court recommendations. Discussions between the HSEA and the nursing unions began on 16 February and an intensive programme of talks was agreed. Difficulties arose when the direct discussions got under way on 25 February 1999 and the Labour Court decided to appoint a chairman to preside over the negotiations. Intensive discussions between the parties have since taken place. Although a certain amount of progress was made in the discussions, agreement was not reached on the pay issues. The chairman of the talks reported back to the Labour Court and I understand that the Court has arranged to meet the parties again on 29 April 1999.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the views of the chief executive officers of the Dublin general hospitals regarding the difficulties being experienced for hospital beds; the number of general hospital beds available in the city in 1999; the population it serves; the comparison figure for 1979; the catchment area for Beaumont Hospital; the population growth in the Fingal area over the past decade; if he will consider the feasibility and the need for a new general hospital to cover the growing Fingal area; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[10427/99]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The total number of acute hospital beds in public hospitals in the Eastern Health Board area is 4,855, comprising 4,548 in-patient beds and 307 day beds. The most recent census of population (1996) showed that the population of the Eastern Health Board area was 1.3 million. This compares with a figure of 1.17 million in 1979. The 1996 census of population also showed that the Fingal area had a population of 167,683 compared with a population of 138,479 in the 1986 census.</P>
      <P>Each of the major Dublin acute hospitals provides a local service to its immediate hinterland. However, referral is a matter for the general practitioner in the first instance, exercising his or her clinical judgment on the hospital of choice. In addition, many of the hospitals in the Dublin area provide both regional and national specialities and referrals to these specialities from outside the Dublin area are a significant feature of their activities.</P>
      <P>There are no plans for the development of a new hospital in the Fingal area in the immediate future. The Deputy will be aware however, that I recently announced the level of capital investment in the health services for the next three years. Exchequer capital spending on the health service infrastructure which will total £525 million over the next three years, includes provision for a number of major hospital developments in the North Dublin region. In this context, it is worth mentioning one major development in particular which is under way in North Dublin.</P>
      <P>I recently gave approval to the appointment of a design team for a major capital development at James Connolly Memorial Hospital. This development will include the provision of new acute wards and the refurbishment of existing wards, new intensive care and coronary care units, a new accident &amp; emergency department and a new department of physical medicine. I am unable to give a precise timetable for this development because, like all major capital projects, the timing for planning, tendering and construction depends on several variable factors which are extremely difficult to assess accurately in advance. However, I would be hopeful that Phase 1 of the development will be completed in 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am of course, aware of the difficulties being experienced in relation to access to hospital beds. I have recently published the report of the review group on the waiting list initiative and am committed to ensuring that its recommended approach is implemented. The report recom<Col N="1151" /> mended the implementation of a range of steps to free up acute hospital facilities for more elective work. It pointed out that a significant proportion of acute hospital beds were being inappropriately used by patients who did not need, or who no longer needed, acute hospital care. This problem arises due to a shortage of places in the areas of &ldquo;step-down&rdquo; or convalescent care, rehabilitation facilities and community based services which reduce the need to use acute hospital care.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, I have provided funding in 1999 of £3.83 million for the development of Services for Older People in the Eastern Region which will be an important factor in helping to free up acute hospital beds which are currently occupied by patients who could be accommodated in more appropriate convalescent or extended care facilities or discharged home if adequate community supports were available. It will be used, <i>inter alia</i>, to improve the home help service, increase the number of nursing and paramedical staff in the community, provide support for carers, enable a number of new health board convalescent or extended care facilities to open and increase the number of private nursing home places either subvented or contracted by health boards.</P>
    <P>There are also a number of chronic sick in acute hospitals who have completed the acute phase of their illness and who are awaiting placement at a level of care more appropriate to their needs. The task of identifying and securing appropriate alternative care facilities for them is under way and this also will have a significant impact on freeing up acute beds in general hospitals over the coming months.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has chosen to raise two separate issues in this question. I will deal firstly with the issue of hours for non consultant hospital doctors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the function of local hospital management to agree work rotas with non consultant hospital doctors taking into account the nature of the service to be provided. The basic working week of all NCHDs is 39 hours. However, they are liable to be rostered to work up to an average of 65 hours per week. The 65 hour week was implemented in 1989 following a Labour Court <Col N="1152" /> recommendation and in consultation with the Medical Organisation which represents the interests of NCHDs. A mechanism has been introduced to monitor and control working hours of NCHDs as part of the revised terms and conditions of the NCHD contract of employment effective from 1 January 1997. The first stage of the mechanism, was introduced on 1 July 1995 and the complete 4 stage mechanism, to resolve any breach of the Labour Court recommendation has been in place since 1 January 1997.</P>
    <P>I would like to inform the deputy that the EU Commission has brought forward proposals to amend the Working Time Directive (93/104/EC). Discussions are ongoing between the Commission and the member states in relation to the implementation of the Working Time Directive for &ldquo;doctors in training&rdquo; and other excluded groups. These discussions have underlined the complexity of the issue of excessive hours and the difficulties in implementing the Working Time Directive for this group. Arising from these discussions it is expected that EU legislation will be brought forward shortly to deal specifically with this issue.</P>
    <P>The second issue raised relates to a proposal to extend the contracts of non consultant hospital doctors to bridge the period over Christmas 1999 and the New Year 2000. Senior health service managers have raised the question of cover over this period in light of their concerns regarding the year 2000 computer software problem. The matter has been raised with the Irish Medical Organisation by the Health Service Employers' Agency on behalf of their members. I understand that this issue is to be the subject of a meeting between the two bodies to be held next week.</P>

      <Quest>the reason for the delay in agreeing the terms of reference for the tribunal of inquiry, which he announced at the end of February 1999, into circumstances surrounding the contracting by haemophiliac and other blood product users of the HIV virus; when the tribunal will commence hearings; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>At its meeting on 23 February 1999 the Government decided that a tribunal should be established to investigate the hepatitis C and HIV infection of persons with haemophilia and the circumstances of the infection with HIV of the Kilkenny health worker following a blood transfusion in 1985. These matters are of serious public concern and have resulted in major consequences for the health of the persons concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, the proposed tribunal will have an international dimension as blood products which were manufactured abroad and imported for use by persons with haemophilia are implicated in the hepatitis C and HIV infection of such persons. Considerable attention has been <Col N="1153" /> focussed on the extra-territorial jurisdiction of the tribunal to ensure that the tribunal will be workable and be given practical terms of reference which are capable of being investigated.</P>
    <P>The current position is that the text of a motion which meets these requirements is being finalised in the Attorney-General's office. The motion will seek the establishment of the tribunal and specify the matters of urgent public importance which should be investigated. The motion will also address the issues which the Irish Haemophilia Society wish to have investigated. I expect to submit the draft text to Government shortly and, on approval, I will move the motion in both Houses of the Oireachtas as soon as practicable thereafter. Under the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act, 1921 as amended by the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) (Amendment) Act, 1979 to 1998 it is the Oireachtas that decides on whether to establish a tribunal, and if it so decides, the definite matters of urgent public importance which should be investigated.</P>
    <P>As regards a timescale for the commencement of hearings by a tribunal, this is a matter for the tribunal itself.</P>

      <P>The administration of the registration system is a matter for An tArd-Chláraitheoir, the Registrar-General of Births, Deaths and Marriages, and for local registrars who operate under his general direction.</P>
      <P>I understand that the indexes to the entries in the registers of births, deaths, marriages and the register of adopted children, which are maintained by An tÁrd Chláraitheoir, are held in a number of different formats. The indexes, which are available for searching by the public on payment of the statutory fees, are printed and bound. There is an ongoing programme of maintenance for these indexes and between 200 and 300 of the index books are repaired, replaced and rebound each year. Considering the age of the material, and the amount of use to which they are subjected, the indexes are in a reasonably good condition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, indexes for selected years, particularly post-1966 onwards are held in electronic format. The Deputy will also be aware of the special project for the capture of the records are associated indexes in an electronic format which has been ongoing in Roscommon for some time. The first stage of this work which involves scanning the records and indexes is making steady <Col N="1154" /> progress and the project will shortly be in the position to begin the development of a retrieval package. Special procedures have been adopted, including image and data quality assurance tests and regulated backup procedures to ensure the completeness and accuracy of the information captured. I am confident that these measures will ensure that the indexes to the records of the General Register Officer and the records themselves will be fully safeguarded and preserved.</P>
    <P>When this archival records project is completed, it will improve the efficiency, flexibility, access and management of the records and the associated indexes and will provide potential for the development of a range of services, which would not be possible in a system reliant on paper based indexes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Health Act, 1970 provided at Section 59(3) that a health board may make arrangements for the supply, without charge, of drugs, medicines or medical and surgical appliances to persons suffering from a prescribed disease or disability of a permanent or long-term nature. There are 15 specified illnesses covered under the long-term illness scheme and since 1975, the scheme has not been extended and there are no plans to change the scheme or to expand the number of illnesses covered by the scheme having regard to the fact that the needs of individuals with significant or ongoing medical expenses are met by a range of other schemes which provide assistance towards the cost of prescribed drugs and medicines.</P>
      <P>Persons suffering from an ongoing medical condition can avail of the drug cost subsidisation scheme which caters for people who do not have a medical card or a long-term illness book and are certified as having a medical condition with a regular and ongoing requirement for prescribed drugs and medicines. Persons who qualify for inclusion in this scheme will not have to spend more than £32 in any month on prescribed medication.</P>
      <P>Under the drugs refund scheme which covers expenditure by the whole family, any expenditure on prescribed medication above £90 in a calendar quarter is refunded by the health board. With effect from 1 July 1999, the existing drug cost subsidisation and drug refund schemes will be merged into one new drug payment scheme with a threshold of £42 per month per family unit or individual.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where an individual or a family is subjected to a significant level of ongoing expenditure on medical expenses, such as general practitioner <Col N="1155" /> fees or prescribed drugs due to a long-term medical condition such as spinal injury, these expenses may be reckoned in determining eligibility for a medical card. In some cases a medical card may issue to a family member on a personal basis. Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board to decide.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that appropriate and comprehensive support is being provided by the State through the existing range of drug schemes to those with medical expenses arising from conditions such as Alzheimer's disease. Accordingly, I have no plans to extend the number or range of illnesses currently covered by the long-term illness scheme.</P>

      <P>Vagal nerve implants are provided for patients who have intractable epilepsy and who are not suitable for surgery or who have failed surgery.

This would be normal procedure when the hospital developed its annual service plan.</P>
      <P>I understand from the hospital authorities that the number of patients being recommended for this treatment at the hospital has increased.

On receipt of the hospital's submission, it will be considered within the context of the hospital's overall priorities for the year 2000 and the many competing demands within the acute sector.</P>

      <P>My Department, through its health promotion unit, has been involved in a number of initiatives in order to improve the incidence of breastfeeding in Ireland including the production of materials encouraging breastfeeding. The National University of Ireland, Galway, with funding from the health promotion unit, has produced a training pack for health professionals which includes a breastfeeding video and information booklets. This pack was developed in conjunction with An Bord Altranais and is designed to equip health professionals with the necessary skills and knowledge to assist mothers with breastfeeding. It is recognised that the support of health professionals is critical to the success of the national breastfeeding policy as they are the first point of contact for the mother during pregnancy and after childbirth and are ideally placed to ensure that the mother receives information about the benefits of breastfeeding in order that she can make an informed choice.</P>
      <P>The Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative, which is a global campaign led by the World Health Organisation and UNICEF to encourage hospitals and health workers to support mothers to breastfeed, has recently been established in Ireland.

      <P>The report to which the Deputy has referred is the European monitoring centre's annual report for 1998 on the drugs problem in the European Union. The monitoring centre, funded by the European Commission with contributions from member states, is responsible for compiling data on drug misuse which is accurate, comparable and timely. The figures in the report relating to the use of cannabis and ecstasy are taken from a European school survey project on alcohol and other drugs (ESPAD), which was conducted in 1995. This report shows that Ireland has a high <Col N="1157" /> rate of drug misuse of cannabis and ecstasy and that figures for this country are on a par with the UK.</P>
      <P>In relation to all drugs, but particularly cannabis and ecstasy the main defence is through education and prevention. Health boards and my Department's health promotion unit are engaged in a range of prevention initiatives in conjunction with voluntary and community groups, aimed at creating a greater awareness of the damage caused by drug misuse and letting people know where they can come for help and advice. My Department has also worked with the Department of Education and Science on the development of substance misuse prevention programmes for schools and just last month my colleague, Deputy Martin, Minister for Education and Science announced the launch of Walk Tall, resource materials for primary schools.</P>
      <P>The health promotion unit provides a range of drug misuse resource materials free of charge on the topic of drug misuse to schools, and other agencies. It has also developed a drug education video, a youth support workpack and a community based drug awareness programme. Regional health boards, through their health promotion officers and drug co-ordinators are also involved in a variety of drug prevention and awareness activities.</P>
      <P>The prevention of drug misuse is a key priority, not just in my Department, but among the range of Departments and agencies involved in initiatives aimed at reducing the number of young people turning to drugs in the first instance.</P>

      <P>Following the budget I announced the provision of £1 million to the Eastern Health Board for a special initiative <Col N="1158" /> involving the voluntary sector, to tackle homelessness.</P>
      <P>The additional £1 million revenue is being used for initiatives involving the voluntary sector, to be developed for homeless young people. These include the provision of three extra flatlets as part of the Salvation Army after care service; an extension of the Focus Ireland day reception programme; an expansion of the existing Focus Ireland transitional care for homeless girls aged under 18 and the provision of a &ldquo;crash pad&rdquo; facility for children who are barred from other services. The board is in contact with the relevant housing authorities in relation to the provision of five houses in Dublin to provide accommodation for homeless children.</P>
      <P>A forum on youth homelessness has now been established in the Eastern Health Board region with representation from the key voluntary organisations, Dublin Corporation and the Eastern Health Board. In addition, the Eastern Health Board have commenced the process of recruiting a manager for the crisis intervention service. This appointment will allow for an improvement in the management of the youth homeless issue.</P>
      <P>A number of new initiatives to address the issue of child and youth homelessness have already come on stream in the Eastern Health Board area in 1999. These include an emergency residential centre for children under 12 years of age which opened in January 1999 on the grounds of Beaumont Hospital, an emergency six bed residential care service developed in co-operation with the Salvation Army for use by the out-of-hours service and operating since January 1999 and the conclusion of an agreement with St. Jude's Trust for homeless children on the provision of residential care for children under 16.</P>

      <P>Magnetic Resonance Imaging, facilities in the public hospital sector are available at Beaumont Hospital, where 5,587 patients are scanned per annum. This scanner services in-patients, out-patients and referrals from other health boards and hospitals. The service is provided during normal working hours and the current average waiting time is seven months for neurosurgery patients and three months for orthopaedic patients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1159" /> I understand that requests for MRI scans at Beaumont Hospital are prioritised using strict protocols based on medical need. I have been advised by Beaumont Hospital authorities that there is no discrimination between public and private patients for this service.</P>
    <P>I have been further advised by the authorities at Beaumont Hospital that its MRI scanner is leased to the hospital's private clinic outside of normal public hours. The booking arrangements for patients are a matter for the private clinic and do not interfere with prioritisation of public patients during normal operating time.</P>
    <P>I have already put on record that there is a need for additional capacity within the public hospital system for MRI facilities. As you are aware, my Department has agreed to develop MRI facilities at University College Hospital, Galway, St. James's Hospital and the new hospital in Tallaght and my Department is currently in discussion with the management of the three agencies concerning the installation and operational requirements for their facilities. Once these discussions have been satisfactorily conducted, I am committed to making the necessary resources available for the provision of MRI facilities at three sites. If an emergency MRI scan needs to be performed on public patients outside normal hours, these patients get priority.</P>

      <P>Government policy in relation to the care of older people is to maintain them in their own homes for as long as possible and the home help service has a key role in implementing this policy. There are approximately 12,000 part-time home helps employed throughout the eight health boards and the number of beneficiaries of the home help service throughout the country is around 20,000.</P>
      <P>Following consultations with the chief executive officers of the health boards, my Department commissioned an examination of the future organisation of the home help service in this country by the policy research centre of the National College of Ireland under the direction of the National Council on Ageing and Older People. This report The Future Organisation of the Home Help Service in Ireland was published recently and is being considered in my Department and the health boards. One of the key issues addressed was that of training and we will be paying particular attention to this aspect. I have made available funding for training of home helps to each of the health boards in the current year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1160" /> I am committed to developing the home help service as a key component in supporting dependent people in their own homes. Additional funding has been provided in the current year to bring the minimum rate of payment for all home helps up to £3 per hour from 1 April 1999. I see this as part of a phased improvement in the rate of pay for home helps. An additional sum of £1.5 million has been provided in 1999 to extend the coverage of the home help service by providing more hours, as well as training courses, for home helps.</P>

      <P>The implementation of the 1996 Budget provision concerning the retention of medical cards by persons who have been on the live register for at least 12 months and who take up paid insurable employment and also to participants on approved schemes aimed at the long-term unemployed is a matter for health board chief executives, who have statutory responsibility for the administration of the medical card scheme.</P>
      <P>Since the 1996 Budget provision took effect a number of problems relating to its interpretation and application in particular circumstances has come to light. To address these issues a joint working group between my Department and the health boards was established to examine the issue and to clarify the guidelines on eligibility for retention of medical cards. In July 1998 the report of the group was approved by health board chief executive officers who have statutory responsibility for the administration of the medical card scheme. The chief executive officers asked the group to prepare revised guidelines based on the report. These revised guidelines have now been agreed by the group and arrangements are being made to have them circulated widely. The report also recommended improved training for staff. In this context, in association with the revised guidelines, a more detailed manual for staff will be prepared.</P>
      <P>My Department has recently been made aware of the content of a survey carried out by the INOU based on phone calls to a number of health board offices. Details of the results of the survey have been circulated to health board chief executive officers.</P>

      <P>I am very much aware of public concern in relation to genetically modified foodstuffs. I wish to assure the Deputy that I am keeping this issue under continuing review and am determined to ensure that public health and the rights of the consumer are fully protected in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that the regulation governing the placing on the market of a genetically modified food provides adequate protection to consumers. Regulation 258/97 concerning novel foods and novel food ingredients provides for a pre-market approval system for novel foods, including genetically modified foods, throughout the European Union. No product consisting of or containing a genetically modified organism can be authorised for marketing in the European Union without <Col N="1162" /> first having undergone an appropriate safety assessment.</P>
    <P>A sub-committee of the Food Safety Authority of Ireland advises my Department on an ongoing basis on issues in the area of genetically modified foods and acts as a forum for the exchange of expert scientific opinion and advice on this new technology and its application to food. This committee keeps developments in relation to GMOs under regular review and it also acts as the assessment body for applications made under Regulation 258/97. This sub-committee is in the process of preparing a report on GMOs and novel foods and I await this with interest.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, last August, my colleague the Minister for the Environment and Local Government published a consultation paper on genetically modified organisms and the environment. I understand that the Minister is currently in the final stages of consultation on this paper.</P>
    <P>In addition to this, an interdepartmental working group on GMOs, chaired by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, has been established with a view to reporting with a co-ordinated overall Government position as soon as possible. The group is comprised of senior officials from my Department, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Department of Agriculture and Food, the Department of the Environment and Local Government and a representative of the Food Safety Authority of Ireland.</P>

      <P>My Department does not routinely collect information on gender mixing in acute hospital wards. Gender mixing occurs in high dependency units such as intensive care, coronary care and accident and emergency departments as well as in small geriatric assessment units. Outside of these areas, gender mixing may occur as a result of emergency medical need where no alternative accommo<Col N="1164" /> dation can be found at the time of admission. It is not possible to re-organise the accommodation arrangements for male and female patients on a day-to-day basis to correspond with the varied demand for male and female beds. Some flexibility is therefore required occasionally in order to ensure that patients who need to be admitted can be. In such circumstances patients are usually only mixed for short periods until alternative accommodation can be found. On such occasions it would be normal practice that patients would be screened off by the use of curtains etc. to ensure that a degree of privacy can be maintained.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The total number of persons on in-patient waiting lists on 31 December 1998, the latest date for which figures are available, was 36,883. I am circulating a detailed breakdown of this figure, by hospital and by specialty, with this reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While these figures show an increase over the September position, I would again remind the House that there is no simple, immediate or &ldquo;quick fix&rdquo; solution that can be applied to the problem of lengthy waiting lists. The review group on the waiting list initiative, which I established to advise me in relation to waiting list issues, emphasised in its report that an integrated series of short-term, medium-term and long-term initiatives must be taken in order to address this issue. Towards this end I have taken a number of important steps. These include allocating £20 million this year for the treatment of patients on waiting lists. This represents an increase of two thirds over the 1998 figure and is 2.5 times higher <Col N="1165" /> than the amount allocated by the previous Government for waiting lists in 1997; providing £9 million to services for older people, so that acute hospital beds can be freed up for elective work; providing £2 million to selected accident and emergency services. This will again ensure that acute facilities are more easily available for elective work, including treatments for those on waiting lists; and issuing a new policy circular and guidelines to all relevant agencies regarding the way in which the waiting list initiative should be operated in future.</P>
    <P>The report of the review group also recommended that my Department should consider introducing positive financial incentives to hospitals to reduce waiting times. In line with this recommendation, I have decided to retain some of the funding available for waiting list initiative work and to redistribute it to those hospitals which show the most progress in reducing their average waiting times.</P>
    <P>My Department has notified agencies that they will risk a reduction in their current waiting list funding during 1999 if it becomes clear that they are falling substantially below the targets agreed under their service plan.</P>
    <P>The policy circular and guidelines, issued by my Department on 7 January 1999, outline revised and updated procedures in relation to improved liaison and communication arrangements between acute hospitals and general practitioners; more effective management of waiting lists at acute hospital level; improved management of out-patient waiting lists; and clarifying the criteria for inclusion on a public in-patient waiting list.</P>
    <P>As indicated by the review group, some of these important initiatives will take some time to have an effect, but I am confident that they will do so from this year onwards. While waiting lists have increased, it is important to look also at the length of time that patients have to wait for treatment. Waiting times for cardiac surgery and ophthalmology in adults and for orthopaedics and plastic surgery in children have declined since September 1998.</P>
    <P>I am determined to take the necessary medium and long-term steps to tackle the underlying causes of unacceptably long waiting lists and waiting times. This will take considerable effort on the part of many agencies, but I believe that we will now begin to show progress in what is a complex problem.</P>

      <P>Current policy in relation to the provision of psychiatric services is based on the recommendations of the report on the development of mental health services, Planning for the Future, published in 1984. As regards the care of elderly persons in psychiatric hospitals the report recommended that patients whose needs are primarily geriatric should be accommodated separately from mentally ill patients.</P>
      <P>Demographic projections in relation to older people clearly indicates that the number of persons in this category will increase significantly over the next 20 years. This increase will require the development of specialist mental health services which will meet the specific needs of older people. Psychiatry of old age is a key area for development in line with the recommendations of the report, The Years Ahead &ndash; Policy for the Elderly, which recommended the establishment of specialised services for the elderly mentally infirm. Pending the provision of such services, health boards have been, where possible, endeavouring to provide more suitable accommodation for elderly mentally ill patients.</P>
      <P>The patients referred to by the Deputy were recently under the care of the mental health services at St. Conal's Hospital, Letterkenny which is the responsibility of the North-Western Health Board. I understand that the patients were transferred to the nursing home as it was considered to be a more suitable care environment for the patients. Prior to the patients transfer to nursing home care, each patient was medically assessed and deemed suitable for transfer. The relatives of the patients were also consulted and offered no objections or complaints prior to the transfers taking place. I believe the patients, aged 84, 75 and 74 years of age, have since sadly died but I can assure the Deputy that the deaths were not related to the patient transfers to nursing home care.</P>

      <P>I am fully committed to the implementation of the recommendations of the Finlay report and I have made available considerable resources for that purpose. The Finlay report considered that a blood service consumers' council could make a major contribution to the maintenance of public confidence in the supply of blood and blood products. The membership of the proposed council, according to the report, should comprise recipients of anti-D treatment, haemophiliacs and suffers from kidney disease. These groups are currently represented by Positive Action, Transfusion Positive, the Irish Haemophilia Society and the Irish Kidney Association on the Consultative Council on hepatitis C. This council was established on a statutory basis in November 1996 to advise the Minister on all aspects of hepatitis C.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In July 1998, I established the National Blood Users Group to support the development of best transfusion practice in hospitals and to address patients' attitudes and concerns about trans<Col N="1168" /> fusion. A national haemovigilance structure has also been established involving the Irish Medicines Board, the Blood Transfusion Service Board and representatives of hospitals to oversee improvements in transfusion practice. The principle aim of these initiatives is to improve blood safety and ensure that transfusion practice is in line with best international standards. I am at present considering how best the interests of recipients of blood and blood products can be promoted while avoiding unnecessary duplication in the existing roles and responsibilities of the various statutory and non-statutory bodies working in this field.</P>

      <P>The former Insurance Corporation of Ireland &ndash; now called Icarom plc &ndash; was taken over from Allied <Col N="1171" /> Irish Banks by the State and placed under High Court administration in 1985. The High Court administration of Icarom plc still continues and is not expected to be completed for some years. The final costs of the administration will not be known until it is completed.</P>
      <P>The Exchequer contribution to the funding arrangements for the High Court administration of Icarom plc consists of two repayable loans totalling £132 million. A loan of £100 million was advanced to the administrator of ICI in 1985 and is repayable in 2000. This repayable advance was provided by way of a loan to the Minister for Finance from the Central Bank which was funded in turn by a deposit of £70 million placed by AIB with the Central Bank and £30 million of the Central Bank's own resources. Under the 1985 funding arrangements AIB and the other banks make an annual contribution of £7 million towards the interest costs of this loan for each year of its 15-year term of which AIB contributes £5.5 million. The Exchequer does not bear any of the interest costs of this loan.</P>
      <P>The Exchequer advanced an interest-free loan of £32 million to the administrator of Icarom plc in 1993 following the conclusion of an agreement with AIB in 1992 for additional funding of the Icarom administration. The £32 million loan is repayable not later than 2012. The cost to the Exchequer of this loan is represented by the interest forgone which is estimated to amount to £2.1 million annually. Under the 1992 agreement AIB makes an annual contribution of £8.8 million to Icarom in each year from 1993 to 2012 inclusive. This contribution is in addition to the annual contribution which AIB makes under the 1985 funding arrangements.</P>
      <P>The administrator of Icarom also benefited to the extent of £38.9 million from the settlement in 1993 of an action against the former ICI auditors, Ernst and Whinney.</P>
      <P>The funding available to the administrator is expected to allow him to meet his foreseen liabilities, including the repayment of the Exchequer loans of £100 million and £32 million.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may be aware that in a reply to a question from Deputy Deasy on 5 November 1998, I indicated that the estimated net present value (NPV) of the costs of the funding arrangements now in place for the Icarom administration, that is, the sum of all past and known future payments to the administrator, is £357 million of which 56 per cent is met by AIB, 8 per cent by the other banks, 27 per cent by Ernst and Whinney (former auditors of ICI) and 9 per cent by the Exchequer. The Exchequer share of this cost would be less than the figure indicated if the Exchequer loan of £32 million were repaid at a date earlier than the scheduled repayment date of 2012. Therefore, the final cost to the Exchequer cannot be determined until the administration is completed.</P>

      <P>The setting of official interest rates for the EMU area has been the responsibility of the European Central Bank (ECB) since 1 January 1999, when the third stage of Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) began and Ireland and ten other member states adopted the single currency, the euro. The ECB is independent in setting monetary policy for the euro area and the treaty provides that neither the ECB, nor a national central bank, nor any member of their decision-making bodies shall seek or take instructions from any Government of a member state or from any other body. I have, therefore, not communicated with either the ECB or the Central Bank of Ireland in relation to the appropriate level of interest rates for the euro area, nor would it be proper for me to do so. Retail interest rates are set by financial institutions themselves in the context of competitive market conditions and I have no role in relation to them.</P>
      <P>It is true that the current low level of euro-area official interest rates, while obviously being of benefit to both business and personal borrowers, does mean that savers receive a lower yield on their investments. I have every sympathy for pensioners who depend wholly or partly on income from savings and have seen such income decline as a result of falling interest rates. However, it should be remembered that these lower interest rates are accompanied by low inflation which safeguards the purchasing power of savings and investments. I would also like to draw attention to the fact that an individual or couple, where one or more is 65 years of age or over, may be entitled to a refund of Deposit Interest Retention Tax (DIRT) paid on savings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mention the following benefits to pensioners living off savings and investments, which I announced at the presentation of the 1999 budget last December. In cases where retired people who derive an income from investments are also in receipt of the contributory old age pension, they will benefit from the pension increases <Col N="1173" /> announced in the 1999 budget. The increase for a pensioner couple will be £9 per week, which will bring the weekly payment to a couple both aged over 66 years to £148.90. In addition to the 1999 social welfare package, a special 50 per cent contributory old age pension will be paid to self-employed contributors who were over the age of 56 in April 1988 &ndash; when social insurance for the self-employed was introduced &ndash; and who have at least five years paid contributions. This measure will provide a significant additional income to all who are eligible for the special pension, including those who derive income from investments.</P>
    <P>In addition to the above improvements, a key priority of the Programme for Government is to increase the personal rate of contributory old age pension to £100 per week. This will represent a further substantial real increase compared with the 1999 payment rates.</P>

    <P>These figures were collected in the context of a value for money report on the emergency ambulance service carried out by the Comptroller and Auditor General published in November 1997. As a first step towards routine response times monitoring, I have asked each of the health <Col N="1174" /> boards to ensure that response times data for emergency and urgent calls be collected and analysed on a quarterly sample basis ending 31 March 1999. This data is due to be submitted to my Department by the health boards shortly.</P>
    <P>The Deputy should, however, be aware that while response times are an important indicator of performance for ambulance services, it is also important to focus on quality of care and clinical effectiveness. In this regard, a standard patient report form has been introduced to facilitate the development of clinical audit in pre-hospital care. In addition, appropriate clinical care standards to underpin the developments currently taking place are at an advanced stage of development and will be brought into use later this year.</P>
    <P>The development of more explicit standards for performance measurement is a key element of the implementation of the health strategy in the ambulance service. In this regard, funding has been provided to each health board both in 1998 and 1999 for the development of ambulance response times and quality of care monitoring.</P>

      <P>Since 1965 an arrangement has been in place whereby the Air Corps provides air ambulance transport to health boards for emergency cases. This service is generally provided in emergencies requiring the removal of badly injured or very ill persons over long distances, particularly where they cannot be safely conveyed by road ambulance. The service is also provided for the removal from the islands of persons requiring urgent hospital attention when weather conditions are such as to make boat transport impossible or hazardous to the patient. Since August 1991, the marine search and rescue helicopter service of the Department of the Marine, which operates from Shannon airport, is also available for air ambulance transport in cases of emergency.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the role which a dedicated air ambulance service could play in enhancing the effectiveness of the ambulance service. However, proposals for the development of an air ambulance service must be placed in the wider context of developments in emergency medical services generally and any initiative in this area must complement other pre-hospital resources such as the ambulance service and first responder programme. The particular role of air ambulance was examined by the standing committee on air ambulance services. The standing committee undertook a detailed examination of a number of independent proposals for the establishment of a dedicated helicopter emergency medical service which were received from groups interested in this area. Meetings took place with a number of these groups.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1175" /> Following these meetings, officials of my Department have worked with other interested parties to clarify a number of issues regarding needs, costs and benefits deriving from having a dedicated and purpose-equipped air ambulance service.</P>
    <P>I remain committed to further improving pre-hospital care services and I have allocated an additional £2.7 million for developments in the field of pre-hospital care in 1999. This funding represents the largest ever increase in resources for this area and will assist considerably in improving emergency medical services.</P>

    <P>Tallaght Hospital is in the process of building 70-75 private/semi-private beds which is an additional facility to the hospital and is being developed and financed by the hospital itself.</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>In relation to the catchment areas for these beds, strategy for the development of acute hospital services is based on the achievement of self-sufficiency within each health board area in the delivery of regional specialities. This means that the services are being developed through the provision of networks of local general hospitals which provide high quality medical and surgical facilities for their local catchment areas, larger regional hospitals which deliver services in a broad range of regional specialities across a health board area and a smaller number of tertiary or supra-regional hospitals which serve much wider catchment areas in particular specialities, enabling resources to be concentrated nationally to the best effect.</P>

      <P>In announcing its intention to have the medical card income guidelines doubled for those aged 70 years and over the Government stated that this measure would be implemented over a three year period beginning on 1 March this year with an increase of one-third in the guidelines, and with similar increases in 2000 and 2001. In the absence of detailed information on the distribution of income among those who did not qualify for a medical card prior to 1 March, it is not possible to state exactly how many people will become eligible as a result of the improvement in the medical card income guidelines. Estimates suggest that about 30,000 additional persons will qualify over the three year period. My Department is monitoring the additional uptake of the medical cards resulting from the increased income guidelines.</P>

      <P>I have no plans to introduce legislation banning the use of sunbeds. Existing consumer legislation sets standards for tanning equipment and requires appropriate warning notices to be displayed on the equipment.</P>
      <P>The advice given by the Department of Health and Children is that sunbeds should be used in moderation and that people should seek the advice of their family doctor before doing so for the first time. In certain circumstances exposure to sunbeds may constitute a hazard. Sunbeds should not be used by children under 18, persons who burn easily or tan poorly, those taking drugs or cosmetics thought to be photoactive, those suffering from skin disorders induced or aggravated by exposure to sunlight, those with a history of skin cancer and those with risk factors for cutaneous melanoma. A consumer information sheet on possible risks from tanning equipment and the appropriate precautions to take is available to the public from the Irish Cancer Society.</P>
      <P>Sunbeds are widely used in beauty salons by beauty therapists who offer cosmetic tanning as part of their services. Guidelines on the use of sunbeds in beauty salons were drawn up by the Society of Applied Cosmetology which represents beauty therapists. These guidelines incorporate advice from the Irish Medical Organisation and the Irish Cancer Society on appropriate precautions to be taken by sunbed operators to protect the health of clients.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware from a number of questions which I have answered in the House in relation to this drug in the past, the Irish Medicines Board, which has statutory responsibility in this area, carried out a full review of the safety and efficacy of this product as part of the assessment of the renewal of the product authorisation in 1998 and also as a result of new safety information regarding the development of neuropsychiatric reactions, including depression, suicide and suicide ideation.</P>
      <P>As a result of this review, the board required that the summary of product characteristics in relation to the product be amended to reflect the new information which had become available. In particular, the revised warnings approved by the board for inclusion in the prescribing data and patient information leaflets included the following:</P>
      <P>Special Warnings and Special Precautions for Use</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Roaccutane may cause depression, psychotic symptoms and rarely suicide attempts and suicide. Discontinuance of Roaccutane may be insufficient and further evaluation may be necessary. Particular care needs to be taken in patients with a history of depression and all patients should be monitored for signs of depression and referred for appropriate treatment if necessary.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Undesirable Effects:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Depression, psychotic symptoms and rarely suicide have been reported with Roaccutane.</P>
      <P>A letter, approved by the board, drawing attention to the possible development of depression and suicide was issued by the company to physicians in May 1998. In addition, the Irish Medicines Board Drug Safety Newsletter of September 1998, which is distributed to doctors, dentists and pharmacists, also contained details of the revised warnings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would stress that it is a condition of the product authorisation that availability of this drug is subject to its prescription and monitoring of its use by a consultant dermatologist. Whilst I would emphasise to patients that they should read carefully the patient information leaflet supplied with the drug and consult with their physicians concerning any problems or difficulties that may <Col N="1190" /> arise in the course of its use, there is also a responsibility on physicians prescribing the drug to ensure that their patients are fully advised as to the possible side effects.</P>
    <P>With regard to the second part of the question, there is a legal responsibility on the company, as a condition of its product authorisation, that it keep a record of reports of adverse effects associated with the use of the product and that it furnish the board with copies of any such reports of which it has a record or of which it is aware. A further condition of the authorisation requires that the company should inform the board of any information received by it which might alter the validity of the data provided in support of the authorisation or which would further the understanding of the substance or its effects or may alter the directions for the use of the product.</P>
    <P>I am advised by the Irish Medicines Board that it currently understands that all information on Roaccutane, required under the conditions applicable to its product authorisation, has been made available to the board by the company. At the same time, the board has had ongoing discussions with the company regarding its pharmacovigilance responsibilities, (i.e. the monitoring and reporting of adverse reactions), and it is continuing to monitor the functioning of the company's pharmacovigilance unit.</P>
    <P>I want to stress that the board continues to monitor the safety of the use of Roaccutane and to this end it has asked the company to undertake a surveillance programme to monitor the use of the product in Ireland. Details of this surveillance programme are currently being finalised between the board and the company. The board is also aware of ongoing epidemiological research into the safety of Roaccutane. The results of these programmes and studies will be fully evaluated when available and the board, in line with its statutory responsibilities, will take whatever action in relation to this product as may be deemed necessary.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 107, 108 and 114 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of people on the waiting list for hip joint replacements at 31 December, the latest date for which figures are available was 1,590. It is estimated that approximately 15,000 procedures were carried out in 1998 using funding of £12 million from the waiting list initiative in specialties such as orthopaedics, including hip <Col N="1193" /> replacements, ear nose and throat procedures, ophthalmology, including removal of cataracts, general surgery, vascular surgery, such as treatments for varicose veins, and cardiac surgery.</P>
    <P>Information regarding persons who are waiting to be placed on the waiting list for treatment is not routinely collected by my Department. I have provided a total of £20 million for waiting list activity in 1999, which represents a 66 per cent increase over the amount allocated to waiting list activity in 1998 and 2.5 times more than the previous Government provided in 1997.</P>
    <P>The report of the review group on the waiting list initiative, published last year, emphasised the need for immediate, medium-term and longer-term measures to address the underlying causes of waiting lists and waiting times. I am committed to implementing the recommendations of the group and towards this end, in 1999 I have also allocated £11 million to services for older people and accident and emergency services, which will free up acute beds for waiting list work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to say that I am providing revenue funding of £1.679 billion in the current year towards the provision of a comprehensive general hospital service. This figure represents an increase of £151 million or 10 per cent over the provisional out-turn for 1998. Included in this amount is £20 million to tackle waiting lists, £17.3 million for general service developments, £11.5 million to new unit facilities, £6.7 million to support a range of developments under the cancer strategy and £5.5 million under the cardiovascular strategy. The increased level of resources is indicative of the commitment of this Government to investment in provision of a quality health service.</P>
      <P>I am also pleased to report that a three year programme of capital investment for the period 1998-2001 will see an additional £525 million invested in the health services compared to the 1995-1997 period when only £309 million was spent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On taking office I recognised the urgent need to invest additional capital resources in the development of the health service infrastructure. In this regard I am pleased to report that a package of major hospital developments &ndash; which are at construction or planning stage &ndash; will be funded in 1999. These include the Mater, St James's Hospital, Naas, St Vincent's, Elm Park, Limerick Regional, Tullamore, Portlaoise, Clonmel, Cashel, Mayo Portiuncula and University College Hospital, Galway. I am also providing £10 million in the current year towards the cost <Col N="1194" /> of replacing medical equipment and for minor capital works in the general hospital system.</P>
    <P>In terms of activity, the number of patients treated annually in the general hospital system continues to rise. Provisional figures for last year indicate that some 540,000 in-patients were treated in public hospitals. A further 270,000 patients were treated as day cases, an increase of 8 per cent over the previous year.</P>
    <P>One by-product of advances in medical technology is that people are living significantly longer. This means that they are likely to continue to present for treatment, often for unrelated illnesses, as they grow older. On average those over the age of 65 years consume four times more hospital and community resources than the rest of the population. The National Council for Older People has projected an increase of nearly 30 per cent in the population aged over 65 from 1991 to 2011 and, even more significantly, an absolute increase from 74,000 to 130,000 in the number of persons aged over 80 years in the same period.</P>
    <P>At the other end of the age structure a significant increase in the number of births is now taking place. In 1997 there were 52,000 births which was 4,000 or 8.5 per cent up on the 1994 number. There is evidence that this increase is continuing and putting additional pressure on maternity and paediatric units.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the changes in demography which are particularly pronounced in relation to the very young and the old are placing significant pressure on health care costs because these two groups are the most intensive users of hospitals and other services. Against this background I was very pleased that for the first time a sum of £2 million was included in my Deparment's Estimate this year specifically in respect of demographic pressures.</P>
    <P>It would be my Department's intention to continue to refine the extent to which demographic pressures are taken specifically into account in agreeing the level of funding to be made available for the health services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Deputy's question relates to special hospital care and needs in the psychiatric services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The policy governing the provision of psychiatric services, including in-patient care in psychiatric hospitals, otherwise referred to as special hospital care, is based on the recommendations of the report on the development of psychiatric services, Planning for the Future, published in 1984. A key recommendation of the report which is central to psychiatric service policy is that all <Col N="1195" /> psychiatric hospital admissions, where possible, should be to acute psychiatric units attached to general hospitals. This policy is supported by voluntary bodies representing the interests of persons with a mental illness as part of a broad approach to the development of a modern psychiatric care through a shift in the provision of psychiatric care from a predominantly institutionalised service to one which is delivered to patients in the community and is integrated with other health services.</P>
    <P>The development of acute psychiatric units attached to general hospitals is being actively pursued with a total of seventeen such units now linked to general hospitals and a further ten units in the planning stage of development.</P>
    <P>

    <P>111. </P>
    <P>Mr. Durkan asked the Minister for Health and Children the number of permanent residential places identified as being required in the special hospital services areas; the proposals, if any, he has to address this issue; and if he will make a statement on the matter. [10654/99]</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Deputy's question relates to residential places in the psychiatric services and, in particular, to residential places in the community for persons with a mental illness.</P>
      <P>The report on the development of psychiatric services, Planning for the Future, published in 1984 contained recommendations relating to the provision of residential accommodation for persons with a mental illness. These recommendations together with other wide ranging recommendations have formed the framework of successive Government policy on the development of psychiatric services. The report recommended, in 1984, that the requirement for community residential accommodation in a catchment area of 100,000 population with a backlog of existing long-stay patients would initially be approximately 100 places with one quarter to one third of these places in supervised community residences. The report estimated that the long-term requirement would be lower than this and would probably be in the region of 60 places per 100,000 population.</P>
      <P>Considerable progress has been achieved since the publication of Planning for the Future in the implementation of the recommended levels of community residential places. In 1984 there were 121 community residences providing 900 places. In 1997 the number of community residences was 391 providing 2,878 places which compares favourably with the recommendations of the 1984 report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the transfer of persons with a mental handicap from psychiatric hospitals, my Department, in conjunction with the health boards and voluntary organisations, has been engaged in a programme to transfer persons with <Col N="1196" /> a mental handicap from psychiatric hospitals and other unsuitable placements to more appropriate care settings. It has been the policy of my Department for some fifteen years that persons with a mental handicap should not be admitted to psychiatric hospitals unless they have an underlying psychiatric disorder which cannot be appropriately treated elsewhere.</P>
    <P>In 1996 the national intellectual disability database identified 329 people with a mental handicap in psychiatric hospitals who had been assessed as requiring a transfer to more appropriate placements in the mental handicap services, and a further 634 people who were assessed as being appropriately placed in their current service. Updated information in relation to 1998 will shortly be available, with a further report on 1999 data due later this year.</P>
    <P>Funding has been made available in 1999 to continue this programme and I will continue to address this issues in the future.</P>

      <P>The number of children aged 18 and under with an intellectual disability requiring residential and respite care is set out below, based on information on the national intellectual disability database at 30 September 1996. Updated figures based on the position at December 1998 will be available shortly.</P>
      <P>According to the database, there were a total of 9,607 children aged 18 and under with intellectual disability, and of these 8,198 children were receiving day services; 659 children were receiving five day or seven day residential services; 20 children were receiving residential support services, including respite, only; 161 children required a service but were not receiving one; and 569 children had no current service requirements.</P>
      <P>These figures reflect the children's primary service. The majority of the children in residential services were also receiving a day service. Some of the children who were in receipt of day services would also have received residential support services, including respite. Day services in this context include a range of educational services, including pre-schools, special schools and mainstream schools.</P>

This funding will pro<Col N="1197" /> vide approximately 320 new residential places; 80 new respite places and 200 new day places. It will also provide additional health related support services for children with autism, continue the programme to transfer persons with an intellectual disability from inappropriate placements and provide additional specialist and other support services.</P>
    <P>Information on children with physical and sensory disabilities, or those with mental health needs, who require residential and respite care is not readily available within my Department. Each health board has been asked to provide the information and I will be in touch with the Deputy directly as soon as the information is received and collated.</P>

      <Quest>the number of patients on hospital waiting lists awaiting heart surgery; the average length of time these patients have been on this list; the longest any such patient has been listed in the past 12 months; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>Adult cardiac by-pass surgery in the public health sector is currently carried out at three centres, the Mater Misericordiae Hospital Dublin, Cork University Hospital and since September 1998, St. James's Hospital, Dublin. Paediatric cardiac surgery is carried out at Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children Crumlin.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, public patient waiting list statistics are collected by hospitals and furnished to my Department on a quarterly basis. At the end of December 1998, the most recent period for which information is available, there was a total of 776 adults awaiting cardiac surgery over 12 months, and 380 waiting for three to 12 months. There was a total of 57 children awaiting cardiac surgery over six months, and 16 waiting for three to six months.</P>
      <P>Regarding average waiting times and length of time on the cardiac surgery list for patients, the Deputy may wish to know that, on foot of the recommendations of the waiting list initiative review group report, agencies are finalising the validation of their waiting lists in line with the policy circular and guidelines, issued by my Department on 7 January 1999. I will revert to the Deputy at the earliest opportunity with this information which should provide a more comprehensive and accurate picture of the situation regarding details of waiting times for cardiac surgery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that, in 1998, I allocated funding of £2.3 million under the cardiac surgery waiting list initiative, with the specific aim of reducing the national cardiac surgery waiting list for adults and children. In 1999, I have made provision for the allocation of £4 million under the cardiac surgery waiting list initiative and I am <Col N="1198" /> confident that this funding will build on last year's success in reducing the total number of adults and children on the waiting list. The impact of the 1998 cardiac surgery waiting list initiative was to reduce the overall numbers waiting, adults and children, at the end of December 1998 by 142. This represents a reduction of over 10 per cent on the figure for December 1997.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Health and Children, my priority is to address the existing cardiac surgery waiting lists and the ultimate objective is to achieve an average six month waiting period for those on the lists. I am confident that the development of additional adult public cardiac surgery facilities at St. James's Hospital, Dublin and University College Hospital, Galway will help reduce the waiting lists which exist at present. Target activity levels are in the region of 450 procedures annually at St. James's Hospital and 300 procedures at UCHG. This additional activity will increase existing adult public cardiac surgery capacity by over 50 per cent. I am also developing additional children's cardiac surgery capacity at Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin in association with the National Cardiac Unit, Mater Hospital to provide for up to an additional 100 cardiac procedures for children. This additional activity will increase existing paediatric cardiac surgery capacity by up to 40 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 119 and 120 together.</P>
      <P>The Department of Social Community and Family Affairs' grant schemes provide support for community and personal development work undertaken by a wide range of local self-help groups, including women's groups and men's groups. This support is provided under a number of different schemes. The individual schemes are designed to meet different aspects of the support</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>needs of local groups and are linked to form an overall framework of support and progression path for community and family support groups at different stages of development. It is acknowledged that disadvantaged women and men, in both urban and rural areas, can experience particular problems arising from poverty and marginalisation and that women's groups, men's groups and community groups generally have an important role in tackling these problems. Particular emphasis, therefore, is placed in the various grant schemes operated by my Department on support for community-based initiatives tar<Col N="1201" /> geted at disadvantaged women and men. Schemes of particular relevance in this regard are the: community development programme; family and community services resource centre programme; community development education and training grants scheme; scheme of grants for locally-based community and family support groups.</P>
    <P>The community development programme was established in 1990 in recognition of the role of community development in tackling poverty and disadvantage. The programme provides financial assistance to projects towards the staffing and equipping of local resource centres which provide a focal point for community development activities in the area and to other specialised community development projects and initiatives having a strategic importance. The projects provide a range of supports, development opportunities and services to community groups and individuals within their areas. However, work with women and participation by women are high priorities across most projects in the programme and four of the projects funded under the community development programme are specialist women's projects. At present there are some 107 projects participating in the programme or in the process of being set up.</P>
    <P>In 1994, to mark the International Year of the Family, an allocation of £250,000 was made available by the Department to fund a number of family resource centres. The decision was motivated by the perception of a possible gap in statutory support for community development activities focused on support for families and tackling child poverty. Ten centres were funded on a three year pilot basis and all centres are characterised by a focus on work with disadvantaged women and men.</P>
    <P>An evaluation of the work of these centres was published in 1997. The key recommendation of the report was that funding of these centres should be mainstreamed by this Department as a family and community services resource centre programme. In addition, the Commission on the Family, in their submission on the 1998 budget, considered that these centres have significant potential as a primary preventive strategy and endorsed the recommendation for significant expansion of the Department's funding programme to support a network of centres throughout the State.</P>
    <P>Recognising the important role played by these centres in supporting families, this programme was expanded in 1998, with an additional 29 centres being funded in that year. The 1999 Budget again provided extra resources to allow some 20 to 25 new centres to be funded this year.</P>
    <P>The total provision for both community development programme and the family and community resource centre programme was: 1996, £4.6 million; 1997, £5.6 million; 1998, £7.759 million.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1202" /> The purpose of the community development education and training grants scheme is to fund training and education initiatives aimed at enhancing the effectiveness of local community and voluntary groups. Responsibility for administering the scheme transferred to my Department from the Combat Poverty Agency in 1997. The following are details of the number of grants and amount of money spent under this scheme in 1997 and 1998: 1997, £158,715, 99 grants; 1998, £116,489, 85 grants.</P>
    <P>A substantial portion of the above were grants to local women's and men's groups.</P>
    <P>My Department has for many years provided assistance to voluntary and community groups for community development and personal development activities undertaken by them under a number of individual once-off grant schemes as follows: scheme of grants to locally-based women's groups; scheme of grants to locally-based men's groups; and scheme of grants to lone parent groups. The emphasis in the three schemes was on making small grants to a relatively large number of locally-based groups involved in programmes of self-help and personal development designed to tackle poverty and disadvantage using a community development approach. Following evaluations of the women's and men's grants schemes and the change of name of my Department to reflect its wider community and family focus, and an internal review by my Department of the overall package of supports proved by the Department for community development and family support groups, a new scheme of grants to community and family support groups, integrating the former schemes of grants to locally-based women's groups, locally-based men's groups and lone parent groups, was introduced in 1998.</P>
    <P>In essence, it was decided to streamline the separate schemes because having three separate such schemes had proved to be unduly inflexible in that it tended to force some groups to seek to fit into a category narrower than their actual work, e.g. family support groups, traveller groups, local community development groups, and did not explicitly cater for other disadvantaged target groups; disabilities, for example, where numbers of local self-help groups have emerged in recent years. The amalgamated scheme continues to provide supports for exclusively women's, men's and lone parents groups, while also giving the Department the flexibility to respond to the needs of local community development groups that comprise both men and women and family support groups that focus on helping individuals and communities in the family context. It also recognised the reality that many of the groups funded in previous years under the women's grants scheme were broader community and family support groups whose work was focused on a <Col N="1203" /> range of target groups as well as disadvantaged women.</P>
    <P>As was the case previous with the three separate schemes, the scheme of grants for locally-based community and family support groups provides grants towards the cost of activities engaged in by local groups. The costs that can be met under the scheme include tutors fees, training materials, cre±che facilities and other running costs. A separate grants scheme, the scheme of grants to voluntary organisations, provides funding for equipment, premises and other once-off, 'tangible' items. Women's and men's groups are eligible to apply and, indeed, have received funding under this heading down through the years.</P>
    <P>I must emphasise that the integration of the three schemes referred to above does not mean that exclusively men's or exclusively women's groups are no longer eligible for funding. It has <Col N="1204" /> eliminated the problem of 'mixed' groups, e.g. traveller groups, people with disabilities, having to be squeezed into an artificially narrow funding category before they can be considered for funding. However, the opposite does not apply and the scheme expressly continues to provide for exclusively women's or exclusively men's groups.</P>
    <P>In addition to the main scheme, a total of 36 more established community groups groups-networks are in receipt of three year core-funding in the range £8,000 to £35,000. This category of funding came into being in 1994, when 19 women's groups and networks were funded and has been expanded each year since. Of the groups at present being funded, 27 are women's groups-networks and one is a men's network.</P>
    <P>The following table sets out the amounts allocated and the number of men's and women's groups which received funding under these schemes, as outlined above, in the years 1996 to 1998 inclusive:</P>

      <P>It is proposed to answer Questions Nos. 121 and 122 together.</P>
      <P>No application for disability allowance has been received from the person concerned. However, my Department has issued an application form to her and a decision will be given on her claim as soon as it can be determined whether she satisfies the means and medical conditions which apply to the disability allowance scheme.</P>
      <P>Free schemes such as free electricity allowance, free TV licence and free telephone rental allowance are available to people, living in the State, aged 66 or over, who are in receipt of a welfare type payment, and who are living alone or with certain specified excepted people. They are also available to certain people with disabilities under that age who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments. In addition, widows-widowers between the ages of 60 and 65, whose late spouses had been in receipt of the free schemes, retain that entitlement.</P>
      <P>The spouse of the person concerned was in receipt of these free schemes prior to his death. However, he person concerned, who is in receipt of a widow's contributory pension, is not entitled to these allowances as she is under 60 years of age.</P>
      <P>If she is awarded disability allowance, she would also be entitled to the free schemes, based on the information supplied in her recent applications for free electricity allowance-free TV licence and free telephone rental allowance.</P>

      <P>There is a shortage of technicians in the telecommunications section of the Garda Síochána which is impacting on the progress in implementing CCTV systems. I am having this problem addressed as a matter of urgency through the recruitment of a significant number of additional technicians and the recruitment process is well under way at present. However given recruitment-selection procedures and training etc. realistically it will be some months before the technicians will be available to commence work on existing or new projects in the telecommunications area, including CCTV.</P>
      <P>I am, however, very keen for CCTV to be installed in all of the prioritised areas, including Finglas, as soon as possible and I have instructed my officials to pursue the issue with the Garda Síochána and to explore all avenues for expediting matters. I would expect that progress will soon be made in this regard.</P>

      <P>My Department does not have details of the total number of pupils with special needs within the overall education system. The report of the special education review committee, published in 1993, estimated that approximately 8,000 pupils with special educational needs attend <Col N="1207" /> mainstream primary schools on an integrated basis. It is estimated that there are approximately 10,000 pupils with special needs enrolled in special schools or in special classes attached to mainstream primary schools.</P>
      <P>The lack of adequate statistical data relating to special needs children within the education system and the development of mechanisms to address this deficit is one of the issues currently being considered by a special steering group which has been established in my Department to review overall provision in the special needs area.</P>
      <P>I recently announced a major development in special education services under which all special needs children in the primary system are now entitled to an automatic response to those needs. The response may take the form of additional teacher or child care support, or both, depending on the needs of the particular child. My Department will shortly be issuing circulars and information notes to advise schools on the procedures to be followed, including the supporting data required, in seeking special support under this initiative. The data required will include particulars of the individual special needs children involved; their ages; and the nature of their special needs.</P>
      <P>The data submitted by schools is expected to provide a comprehensive picture of the level of special needs within the primary system. If, following receipt of this data, it is considered that further survey data is required, the necessary arrangements will be made.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 129, 130 and 131 together.</P>
      <P>To date 15 teachers have been granted restricted recognition by my Department under the provisions of Circular 19/98.</P>
      <P>Restricted recognition is applicable to teachers who have qualified teaching status in another country, who possess the qualifications or experience outlined in paragraph 2 of Circular 19/98 and who wish to teach in this country in special schools or classes in which Irish is not a curricular requirement.</P>
      <P>Since the circular was introduced in May 1998 I have broadened the criteria under which teachers are eligible for restricted recognition. In addition to the criteria outlined in paragraph 2 of the circular, restricted recognition will now also be granted to teachers who have received provisional recognition under Circular 19/96, recognition in national schools of EU qualified teachers, and who have satisfactorily completed one year's teaching experience in a special school or special class. Similarly a person with qualified teaching status from another country who successfully completes a relevant post-graduate qualification in this State, will also be granted restricted recognition.</P>
      <P>In assessing applications for restricted recognition, submitted by teachers from the United Kingdom and other countries on the basis of the teaching experience they have gained in such countries, my Department must have regard to the relevance of that teaching experience to the needs of children in special schools and classes in this country. Experience or skills gained by such teachers in a mainstream setting in other countries would not normally be equivalent to the type of experience or skills required for teachers in special schools or classes in this country.</P>

      <P>The person referred to by the Deputy did apply to my Department for restricted recognition to teach in special schools and special classes under the terms of Circular 19/98.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, her qualifications did not meet either of the requirements as set out in paragraph 2(a) or 2(c) of the circular.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Firstly, the post graduate qualification which she possesses is in fact a post graduate certificate in education (PGCE), which is a constituent part of her teacher training. It is not a qualification in <Col N="1209" /> a particular aspect of special education relevant to a special school or special class as is required under paragraph 2(a) of the circular. Furthermore, her teaching experience has not been gained in a special school or class with children diagnosed as having serious disabilities as required under paragraph 2(c) of circular 19/98, but has been gained in a mainstream capacity with children who have learning difficulties. Accordingly paragraph 2(c) of the circular did not apply in this case either.</P>
    <P>As it was not possible to equate the applicant's qualifications or experience to the type of qualifications or experience as required under the terms of the circular, it was not possible to grant her restricted recognition. However, in view of her qualified teaching status from the United Kingdom, the applicant has been provisionally recognised under the terms of Circular 19/96. Such recognition allows her to take up positions in national schools for a period of up to three years, during which time she must acquire the Irish language qualification. Subject to her successfully passing the Irish qualification exam, and attending an approved Gaeltacht course, she would be accorded full recognition to teach.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1211" /> In addition to the salary scale all teachers are paid an allowance in respect of qualifications. These allowances vary depending on the level of qualification. Teachers who hold posts of responsibility i.e. principals, deputy principals, assistant principals and special duties teachers are paid additional allowances for those posts. The allowances for posts of responsibility were increased by 28 per cent in accordance with the PCW agreement with the teacher unions.</P>
