        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to discuss an issue of major public importance &ndash; the decision of the Government to ignore the wishes of the Irish people by moving to bring the country into an affiliate of NATO known as Partnership for Peace without a major national debate on the implications of this move and a referendum of the Irish people.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take No. <i>a</i>10, motion re Ministerial Rota for Parliamentary Questions; No. 1, Education (Welfare) Bill, 1999 <i>[Seanad] </i>&ndash; Second Stage (resumed); and No. 2, Criminal Justice (United Nations Convention Against Torture) Bill, 1998 <i>[Seanad]</i>&ndash; Second Stage. It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that No. <i>a</i>10 shall be decided without debate.

      <P>I am sure the House wishes to convey its sympathy to the British people on the tragic loss of life in the train crash near Paddington in London over the last 24 hours. This is a very serious blow to people in Britain and, as <Col N="1090" /> their nearest neighbour, Irish people would wish us to express our sympathy to them at this very sad time for many families and for the British people, generally.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>When I heard about the terrible tragedy yesterday I contacted the Prime Minister, Mr. Blair. At that stage the number of casualties had not reached the unfortunate height they have now. The latest report is that the number will rise even higher. I join the Leader of the Opposition, on behalf of the Government parties, in extending our sympathy to those bereaved, to those injured and to the authorities involved. I hope their investigations will help to avoid such things in the future but today our sympathies are with those who have been bereaved and their families.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that 3,000 people have had operations cancelled and are being earmarked to be discharged from hospital as a result of the pending withdrawal of service by the nursing profession in hospitals? Is the Taoiseach aware that a two week strike could lead to a backlog in the hospital services of up to 18 months in its effects? Will the Taoiseach take urgent steps to bring the sides together to see if a resolution can be found to this potentially tragic and deadly dispute.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Taoiseach has indicated that time will be allowed next week for a debate on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Taoiseach's attention been brought to the request by the president of SIPTU, Mr. Jimmy Somers, for a personal intervention by himself and if his office has brought to his attention the remarks made by Bishop Darling to the SIPTU conference yesterday on the same matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the matters mentioned by Deputy Bruton. The discussions are going on between the health employers' group and the trade unions concerned to try to ensure <Col N="1091" /> that the emergency levels will be in existence during the course of the dispute, if it happens. The Government hopes that the Labour Court award will be accepted and that matters will continue to be dealt with through the normal channels but that is a matter for debate.</P>
      <P>I am also aware of what Deputy Quinn said regarding the request made by trade union leaders and leaders of the churches.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that the problem is not simply one of what are described as emergencies? People awaiting elective surgery will die. It is not enough to say that emergencies will be dealt with. People can die in chronic pain over a long period. Others die quickly in an emergency. Already 3,000 people have had their operations cancelled, and many of them will die before those operations are carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach elaborate on what he means by discussions because he has, perhaps inadvertently, given the impression that there are discussions between both sides? I understand him to mean that there is discussion between the Department of Health and Children and the employers' organisations, but there is no direct discussion between representatives of the nurses on the one hand and representatives of the Department of Health and Children on the other. Is that correct?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The discussions I referred to are the same as those I mentioned yesterday &ndash; the discussions about emergency levels. In terms of industrial relations discussions, there are no discussions. The Labour Court offer is there &ndash; the Government has accepted it; it wants to pay it and to implement it. This is the third incremental increase for nurses. Incremental increases were offered in February 1997, February 1999 and September 1999, which were substantive. I have set down on the public record how these matters could be resolved and it is a matter for the sides to consider whether they can accept that, but we can move on if the Government offer &ndash; which, effectively, is £30 million on the claim, £37 million to staff nurses &ndash; is accepted. Hopefully, they will accept it.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree, given that there is still almost two weeks before possible strike action, there is a window of opportunity to see if this dispute can be resolved? Will he authorise the Minister for Health and Children &ndash; or, alternatively, sideline him and take up the job himself &ndash; to open discussions with the nursing unions to see if this dispute can be resolved on a reasonable basis?</P>

      <P>I asked the Taoiseach yesterday about the Whistleblowers Protection Bill and he said it was at select committee. This term is taken up on the schedule of legislation that has been circulated, but I do not think it has any meaning. The Bill is either in select committee or it is not. There is no such thing as it being at select committee. The whistleblowers' Bill, which I introduced on behalf of the Labour Bill, is not at select committee.

With regard to his announcement in the House on the Order of Business on the granting of limited work permits, have procedures been put in place to grant any, given that it is now some two months after that announcement? Have any been issued? In relation to the protocol that we negotiated on the Amsterdam Treaty, is it now the intention of the Government to participate in a European-wide asylum entity and is that part of the negotiations that will take place in Tampere? As part of that, under what legislation is the fingerprinting of asylum seekers now instituted by the Government?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On the first matter related to the regulations, regulations are in place on the work permits. On the negotiations that will take place in Tampere, that matter will be discussed next weekend or, if not, the weekend after. The aim is to try to get a common approach to this matter. I spelt that out here yesterday. On the fingerprinting issue, which is the subject of an EU directive, this matter will be before the House next week. This is an EU-wide directive to try to deal with the illegal trafficking of refugees who are being abused at present on an enormous scale.</P>

        <b>: </b>In reply to Deputy Deasy's question on liquor licensing legislation, the Taoiseach indicated that the Government will bring forward proposals in due course. Does this mean that the Intoxicating Liquor Bill, which is now on Second Stage, will be dropped, or that new additional proposals will come on stream or that we can envisage further amendments? In the light of the furore over the banning of the <i>In Dublin </i>publication by the censorship board, a decision subsequently overturned by the courts, is it envisaged that the legislation on the censorship of publications will be updated?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>It is unacceptable that one-third of Irish children live in poverty. Ireland has the second highest national rate of child poverty in the European Union. What is now required is the introduction of real measures to invest in children and to help to tackle poverty seriously. Tackling educational disadvantage is a crucial element in tackling poverty and social exclusion. Measures in this area should include expanding the early start pre-school programme.</P>
      <P>A recent report on school funding criticised the way in which specific funds for educational disadvantage can be used for any requirement schools may wish. The funds can be used for any purpose and there should be more controls in this area. Whether a school is designated as disadvantaged depends on its principal's assessment of the status of the first pupils in terms of housing, parenting and financial status, literacy and numeracy. The availability of extra funding may lead some principals to over-estimate the numbers of disadvantaged pupils. Conversely, others may under-estimate the numbers because of the perceived stigma involved. The present system of providing funding to update schools rather than for designated disadvantaged pupils leads to inadequate funding in some areas, particularly for the disadvantaged in small towns in rural areas. The fact that a school can be designated as disadvantaged and receive funding provided does not necessarily mean the funding is going to the people who need it.</P>
      <P>The Education (Welfare) Bill is a totally inadequate response to the problem of early school leaving. Early school leaving will be resolved only by providing support services to enable schools to offer a range of assistance to pupils at risk of early school leaving. Resources will also be needed for out-of-school activities in the community. The integration of communities in working closely with schools and community development, particularly play groups, is very important. These are under-resourced and in some instances depend on FÁS funding for their continuity. This Bill recognises the wider canvass in which early school leaving must be addressed, but fails to do anything about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of shortcomings in the Bill. It is strong on the compilation of detailed records of attendance but it is silent on the issue of what services will be available to support pupils who show signs of persistent non-attendance. The former School Attendance Act, 1926, was also strong on setting the obligations on schools to maintain records of attendance. However, the Department allowed the system to fall into disuse. What evidence is there that this Bill will be any different? The management of schools, caretakers and the amount of services available in schools is totally inadequate. This is why there <Col N="1101" /> are huge difficulties, particularly in the area of primary education.</P>
    <P>There are more than 200,000 pupils in classes of 30 or more pupils. At present 80 per cent of principal teachers must combine their full-time teaching responsibilities with their administrative duties. More than 500 schools do not have access to a remedial teacher. Shared remedial teachers generally have so many schools to cater for that the service provided is often minimal. Given these shortcomings, the introduction of this Bill is of no advantage to schools when the facilities that should be in place are not.</P>
    <P>The pupil-teacher ratios for special schools and special classes set out in the special education review committee report have not yet been fully implemented. Due to a major shortage of substitute teachers, each day thousands of pupils are in the care of unqualified and untrained personnel. Some 42 per cent of substitution hours were provided by untrained personnel in 1997. There are 8,000 children with special needs attending mainstream schools on an integrated basis without minimal support services. The most recent allocation of remedial teachers included 13 clusters comprising four schools, eight clusters comprising five schools, ten clusters comprising six schools and two clusters comprising seven schools. Half of the State's full-time students are at primary level but only a quarter of the funding goes to primary care.</P>
    <P>Many of the most exciting initiatives dealing with poor attendance and early school leaving have come from area-based partnerships and community initiatives. Yet nowhere in the Bill is their role even mentioned, let alone given recognition and resources. This is a major oversight. This service cannot succeed if it does not recognise and harness the work of community groups. It is evident that within educational development the role of the community and the observation of the child in school are very important.</P>
    <P>The insistence of the Minister on a national rather than a local structure has given rise to some extraordinary features in the Bill. It demands that every one of the 4,000 schools should submit a strategy on early school leaving to a centralised bureaucracy. This is a major shortcoming. It is similar to mission statements being displayed on the inside of a wall whereas most companies display them publicly. However, implementation of mission statements in certain businesses can leave a lot to be desired. It will be difficult for two teacher and one teacher schools in particular to deal with even more red tape.</P>
    <P>The Bill seeks to impose co-operation across a range of services in a top down manner by establishing a liaison group of 49 different organisations. This will become a hopeless talking shop instead of a practical integration at local level where professionals could work in teams supporting a family and review individual needs in case conferences. Having 49 different organisations liaising seems totally unreal because while certain organisations work in tandem with schools, there <Col N="1102" /> is very little evidence of this being the case at the moment. If 4,000 schools are expected to submit a report to the Department, someone will have to assess the mission statements of principals in these schools. This might look well on the wall but will there be unannounced on-the-spot checks to see if this is being implemented? </P>
    <P>In business there are hygiene audits &ndash; and these are important to ensure high standards. It is equally important in the education system that there should be unannounced audits carried out on schools in order to check quality. Schools should be given awards based on an internal audit. Upon inspection there should be a classification code on the core principles of facilities, caretaker facilities and so on. Given that there are tidy towns awards, there should also be school awards &ndash; they would be individually audited, depending on whether they are two teacher, three teacher or five teacher schools. This could involve students and the school could receive an award based on the attendance of children.</P>
    <P>The Bill waits until a child has been expelled and links with the school have been irrevocably broken before it considers the sort of personal supports the child might need. This is a case of closing the stable door after the horse has bolted. It should be easy for school principals to identify problem children from different social backgrounds where there is a regular pattern of non-attendance. This is perhaps the most serious flaw in the Bill. Instead of an early warning system and timely intervention, the Bill offers intervention only when disaster has struck. We all know parents who ensure that their children have full attendance in school but it is easy to identify children who do not attend school and who drop out early because they believe school is a hindrance. This Minister must look again at the assessment of problem children. Children might be highly intelligent but they may not be given encouragement in their home environment. The welfare officer should identify and visit these homes and encourage parents to ensure their children attend school.</P>
    <P>The problem would be much more difficult to solve with a welfare officer holding an inquiry into the matter. The Bill is strong in placing statutory obligations on schools and parents, but it is weak on the role and duties of the new educational welfare service. The Bill shows no appreciation of the necessary partnership that must be developed.</P>
    <P>There is no clear role or function for welfare officers under the statutory obligations. Is this a pilot scheme? Will there be an integration of schools working on this matter? Will welfare officers just talk to principals or will they meet parents? As regards the role of management boards, I read in yesterday's newspapers that the Tories have given a commitment that, if re-elected to office in Britain parents will be given rights to block the re-appointment of management boards that do not function properly. I do not say that is the situation here but school man<Col N="1103" /> agement boards should be fully familiar with the difficulties concerning the integration of departmental regulations and the enactment of education legislation.</P>
    <P>One can establish arrangements in legislation but it is important that such legislation operates effectively in each school. In addition to there being problem schools, some teachers are more dedicated than others and a number of teachers are suffering from burn-out. It is quite understandable when one considers the amount of responsibilities they have, from caretaking to secretarial roles. FÁS finds it difficult to replace school caretakers and secretaries and this puts considerable pressure on teachers who also have to teach.</P>
    <P>The Bill is almost silent on the rights of the child. I was interested in what Deputy Michael Higgins said yesterday &ndash; that the rights of the child should be clearly outlined to parents and the children themselves. That is the most important aspect of all. The appointment of an ombudsman for children has been spoken about for some time and it could easily have been incorporated into the Bill. Children have no legal right to support services, nor is there any provision for an appeal for children or their parents who believe the State is not offering the necessary placement or support.</P>
    <P>Yesterday's <i>Irish Independent</i> reported the case of an autistic child whose parents were never told that the school bus would not take the child to school. The school was notified that the service would not be continued, yet the parents of that child were left waiting. That story demonstrates a lack of communication which should not happen. I saw a photograph of the parents with their son in the paper yesterday. They were left totally in the dark, waiting on a bus to bring him to school, yet the bus did not turn up. That should not happen in this day and age when we talk about welfare and awareness in the educational system. The system failed in that case.</P>
    <P>The sections of the Bill dealing with unemployment have been approached from a very narrow perspective. The Bill offers a bureaucratic registration system for taking up employment by young people who have dropped out of school. However, it ignores the far greater problem of young people who are still in school but whose working hours totally disrupt their schooling. Many children at second level work part-time, including at weekends, but there must be some control of the level of hours they work.</P>
    <P>The Bill develops the idea of a personal plan once a young person has dropped out of school, however, it is notable that the Bill confers no right to a suitable placement for such a young person. In addition, employers have no obligations concerning continued studies for such young employees. IBEC has stated that the new school attendance legislation does not place any obligation on employers for early school leavers in their employ to continue their education in <Col N="1104" /> some form. This is despite a suggestion last month by the Minister that the Bill would include a scheme under which all unqualified school leavers under 18 would have to maintain their links on a part-time basis with the education system. Possible constitutional problems, if the legislation were to impose obligations on employers which might conflict with the right to work or property rights, are understood to be the reason for the absence of such a scheme. However, departmental sources said the discussions were continuing with employers.</P>
    <P>Little incentive is given to employers, particularly in the services sector, to encourage early school leavers to continue their education, whether through a VEC or other courses. That area should certainly be developed. The sections of the Bill dealing with employment contain shortcomings. The Minister is looking for a huge act of faith on the part of the public because agencies established by this Bill will do things which are not spelled out in the legislation. People might be willing to make this act of faith if the Department had a record of fulfilling its obligations in this area. However, the Department is deeply culpable for its failure to honour its obligations under the School Attendance Act, 1926. That legislation has been on the Statute Book for over 70 years but it has failed dismally. It is a little ambitious to think that the Bill will change matters dramatically.</P>
    <P>Primary school authorities are required by regulation to pay a local contribution before they receive their annual grant. This is not a requirement for post-primary or third level institutions, despite the fact that the Constitution guarantees free primary education for every child. <i>Pro rata</i> funding at primary school level &ndash; the most critical period of education &ndash; is inadequate. I know there are some very fine schools and the Minister has introduced some innovative ideas since taking office, but there are areas, such as computer technology, where the system has failed. In rural areas, schools may have only one or two teachers but no remedial teachers or speech therapists.</P>
    <P>The Education (Welfare) Bill should upgrade the School Attendance Act, 1926, but early school leaving will only be resolved by providing support services. Adequate resources must be provided in that sector as well as in the pre-school sector. Crèche facilities are needed for parents who are returning to work as more jobs are created. They face huge financial difficulties due to the high cost of purchasing a house. Existing crèche facilities are totally inadequate and I am very concerned about them.</P>
    <P>During the local election campaign, I was astonished to come across up to 35 children under the age of two in a bungalow where two people were running a crèche up to 5 o'clock in the evening when parents would rush to collect their children at the door. The television was on and only two people were minding 35 children. I hope the forthcoming budget will start at the bottom, <Col N="1105" /> so to speak, by providing funding to parents and children to allow them some comfort.</P>
    <P>We have all heard about the Celtic tiger but there is a great amount of poverty. The Bill must provide parents with the financial resources to ensure that their children receive the best possible care. Tax breaks are important but they will benefit middle income earners. We must look at those who need the greatest support &ndash; those who have no tax benefits and who need £20 a week to ensure their children are in safe hands.</P>
    <P>The Bill's provision for primary care is important but I would like a clearer opinion on how it will actually work. Will the welfare officer visit homes before the problem arises? It is too late when a child has already been expelled from school. In such circumstances it is unfair to classify a child of ten, 11 or 12 years in fifth or sixth class as being disruptive.</P>
    <P>Ireland falls short of meeting the requirements of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, according to a report to the United Nations. The convention, which was ratified by Ireland in 1992, covers such areas as child protection, education, poverty and freedom of expression. The report, Enlightened Small Voices: Vital Rights, was written by the Children's Rights Alliance, which represents child welfare and parents' organisations. Launching the report, Mr. John Bennet, co-ordinator of children's rights said:</P>
    <P>In accordance with the convention, children have the right to survival and development. The right to development is at times denied some Irish children.</P>
    <P>That is an awful statement in the current economic climate. I appeal to the Minister, at a time when we have £5 billion to spend, to give the money to the people &ndash; those of the next generation &ndash; who will be our greatest asset in the new millennium. We must ensure that resources are put in place in order that they may embrace the future to the best of their abilities.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Education (Welfare) Bill, 1999, because it sets itself a number of aims and, in doing so, a number of challenges. Stating that each child has a right to a minimum education is something we understand but it is also something which needs to be defined. That in itself will be a challenge for the Minister. The Bill also recognises the right of parents to choose the type of education they want for their child, a right which is recognised in the Constitution but which is now given a statutory basis. More than anything else, it clarifies the State's role in relation to education. When seen in conjunction with the Education Acts recently passed, the Bill will finally set our education system on a firm legislative footing. However, its main aim is to encourage school attendance and the full participation of children at all stages of our education system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill, when passed, will not only uphold the Constitution, it will work in conjunction with all <Col N="1106" /> other agencies, complement the initiatives recently passed by the Minister and ensure that everybody can benefit from it. However, it is important to focus for a moment on who exactly is targeted by the Bill. Is the target the juvenile offender? Is it one of the 15,005 people mentioned in the last Garda report, of whom 4,500 were referred for larceny and burglary, of whom 804 were charged with possession of articles of intent &ndash; which I take refers to kids hanging around the streets mostly carrying knives &ndash; or, even a sadder reflection on our society, the 115 who were begging on our streets, most of whom, I am sure, were begging on the streets of Dublin? Many of those children were under the age of 15 and they should have been in full-time education. More dangerously, is the Bill targeted at the 32 people who were charged and referred for offences dealing with the railway, those children who have nothing better to do except lie in front of an oncoming train and cry &ldquo;chicken&rdquo; before seeing who is the last one to leave the railway track? That is not to mention the 1,000 people who were referred for drink related offences at a young age.</P>
    <P>Is this Bill focused at the young people referred to in the report of the National Crime Forum, which refers to young people with a low value on education who have difficulty coping with school, who develop a low self-esteem and see few signs of hope in the depressed environment in which they live? Is it the people who are more attracted by the immediate gain of money than a long-term job which they might obtain if they would only finish their school education? Is the Bill focused on children for whom school is not relevant, who see no point in studying history because they see no future for themselves? Is it aimed at the children who have very poor parental support, parents who themselves never had the opportunity and who, therefore, do not value education for their children? Is it aimed at those children I have met in Barnardo's in Loughlinstown who can be pointed out to me at the age of three or four as the people who will end up in our prisons? This Education (Welfare) Bill refers to each of those children and to many more.</P>

      <P>No. This Bill takes a holistic approach to students, families, schools and State agencies working in conjunction with each other. It is long overdue because it is high time we updated the outdated legislation of 1926. In my years of teaching I never laid eyes on a school attendance officer. I did not know they existed or what were their duties. However, where they did exist the focus was on punishment, it was negative and was directed towards parents who knew no better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is frightening when one learns that each year 10,000 people leave school without qualifications. That figure really only represents two per school <Col N="1107" /> and two in any school generally go unnoticed. However, 10,000 people together represent a quota in a five seat constituency or the population of a good sized town in the middle of Ireland. If you put those 10,000 people into a stadium, into the Hogan or Cusack stands, and tell them, &ldquo;All of you are in danger of not getting a job, of being the underprivileged people of society, of turning towards drink and drugs&rdquo;, there would be an outcry. These are the people to whom we must refer. Economic success has not reached these people but we can prevent that pattern continuing into the next generation if we focus properly at this stage. We can do that by bringing the partners in education together and encouraging them to work together for the good of the child.</P>
    <P>Whereas one would automatically think we are focusing on disadvantaged areas and disadvantaged children, and of course we are, in effect we are talking about every school in Ireland because many children move outside their local areas to attend school. I ask the Minister, when allocating resources, not to look at the geographical location of a school but to consider its profile and its catchment area. Just because a school is situated in Blackrock does not mean the children who attend it are all privileged. With the availability of buses and the DART, children come from a wide variety of backgrounds and they need extra guidance, counselling and remedial care.</P>
    <P>One of the main features of the Bill is to increase the school leaving age to 16, something of which I am totally in favour. However, school must be made encouraging for children. It must be more than merely the implementation of a law. It must start at pre-school level and track children from then on. One of the most beneficial systems in ensuring that children stay in school is the home-school liaison officer. Most of these people are very valuable in a local community. When I look at St. Kevin's in Sallynoggin, where the home-school officer, in two months, has invited in the parents and established a parents' room. Not only does this person deal with parents on a personal level. She even telephoned me last week to see if I could help in the transfer of a woman and her five children from her two bed accommodation to a house. That is the type of communication and system which will work for the benefit of these children.</P>
    <P>As a secondary school teacher, I have always been concerned that these children get lost in the system when they leave primary school, particularly in an urban setting. In the average rural town, most people will go from the local national school to the local secondary school. The choice is so great in urban areas that children become lost between the different schools. I would put the onus, difficult though it may be, on primary schools to compile a list of where each of their sixth class students has gone. Each second level school should send back to the original primary school the list of students who have registered with them so that we know where they are. That <Col N="1108" /> would mean that the work of the welfare board at national level could be made more simple by bringing it down to local level.</P>
    <P>The challenge in each school for first year students and first year parents is one which must be met and is the most valuable time for any student starting off at that level. The Bill refers to the code of discipline and the rules of conduct, etc., for the school. When I was transition year co-ordinator I asked parents, students and the school to sign a contract to the effect that we each understood our responsibilities in relation to the provision of the course for that child. All parents and children should do this before they enter the school so that we can ensure there is a link and that we are not contacting parents only when a child is in trouble.</P>
    <P>I particularly welcome the provision which states that parents must notify the school of absences and the reason for them whether it be illness or something else. Too often we see notes from parents to the effect that a child is sick. The child might have a headache or some other sort of pain. I was always very happy to tell the child that it would probably recur for the rest of her life. However, when a student is 14 or 15 a pain seems to be a good enough reason to leave school. Parents need to take more responsibility for children who have not only missed a full school day but the last class of the day or the first class in the morning. This is the beginning of a trend towards absenteeism.</P>
    <P>The school also has to create an environment which fosters an appreciation of learning. The appreciation of learning comes from the general school environment and not just from the academic work. We have to ensure that students enjoy what they are doing in school and participate in extra curricular activities. We need to encourage the people in our schools who are the focus of the Bill. We must encourage them and build up their self-esteem. It is much easier for a student not to try and to be criticised for not trying, than to fail and be humiliated for being a failure. The old saying &ldquo;mol an óige&rdquo; should be kept in mind when we are talking about the 10,000 children who leave school early without any qualifications.</P>
    <P>The curriculum and subject choice is crucial to encouraging children to stay in school. I welcome the Minister's initiative in changing the primary school curriculum and the focus on many subjects at second level. Chaith mise na blianta ag múineadh Gaeilge. One of the short stories I taught for many years to a junior certificate class was about the radar powers of a bat, an sciathán lathair, which was a technical, scientific short story about radar as gaelige. I have never come across anything more irrelevant either to the Irish language or to the academic value for those students than that short story. It has since been dropped and replaced with stories which are equally inappropriate.</P>
    <P>I read in the Education and Living supplement yesterday about the need for physics and chemis<Col N="1109" /> try teachers. A huge gap exists between the junior certificate and the leaving certificate. In many instances students at foundation level in the junior certificate course are not capable of taking even the pass level in the leaving certificate. This gap needs to be bridged if we are to ensure that children leave our schools with a qualification.</P>
    <P>The other way in which schools can help is by involving their students in student councils, giving them a role at that level in the management of their school but, more importantly, giving them an ownership of their school. In order to do this schools need administrative assistance and remedial services. They need not just a guidance counsellor but a career guidance teacher and a counsellor because the problems being faced by young people today are such that they need that extra support and advice.</P>
    <P>I am particularly pleased the legislation on the ombudsman was not included in this Bill because that would have implied that all children's problems related to schools whereas in fact it is parents, families, homes and the outside school situation. I encourage the Minister to offer early retirement to those teachers who seek it because if a teacher wants to leave a school, the school wants that person to go for the good of the child.</P>
    <P>The Bill recognises the role of parents in education, both inside and outside of the home, and guarantees the quality of education. It recognises their responsibilities also. I admire parents who have a low level of education but who appreciate the value of it and who make sacrifices for their children. I understand the parents who feel they need to allow their children to work but I do not understand the parents who have a good level of education, good jobs and who are not experiencing financial difficulties who take their children out of school to go on holiday in May and September because it is cheaper. Some regulations should be brought in to not only focus on parents but on the travel companies who go out of their way to target family holidays during the school term. The last and the first month in school are crucial but parents do not seem to realise the importance of that.</P>
    <P>Parents do not seem to appreciate the detrimental effect on students who work during the school week. Section 25 focuses on young people working during the school day. I realise employers need employees but I blame the employers who enter into contract arrangements with students whereby they will not let them work the hours outside of school time but insist on them working Thursday, Friday and all day Saturday. Bar and lounge work is such that students come into school almost falling asleep because they have been up so late at night. The Bill states that all restrictions on working will apply during the school day but the Minister has not yet defined a school day. Those regulations need to be introduced and in this context the school day should be defined as any day on which there is school. It should not be a school day which ends at 3 o'clock or 4 o'clock. I do not want to see <Col N="1110" /> students leaving school at 3.30 p.m. to go straight into work so that homework cannot be done. More importantly, such students lose out on all of the extra curricular activities which make a school environment pleasant. I ask that the hours be restricted, and that we define a school day as being from Monday to until 5 p.m. or 6 p.m. on Friday to ensure that our school children are not being exploited.</P>
    <P>We recognise the role of parents in the Bill. It is not sufficient just to talk about their role and their responsibility or about the role and responsibility of the teachers in relation to the board. I want to see the partners in education being members of the board. I realise the Bill states that people who have a particular interest and involvement in the education system will be on the board but we must ensure that the people who are directly involved get the recognition they deserve.</P>
    <P>That 16 to 18 year olds will now be registered is also welcome. I know of a girl who left school happy to earn her money as a hairdresser but a year later she developed a skin allergy and can no longer engage in the type of work for which she had opted. She is lost to the education system. Nowadays we know more about the young girl who leaves school because she is pregnant and who believes she is not being encouraged to return, and we can make the link between the education system and her new life. The new focus on every child recognises that everybody under the age of 18 is entitled to an education and that is an important feature of the Bill.</P>
    <P>There are major challenges in the Bill because the expectations of education have changed. I wish the Minister well in trying to define a minimum level of education. Expectations in the past were concerned with basic literacy. Expectations now deal with our requirements for careers and the fact that people may change careers a number of times during their lifetime. The Bill is challenged in ensuring that at a national level it can relate to the 3,700 schools throughout the country. It is a challenge to ensure that principals and schools do not become bogged down with paperwork but that the system can be allowed to flow freely. There is a challenge to ensure that it can work in conjunction with other agencies by giving them the proper resources. The results of this Bill, when taken with all the other initiatives, will ensure that we have literate young people and that we have an educated population, but more importantly, that the maturity they gain from being in education will ensure that down the road the juvenile offenders I referred to will be far fewer and that our society will be a happier place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad not many speakers referred to the wonderful education system we have, because that would not be true. It is a wonderful education system if you are two things &ndash; bright and rich. If you are bright and you are in a class of 36 or 37 pupils, you can pick up what is going on, but if you are not bright you will fall behind. I agree with Deputy Hanafin. The problem is that many children fall behind in school. Because of the education system there are 36 and 37 pupils in a class and the pressure teachers are under means they are unable to identify children's problems at an early stage. We lose pupils and they fall behind from first class until primary school is finished.</P>
      <P>Whether we like it or not we have a major problem with literacy. Many people leave education without being able to read or write. That is why I do not agree with those who say we have a wonderful education system. If you are rich you can send your child to a boarding school. However, if you are not rich and your child falls behind, that child has no hope of being identified and given the special care he or she needs.</P>
      <P>Society puts much pressure on parents. The first pressure is financial and forces both parents to work. There are also many lone parents, which is also a major problem. Many women without husbands must look after their families and there are men without wives or partners who must care for their children. That creates pressure because one parent must be both father and mother. These parents cannot always give the children the time and commitment they need when they come home and this in turn leads to further problems.</P>
      <P>Many parents have raised the issue of curriculum with me; Deputy Hanafin mentioned it also. The curriculum has been changed over the years &ndash; at one time we learned Latin in school and at another we learned through Irish. We learned different things that had nothing to do with life in the wider world when one had to work. I refer to those who did not go to third level and who left school at an early age. They learned subjects that were of no benefit to them in the outside world. They found that Latin was not much good to them and that in some cases Irish was not much good either. You would have a teacher beating you with a stick if you could not multiply 100 by 100 by 100, but that was not a lot of good when you went out into the world. When students leave sixth class there should be a test to ensure that every child is checked for two simple things &ndash; that they can read and write. If they cannot, they should not be allowed into secondary school. It is very simple.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, this cannot happen without resources. We talk about free education, but there is no such thing. Pressure is exerted on parents when children look for money almost every evening to assist the school. It is incorrect to say we have free education, though the Minister of State and his officials may disagree. Schools are crying out for money every day. My child's secondary school looked for £25 or £30 last week. <Col N="1112" /> There is nothing wrong with that. I can afford it and have no problem paying it, but what about a family with five or six children who need shoes, clothes and books? The parents may be unemployed and there may only be social welfare going into the house, yet the child cannot go to school and say they cannot give this £25. The parents will try to find it. This is happening in primary schools.</P>
    <P>I am not picking on the Minister of State's constituency but I am using it as an example and do not want him to take it as an offence. I had a different attitude to education and law and order until I canvassed in by-elections in different parts of the country. We have rural problems and urban problems. In a recent by-election I canvassed in Southill where there are thousands of houses but no facilities for young people, such as community halls. There are 3,000 or 4,000 houses just shoved into one area and nothing there for them. In built up areas all over the country parents have problems with drugs or drink and their children are neglected. These parents are not interested in putting pressure on their children to go to school and those of us who are parents know that if you do not keep pressure on children to go to school they will try to avoid going at the first opportunity.</P>
    <P>However, I now see children who enjoy going to school because they are being taught in a different way. They enjoy what they learn. I did not enjoy school because of some Christian Brothers. I am not being critical of the Christian Brothers because a fair percentage of them, and the nuns, did a wonderful job, but there were a few bad eggs in both organisations, particularly the brothers, where there were some awful savages. I was misfortunate in my school days to have met three savages, which is the only way I can describe them. They had the stick and it was the stick that ruled, not education. You were fine if you were upper class and there were plenty of them in my class. The brothers would put the arm around them and love them and they were very good to them, but if you were working class or from a housing estate, the stick was what you got. That was all they knew. That turned people against education and turned children from going to school. I remember people who were in my class that we were able to assist in later life, but some of them finished up badly simply because the education system failed them. It failed them because they were not identified as having problems when in school; there were 38 or 39 children in my class and those who fell behind were left behind. All they got from the Christian Brothers was stick, stick, stick. As Deputy Hanafin said, when these people went out into the world it is no wonder they ended up involved in crime, as they saw no future. I refer to Southill again &ndash; what is the difference between Mountjoy Jail and some of these housing estates? There is nothing there for people to enjoy or go home to and they can see no future. I blame all Governments, not <Col N="1113" /> any particular one, for creating these kinds of ghettoes and doing nothing about them.</P>
    <P>One might ask what has that to do with this Bill; it has a lot do with it. The Bill deals with those who fall out of education and how we are to assist them, particularly those under school leaving age and who should still be at school. There are many problems to address, but I give the nuns in my area full credit for their work in this regard. There were problems in a housing estate where parents said they could not assist the children because they were not educated enough themselves and could not understand the curriculum. They were looking for help in assisting their children with their homework. The nuns went to some parents' houses and then they got a little building where nuns, parents and children did the homework every evening. The children and parents said they got better and better until the children began to enjoy school and the parents began to enjoy helping them. However, the nuns had problems. They could not get a building. They could not get assistance to provide a building. We will be talking about the major housing problem tonight, but in housing estates with more than 20 houses built in the future, a community building should be provided which could be used for this work and it should be assisted by the State. The necessary resources should be given to the primary sector.</P>
    <P>In rural areas we have a different problem regarding children and the Minister knows this because I have written to him and put down parliamentary questions on school transport. Some children aged four have to walk a mile and a half to get a school bus. In fairness, it is not easy to give resources to everything but I thought the Bill might provide for this. In some rural areas children get up at 7 a.m. to be in school by 9.15 a.m. and do not get home until about 6 p.m. It is not right, young children should not have to get up that early or get home that late. They are so exhausted they cannot learn and cannot be expected to do another half hour or hour of work when they get home. Some of these children are only four, and the first thing they want when they get home is a good meal.</P>
    <P>The problem of children having to get up early can be seen in rural and some urban areas. It is time to make resources available with the assistance of parents &ndash; if money is needed it should be given  &ndash; to provide school dinners. To begin with, the State should make available as much money as possible but the parents should make a contribution. We could then be sure that children were getting at least one good meal a day.</P>
    <P>A major complaint about this Bill concerns the liaison officers. We must provide the resources, put these people in place and monitor the children. If we don't look after the children who will we look after, particularly at primary level? If children get a good primary education they will have a good start and society will not face as many problems if they get the start they need. Teachers with up to 37 children in a class cannot <Col N="1114" /> check on each child's progress, whether a particular child has a problem, is being interfered with, is not being washed or looked after, etc. The teacher should be able to tell someone there is a problem and ask that it be investigated.</P>
    <P>Many children are not being looked after properly &ndash; I stand over that statement. The health boards do not have the resources and do not move in time when they get a complaint. Many children live in terrible circumstances and their only relief is when they go to school and get away from the home. It is sad that on the verge of the new millennium some children still go to school hungry and come home afraid, and that there is no one to do anything for them. We should not be afraid to say this is happening. Our primary aim must be to protect children and we should provide whatever resources are necessary to do so.</P>
    <P>On the school day, children should not have to get up at 7 a.m. and should get home before 5 p.m. or 6 p.m. I ask the Minister to deal with that problem. Children are important, we only have them for a short time. I ask the Minister to consider controlling the media, particularly television. Children's programmes are shown at 7 a.m., geared towards them before they go to school and again when they come home at dinner time. We should not be afraid to take on the media and should introduce legislation to provide that children's programmes are broadcast between 5 p.m. and 7 p.m. They should not be shown from 7 a.m. to 9 a.m., to catch them before they go to school. Perhaps that cannot be done in this Bill but the Department should consider it. Toys for Christmas are already being advertised between 7 a.m. and 2 p.m., which is outrageous.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Ring for sharing time and am glad of the opportunity to make a short contribution to this important debate.

His personal interest in handicapped children should be mentioned and does not go unnoticed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a good education system, probably unequalled anywhere in the world, and this is shown in the way we have attracted new industries, such as the computer industry. Our third level system is of a high standard and the development of regional colleges was a major breakthrough. My own children have received a good education in Sligo, and there are other colleges in Galway, Waterford, Limerick and Dundalk. In Dublin, Kevin Street and Bolton Street are outstanding third level colleges. My home town has the Cavan College of Further Education, which has been upgraded to a regional technical college. A green-field site has been earmarked and progress has been made to put in place a proper campus &ndash; the college is currently spread around various buildings in Cavan town. It attracts students from Limerick, Cork and else<Col N="1115" /> where around the country and has a computer education facility.</P>
    <P>The third level colleges have armed our young people to take up modern, technical jobs currently available. There never was a better time for young people in Ireland than the last five years. However, I must sound a note of warning &ndash; the multinational computer firms and technical industries regularly canvass our third level institutions for employees before the students have received their certificates, diplomas or degrees, because there is a scarcity of qualified young people for these jobs. We see job advertisements in the national newspapers on a weekly basis. One reputable company is using a &ldquo;carrot and stick&rdquo; advertisement for young people. Good wages are being offered and young people are attracted to money but they should stay in college until they get a certificate or diploma at least. It may be attractive to take a job now and it will save money for their parents but something could happen to the companies. By and large they have a lifespan of 20 years and many multinationals wind up and move on. What will happen those young people if they do not have a certificate of education because they were attracted by an industry which offered a good salary? They could be left high and dry five or six years later. I understand the industrialists' position but if they ask young people to work for them they should be given an opportunity to continue their education. The company should be responsible for bringing the young people to the centres of education, be it Kevin Street, Bolton Street or elsewhere. They should not have to drive into the city under their own steam, it should be done collectively. It is in the interests of both the industrialists and the young people to do this. I know this is happening and that young people are taking up these opportunities.</P>
    <P>I have spoken about third level but we must begin at the beginning. Young people must be brought through the education system to leaving certificate standard so they can go to third level and take the course they wish to follow. In going to the beginning, we must look at society today which has changed tremendously over the years. In my day and until a quarter of a century ago, a family contained the traditional parents, husband and wife, and a number of children. This has changed and there are single parents in every town and village. Far be it from me to decry this, these things happen and we must face up to matters as they are. There are single parent households with mothers on their own. Society and the Government must face this problem to ensure those children have the same opportunities. It is not the fault of the children that they are born into that environment. The term &ldquo;absentee father&rdquo; annoys me &ndash; there is no such thing. A couple gather to conceive a child and both must be responsible. It is unacceptable for a man to leave an unfortunate girl with a child to rear &ndash; he must be made <Col N="1116" /> responsible and tracked down. If that man goes somewhere else and receives social welfare benefit or is in employment, there should be some means of deducting child support from his income. There is a little too much free living, for the want of a better word. The unfortunate girl is left with the child or perhaps two children and she needs support. We must face up to this problem. In the family unit as we understand it, by and large, children will get on. However, there are problems, even in rural areas, upon which we should not frown and we should support the people with these problems.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Ms M. McGennis Ms M. McGennis">
      <NameTxt>Ms M. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have been prepared to listen to the previous two speakers for longer. It is seldom we get an opportunity to hear some common sense and it was a privilege to listen to them.</P>
      <P>I concur with the Minister that the Bill is among the most important legislation introduced by the Government. Every child should be given the opportunity to reach his or her full potential. That is what we hope for when we bring our children to school on their first day. It is more common now for them to go to pre-school but when one places them in the care of their junior infants teacher, one embarks on a journey for the most important part of their lives when one hopes they will, with the guidance and assistance of their teachers, reach their full potential, and I do not mean academically. As the previous two speakers said, education should not be viewed as the attainment of academic excellence &ndash; it involves a great deal more. The word education derives from &ldquo;educo&rdquo; which translates as &ldquo;to draw out from within&rdquo;. It involves not only imparting information or knowledge to young people as in many instances there is an information overload. It involves parents and teachers drawing from within young people the potential which lies inside them. Often this means listening to them rather than talking at or to them.</P>
      <P>The Bill has two main objectives, the first of which deals with an issue that does not occur often but is obviously important, the desire of parents to educate their children outside the recognised schools system. The constitutional right of parents as prime educators must also be recognised. Most of us are happy to pass on that task to teachers in recognised schools. The Bill addresses the issue of parents who do not want to send their children to recognised schools and may want to educate them themselves in their homes or undertake an alternative form of education. It sets down a standard of minimum education which should be observed by people who take that option. It is important but it is not an issue with which I have had to deal. The Department has been involved in court cases on a number of occasions because of the desire of parents to educate their children themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most important part of the Bill is its objective to put in place structures to encourage and promote school attendance. More importantly, it <Col N="1117" /> recognises this cannot be done in the way envisaged by the 1926 Act and the involvement of experts from a wide range of areas is necessary. The Minister and other speakers referred to the 1926 School Attendance Act which established the position of school attendance officer. I represented an area in County Dublin which does not have school attendance officers and the function was given to the Garda Síochána. I never came across a garda who carried out that function. I understand why that did not happen; it is not the way it should be done.</P>
    <P>My only experience of school attendance officers was when I went to school as I do not remember having to deal with them when my children attended school. The focus of the school attendance officer was to punish and when the job was being done he or she did it extremely well. One does not have to look at documentaries to know this, but it is educational to see how we locked children in institutions because they were not going to school. A large number of those in industrial schools consisted of children who were &ldquo;mitching&rdquo; from school. We talk about non-attendance but &ldquo;mitching&rdquo; was the term used when I attended school. I clearly remember that one of the good jobs one could get when I attended school was to return the roll book to the principal who, in my case, was a nun. It was taken seriously and even more so in the generation before mine. Large numbers of children were taken from their families and placed in industrial schools and institutions. That is certainly not the focus of this Bill. Hopefully we are more enlightened now &ndash; fear was a great motivation in all areas of life in those days. It is not the way I would want us to go and I am glad we are going in the other direction.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hanafin wished the Minister well in his efforts to define minimum education, if he decides to do so. I also wish him well in that task. I am not suggesting we introduce league tables which were brought in by the Conservative Government under Margaret Thatcher. I would not support that in any way, shape or form. However, the school assessment procedure which was introduced by the Minister on a pilot basis and the provisions of the Education Act could be extended to all schools. Deputy Ring rightly said young people are leaving school in the latter part of the 20th century without the ability to read, write and add in circumstances where the pupil-teacher ratio has been reduced considerably &ndash; enormously since I went to school. I do not know if the levels of illiteracy are higher now than they were 20 or 30 years ago but we must examine why people leave school, not having &ldquo;mitched&rdquo; or been absent for long periods, without the ability to read, write and add. This is excepting that people have difficulties such as dyslexia, attention deficit disorders and other recognised problems. However, there are young children who do not have those problems and are still leaving the education system with an inability to <Col N="1118" /> read, write and add. We need to address the reasons that is happening.</P>
    <P>The provisions of this legislation are geared at those who may end up in difficulty, perhaps in Mountjoy, but certainly in situations of disadvantage. I had the privilege of attending the opening of the women's prison in Mountjoy last week. I had the opportunity to speak to some of &ldquo;the community&rdquo;, which is how the Governor describes the women serving time there. I listened to women on a follow-up programme speak about what they were doing and how they were passing their time in jail. How does somebody who ends up in the most horrendous circumstances, in Mountjoy jail, probably with a huge drug habit &ndash; that was certainly true of some of the women to whom I spoke &ndash;  embrace with the most unbelievable enthusiasm an opportunity to avail of education? What happens to people in those circumstances that was not happening to them when they were in the recognised school system?</P>
    <P>We need to look at what is happening in schools. Parents have told me their children are being kept back or are skipping a year in primary school. That happens for good reasons in a number of cases. There is often a need for a child to spend more time in one year, or if the child is bored it is better to move them on so they are open to new learning experiences. However, in the majority of such cases children were being moved from one class to another to maintain numbers so that the school could keep a teacher. That is not what we call child centred education or what is expected from a school system that works well. The parents' council does not have the same clout as a teachers' union. Despite the advances in education, parents are not full partners, although the Minister is moving towards that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hanafin referred to the need to let teachers take early retirement if they so wish. If they do not want to teach, they will probably not be of any great benefit to the pupils they are trying to educate. I am a member of a board of management and at a board meeting we discussed the issue of teachers taking extended leave of absence to pursue other interests. In some cases teachers are seconded to the Department and they will use the experience they gain to improve the school when they return. Some teachers go as volunteers with APSO to assist people in other countries. Such experience will enhance their work when they go back to school. However, in some cases teachers go away for two or three years and then come back for a year before reapplying for another year's leave of absence. I question whether such teachers are committed to teaching.</P>
    <P>There are many reasons children decide not to go to school or to finish their education, but the main one in the majority of cases is difficult family circumstances. A percentage of children are also wild and out of control and even their parents have difficulty getting them to stay in school. Sometimes we need to listen to children. If a child <Col N="1119" /> repeatedly says over a one or two year period, not just on a Monday morning because they do not want to go to school, that their teacher hates them, we must take it seriously. If six, seven or ten second level pupils, who are more confident than primary school pupils, say that a teacher of a particular subject is useless, we should listen to them and do something about it.</P>
    <P>I know a young man who was not unruly or out of control but who fell out of the education system because he came from a horrendous family background. It was surprising how well-rounded he was given the circumstances. He was expelled from a community school in a disadvantaged area which had the supports the Minister and his predecessors recognised as necessary in such areas. Teachers in disadvantaged areas are usually the best because when they start teaching they are young and want to make a difference. I listened to a teacher on the radio recently who was bubbling with enthusiasm and believed he could make a change. I know it is not easy and that they burn out quickly.</P>
    <P>The principal in the community school expelled the young man because of poor attendance. He was told he would not make it academically, that he had no chance of getting a junior or leaving certificate and that he was wasting his time. He was moved to another school but that did not work as it was away from his home. I approached the principal of a community school a quarter of a mile from the first school and asked him to interview the young man. He took him into the school and gave him the type of additional attention he needed. He was given a uniform, which he did not have because his parents did not help him, and books were provided from a school fund. He was also given as much pastoral care as possible without making it look like he had a problem. As a result, he got an applied leaving certificate and he went to his &ldquo;debs&rdquo; ball.</P>
    <P>The first school was wrong and was responsible for the young man falling out of the school system. The second school was what the Minister and parents believe should be the model of a good school and management system and an extremely good principal. The principal outlined the contract between the boy and the school, that unless he worked and showed commitment he would have to leave.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that the Bill deals not only with raising the school leaving age from 15 to 16. Our education system is not about numbers or about telling pupils they are guilty of a crime if they leave school to work before they are 16 years of age. It is not about keeping children sitting in seats in school but about turning out well-rounded young people and giving them the skills to solve problems and deal with the pressures we did not have to deal with in school, such as taking drugs and drinking at 15 and 16 years of age. That is the norm in most schools, not only in disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1120" /> Sections 23 to 27 are the core of the Bill as they deal with keeping children in school. Section 23 provides for a code of behaviour, which is welcome. Some schools, including the one to which I referred, have a written code of practice which is published in the pupils' year book so parents know what is expected, but it is not the norm. I welcome the fact it is being laid down in law and that it will be drawn up with the consent of all parties. I am glad parents are included in that process.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that parents will be required before registering a child as a student at a school, in accordance with section 20, to sign a contract between themselves and the school. Parents will sign almost anything to get a child into a particular school. I am not sure that parents will have read it or know what is binding if they do that.</P>
    <P>Section 24 gladdens and lightens my heart. I have discussed this matter at Fianna Fáil parliamentary party meetings and with the Minister. The position was that children were being suspended and expelled from schools and that was it. I understand why a school might feel it was at the end of its tether and was forced to expel a child. However, there are instances where children were expelled from school for little or no reason. I remember a girl with whom I palled around in primary school who was told by the principal of her primary school that she would not be allowed to sit her primary certificate examination. I do not know if there was a league table then but the school was obviously concerned that she would affect the school's overall results. The girl was told straight out that she would not be allowed to sit for her primary certificate.</P>
    <P>The Minister has enshrined in the Bill that a child must receive an education and if he or she is expelled from a school, the welfare officer must find an alternative place for him or her. If that cannot be done, measures must be put in place to ensure that the child receives an education. The Bill is worth its weight in gold if it achieves that objective and I very much welcome it. Some people, including many in the teaching profession, said it could never be done. However, the Minister is doing it, and I am proud to be part of a Government that is doing it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to participate in the debate and I am also pleased that the Minister is present to listen to Members' contributions. A measure of the Bill's importance is that the last school attendance legislation was introduced in the early 1920s. Various reports were produced in the 1990s which probably created the seed corn for this Bill in terms of all the presentations which were made. However, it is recognised internationally that Ireland has a very good education system and this point has been acknowledged by successive speakers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland is enjoying significant industrial benefits as a result of companies coming to this country. This is due in the main to people who made sacrifices in the past to ensure children got a good <Col N="1121" /> education. This is paying off now in terms of overseas industries coming to Ireland. However, these industries are probably exposing certain deficiencies in the system which will need to be addressed urgently in terms of our attitude to continental languages and the emphasis placed in the education system on that area. Many companies are experiencing difficulties in that regard.</P>
    <P>In the main the Bill deals with truancy and school attendance and the direction in which the Minister intends to progress. Many people felt that in modern times monitoring school truancy should not be part of the duties of the Garda Síochána in rural Ireland. It is recognised that there is more temptation for pupils to drop out of the education system than heretofore because of the buoyancy of the Celtic economy. In many cases this is probably due to financial necessity at home. Often young people aged 14 or 15 years see their parents caught in poverty traps or dependent on social welfare and they seize the opportunity of a job instead of remaining in the education system. Although in many cases these jobs may have limited progression possibilities or may lead to an employment cul de sac in the future, there is a temptation to take them now. The important point is how to ensure these young people remain in the school system.</P>
    <P>The objective of trying to ensure pupils remain in school until the age of 16 years or at least spend three years in the junior cycle is desirable. Statistics prove that up to 90 per cent of people stay in the education system up to that age. However, there is still a problem regarding pupils from homes where there is residual unemployment who drop out of the education system. The issue is how to ensure they remain in the system.</P>
    <P>There is much emphasis in the Bill on the disciplinary codes of schools and ensuring it is known to pupils in advance. This is desirable but there is already a deficiency in the current system which I am not sure will be rectified by the Bill. In many cases, pupils are disciplined within the school system and suspended or expelled. However, most others schools in the area will not take on such pupils. I am aware of cases where that happened and families were traumatised by it. Pupils have prematurely dropped out of the education system due to an aberration for which they were disciplined under the school code. They were probably victimised by the education system as it stood. Will the Bill address such cases?</P>
    <P>I am aware of families who were traumatised because children were suspended or expelled from school. Under the current system, other schools in the area cannot be compelled to take on such pupils. Most schools are conscious of their disciplinary codes and values and they are afraid that their school will be stigmatised by parents if they take on a pupil who was suspended or expelled by another school. The schools want to maintain their ideals. This issue needs to be addressed and it would be worthwhile if the Department of Education and Science researched <Col N="1122" /> and studied second level educational establishments from which pupils were suspended or expelled. Often suspensions can last for considerable periods and the pupil's education is disrupted. There are approximately 700 secondary schools and it would be interesting to find out the total number of people who found themselves in that situation. Suspensions may have been imposed as a result of an escapade following a disco outside the school setting or for many other reasons. However, it would be worth finding out how many people ended up outside the education system because of incidents which took place for which they were suspended or expelled. The Minister probably would be surprised by the number involved.</P>
    <P>Last December the Minister received the maximum possible accolades because he addressed the difficulty which Deputies raised in the House on many occasions regarding the lack of remedial teachers for groups of schools. The position was reached last December where all schools have access to a remedial teacher. I am sure the Minister is not totally happy because a remedial teacher who is responsible for at least five different schools may spend more time in his or her car than in the schools undertaking remedial teaching. As a result, it is questionable whether the system is working. However, it is a step in the right direction because there were many complaints in the past that there were not enough remedial teachers for schools.</P>
    <P>If the Minister considered the people who are likely to fall within the remit of the Bill and become involved in truancy in the future, he would probably find that in many cases intervention should take place before the child goes to Montessori school. Many people who work with children will testify that the crucial formative years are after the public health nurse's intervention ceases and before the child goes to pre-school or Montessori school, if they can afford to go. There appears to be no intervention on the part of the State during this vital period. The child's character has usually been formed by the time they start primary school and we know what can happen within the education system. I could never master geometry, for example, although that did not create problems for me later. However, if I could not have mastered reading or writing, I would have been in serious difficulty.</P>
    <P>I accept that we are addressing the problem of illiteracy but we are not moving fast enough. Look at the number of people who are involved in community youth employment projects throughout the country. One will find that there are illiterate people among that cohort of 39,000. In our obsession with getting people off the live register and into worthwhile occupations &ndash; an aim I agree with &ndash; we often do not quantify the number of illiterate people on that register. If we find the opportunity for FÁS employment within the community we are happy to at least have them doing desirable work.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1123" /> However, I often wonder if it would not be a worthwhile exercise to suggest to those people, who might be 35, 40 or 50 years of age that we will put them through a programme in which they will spend at least a year on a week on, week off basis in FÁS employment, that we will give them at least six months to master their illiteracy and that we will pay them the same amount as they would be paid on the FÁS scheme. I believe it would be worthwhile. If these people mastered their illiteracy, it would give them the confidence and ability to progress to another type of job. People participate in community employment projects for up to four years because they feel confidence in what they are doing. In many cases, however, a number of them are illiterate and would like to master that difficulty. The problem is that they fall between two stools and that issue should be examined.</P>
    <P>I support the home school liaison officer system in disadvantaged areas. It works extremely well. I read a press release issued by the Minister on 5 November 1998 in which he said that the issue of providing special needs assistants had to be addressed. On that occasion, he announced the provision of 65 places. The Minister will be aware that in rural areas it is most important, if possible, for a child who has a disability to be absorbed within the primary school system, to be integrated in the community and to grow up in that community. In many small rural primary schools &ndash; local people tend to be very proud of their primary school &ndash; that has worked very effectively and the children, whether they are confined to a wheelchair or are otherwise disabled, have been absorbed and integrated fully into the school. This has been possible due to minor adaptations being made within the school, for example, making the school wheelchair compatible.</P>
    <P>The Minister will acknowledge that there is pressure on the Department to create many more special needs assistants. I recently received a letter and documentation in this regard from a principal in Ballyagran national school in Limerick. A child has been identified as requiring a special needs assistant. A school such as that might find it impossible to cope without such an assistant. When the Department gets a cry from the heart from the principal of a school and when the psychological assessment is available to verify that the person is in need of such an assistant, it should respond positively. If it does not, the primary school will be unable to give the necessary commitment and time to the person who requires a special needs assistant. This matter should be analysed and given an appropriate response. As I said earlier, I have seen situations where such people have been integrated into the local school and they have been very happy in that environment.</P>
    <P>It would be remiss of me not to use this opportunity to make a plea for something close to my heart and, indeed, to the Minister's heart. A gael<Col N="1124" /> scoil was established in Newcastle West in 1985 with 17 pupils. It now has 350 pupils between the naonrá, the gaelscoil and the gaelcholáiste. The Minister is aware of the gaelscoil, Gaelscoil O'Doghair. I put down a parliamentary question on the resumption of the Dáil asking the Department to be more active in ensuring that the school is built. Sanction for its construction was given in 1995 but due to various frustrations, the management of the school purchased the land itself to ensure that the land would be available.</P>
    <P>I understand discussions are currently taking place with the Department. I urge the Minister to respond quickly and positively so the gaelscoil can get going. The principal is Daithí Ó Murchú and the school's achievements have been lauded. I hope something positive will happen in the near future because the school does an excellent job in the local community.</P>
    <P>Newcastle West has a population of less than 5,000 and was selected recently for urban renewal. The population criterion is much higher but the town was regarded as suitable for urban renewal because it is the county capital and there is a huge expansion in population. This was encouraged by the Department of the Environment and Local Government which was anxious that the population expansion should not take place totally within Limerick city and suburbs but in the county towns. Parallel with the population expansion is the need to provide for schoolchildren. That is why it is most important that the gaelscoil is given approval.</P>
    <P>I will now turn to the truancy issue. The Minister intends to establish a national education welfare board. The board will have access to records for 3,000 primary schools and 700 secondary schools. It will also have access to the disciplinary codes of conduct in the schools. The Minister was critical of the provisions of the Bill introduced by the former Minister, Niamh Breathnach, providing for regional education boards. I do not intend to discuss the merits or demerits of that Bill. However, can the Minister reconcile the situation that will arise with regard to the education welfare board? The body will meet in Dublin and will have access to these records. The members of the board will be drawn from different Departments and there will be no representative from the parents, teachers or management associations.</P>
    <P>How can the Minister reassure us that the board will provide an effective service for all 3,700 schools? Will he give such an assurance on the basis of there being an advisory body which will provide certain information to the board and that the body will comprise members of the teachers, parents and management organisations? Is the Minister satisfied that the advisory body will have the power to influence this board? The board's membership will be drawn from Departments and will be based in Dublin, not in Portlaoise or in any other part of the country which might be more central. Does the Minister believe the board will achieve its objective? Bearing in <Col N="1125" /> mind the debate that took place about regional education boards, would it not have been more feasible to provide for a regional board of that nature to cover a certain area? After all, there are only so many regions in the country and a large number of regional bodies already exist. This issue will be teased out on Committee Stage when the Minister can outline his views in that regard.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister well with this Bill which contains many good ideas. Truancy and non-attendance at school must be analysed to a greater extent. In pitching the figure higher than 90 per cent, we have a major challenge on our hands. Given our current economic buoyancy, there is a temptation for people to go to work.</P>
    <P>For problems in reading and writing or problems arising from being left behind within the education system, there may be a need to establish an interventionist system. The children of families, which may be vulnerable to the type of problems the Minister is attempting to allay on a long-term basis because of unemployment, poverty and so on should be monitored from the age of six months to four or five years so that they will be able to avail of some type of support. The Department of Health and Children is probably the ideal body to administer such a system. That support is not available at present and many children start out with educational disadvantages at four or five years of age. Once they lose out at the start, it is very difficult for them to recapture that lost time.</P>
    <P>Rather than tabling a matter on the Adjournment on the urgent necessity for a special needs assistant for Ballyagran primary school can I ask the Minister&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>There should not be any difficulty with that, pending assessment and verification of the assessment. That child would have an automatic entitlement under the decision of November of last year. I will follow the matter up with the Deputy.</P>

I know the Minister will ensure that the Gaelscoil will be built in Newcastle West prior to the next election. That would be a positive development.</P>

      <P>I compliment the Minister on introducing this Bill. The relationship between educational disadvantage and performance in the labour market or the workforce has been demonstrated in numerous studies carried out both in Ireland and abroad. I compliment the current <Col N="1126" /> Minister on taking a number of initiatives to assist those at risk of dropping out of education at an early stage. I refer to the £57 million disadvantage package, the £6.5 million for school libraries, the national educational psychological service, increased intake to colleges, an offer to purchase all school sites and the abolition of exam fees for students who hold medical cards or whose parents or guardians are medical card holders.</P>
      <P>One of the greatest divides in society today is doubtless between those who complete senior cycle education and those who leave school early. Some 63 per cent of unemployed people do not hold a leaving certificate and three quarters of poor households are headed by a person without any educational qualifications.</P>
      <P>The school curriculum can be an important element in assisting children to stay in school. Significant additional funding has been put in place to ensure the development of the curriculum diversity necessary to provide the most appropriate programmes for individual students. It is also important to provide second chance interventions for those who leave school early.</P>
      <P>Arising out of the importance placed on this area, one of this Government's first decisions was to expand the Youthreach programme. This initiative is aimed at tackling those who leave school early, students who drop out at 13 or 14 years of age or younger. The programme offers an opportunity to bring these students back into the education system and to provide them with basic skills. It also gives them the confidence to establish a routine. It is evident that people who drop out of school for whatever reason lose routine and become involved in activities which do not result in a normal or reasonable standard of living.</P>
      <P>The newly established National Education Welfare Board will have overall responsibility for the operation of the Bill. The board's functions include prescribing minimum education for all children, assisting in the formulation and implementation of Government policy and objectives concerning the education of children and promoting and fostering in society an appreciation of the benefits which can be derived from education.</P>
      <P>Previous speakers have asked what constitutes a minimum education. Some may believe it is the attainment of a degree or a diploma while others would consider that a decent junior or leaving certificate represents a minimum education. At the end of the day, it is desirable that all children leaving school at 16 years of age would have the ability to read and write and have good numeracy skills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As politicians at the coal face, we witness people attending clinics from rural areas, towns and villages, who are unable to fill out various forms. That is a shocking reflection on our education system. These people have simply fallen by the wayside. I hope this Bill will ensure that is stamped out. The Education (Welfare) Bill clearly sets out the role of the education board. The board will ensure that the education system <Col N="1127" /> is further enhanced and developed and that those who are socially and economically disadvantaged will receive a better formal education than has previously been the case.</P>
    <P>The reality of the current economic boom is that children can be employed while still attending school. This can have serious repercussions on their education. If a child comes from a disadvantaged family where money is scarce and an employer is willing to take him or her on during school hours thereby providing them with resources, it is likely that he or she will opt for work. The Bill provides additional safeguards for these children by making it an offence for an employer to employ children during school hours. Perhaps it would be possible to extend that to ensure that students will also have time to attend to their homework.</P>
    <P>The reality of the current education system is that many young people leave school with qualifications which are inadequate to guarantee their entry into the workforce. This Bill provides a framework which will ensure that all young people who have left school under 18 years of age will be identified. Once identified, the National Education Welfare Board will assist them in accessing continued education and training. Employers will have a role to play in the identification of young people by only employing young people who have a certificate to show they are registered with the board and by informing the board when they employ a young person. It is vital that any system is monitored and assessed in order to ensure it operates to the maximum benefit. The National Education Welfare Board provides for an ongoing assessment of educational provisions outside the recognised school system. It is vital that the board be accountable. Accounts shall be submitted to the Comptroller and Auditor General for audit and shall be placed before the Houses of the Oireachtas by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Education (Welfare) Bill is a further necessary step in the continuation of this Government's progress in dealing with educational disadvantage and in tackling the root problem of poor school attendance.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on the manner in which he has tackled the special needs issue. When I attended national school, weak students with special needs barely scraped through the system. Such students have had a difficult time until now, but they are being assessed and retrained by FÁS and provisions have been made for the weaker sectors of society. Such sectors were ignored by the State and I welcome all the initiatives that have been taken by the Government to tackle social exclusion within the education system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this important Bill, which is long overdue. It demonstrates the Government's ongoing commitment to social inclusion. It seeks to tackle the problems of those who have the potential to become socially <Col N="1128" /> excluded at an early age, such as children who drop out of the school system and early school leavers generally. As a result, these children ruin their chances of full participation in all aspects of society and, in many instances, they have a poor quality of living and diminished employment prospects.</P>
      <P>I am happy the Bill strikes the correct balance between the rights and duties of children, parents and the State and, in particular, it recognises the legitimate right of parents in the education of their children. However, there is no doubt that in areas of disadvantage the State must get more involved and play a greater role. These children are entitled to the same opportunities as everyone else. The State must adopt a hands-on approach and back it up with adequate resources.</P>
      <P>School attendance is, obviously, a major problem in disadvantaged areas. I congratulate the Minister on his policies to deal with the problem of early school leaving. Such initiatives include the pilot project to address the needs of children between the ages of eight and 15 who are at risk of dropping out of the education system and it is in place in a number of target areas. The home-school liaison service has also been extended to every school classified as disadvantaged. The remedial teaching service has also been extended to every school. The national education psychological service has been established and recently the Minister launched a £4.5 million stay in school initiative, aimed at keeping pupils in school to complete the leaving certificate through school-based plans supported by generous financing. All these measures are welcome.</P>
      <P>A serious problem on the ground in terms of school attendance is the position of children who have been expelled or suspended from school and this was also referred to by Deputy Finucane. Very often such expulsions or suspensions are for non-attendance or disruptive behaviour generally and school principals do not want to know about these problems. The children involved often find it impossible to get into another school. School attendance officers and, in particular, the Department seem completely helpless and powerless in dealing with the problem.</P>
      <P>The child has been expelled or suspended for disruptive behaviour, etc., has probably been given a number of chances and is then told that he cannot return to the school. As a public representative, I have been called on to intervene in such cases. One contacts several schools in the locality and for one reason or another it is impossible to get the child into an alternative school. The situation is hopeless. I tabled a parliamentary question to the Minister on this matter on 16 October 1997 and he stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that there may be difficulties involved in securing a school placement for pupils who have left or been excluded from a second level school. The selection and enrolment of pupils in second level schools is the responsibility of individual school managerial authorities. The managerial authorities are also <Col N="1129" /> responsible for devising and applying a code of discipline in their schools.</P>
    <P>My Department has issued guidelines to schools to assist them in discharging their role in this area. These guidelines stress both the need for proportionality of response to incidents of misbehaviour and the use of expulsion only as a last resort. A disciplinary ruling involving either exclusion or suspension may be appealed in the first instance to the appropriate management authority of the school concerned, normally the manager, board of management or vocational education committee. If matters are not resolved at that level it is open to parents to raise the matter with my Department, which will liaise with the school and assist in securing an alternative school placement where necessary.</P>
    <P>That is all very well in theory, but it does not happen in practice and I hope, therefore, the Bill will deal with such issues in a more comprehensive and practical manner.</P>
    <P>The national education psychological service has an important role in this regard. Last night the Minster of State said that it was well under way. I wish to know more about it because many of the children to whom I referred have problems and I hope this service can play a crucial role in their progress.</P>
    <P>Children not attending local schools is another practical issue which creates increased difficulty. It is more of a problem in the Dublin area where a range of schools is available within easy access for pupils. I do not suggest that children should be compelled to attend their local schools, but it causes problems even from the point of view of traffic and public transport when children are driven from one side of the city to another to attend a different school. Where enrolments decline in a school, the Department must get involved and investigate why that is the case. I am aware of children who will not attend the school in their local parish but will attend every other school on the north side of Dublin. We need to ask why because it is a serious issue which the Department should investigate and examine. School attendance is not just a matter for the Department of Education and Science as other issues are involved, such as drug and alcohol abuse, teenage pregnancies and dysfunctional families where no value is placed on education. It is a complex issue and there are many reasons it is a problem, and as a result many other Departments are involved.</P>
    <P>The Minister outlined the role of the national educational welfare board and educational welfare officers, who have a comprehensive list of functions. It is an ideal list of functions, but the difficulties in dealing with issues on the ground should not be underestimated. There are many practical difficulties and it will take committed educational welfare officers with power and resources to deal with children with special needs.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1130" /> I welcome the extension of the school attendance service nationwide. Previously, this was confined to local authorities in Cork, Dublin, Waterford and Dún Laoghaire and the Garda elsewhere. In many cases, local authorities were unable to deal with large new sprawling local authority housing estates under this particular brief so, therefore, the idea to extend this nationwide in a comprehensive way is good. The School Attendance Act, 1926, was introduced in much simpler times and the emphasis was on penalties rather than assistance. I welcome, therefore, the change in emphasis outlined in this Bill. I cannot stress enough the importance of ensuring that schools have adequate resources to deal with these problems and to implement this Bill, and I know other Deputies mentioned that as well.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister will, at some stage, report on school meals. It seems to be a very limited service available in a few disadvantaged areas. I would like to know the position in other EU states because that would be an important service to revamp. I know the Minister is very concerned about bullying in schools, and it must be a factor in dealing with non-attendance. I welcome the Minister's initiatives in that regard, which are taking effect in the schools. Young children in national schools are being informed of this phenomenon. They are told to report incidents in the yard or they are watched to see if the yard is a pleasant experience for children, and I welcome those measures. It is an important issue as regards school attendance. All in all, this is a welcome Bill. I congratulate the Minister on bringing it forward and wish him well in implementing it.</P>

      <P>I welcome this legislation but the first point I would like to make, which is reflected in the contributions of previous speakers, is that the setting up of this board, the national educational welfare board, must be used as an opportunity to do much more than establish a policing system for truancy and home education. I am sure the Minister will ensure that happens. Certainly, from listening to the various contributions, it is important that it would happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of serious issues have been raised, which Deputy Haughey and many other speakers illustrated. There are many difficulties for young people who do not fit into the system in the same way as those who sail through third level. Those who are well adapted to the system can cope. The Bill must address those problems. I welcome the fact that there will be school attendance procedures throughout the country. There have been loopholes in the past and it is important that they are closed off. There was a very sad case recently of a child who was taken out of school by her <Col N="1131" /> family and was not registered in another one. I am not sure how much has been proved, but she may have been subject to abuse in the home. There was no system of tracking and when she was taken out of one school her parents' word was accepted that she had been registered in another but that never happened. That is the most serious aspect of this issue. There is another aspect &ndash; it is essential that there is a system whereby children are enrolled in schools and do not fall through the net.</P>
    <P>There must be an onus on the schools as well as on the parents and children. That point has been well illustrated in the examples given. Sections 19 and 27, in particular, are welcome in so far as section 27 states that there is an obligation on the national educational welfare board to make reasonable efforts to ensure that children who are permanently excluded from a school or whom a school refuses to enrol receive a minimum education. There must be a greater obligation on schools to ensure that children are not in position to drop out or be expelled from a school. Section 19 provides that the board of management of recognised schools shall not refuse to admit as a student in such schools a child in respect of whom an application to be so admitted has been made, except where such refusal is in accordance with the policy of the recognised school concerned. It is important that schools publish their policies as regards admission. It should be a function of the board that schools must take their fair share of children who may have difficulties adapting to the education system and must also recognise their obligations to children whom they have taken into their schools.</P>
    <P>There should be an early intervention system, and I would like the officers of this board to have a role in early intervention where there is a problem with a child. If a school detects problems with a child, it should have an obligation to report that to the officers of this board so that intervention can happen early and a child will not be suspended from a school without any warning or attempt to pre-empt that.</P>
    <P>Yesterday, my colleague, Deputy Michael Higgins, described many children who have dropped out of the system or who have been expelled from schools and who, as Deputy Haughey said, find it almost impossible to enrol in another school. It is not enough to say the board has an obligation to ensure these children receive a minimum education. It should have that obligation, but schools should also have an obligation to ensure it happens.</P>
    <P>The point about schools not always taking a cross section of children is important. There are many excellent schools which have a mix of input and which do a fine job, but there are many other schools which are quite selective in the type of children they take in. I suppose that is more true in urban schools where there is more choice. In many cases, schools have come together in rural <Col N="1132" /> areas where there are fine community and comprehensive schools which take children from all backgrounds. In urban areas, there is a danger of schools becoming more selective. Recently, private colleges charging fees seem to be making more of an inroad. It is important the national educational welfare board is given a function which ensures schools uphold their obligation to equality and ensures that they open their doors to children in their area no matter what their background. It is also important that where there is a pattern of low educational achievement in terms of the input into a primary school, there is an obligation to ensure these children have access to second level schools and that they are given the support they need to ensure they can proceed through the system. Early intervention is extremely important.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to ensure that schools which cater for children who have difficulty in the regular system are properly funded. We have one in Limerick, St. Augustine's, with which the Minister of State will be very familiar, which does excellent work. There are other such schools around the country but they tend to be underfunded. It is important that any school which caters for children with difficulties is properly funded.</P>
    <P>The first function, as described in section 10, is that the board must ensure the provision of a prescribed minimum education to each child. Will the Minister respond in relation to children with special needs, such as children with intellectual disabilities, dyslexia, ADD, ADHD, autism, Asperger's syndrome and other such problems? Parents of such children have had great difficulty accessing appropriate education for their children and, in some cases, have had to take the State to court &ndash; for instance, the O'Donoghue case and others which have followed on from that. Do I detect from this Bill that these parents now have a way in which they can ensure that their child has access to a school appropriate to their needs?</P>
    <P>If this is the case it is a great step forward but I would like to have the matter clarified. I hope funding will follow and that children are not obliged to wait until appropriate classes are funded. This Bill provides an opportunity to ensure that the constitutional rights of children with special needs are upheld. The national educational welfare board has the potential to have that brief and it should have it. We must not miss the opportunity which the passage of this Bill affords us. The necessary funding must follow automatically. A child who fits into an ordinary national school automatically has access to that school. A child with special needs should also have automatic access to education and should not have to wait for funding. I hope this issue will also be addressed in the Bill.</P>
    <P>We must not use this Bill as a minimalist set of principles. We must ensure that it embraces the various issues raised by Members and we must address these issues if we are to prevent the development of a two tier education system <Col N="1133" /> which works very well for a certain sector of the population but fails another sector.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy O'Sullivan for allowing me to share her time. I welcome the Bill which introduces very important measures, including the registration of children receiving education in places other than recognised schools. The main feature of the Bill, of course, is the setting up of the national educational welfare board, An Bord Náisiúnta Leasa Oideachais. The board will co-ordinate activities connected with school attendance, identify the causes of truancy in children and adopt certain measures to help prevent truancy. These measures are very important and I welcome them. Our education system is failing to recognise and identify potential problems in children at an early age. Some teachers say they can tell at an early age how a child will turn out. If a young boy or girl is seen to have problems at the age of four, those problems must be addressed to prevent them getting worse as the child grows older. Some of these problems may be emotional or psychiatric or some may arise from difficulties in the home. Small children may sometimes be aggressive or violent or may suffer from a lack of educational support in homes where there are no newspapers, where no one listens to the radio and where violent and unsuitable programmes are watched on television. If such children could be identified at a young age and encouraged to take an interest in education, many of them could be helped. We are not quick enough in spotting the difficulties experienced by small children.</P>
      <P>I welcome the establishment of the national educational welfare board and I hope, when it is set up, it will be based outside Dublin. I recommend that it be based in Tullamore which is centrally placed and already has an involvement in education.</P>
      <P>Sections 23 and 24 deal with codes of behaviour and the expulsion of children from recognised schools. I must speak bluntly. Some young children, particularly young boys, behave very aggressively in schools which are unable to cope with them. I recently spoke to a number of teachers who are having great problems with boys in their school. These boys have struck other boys and girls and have created many difficulties for the school. The boys concerned have many emotional and family problems but their behaviour in class affects other pupils who are trying to study. It is unfair that young boys and girls should be afraid to go to school. While the problems of troublesome pupils must be dealt with sympathetically, one must recognise the needs of other pupils who wish to get on with the business of learning. Such troublesome pupils cannot be transferred unless they can be accommodated in another school. However, very few teachers are willing to accept an aggressive or violent pupil from another school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot come up with a satisfactory solution to this problem but it is one which must be tackled. I <Col N="1134" /> suggest that such pupils be dealt with on a one to one basis by an adult who is equipped to assist the pupil concerned. If the pupil comes from an outlying rural area he or she might need to be accommodated in a town. Even this may not prevent the pupil behaving aggressively, but it is essential that such problems are dealt with individually. Some schools find it impossible to enforce rules or regulations on very disruptive pupils. If a pupil is disruptive at the age of seven, eight or ten, we can guess how he will turn out later in life. The problem is not simply an educational one. It has a wider aspect and its solution will involve the interaction of social workers with schools.</P>
    <P>The Bill deals with primary schools, but I am sorry it does not go further and amend the legislation dealing with the employment of young persons. We must also examine the question of pupils who drop out of second level schools with no formal qualification. They are the boys and girls who are hanging around chip shops and corners late at night, they are into drinking and probably drugs and have social problems, they pose problems for their parents and for society and many of them drop out of education at an early age. A greater effort must be made to encourage them to remain in education.</P>
    <P>Another point is that schools do not place sufficient emphasis on sport, music and art. Also, when students in third level colleges fail their courses for one reason or another &ndash; perhaps because they did not study &ndash; and want to return to college, say, two years later when they have matured, they may do so but the Department of Education and Science will refuse to give them education grants.  That matter needs to be addressed. If a student has matured and wishes to return to college, he or she should be given a grant.</P>
    <P>I raised the issue of untrained teachers here at 6.40 p.m. on 26 May and asked the Minister of State to examine the case of persons who did not qualify as teachers but who have devoted 15 to 20 years of their lives to education. The Minister of State promised he would bring my remarks to the attention of the Minister and return to me on the matter. I have been in contact with him, but he has not come back to me. This matter arises under the qualifications and training education Bill and I am anxious that it be addressed.</P>
    <P>The pupil-teacher ratio in primary schools is still too high and must be lowered. The secret of success in education is to ensure there is effective communication between teachers and pupils during young people's formative years. That is important. Also, in addition to academic subjects, schools should place more emphasis on sport, music and art.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute on this important Bill, which is long overdue. The Bill sets out to chart a comprehensive national system to ensure that children in the compulsory age group attend school or, if not, to receive a basic accessible minimum level of education. It also seeks to ascertain the causes of truancy and to identify at the earliest possible time any difficulties, personal or environmental, which might militate against a child's education interest in the short, medium or long-term.</P>
      <P>Binding the Bill together is the imposition of statutory obligations on schools to take a more pro-active role in understanding, assessing, intervening and determining outcome and working in full consultation with parents and all agencies which have an impact on the quality of life of pupils. I welcome the fact that the minimum school leaving age is being raised from 15 to 16 years or on the completion of three years post-primary education, whichever comes later.</P>
      <P>I also welcome the establishment of the national educational welfare board, which will have overall responsibility for the implementation and operation of the Bill when enacted. The board's functions, which combine advisory and research functions and direct involvement in enforcing school attendance, will be given sufficient and appropriate resources, both financial and personal, and that will have a profound bearing on two of the most worrying aspects of the school system &ndash; the proper assessment of pupils and the high drop-out rate of students from certain communities, especially inner city communities. This is also applicable in many parts of rural Ireland. One of the blots on an otherwise praiseworthy and excellent education system is that we have for too long neglected to introduce proper psychological assessment in schools. I compliment the Minister, Deputy Martin, on adhering to his pre-election promise to set about providing this essential service.</P>
      <P>The proposed national educational welfare board has a wide range of functions prescribed to it. It must draw up a prescribed minimum education for each child, whether in the education system or outside it. It has wider authority to assist in the formation and implementation of Government policies and objectives concerning the education of each child, the public education role of promoting, through understanding, an appreciation of education as well as a specific role of working with schools to draw up programmes of activity. It will also assist in designing programmes, monitoring and assessing their effects, helping schools and parents in a practical way and advising the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment and the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The national educational welfare board has a tremendous work programme. It is interesting to note that the board is expected to liaise with the relevant bodies, Departments, health boards, the Garda, vocational education committees and the national youth work committee. How can all this work be undertaken unless there is a clear indica<Col N="1136" /> tion from where the personnel and the necessary finance will come to provide for the large number of positions required? I agree with the proposal for registration and the various suggestions regarding home liaison and the important code of behaviour. Overall, the high profile the Bill gives to the rights of parents and their obligations is long overdue.</P>
    <P>As a parent and a public representative I believe it is a mistake that the Bill omits one of the four partners, namely, teachers. While we are blessed with teachers of high standard, there are many occasions where management, parents and pupils have been discommoded by the absence of a teacher from a classroom. We must be open and transparent about this real issue. It appears the Bill will be incomplete if it does not address this key issue within the classroom. The presence of a teacher and what happens when the teacher is missing, for whatever reason, needs to be addressed.</P>
    <P>There is no reason or excuse for a child leaving school illiterate. A total of 3,000 students leave school without attaining the junior certificate and 8,000 children leave school without having completed their leaving certificate. It is up to all of us, the Government, the education authorities, parents and teachers, to stop this human haemorrhage. It is an outflow of national talent and a terrible waste of potential. The Bill begins to tackle that task in a meaningful way but there is a long way to go and probably not a moment to lose.</P>
    <P>In regard to registration and recognising the wishes of those who do not want to attend recognised schools, the Minister suggests that they should have the opportunity of being educated outside the school. I do not know how that will work in practice. It is important that the school attendance officer liaise with guidance counsellors and school principals on a regular basis but this does not happen at present. The proposed integrated approach is a new model with a linked person in each VEC and health board. It should help young people and every area will be working closely together. Some young people are lured from the school by the prospect of a job without having the basic education attainments. Section 29 provides a framework which will ensure that employers of such young people will register them with the national educational welfare board and assist them to access part-time education.</P>
    <P>The current school curriculum is too driven by the points system to allow for the education of all children. In some cases schools are in competition for pupils and cannot afford to risk being labelled as a school which is not producing enough points. Alternative curriculum models, such as the NCVA and the leaving certificate applied programme, are excellent but are difficult to implement because of restricted staffing resources and because young people who choose this route become labelled. It is unfortunate that such labelling occurs. There is need for a funda<Col N="1137" /> mental change in education to overcome these difficulties.</P>
    <P>The Department of Education and Science invests millions of pounds in many education side shows which are more or less effective. It is time to assess the productivity of the system. In spite of great effort, literacy skills are low and schools lack resources. It is time for the Department to examine and identify good practices outside the mainstream education system and find ways to combine the two. Rather than imposing penalties on parents who have already been penalised by the education system, perhaps the board should impose penalties on schools which ignore their responsibility to educate all children when they have been given the resources to do so.</P>
    <P>I received correspondence from a family in my constituency who intend to home educate their children. I would like to put on record some points they suggested to me. Regarding the application procedures to register a child, in specifying the times and place of education, the place, in most circumstances, would be the home address, the times, however, could be harder to pin down. Some well documented research carried out recently in Britain and Australia shows that home educated children learn a good deal informally through everyday living. It also shows that formal learning can be more flexible &ndash; the lessons being as long or as short as is essential. In practice it would be very hard to keep track of how long a child spends learning. School records indicate how many hours children are at school, not whether they are learning.</P>

      <P>The so-called commitment was based on the fact that we would examine whether it affected our neutrality. At that stage, we were not in a position to look at all the legal assessments made by Deputy Spring's party leader when he insisted that we should join Partnership for Peace.</P>

      <P>If this is Question Time, I am quite happy to answer questions. I have no problem if the Taoiseach wishes to ask me questions. I will be pleased to answer him although I might have a few questions to put to him about what he has been up to for the last few days. However, I will forbear from doing so; I will not descend to that level. Is the Taoiseach seriously suggesting that in Opposition the Fianna Fáil Party thought that Partnership for Peace threatened legally our neutrality and that it was only when they came into Government and he met up with Deputy Harney he discovered this was not the legal position?</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 4 together.</P>
      <P>In July 1999 my Department declared that its year 2000 compliance programme was complete. My Department has prepared contingency plans to ensure business continuity in the event of year 2000 problems arising. These plans have been approved by management and are currently undergoing external audit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1143" /> A substantial proportion of the time of staff in the IT division of my Department has been devoted to the Y2K issue over the past two years. It is not feasible to estimate the cost of this separately from other work of the division. Other expenditure to date identified as relating to tackling the year 2000 problem has been £15,500 approximately. Most of this represents the cost of upgrading hardware and software.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the approximate cost of skills that have had to be bought into the Department over and above its own in-house skills concerning this issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Most of the work was done by our own IT unit. Changing some of the equipment &ndash; I have mentioned the alarm system before &ndash; was outside our expertise. However, the vast amount of the work was done by the internal IT unit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In addition to the work being done to change the systems and make them year 2000 compliant, have they all been tested?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>They have. I think the work is complete on that. Most of that was done during the summer. I could not be certain that every last piece of work has been done, but certainly all the essential work was done in the early part of the summer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that the question refers specifically to the Taoiseach's Department but is the Taoiseach in a position to say now, or would he accept a question subsequently, whether the same information or the same question can be posed to all other Departments? I think the target date was originally July. Are we now in a position in October to be able to state that all Departments and related sub-agencies and agencies are in fact Y2K compliant? Will the Taoiseach indicate, if the information is available to him, whether that is the position? If not, what additional steps, above those that have been taken, will need to be taken to ensure that we are Y2K compliant?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should put down a question to the Minister for Finance on that matter. However, to be helpful, I know at this stage that the co-ordinating group has monitored most of the Departments. There are still a few areas they are concerned with but practically all the line Departments and most of the agencies have completed their work. Some of them are uncompleted and will remain so until November, which is a matter of concern because it is getting late. There are also a few in the security area that are creating some concern but by and large most of the work has been completed. The Department of Finance is co-ordinating this and has just presented its ninth report which indicates that, <Col N="1144" /> expect in a few areas, most of the difficulties have been overcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the Government's intention to indicate a kind of Y2K all-clear, in so far as anybody can offer such an observation? Is there a deadline against which all Departments are working, including the agencies associated with the various Departments, so that we can, in so far as it can be done, signal that all the systems deemed to be vulnerable have been checked and tested, and that, therefore, we can minimise the risk? The Taoiseach may not be aware of it, but many individual households are now receiving letters from their insurance companies to the effect that home insurance cover no longer applies to Y2K related exposure. Therefore, any level of certainty the Government can offer the marketplace would no doubt minimise this kind of risk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Earlier I mentioned the question of alarms which is one of the areas that is most vulnerable to the embedded chips. As regards the insurers, it would have been helpful it all that had been highlighted for people a long way back. If the alarm system does not operate and, thus, one's household insurance is not valid, it seems a bit unfair to me. I have highlighted this matter publicly on a number of occasions at Y2K conferences and I am doing so again now. The co-ordination committee will be working until the end of this month and it has identified the areas that will not be finished in that time. Most of the important and essential systems have been finished, but there are some in the security area that have not been, as I have already mentioned. I will leave that matter to the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. As regards the Deputy's question about putting it forward, we decided that all Government offices, their associated agencies and public bodies operating under their aegis, would commence publishing information on their year 2000 programmes on the Internet websites. They are doing so and those that have not got websites are using the Department of the Taoiseach's. So, they are highlighting their state of preparedness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach ask the Minister of State with responsibility for insurance to contact all insurance companies to ensure that timely information on the extent of cover for Y2K related problems is issued to all households? Second, will he ask whether they would consider jointly financing with the Government a leaflet to be issued to every household in regard to the matters they need to take in hand to ensure they are Y2K compliant as of 1 January next year? Is the Taoiseach aware that the Government of New Zealand has issued such a communication to every household there telling them exactly what they have to do and what they should check for Y2K compliance? Would he not agree that something like that should be done here also?</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 and 6 together.</P>
      <P>At the SMI launch on 22 July, I made a number of announcements on the achievements of the SMI to date and the future work programme. The key theme of the launch was &ldquo;Delivering Quality Public Service &ndash; responding to the needs of a changing environment&rdquo;. The launch focused on a number of initiatives designed to improve the functioning of the Civil Service and to enhance its capacity to deliver high quality services effectively. Most of these initiatives build on the reports of working groups which were set up under the SMI in recent years. Briefly these are: deepening the quality customer service initiative; introducing an action programme for regulatory reform; extending the scope of freedom of information legislation; new financial management systems; developing human resource management issues, including performance management and recruitment; and promoting gender equality. Details of these can be seen in the documents contained in the packs which were circulated at the launch. I have arranged for these to be made available in the Dáil Library.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my speech that day, I referred to the progress that has been made in recent years in the reform of the public service. I also highlighted the need to continue widening and strengthening the programme of reform throughout the civil and public service. To this end, a number of measures have been taken to ensure that this process is managed effectively. Briefly these are that the SMI implementation group has been broadened to include Departments with large numbers of employees and Departments with responsibility <Col N="1146" /> for the wider public sector. At its first meeting last week, which I attended, the implementation group considered a work programme which includes measures to progress the deepening of the SMI, based on this sectoral approach. The liaison group on widening the SMI to the public service last met in July and is due to meet again early this month. The group comprises representatives from those Departments with responsibility for the various sectors and exists to monitor and progress the SMI modernisation process in the wider public service. It reports directly to the implementation group.</P>
    <P>Central to these reforms is the effective management of performance. The Government has decided that Ministers and Secretaries General should proceed immediately to develop systems of performance management suited to the business needs of the different sectors. This process will be overseen by the implementation group.</P>
    <P>With regard to the specific issue of equality in the Civil Service, I highlighted the need for more to be done to address this issue. The main problem is the dearth of women in senior management grades and, despite the best intentions, the lack of progress made in redressing this imbalance. To this end, the Government in July of this year approved a package of measures which include: the development and adoption of a new equality policy to be drafted by a high level equality group; a programme of affirmative action in the areas of recruitment, placement and mobility, training and development, promotion, work and family responsibilities, language and sexual harassment and policy delivery; the adoption of strategic objective setting at departmental level, including the setting of increasingly specific equality goals, to be achieved over a stated period of time; and the putting in place of new equality structures, locally and centrally, to support implementation of the new policy.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, in his address at the launch, stated that additional resources will be deployed in the equality area and the full report on gender imbalance in the Irish Civil Service, produced by the Institute of Public Administration, will be published shortly. Following discussion of this issue at the SMI implementation group meeting last week, it is expected that the high level equality group will have its first meeting in the near future to begin work on these issues.</P>

      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that one of the major areas of difficulty in public administration is where a topic is the responsibility of more than one Department and that if one is seeking areas where the greatest delays occur or where the greatest problems in getting accountability occur, it is in those which cover more than one Department?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from that, will the Taoiseach indicate why Government Departments have been so slow in using section 12 of the Public Service Management Act, 1997, which provides for interdepartmental co-operation structures to be established? Is he aware that only one Minister has made use of section 12, namely, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, and that all other Ministers recently admitted that they have not made use of the section, which was passed by the House specifically to establish structures to overcome this sort of difficulty? Why is it that all Ministers, other than the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, have been so slow to make use of legislation that was passed by the House? If we pass legislation and Government does not use it, we are wasting our time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have said on a number of occasions, and I will not contradict myself, that section 12 is a good measure. Early in September 1997 I ensured the legislation introduced by the Government of which Deputy Bruton was a member could be used. The Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs is using it and I know that those involved in the children area are considering using it. They are successfully moving forward with the interdepartmental group working at interdepartmental level. Some Ministers and departmental officials find that the interdepartmental committees work quite well. However, using section 12 of the Public Service Management Act, 1997, is a better way to operate because it includes a statutory responsibility. Co-ordination is not mandatory but I increasingly believe it should be used. It is being considered in a number of areas. The Ministers of State with responsibility in the areas of social inclusion, children's issues and drugs issues, Deputies Flood and Fahey, are effectively co-ordinating on a cross-departmental basis. There has been some discussion about whether we should extend that. The fact that this is provided for on the Statute Book meant that Departments started using the interdepartmental groups more effectively, which used not to be the case to any great degree. I will not argue against it. I still believe that using section 12 of the Public Service Management Act on a statutory basis across Departments is probably a better way of progressing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is accountability not the key issue? If you do not use the statute to provide for interdepartmental co-operation, you do not have accountability? Is it not the case that the easy way out for any Department that does not want to be properly accountable is to continue with the old system where they can always blame somebody else? It is only if they use section 12 that that excuse is denied them. Does the Taoiseach not agree that it is, two years after the event, an administrative scandal that no Department, apart from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, has used this section? Does he <Col N="1148" /> remember how long it took to get that legislation through? Does he recall the amount of Civil Service time and other time devoted to its drafting and preparation and, two years later, it is being used by only one Department? Surely this is something that deserves condemnation from the Taoiseach not the sort of half justification he is giving to it now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not justifying that, I am saying that some Departments should use it more. Interdepartmental groups can and do work and the section should not be required at all if they work successfully. However, the practice over the years has been that they do not do so in all cases. I have seen interdepartmental groups working very successfully on many issues. This year, for example, a great deal of work was done in preparation for the Berlin and Cologne summits and Agenda 2000.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not. In the areas of children &ndash; to which I referred earlier, which affects approximately six Departments &ndash; and social inclusion, there is a case for using that section. I have informed Departments of that and I believe it will be used more in the future. It is already being used by Deputy Dermot Ahern's Department and it is being considered by a number of others. Departments have been encouraged to use it. I am not arguing against it. Where Departments are working across the lines they should use it and, increasingly, they will.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In respect of the matter that has just been the subject of discussion, I agree with Deputy Bruton. As the Minister who introduced the legislation in question, I was acutely aware of the need for section 12 and the inherent resistance to it from various line Departments. The latter will only be changed if the head of Government directs or if there is a Cabinet decision that the mechanism be used. Ultimately, therefore, the responsibility falls on the Taoiseach's shoulders. Commentary about the desirability of interdepartmental groups and how they work in relation to Presidency matters or European Union issues is simply evading the issue and I urge the Taoiseach to exercise his responsibilities as Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1149" /> The Taoiseach said in his formal reply that extending the Freedom of Information Act was being examined. What does he mean by that? Is he aware of unscripted comments made by his colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Martin, at a conference in Cork last Friday night when he expressed concerns about the restrictions the Freedom of Information Act imposed upon decision making processes in Government. I was not there when these remarks were made &ndash; they were conveyed accurately to me &ndash; but the Minister indicated to the assembled audience of academics, in the main, and senior civil servants, that the operation of the current Freedom of Information Act prevents, for example &ndash; and this was the phrase used &ndash; a brainstorming session where different options would be put down on paper and that there would be a difficulty subsequently in arriving at a conclusion. If that reflects Government thinking, and the word &ldquo;if&rdquo; is carefully chosen, what kind of extension of the scope of the Freedom of Information Act does the Government have in mind?</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Quinn's first question, there was not any resistance to the REACH programme initiative nor to looking at the children area and the interdepartmental groups working together on the basis that they may use section 12. However, it can be extended. It will be used in suitable areas; it will not be just thrown aside. The point has been made that if it is used there will be more accountability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">

      <P>The only real issue at present is how effectively it is operated in the children area. On the Freedom of Information Act, I am not sure if it is announced yet, but there are some additional areas to which it will be extended in the months ahead, some new agencies including some semi-State bodies. While the Government has no difficulty with the Freedom of Information Act a number of problems have arisen, which could not have been foreseen at the outset, and which the group responsible for monitoring it has highlighted. Those problems will have to be examined in due course. People have devised major abuses of the Act and they will all have to be examined. I am not talking about journalists or politicians, but costly abuses have occurred where Departments are being tied up in bureaucratic knots and an enormous amount of staff resources&mdash;</P>

      <P>Members of the public and private companies, and it is also being used by a number of commercial interests to try to decipher information that could be used against competitors, and there are other areas too. These are issues which could not have been foreseen and these areas have to be examined. There are a number of other less important areas but already, in a very short period, abuses are fairly evident. They will have to be looked at in due course but that does not mean, at the same time, we will consider extending it. I am not aware of the matter the Minister, Deputy Martin, was discussing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the Taoiseach has offered substantially new and perhaps startling information on the floor of the House, and I welcome his frankness in so doing, I invite him to ensure that one of his Ministers will bring to the relevant committee of this House the concerns in substance that he has just articulated in summary. Members of this House should know of the unforeseen difficulties the Taoiseach has now described as should members of the committee which represents all sides of the House, so that a legislative response, if such is needed, can be a consensual response following full consultation with the public at large. If there are unforeseen difficulties of a dangerous nature in respect of competitive pressures or whatever, the House is entitled to be informed. I invite the Taoiseach to consider that and in due course come back to the Houses of the Oireachtas so that in the first instance we can share the experience and then examine the best way to proceed to try to address it and then make progress together to make whatever amendments might be necessary.</P>

      <P>As Deputy Quinn is aware, the system operates so that it is not directly Ministers who make the call on FOI issues; there is a designated official.

      <P>This is something out of which oaks grow. This is on the public record, it is just a riddle. Will the Taoiseach tell the House about the study prepared by Fitzpatrick Associates on the progress of the Strategic Management Initiative, with particular regard to pay issues? Is the Taoiseach aware that the associates in question said that if the Strategic Management Initiative continued to be, as they put it, &ldquo;mandarin led&rdquo;&ndash; and they were not referring to oranges &ndash; it would not work as far as pay was concerned and that it was necessary for the Government, if it was to maintain industrial peace, to develop new gain-sharing techniques where teams of people working in the public service would be specifically financially rewarded for exemplary team performance? What progress has been made in this area? Does the Taoiseach agree with the recommendation from Fitzpatrick Associates that there should be a performance related pay preparedness audit done in all Departments to indicate how well their current management systems are prepared for the use of gain-sharing techniques if such were decided upon because there would not be much point deciding on these if the management techniques did not exist to use them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That really comes into the next question when we will be talking about the ongoing public service discussions with the public service section of the Congress of Trade Unions and the Department to see if we can find a performance pay initiative. Many models, including the one the Deputy mentioned, are being examined in that, but no conclusions have yet been made. Much valuable work on this has been done since the beginning of the year and many models have been examined. Performance pay is important in the public service and the Civil Service. Some model should be found. It will become increasingly difficult to hold on to quality civil and public servants under the current system. That has been an issue for some years and it will become an even bigger issue. Some of the recommendations of Fitzpatrick Associates are important and are being examined but I will come back to that in the next question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter is of substantial concern and the Taoiseach has just indicated the extent of that concern. Will he agree that there is a necessity, first and foremost, to have a wider public debate about this than that which is currently taking place? We had the Hay MSL initial survey and consultancy study that was initiated back in 1997 and which was followed up by the Fitzpatrick study to which Deputy Bruton referred, none of which has taken place in the <Col N="1152" /> public domain. There is no awareness among the wider public that there are detailed discussions going on in relation to either the four clusters of analysis or evaluation or the 17 criteria that relate to them. The Taoiseach is no doubt aware of the widespread divergence of opinion among the various public sector unions on this matter.</P>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that to a certain extent the public sector unions &ndash; and this is not in any way a discredit to them &ndash; are negotiating between themselves and are accountable to nobody else but themselves on this matter? While not wishing to derail, slow down or take away from the need for such negotiations to conclude, this is an internal private conversation, a dialogue concerning both sides with nobody else being represented at the table. Therefore, what plans, if any, does the Government have to ensure that this particularly crucial debate is open to a wider audience so that different views can be expressed other than the internal parties, as both sides are beneficiaries to any system that might be ultimately agreed?</P>

      <P>The carer's allowance is a means tested payment for carers on low income <Col N="1154" /> who look after people in need of full-time care and attention.</P>
      <P>Following a detailed examination of the review of the carer's allowance, which was published in October 1998, a range of measures was introduced in the 1999 budget at an additional annual cost of over £18 million, to improve and develop the position of carers. The estimated expenditure on carer's allowance in 1999 is almost £60 million, which is an increase of almost 40 per cent. At the end of September 1999 there were 13,605 carers in receipt of the carer's allowance compared with 11,100 carers in receipt of the allowance at the same time last year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>There were 13,605, as opposed to 11,100 this time last year. This number is expected to increase to almost 15,000 following the package of measures introduced for carers in the last budget.</P>
      <P>The review of the carer's allowance examined the issue of paying the allowance in conjunction with another social welfare payment. The practice of paying only one allowance is a feature, with very few exceptions, of all social welfare payments and is designed to ensure that limited resources are not used to make two income support payments to any one individual. The review concluded that this practice should continue.</P>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that where a person in receipt of a widow's pension applies for a carer's allowance, she will receive the higher payment &ndash; there is no loss of income. In the majority of cases persons in receipt of a widow's contributory pension would be better off remaining in receipt of this payment and the Department will ensure that this is the case.</P>
      <P>The measures introduced in the 1999 budget clearly indicate my personal commitment and that of the Government to carers and the appreciation we must all have for this valuable role in our society. In addition, my colleagues, the Ministers for Finance, Health and Children and the Environment and Local Government also brought forward proposals for assistance to carers in the last budget. The Government is conscious that such a cross-cutting approach is required and needs to be developed even further.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister accept that it is economically sensible and socially wise to develop the carer system further so that we can encourage more people to be looked after in their own homes? Furthermore, does he accept that pending the introduction of a carer's allowance without a means test we have to look at the worst cases? Does he accept that one of the cruellest cases of all is that of a woman who is looking after her father or father-in-law and whose husband dies? She should get the widow's pension, but if she gets it she loses the carer's allowance. Surely that is a very cruel system. Does the Mini<Col N="1155" /> ster accept that in the next review of the carer's allowance, which hopefully will occur coming up to the budget, this issue should be looked at? The absolute rule that there should be no double payment from the Department should be looked at seriously and the examples such as the one I have given should be addressed. A woman in that position should be entitled to both the carer's allowance and the widow's pension or at least more than just one of those allowances.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Deputy that it is an issue of concern and again I go back to the measures I brought forward in the last budget. That was the first major change in the carer's allowance and, as I said, there was a 40 per cent increase in funding for the scheme. The review I referred to looked at the issue of the introduction of a new non-means tested payment for carers called a continual care payment. This was to recognise those providing the highest level of care and to promote care in the community. The review did consider that this continual care payment, if it was to be introduced, would have to follow on from addressing the issue of needs assessment. I have responded to previous questions on needs assessment by citing the committee under the chairmanship of the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, to examine the issue of needs assessment. One of the main arguments in the review of future issues for carers is that we need to identify the requirements of each carer and each person cared for, and that could only be done on a one to one basis. At present, we do not have a system of needs assessment and we need to put it in place. The question of a continual payment such as that referred to in the review will be examined in that context.</P>

My colleague, Deputy Creed, received a letter from the Minister's Department yesterday which indicated that only 214 people have been refused this payment because of duplication? We are, therefore, talking about a small number of people. If the spouse of the carer is working there is a disregard of £150 and if the carer&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>As I am sure the Deputy is aware, prior to 1953 different types of contributions were payable &ndash; national health insurance, widow's and orphan's pension and unemployment insurance contributions &ndash; which gave specific entitlement only to the benefits of the schemes under which they were paid. The unified system of social insurance was introduced in 1953 and the first major extension to the range of contingencies covered came in 1961 with the introduction of the old age contributory pension scheme. While contributions paid prior to 1961 contained no pension element, it was decided to count all such contributions paid under the unified scheme towards qualification for the new pension. Special transitional arrangements were also made for people who were close to reaching pension age at that time, which permitted certain contributions paid before 1953 to be taken into account for satisfying the yearly average test.</P>
      <P>In addition, provision was made for pre-1953 contributions, paid under the National Health Insurance Acts, to be taken into account for the purposes of satisfying two of the qualifying contribution conditions for the old age contributory pension, namely, that a person must, first, have entered insurance at least ten years before pension age and, second, have at least 156 contributions paid. This arrangement still applies. I have often stated my commitment to ensuring that contributory pension coverage is as widely available as possible and in this context the Department is examining, at my request, the issue of contributions paid prior to 1953 as part of a wider review of the contribution conditions applying to the old age contributory and retirement pensions. This review is nearing completion, but any change to the existing situation in relation to pre-1953 contributions would have to be carefully considered in the context of overall budgetary resources.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Minister has commenced a review of this matter but I am disappointed we are essentially talking about costs. Most Deputies have been approached by senior citizens who are exasperated by the inability to count their pre-1953 contributions, with two groups in particular affected, which I will mention later. It is an increasingly arbitrary position for people reaching their later years so I ask the <Col N="1157" /> Minister to decide, arising from this review, that all stamps earned in a person's working life from the age of 16 will be counted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not say this in an antagonistic way, but this position has existed since the old age pension was begun in 1961 and no changes have been made to alleviate the problem. Many representations are made about pre-1953 contributions but those contributions contained no pension element, they related to other contingencies. I am aware of difficulties on this issue, as are most Members. While the Deputy may be disappointed that it boils down to cost, I must state this is because it will cost money to give credit for pre-1953 contributions and that must be considered in weighing up priorities. Again not wishing to be antagonistic, should we look after this issue to the detriment of people with disabilities, carers, child benefit, etc. It is a matter of prioritising the various issues and coming up with solutions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should stand up much more strongly to the Minister, Deputy McCreevy. There is a budget surplus of £2.5 billion so there is a good deal of money to allocate this year, if the Minister wants to deal with problems such as those faced by these senior citizens. Has the Department estimated the total number involved? Judging by Deputies' clinics, there is a considerable amount. Following from that, has the Department estimated how much it would cost if it was provided for in the next budget? The groups hardest hit by this issue include returned emigrants, who left in the 1950s and 1960s and spent a large part of their working life in the UK or US but find that many years of work here cannot be counted for contributory pension purposes. Those people who have returned to the land of their birth for their remaining years deserve special consideration. People who were sick through no fault of their own and were out of the workforce for considerable periods find it hard to make the contribution requirement and they too are denied this respite in their later years. There are many important things to do and we have heard the discussion about carers, but to provide justice for our senior citizens in their retirement, I urge the Minister to ensure that the next budget changes this requirement and allows people to count all their contributions as stamps from age 16.</P>

      <P>I have already indicated to the Deputy that my Department is reviewing the current method of assessing capital, which was introduced by my predecessor. As part of this review, a recent sample survey was carried out to identify the amounts of capital held by old age pensioners. This survey indicates that of the 35,000 pensioners who have capital, approximately 24,600, or 70 per cent, have less than £5,000, while some 31,000, or 88 per cent, have less than £10,000. Only about 4 per cent of pensioners surveyed had capital in excess of £20,000.</P>
      <P>In the light of the survey findings, my Department is currently examining options for improving the method of assessing capital. However, in addition to benefiting those already in receipt of old age &ndash; non-contributory &ndash; pensions, any reduction of the current assessment rates would also be of benefit to pensioners with substantial amounts of capital who are not currently entitled to payment. I would be anxious, therefore, to ensure that any possible changes to the current rules would benefit those with modest amounts of capital, while the system should continue to ensure that the small proportion of people with large amounts of capital should avail of it to contribute, at least partially, towards meeting their needs. As any relaxation of the current rules would have financial implications, such a change could only be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>We have had this discussion before and I will not go into the detail of it again. I have accepted that, on the face of it, the figures of 7.5 per cent and 15 per cent look excessive. However, I said before &ndash; I have looked at this thoroughly, including the files and the reason the figures were introduced at that level &ndash; they do not take into account the substantial initial disregard of £2,000. That was devised by my Depart<Col N="1159" /> ment and accepted by then Minister, Deputy De Rossa, because it would assist people with modest capital. However, in the light of changing circumstances, I previously indicated &ndash; obviously I accept the view of the all-party committee &ndash; that perhaps this should be examined. That is one of the reasons we instigated this review and why the Department carried out this survey. We are examining that. There are a number of suggestions before me which I will consider in the context of the forthcoming budget. I cannot pre-empt what may happen at that stage. It is probably better that the assessment is as transparent as possible so people fully understand it. I do not think people understand the current system, which looks excessive. However, the net effective rate is in the region of only about 3 per cent for those couples with capital under £20,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">

      <P>I accept that. It has always been the view of successive Governments and Ministers that we should endeavour to assist people. For example, the £2,000 disregard was introduced to allow people to have capital in the event of death or whatever. Obviously, this may need to be considered in changing times. It is important, having looked at the practice in other European countries, that the system of assessment here is much more favourable, particularly compared with our nearest neighbour. In Sweden, Norway, Finland, Austria, Switzerland, Spain and Portugal, claimants must use all their assets and capital before they receive social assistance. In other countries, entitlement to social assistance ceases once one's assets exceed a very small disregard. We have a favourable assessment procedure which should be continued. However, we are trying to make it more transparent and understandable to the public.</P>

These arrangements were introduced in November 1997 when I signed regulations. Prior to that, the entire qualified adult allowance was withdrawn at the £60 threshold.</P>
      <P>I have recently introduced further regulations which I signed last week. They extend these arrangements to cover spouses' incomes of up to £105, an increase from £90, and these revised arrangements are being brought into effect over the next week. The new arrangements reduce the amount of qualified adult allowance which is lost as income increases. These arrangements apply equally to income from all sources, including income earned from employment as a home help.</P>
      <P>The income disregard for the one parent family payment is in recognition of the particular problems which lone parents may have in accessing the jobs market and their special needs, such as in the area of child care I would not accept that income disregards of that level should necessarily apply to other categories. The issue highlighted by the Deputy can be best tackled through further enhancement of the arrangements for a more tapered withdrawal of the qualified adult allowance and I am examining the scope for such improvements in the context of the forthcoming budget.</P>

      <Quest>the way in which capital is assessed when a young person living at home with his or her parents has applied for unemployment assistance; when these limits were first introduced; and if he has satisfied himself that these limits are set at a reasonable level.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">

      <P>The Deputy has raised two issues in his question, the assessment of capital for the purposes of the unemployment assistance scheme and the assessment of benefit and privilege where a claimant lives at home. However, I understand the case the Deputy has in mind relates to a claimant with a small amount of capital who has lost entitlement to payment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unemployment assistance is a means tested payment and as such it is designed to ensure the limited resources available are directed at those most in need. In assessing a person's means for unemployment assistance purposes, account is taken of any cash income the person may have together with the value of any capital or property. In addition, the value of any benefit or privilege enjoyed by an applicant, such as that of free board and lodging in the family home, is assessed. A number of improvements have been made in the assessment of benefit and privilege in recent years. For instance, where the sole means of a claimant for unemployment assistance are derived from the assessment of benefit and privilege and that person qualifies for a payment, even at a reduced rate, he or she is entitled to receive a minimum payment of £25 a week. However, <Col N="1162" /> where such a person has additional means from any other source, for example, earnings from part-time work or the value of capital owned, the full means of that person are assessed. The £25 minimum payment only applies where there are no other means. That has been the position since the measure was introduced in 1993 and there has been no change in that respect.</P>
    <P>The value of capital for unemployment assistance purposes is determined by assessing the first £400 at 5 per cent, with the balance being assessed at 10 per cent. This is the formula which has applied to the scheme since its introduction. Over the years different methods of assessing the value of capital have been applied to the various social assistance schemes. This led to significant differences in the treatment of capital under the different social assistance schemes. Accordingly, it was decided to introduce a standardised method of assessing capital across all social assistance schemes.</P>
    <P>Under the revised capital assessment method, which was introduced by my predecessor in 1996, the first £2,000 is disregarded, the next £20,000 is assessed at 7.5 per cent and the balance is assessed at 15 per cent. This standardised method has now been extended on a progressive basis to all social assistance schemes, other than unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare allowance. However, since the introduction of the standardised method of assessing capital, interest rates available on investments have fallen significantly. In the circumstances and because of representations, I have arranged for my Department to review the current standardised method of assessing capital.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information</i>As I have already indicated, the original intention had been to extend the standardised capital assessment method to all social assistance schemes. However, in view of the changed circumstances in relation to interest rates, it would be preferable to await the outcome of the review before making any changes in the method of assessing capital for unemployment assistance purposes. Any relaxation of the current rules would have financial implications and could only be considered in a budgetary context.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister mentioned capital disregard when replying to questions from Deputy Jim O'Keeffe. There is no capital disregard for unemployment assistance. The Minister, like myself, is a family man. Our children get money for their First Communion and Confirmation, which means they have some money in the bank when they go to college. I came across a case recently where a young girl had £600 in her bank account. A notional assessment on that money meant she could not claim unemployment assistance and get the minimum payment of £25 per week or participate in the student summer jobs scheme. I hope the Minister introduces income disregard because it is outrageous that <Col N="1163" /> someone with a small amount of money cannot receive a small payment. We are forcing people out of their homes to live in flats and claim unemployment assistance and rent allowance, thereby costing the State more money.</P>

      <P>I have looked at the case the Deputy raised. I agree there is an anomaly but it has been there since 1993 and no disregard has been put in place. Originally we wanted to extend the standardised capital assessment to all schemes, which would deal with this case. However, because of a decision made by me and my Department to look at the existing 7.5 and 15 per cent standard method, we have decided to leave everything for the time being. We hope to devise an overall new standardised system which would apply across all schemes and would deal with the difficulties in this case. We must await the result of that review.</P>

The Minister should review this case and pay the money as it would make a big difference in the circumstances.</P>

      <P>I understand the Deputy is referring to assistance for the cost of the transport and storage of furniture for persons who are evicted from private rented accommodation and <Col N="1164" /> who are awaiting local authority housing. The Deputy will be aware that under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme a health board may make a single payment to help meet essential once-off exceptional expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income. These payments are known as exceptional needs payments and they are subject to a means test. Eligible people would normally be in receipt of a social welfare or health board payment.</P>
      <P>Guidelines on exceptional needs payments were published in 1995 to try to achieve consistency of treatment of applications for exceptional needs payments both within and between the eight health boards. The legislation does not allow me to prescribe either the circumstances or the nature of the need in respect of which a payment may be made. Exceptional needs payments are payable at the discretion of the health board taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case. I confirm that the health boards provide financial assistance in the circumstances of eviction. Each case is dealt with on its on merits.</P>

      <P>I would probably have been more fulsome in my reply but for the fact the question was in the name of Deputy De Rossa. We looked at the fact that Deputy Broughan had raised a number of cases. He provided my Department with the names of three people who were seeking assistance. One person had already been evicted with her three children and her current address is unknown. The Eastern Health Board has confirmed that the Deputy made representations on behalf of one individual only. I understand the Eastern Health Board replied on 23 September asking the Deputy to get that person to contact the health board by telephone or in person. However, there is no record, as far as we are aware, of that person making any contact to date. I advise the Deputy to encourage his constituent to contact the health board.</P>

The 50,000 people on local authority waiting lists have no immediate hope of being housed and 5,000 are regarded as homeless.

      <Quest>the projected cost of adjusting contributory and non-contributory pensions in line with inflation plus 1 and 2 per cent and with average earning increases for the three years commencing 2000.</Quest>

      <P>The information requested is contained in a table which I am making available to the Deputy. The table shows the full year cost of increasing the personal rates of contributory and non-contributory pensions payable to persons aged over 66 by the various options outlined in the question. The table also details the actual cost of the improvements in the personal rates of such pensions which were introduced in the last two budgets.</P>
      <P>The cost of the measures introduced in the last two budgets far exceeds any of the future options outlined or requested in the question. The full year cost of increases in the personal rate of social welfare pensions payable to those over 66 introduced in the 1998 and 1999 budgets was £82 million and £100 million respectively. The maximum personal rate of old age retirement pension which now stands at £89 per week has been increased by 14 per cent since this Government came into office.</P>
      <P>The 1999 budget provided for an increase of £6 per week in the personal rate of all pensions payable to those over 66. This increase ranged from 7.2 per cent to 8.3 per cent depending on the pension involved. On the basis of an expected inflation rate of 2 per cent in 1999, these increases represented real increases of between 5.1 per cent and 6.2 per cent and were also well in excess of earnings inflation which is projected to be 5.5 per cent for 1999. The 1999 budget additionally provided for increases in the qualified adult allowances payable to pensioners. Where a qualified adult is aged over 66, the rate was increased by £3 per week. This increase ranged between 5.3 per cent and 7.3 per cent and represented a real increase of between 3.2 per cent and 5.2 per cent. The rate applicable to qualified adults under the age of 66 was also increased by £2 per week or 4.9 per cent.</P>
      <P>Achievement of its manifesto commitment to raise the maximum personal rate of contributory pensions to £100 per week by 2000 remains one of the Government's key targets. As I outlined, significant progress in this regard has already been made and I look forward to further securing the position of older people in our community in the years ahead.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree that the report monitoring poverty trends indicates that in the period to 1997 social welfare payments, including payments to senior citizens, only rose at approximately half the level of the general income of the community? How does the Minister intend to address the concerns expressed by the Irish senior citizens' parliament, which will make a submission to the Minister this year? It will ask specifically that consideration be given to a pension regime which would tie in pensions to average income in the long-term and that, as a first step, the Minister should aim at 34 per cent of average income as the norm for contributory and non-contributory pensions in 2002. Subsequently, the aim should be a rate of perhaps 40 per cent of average income. Does the Minister agree the problem is that people on fixed incomes, particularly senior citizens, are left at a disadvantage in a country such as Ireland where national income is growing at a rate of 10 per cent per annum? Incomes throughout the community are growing at a tremendously fast rate but they are not receiving any of the bonuses associated with the Celtic tiger.</P>

Our record since we came into office just over two years ago shows our commitment in that respect. The senior citizens' parliament may have demands but the representatives of old age pensioners at the budget forum would compliment the way in which the increases of £5 and £6 were given in the last budgets and also the changes made regarding the pre-1956 issue which was a bone of contention. They would also compliment a number of other dramatic changes which have been made, such as the bereavement grant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The increases in the last two budgets were ahead of the consumer price index by a large degree. They were also ahead of the level of <Col N="1168" /> increase in earnings. The Government's commitment to old age pensioners is illustrated by its strategic decision to place a major proportion of the proceeds of the sale of Telecom Éireann into future pensions. This may not win us votes at the next election but this strategic decision was necessary for the betterment of the people in the future.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister accept that he is in a position to raise his sights substantially and to considerably increase his demands because of the amount of money which is available to the Exchequer? Everything has changed and we are now in a position to qualitatively and substantively improve the lot of the elderly. From that point of view, the Minister should not be shy about making major demands in the upcoming budget to improve the lot of the elderly and other social welfare recipients.</P>

However, I assure the Deputy that I will shout for as much as possible for old age pensioners and others.</P>
      <P>It is easy for people to say that the place is awash with money and it would be easy for the Government to splurge the existing funds and give in to all the existing demands. However, we must keep an eye to the future because it may not always be rosy. This is what the Government is doing and why it made a strategic decision. The importance of this decision may not be fully understood by people but a major element of the proceeds of the Telecom Éireann sale will go towards social welfare pensions in the future to ensure&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Government recently decided that a number of asylum seekers whose applications for asylum have been pending for more than 12 months will be granted permission to work and, as a result, they are also entitled to claim unemployment assistance. Arrangements are being worked out currently between my Department and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform regarding the identification and confirmation of status of the individuals in question. As the Deputy stated, many persons in this category are currently in receipt of supplementary welfare allowance and arrangements are ongoing with the health boards to manage their transition from supplementary welfare allowance to unemployment assistance.</P>
      <P>When these arrangements have been finalised, consultation will also take place at local level between social welfare local offices and local community welfare officers to facilitate the transfer of individual claims. During this transition phase the priority will be to ensure that there is not a disruption in payment arrangements. In addition, every effort will be made to ensure that customers are made fully aware of their entitlements and responsibilities under the various schemes administered by my Department and the full range of employment and other supports.</P>
      <P>A working group comprised of my Department and the health boards has been working out the transition arrangements and any particular issues arising which may require special provision will be addressed by the group.

However, once they go on the live register they will be able to access the training programmes available through FÁS and other agencies. Given the difficulties with language, background and culture, it will be a learning process for all concerned and the Department will have to be aware of that aspect. Until now, direct contact between asylum seekers and my Department has been <Col N="1170" /> negligible because the asylum seekers were referred to community welfare officers. We will ensure that the transition takes place smoothly. One can look to the transition that took place between disabled person's maintenance allowance and DA.

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 48, 64, 65 and 82 together.</P>
      <P>The carer's allowance is a means tested payment for carers on low income who look after people in need of full-time care and attention. Following a detailed examination of the review of the carer's allowance, which was published in October 1998, a range of measures was introduced in the 1999 budget at an additional annual cost of more than £18 million to improve and develop the position of carers. These measures were implemented between April and August this year. The estimated expenditure on carer's allowance in 1999 is almost £60 million. At the end of September 1999, there were 13,605 carers in receipt of the carer's allowance compared with 11,100 at the same time last year. This number is expected to increase to almost 15,000 when the package of measures introduced for carers in the last budget come into full effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1171" /> The review of the carer's allowance proposed the introduction of a PRSI carer's benefit to facilitate carers in employment to temporarily leave work to care. The review envisaged that this would be financed through the PRSI system. The proposal would, for example, require an increase of the order of 0.1 per cent to 0.2 per cent in each of the current employee and employer PRSI rates, depending on the level of Exchequer contribution. A working group has recently been established in my Department to examine the operational details involved in the introduction of a carer's benefit scheme.</P>
    <P>The review considered that a needs assessment encompassing both the needs of the care recipient and the carer should be introduced. This would separate care needs from income support needs and could be used by all State organisations which provide reliefs or grants to those in need of care. A working group which is chaired by Deputy Moffatt, Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, and comprising membership from my Department and the health boards has been set up to advance this proposal.</P>
    <P>The review of the carer's allowance also examined the issue of paying the carer's allowance in conjunction with another social welfare payment. The practice of paying only one allowance is a feature, with few exceptions, of all social welfare payments and is designed to ensure that limited resources are not used to make two income support payments to any one individual. The review concluded that the payment of two concurrent income support allowances would not be an effective use of resources.</P>
    <P>The measures introduced in the 1999 budget clearly indicate my commitment and that of the Government to carers and the appreciation we must have for this valuable role in society. In addition, my colleagues, the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Health and Children and the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, have also brought forward proposals of assistance to carers. The Government is conscious that such an integrated approach is required and needs to be developed further. Further improvements in the carer's allowance will be considered in a budgetary context.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Keeffe and I have asked the Minister on a number of occasions about the possibility of providing a carer's benefit and I am glad he has advanced the proposal to the stage of a working group examining the figures and how it can be done. Everybody has encountered cases where people have no alternative but to leave the workforce to look after a spouse or parent and the provision of a benefit based on their caring work would be welcome. I urge the Minister in his forthcoming battles with the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, to go out of his way to try to introduce this in the 2000 budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1172" /> Did the Minister also indicate in his reply that he is considering introducing a cost of caring allowance? He said he is trying to separate the expenditure on the person who is being cared for from the carer. Will he introduce such an allowance? Estimates of the number of carers that will be required have ranged to 100,000; it will certainly be between 45,000 and 50,000 people. Currently, 15,000 people are being cared for and there are many more people to be reached. The Minister has a big responsibility to reach them by 1 December.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Deputy's point about the future care of the elderly. Obviously, the pensions issue will be important. The Government has decided to invest in pensions. An ever increasing aging population will put further strain on health resources and raises the issue of how we are to care for the elderly. The Government is conscious of the major task ahead of it and future Governments in that respect.</P>
      <P>The carer's allowance review recommended a number of measures and the Government implemented all of them except two. The first was the carer's benefit which we are examining at present. The cost of introducing such a measure is significant; we estimate it could be approximately £42 million. It could be financed through an increase in PRSI payments and that is being examined by a working group which comprises people from a number of Departments.</P>
      <P>The issue of a continual care payment is not to be confused with a cost of care payment, which is recommended by the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities. It would be under the aegis of the Department of Health and Children. The continual care payment under the carer's allowance is indicated in the review as a payment for those people who are caring with the highest level of care. Before that can be introduced we need a proper system of needs assessment. That is why we have set up this working group, with Deputy Moffatt in the chair, to look at the introduction of a needs assessment system. It is not an easy task because one will try to identify on a one to one basis the needs of particular individuals and, obviously, what comes out of that will have huge financial implications.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever about the improvements in the carer's allowance, does the Minister accept that at best one in three carers qualify for an allowance and the system must continue to be improved? I wish to return to the issue of those who are excluded because they are in receipt of another social welfare payment. Does the Minister acknowledge that if that payment is from another EU member state, the individual in many instances in not disqualified from receiving the carer's allowance? Does he accept that if the spouse of the carer is in receipt of a social welfare payment, that should not disqualify them? Is it a question of cost or principle, or both? Does he further accept that the assessment is unfair to <Col N="1173" /> many women in particular? If he is improving the system, why is he reluctant to tackle this anomaly?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>My record speaks for itself. I introduced major reforms in the allowance, which were appreciated. A total of 11 different initiatives were involved, ten of which were announced in the budget. I brought an additional one forward which related to people who did not receive the carer's allowance because the care recipient might have been deceased.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Such individuals are entitled to receive the back to work allowance. The allowance was originally introduced to help low income carers and that is why the means test was put in place. Child benefit is the only payment in the social welfare system which is not means tested. The review of the carer's allowance recommended that means testing should continue in order to ensure that the available resources were targeted at those who were most in need.</P>
      <P>However, in the last budget I made a change in regard to spousal income and I will continue to look at the issue of the disregard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>However, in the past two years there has been no change. Does the Minister accept that £150 is not sufficient? Is he prepared to change that? Is he satisfied that the regulations relating to people who do not live under the one roof are being implemented in a reasonable manner? Is he further satisfied that those who are assessed, such as small farmers and businessmen, are treated in a realistic manner, taking into account the reduction in income, especially in farming?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Deputy in regard to the regulations I made on residency changes that I am paying attention to their implementation. I informed the carers' association that if difficulties arose my officials would look at them in conjunction with it to see how they are implemented. The regulations are in place and are as generous as can be. It depends on where one draws the line in regard to the residency issue and we have been as fair as possible in their implementation. However, if difficulties arise they can be addressed. At the end of the day, it is up to the deciding officers and they must make a judgment, but we are monitoring any adverse decision in that respect.</P>
      <P>Over the past two years I have endeavoured to target more people in terms of the means test and the disregard not just on the basis of their income. In particular, those who were in receipt of domiciliary care allowance can receive the carer's allowance because it is better for them. That was one of the major changes in the budget, rather than just raising the income level and bringing in an extra couple of thousand people, who might not necessarily be the worst cases. People in receipt of domiciliary care allowance are the worst cases. The issue of the disregard will be looked at in future budgets but it is one of the most generous in the social welfare system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be looked at in the context of the budget. There are a number of other issues which are being looked at not only by the Government but, indeed, by the social partners. I have had discussions with a number of the social partners in regard to the issue of carer's benefit. Some of them will push the parental leave issue. However, the issues involved must be looked at in terms of priority. We need to put in place a carer's benefit to allow people to take time off work to look after somebody in the home. Other people believe that parental leave should be dealt with sooner than carer's benefit. The carer's benefit is probably the best route to take in this respect, but, ultimately, the issue of carer's benefit will have to be decided in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>It must be remembered that home education takes place in the home, not in a public building. Any authorised officer calling to a home should respect the privacy of the family. It should also be remembered that parents are often not professional teachers and are not used to the scrutiny of an inspector. Parents believe strongly that any observation of the child receiving such instruction as part of the education provided would be unlikely to give a true insight into the education the child receives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned that these measures are supposed to be implemented before the child is put on the register. Any assessment would, presum<Col N="1176" /> ably, assess the child's knowledge acquired at the school he or she previously attended or his or her development up to the age of five. As home education may have only just commenced, these measures should be taken later if for some reason there was concern about the standard of education provided. These measures need only be applied where there is such doubt and not as a routine procedure on application. Such assessments attract criticism. I feel that the overall mistake being made in section 15(4) is that it is too threatening. If the accent were put on providing help and advice to parents who wish to retain their responsibility to educate their children, the authorities would receive greater co-operation. The Bill seems to say &ldquo;prove to us that you are providing a suitable standard of education&rdquo; and does so in a very threatening and intrusive way. This attitude will lead to conflict and non-co-operation.</P>
    <P>It is important that any minimum standard set should not just cover children educated outside the school system. It is also important that any social welfare payments would be made available to home educators. At present, home educators lose their children's allowance payment when the child reaches 16 years of age, regardless of whether the child is still receiving a full-time education. They are also unable to avail of the book grant scheme which is administered through the schools.</P>
    <P>The general feeling among home educators is that the Bill has been written to deal with home education without any understanding of what home education involves. It attempts to treat home education in the same manner and according to the same rules as school education although the approach is totally different and should be treated accordingly.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides a framework through which truancy and the risk of young people dropping out of society can be addressed. If we achieve this, we will succeed in reducing criminal activity. I welcome the Bill.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Foley for sharing his time. I welcome the Bill and congratulate the Minister, Deputy Martin, and the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, for introducing it. I particularly welcome the two broad aims of the Bill, the first of which relates to the child's right to a minimum education, the right of parents to choose how that education is to be provided and the State's role in providing for an education for each child. The Minister has achieved the right balance in this very sensitive and delicate area.</P>
      <P>There is the question of how a &ldquo;minimum education&rdquo; should be defined. I hope the home-school parents will be consulted on that. The Bill provides a structure through which school attendance to leaving certificate level can be encouraged and promoted and through which students can be given a solid educational basis for later life. That commitment is a very important element of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1177" /> It is very important to recognise that parents have rights in regard to their children's education. The Bill protects these rights. It has been pointed out to me by the Coalition of Irish Home Schools that some parents will opt to have their children educated outside the recognised school system. This is particularly relevant in the light of the introduction of a new primary school curriculum. The Minister has clearly stated that the new primary school curriculum will be child-centred and feature an increase in practical work. The primary school curriculum of the 1970s was child-centred, as are systems such as Montessori and Froebel which involve a great deal of practical work. I have read the literature on the new curriculum, on which in-service training will be provided to teachers, and I believe it will be a very exciting programme for our schools.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the National Education Welfare Board which will play a key role, particularly in regard to children receiving education outside the recognised school system. There has been a good deal of misunderstanding about home schooling which is one of the areas in question. Some people may envisage the isolation of students when they think of home schooling. They may recall the fairy tales of Rapunzel in her tower with her long hair or princes and princesses with their private tutors. That is not what is involved here. Many families are involved in home schooling. Children do socialise with other children and with members of their own families and extended families. Many practical benefits accrue from home schooling. For example, there is not the same disruption involved with rushing children out to schools in the morning and having to wake younger children in order to bring older children to school or to the pick-up point for school buses in rural areas. Another advantage of home schooling is that a greater degree of individual attention is available to children.</P>
    <P>The issue of bullying, which is a very big issue in our schools, would not arise in home schooling. I am not referring merely to horseplay in playgrounds but also to the use of sarcasm and the running down of pupils by teachers or other students. It is a serious issue which must be tackled by the Department.</P>
    <P>I am very glad that some of our smaller schools in particular encourage the idea of social skills or endeavour awards to improve students' self-esteem which, as we see from reports, is lacking. The Government has appointed a commission to examine the points system. I do not intend to condemn the points system because I do not know what the alternative is. However, I know that not all students will be able to achieve the increased points required for entry into third level. The system of awards to which I referred above is very beneficial for students.</P>
    <P>Part of the teacher training programme which I and other teachers underwent involved the basic issue of roll book completion but we received very little information on school attendance officers. I was amazed when, in my first teaching <Col N="1178" /> position in Dublin, I met a school attendance officer almost every week because the school in which I taught was located in a so-called disadvantaged area. That situation has now been addressed by the Minister. In many housing estates, particularly in the inner city, students and families are sometimes transferred by local authorities thereby affecting the students' education.</P>
    <P>I strongly support the Minister in regard to the Bill's second objective of encouraging school attendance. He referred to the fact that 10,000 teenagers leave education each year without obtaining any qualifications and are subsequently at a disadvantage in securing employment. That is very worrying. However, the Minister's views on school attendance are very positive. He has developed many schemes to assist children to stay at school. At third level, grants are available to mature students and others who return to education. In regard to the back to education scheme, I am somewhat disappointed that a person must be in receipt of social welfare for six months before he or she can avail of the scheme. The priority should be to encourage people back into the education system as quickly as possible, whether at second or third level. I hope the Minister and the Government will investigate ways of doing that.</P>
    <P>The fact that the Bill makes specific provision for people between 16 and 18 years of age is very important. I would be very concerned about such students leaving education and moving into employment too soon, taking up low paid and low skill jobs which can keep young people in cycles of poverty and disadvantage.</P>
    <P>There is great variety in the new curriculum. It certainly contrasts with some of the stories we have heard about systems in other countries. Perhaps the Leas-Cheann Comhairle is familiar with the song about an American system of education where a young student who wants to display his flair at art is told by the teacher &ldquo;flowers are red, young man, and green leaves are green and you don't have to see flowers any other way than the way they always have been seen&rdquo;. I hope that all the colours of the rainbow will be available to students who will avail of the new curriculum. The new curriculum will be a major challenge for teachers who constantly compete with television, video, computer games and other aspects of the media and I welcome the provision of in-service training for them. We are also faced with the challenge of coping with the special needs which exist. The Minister has made remedial and resource teachers available for that purpose.</P>
    <P>Now that the campaign by teachers' unions is well under way, I hope that the pupil-teacher ratio can be lowered at first and second levels. The ASTI, in particular, have made that case very strongly. I also hope that areas such as music, art and physical education will be highlighted in the new curriculum. As Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Science, I welcome the production of a report on the role of music in education on which we have had some <Col N="1179" /> very interesting submissions. Physical education will be accorded a great deal of priority under the new curriculum.</P>
    <P>In 1970, when the new curriculum was introduced at primary level &ndash; a curriculum which was supposed to be child-centred &ndash; only two booklets were available on it. There is a wide range of reading material for the 1999 curriculum. It will be a great challenge for our teachers but I hope it will be an exciting one. I hope students in first and second level schools will be able to avail of the great benefits of this curriculum and that it will be of benefit to our education system.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill and on the broader education structures. The Bill provides for greater clarity, certainly as regards each child's right to a minimum education, the rights of parents to choose how that education is provided and the State's role in providing for an education for each child. The Bill also provides a structure to encourage and promote school attendance up to leaving certificate level or its equivalent and by so doing gives our students a solid educational base for later life. I accept the Minister is bringing forward the best laws he can, but if we do not have financial support and personnel backup, this Bill, like many others, may not achieve its aspirations.</P>
      <P>We are all aware of the strong evidence of a very close link between poor school attendance and social and economic disadvantage in later life. It has been shown that 90 per cent of households classified as poor are headed by an early school leaver. There are some who would prove that wrong, but they are the exception rather than the rule. People with low educational qualifications have less chance of employment than people with higher educational qualifications. The ESRI, in its identification of the national investment priorities for 2000-06, also noted that research found that the absence of educational qualifications among many school leavers leaves them seriously at risk of spending much of their lives unemployed.</P>
      <P>The ESRI also warned that, despite our economic success, people who leave the education system without qualifications will remain at a significant disadvantage in finding employment. It highlighted interventions for children who are currently not making it through the system as the first priority for investment in education over the period of the next National Development Plan, and I agree with that. Each year more than 10,000 teenagers leave the education system without any qualifications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a need for co-operation in this area, and every effort must be made to bring people <Col N="1180" /> together rather than face confrontation. Partnerships and community groups highlight what can be done and what is possible. In my community, a play group has been set up which will give a good start to the children involved when they reach primary school.</P>
    <P>Many schools have sought remedial and resources teachers over the years. We, as politicians, are as guilty as anybody else when we announce with great gusto that a remedial teacher has been provided, especially in rural areas, to four or five schools. It is nothing short of a farce, not through any fault of the teachers but because they spend so much time on the road and so little with the children. They do not have the opportunity to build a relationship with the children which is necessary if they are to move forward.</P>
    <P>I am worried about what will happen to the FÁS workers who have acted as school assistants in recent years. I know the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, has stepped back from the abyss but I am not sure of the full extent of this. The young people who have acted as school assistants have been very beneficial to schools in general but especially to those with handicaps and those in need of extra help.</P>
    <P>I will briefly cover dyslexia, speech needs and autism. Families who can afford to travel or to move house often find a resolution to this problem but those who live in more isolated rural areas have great difficulty. I put on the record the experience of an individual in 1997, which has been dealt with only recently. In a letter to me she stated:</P>
    <P>Dear Seymour, I wish to bring to your attention my dissatisfaction with the services available. I have for some considerable time now been most anxious about my son. These worries are as a result of my own experiences and concerns expressed in various meetings with the school remedial to discuss his lack of progress in his school work. The remedial teacher advised that she considered it necessary to have him assessed as it was her opinion that he was probably showing the signs of dyslexia. Assessment of his learning disability would be necessary in order to adapt teaching methods to his particular requirements. On 8 February 1996, I went to my own doctor to have him referred to an educational psychologist with regard to him being assessed for dyslexia. I was told that there was a waiting list and it would be approximately six to 12 months before he would be called. I waited patiently for almost 22 months and have received absolutely no contact in regard to my appointment. I contacted my doctor about three weeks ago to find out why he had not been called. After a lot of &ldquo;I don't know&rdquo; answers, eventually, on 20 October I was told to contact a person in Rooskey.</P>
    <P>The letter goes on but it was 12 months after that before the assessment was done. If we are serious <Col N="1181" /> about treating all children equally, this type of thing must stop. That is why I said at the outset that the Bill may be great but if the funding and personnel are not available to deliver on it, we have nothing.</P>
    <P>I recall the introduction of a Bill in 1989 to deal with an issue in agriculture but personnel were not provided, and we all know the results of that. When BSE struck, we did not have the backup or the information. Although the Bill was in place, nothing was done. It is essential that the Minister states clearly that not only is he introducing a Bill, but that he will provide the finance and the personnel to follow it through.</P>
    <P>Last May a couple who discussed their child's needs for special speech classes were assured that their child would be taken into a special class. Unfortunately, there was some misunderstanding and it did not happen. It is now October and there has been no satisfactory resolution to that matter. Autism is a major problem and unless one visits the homes of children with autism, especially when it is at a serious stage, it is difficult to understand. Recently, I visited a person whose two youngest sons are classified under that heading. They have gone to the US to find ways and means to have them treated. The family is now divided with the mother and two children living north of the Border to get help. While that may be an isolated case, all children should be treated equally. It is a very difficult situation but one to which more attention must be paid. The health board and the Department of Education and Science must co-operate more closely in this area to ensure that a family such as this does not suffer. They are talking of building an extension to their house and bringing a specialist teacher over from the US. That would involve an enormous cost but the family is committed to having an adequate service provided. If something is not done for these two young people the State will have to deal with the problem in a much more costly fashion in the years to come. I hope something can be done because if it is not we will face a real problem.</P>
    <P>Those who complete primary, secondary and third level education have a good chance of finding employment. Ten thousand people leave school early every year and the Bill does not provide sufficient incentive to prevent young people doing so in the future. When I consider that the cost of keeping someone in jail is £40,000 a year I must agree with Deputy Richard Bruton's recent proposal that funding be made available to make sure that children from poor families should not be forced to leave school because of lack of finance. The Bill raises the minimum school leaving age to 16 years. This is welcome. However, many young people in difficult family circumstances are obliged to work at weekends or in the evenings and find it impossible to keep up with their school work.</P>
    <P>I question those educationalists who try to encourage people to proceed to second level education when they may be able to work with their <Col N="1182" /> hands at building, carpentry or a similar trade. This area should be re-examined and apprenticeship schemes put in place so that someone who wants to leave school at 16 will find proper opportunities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and I am delighted to have an opportunity to participate in this debate. I congratulate the Minister for trying to tackle the issue of educational welfare which has not been addressed in legislation since the 1920s. The Minister for Education and Science is very lucky because his predecessors could only have dreamed about the amount of funding now available for education. It is important, therefore, that legislation is properly enacted and I hope this Bill will solve many of the problems in our education system. Legislation cannot solve all problems but it is up to the Minister and to the Members of this House to ensure that the enactment of this Bill brings more people into the education system, stops truancy and gives people the chance to avail of education, which is the right of every citizen.</P>
      <P>Our forefathers who established this democracy placed a high value on education and saw it as one of the major factors which would bring the country into a prominent position in the world. It has taken 70 years to do that but we are now reaping the benefit of our predecessors' foresight in establishing one of the best education systems in the western world. We can now be proud that most of our people who have had the opportunity to be educated find they have good employment prospects in Ireland and abroad. A sound education system is one of the foundations stones of a democracy.</P>
      <P>Primary schooling is the foundation of education. If young people do not receive a proper primary education they have a slim chance of progressing through secondary and third level education. The Minister and politicians must seek ways to improve primary education. We must examine the question of class size. Classes in most primary schools are still too large and we must look for ways to reduce class sizes as much as we can over the next number of years. We must also examine the question of remedial teaching. Children who have been helped by remedial teaching have had their passage into second level made much easier. We have a shortage of remedial teachers. We must try to have a remedial teacher between every two schools but in my county remedial teachers are shared by four or five schools. If this ratio were reduced those who find it difficult to progress through the education system would be helped.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of substitute teachers is causing grave concern to parents and pupils and it has not been highlighted. A parent came to me last week to tell me that his son, who is in fifth class has had 11 teachers, eight of them substitute teachers. It is not acceptable that young children, who find it difficult to cope with change, should have two or three different teachers in one year. The Mini<Col N="1183" /> ster must address this matter and the INTO must work in conjunction with the Minister to alleviate the problem of the shortage of primary school teachers. The situation should not be allowed to continue and must be addressed as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>Schools with fewer than 50 pupils &ndash; there are many in my county &ndash; are not entitled to a secretary or a caretaker. School principals' time is being wasted doing secretarial work. Bureaucracy has increased in every area and teachers are obliged to spend valuable time on paperwork when they could be teaching pupils or engaging in extra-curricular activities with them. We must examine the possibility of introducing a scheme to provide at least a part-time secretary for schools with fewer than 50 pupils.</P>
    <P>I received a letter this week from a constituent on the question of home education. When the Minister for Education and Science deals with this issue on Committee Stage, I would like him to take into consideration what this constituent wrote to me. The letter states: &ldquo;as a parent who has chosen to educate our youngest son without sending him to the State school until an age to start at secondary school, my wife and I would like to know that our wishes and rights and those of other families like ourselves would be fully considered under the Education (Welfare) Bill&rdquo;. The letter also states: &ldquo;without entering into the whole debate of education, it is, as I am sure you are aware, provided for under the Constitution and it is this provision that seems to be under threat by this Bill .. in particular, it does not seem appropriate to us that choosing to take responsibility for our children's early education should necessarily mean that we are encouraging truancy and, therefore, we feel very strongly that we should not be treated the same as parents who do not take the same care over their children's upbringing. In failing to take account of home education as a valid means of education, it would appear that the Department has not conducted sufficient research in this area&rdquo;. The letter asks specifically, what home education experts were consulted? That issue must be dealt with. I ask the Minister to deal with on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and this opportunity to debate it as it gives Deputies on all sides of the House an opportunity to discuss education in general. That the legislation on which we have been depending dates from 1926 gives us an indication of the areas of education that have been neglected for years by the State, particularly education during young people's formative years. While great strides have been made in recent years to encourage certain sections of our society to continue their education and move forward to third level, a major draft of people have been left very much behind. That, at least, is something this Bill recognises and, I hope its provisions, when implemented, will be backed up <Col N="1184" /> by the necessary resources to make sure it succeeds.</P>
      <P>The most important parameter of this Bill was to ensure that it does not conflict with the Constitution. I am sure some people will argue that it will infringe on the rights of parents to educate their children at home. While parents have rights, they also have responsibilities. This Bill is trying to deal effectively with that and it is sensitive and balanced.</P>
      <P>Our Constitution sets out a number of broad principles, which underpin our education system. These principles strike a fine balance between the rights and duties of children, parents and the State. This legislation respects the balance between the rights of all the participants and a broad consultative debate took place prior to the publication of this legislation. Of particular relevance are the provisions relating to the role of the family as the primary and natural educator of the child. Article 42.1 of the Constitution states &ldquo;The State . guarantees to respect the inalienable right and duty of parents to provide, according to their means, for the religious and moral, intellectual, physical and social education of their children.&rdquo;  Article 42.2 states &ldquo;Parents shall be free to provide this education in their homes or in private schools or in schools recognised or established by the State.&rdquo;  Article 42.3.2º. states that these provisions recognise the right of parents to educate their children while at the same time requiring &ldquo;The State .. as guardian of the common good, require in view of actual conditions that the children receive a certain minimum education, moral, intellectual and social.&rdquo;  The Bill had to take account of those articles of the Constitution. I am confident that if there is a challenge in the Supreme Court as to the constitutionality of the Bill and having regard to the wide consultation that took place prior to its publication, it will stand up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the broader context of the Bill, we are always amazed at various statistical data published on a fairly regular basis. We can draw corollaries between unemployment, low self-esteem, adult illiteracy, the problem of early school leavers and truancy. Every Deputy in this House, particularly Deputies who represent large urban areas, is aware that there is a good deal of social disadvantage and State neglect and that for years the State has ignored the plight of many disadvantaged people. We are all aware that the problem of early school leavers has been with us for some time. Many people who were born in the 1920s or 1930s finished their primary education and were able to find some form of work to sustain themselves and their families, but in recent years the need to have a qualification has increased. A person with a good leaving certificate in the 1970s could walk down a financial street in Cork or Dublin and many of the financial institutions or other big companies would have been more than willing to offer employment, but nowadays one must have a degree or a master's before one is considered for this type of <Col N="1185" /> work. The education qualifications system has continually moved on, yet the system has failed to take account of the large proportion of people who, because of social disadvantage, a history of adult illiteracy in the family or continuous unemployment within the family, have been forgotten. At last this Bill recognises that. It is most important that the necessary resources are put in place to ensure that when the Bill is implemented, those people can be detected in time.</P>
    <P>Another issue that must be addressed is a tracking system for early school leavers. With the benefit of modern technology and the availability of computers in schools and through the Department of Education and Science, if a child were to leave one school and not enrol in another within a certain period of time, we should be able detect that he or she is not in formal education. It is beyond belief that one can walk the streets of Dublin and parts of Cork and see children, eight, nine and ten years of age, on a Tuesday morning at 11 o'clock begging on the streets. It is a damning indictment of society and of the education system, which cannot seem to tackle that problem. When schools are contacted about this problem, it is often found that a pupil has moved from one school but has not enrolled in another. If the Department of Education and Science is serious about tracking young people who have dropped out of school, it will set up a computerised system to detect where a pupil leaves a school with or without notice, and does not enrol in another, so that an educational officer will be able to investigate the problem. Children in this category are to be found on our streets every day of the week. Such a measure would be one very positive administrative step towards ensuring that this legislation will be successful.</P>
    <P>In recent years we have heard that the Exchequer is overflowing with money. We have an opportunity now to ensure that social disadvantage is tackled right across the board. We must also ensure that we have a proper statistical database whereby regular surveys could be conducted in schools to detect truancy problems or indicate where pupils come from a background that is not conducive to learning. There is no point in us being polite about this. There are many families who are not fulfilling their roles as guardians of their children in encouraging them to stay on in school to further their education. The rights of the child are one aspect of the matter, but the responsibilities of parents must be seriously examined. Statistically, it is proven that the problems of early school leaving and truancy will lead probably to long-term unemployment at a later stage and, by extension, could lead to criminal activity. If we are serious about tackling these problems, we must accept that parents have rights and responsibilities and, if they are not fulfilling their responsibilities in regard to their children, it is up to educational officers to ensure those parents who are irresponsible are dealt with in the appropriate manner.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1186" /> Because of unemployment, adult illiteracy and the fact that society has failed in certain areas to tackle this problem in time, there are homes where, through no fault of the parents, children are leaving school early and indulging in truancy. Nor is it the fault of parents that children leave school early and partake in truancy. We face a dilemma in dealing with this problem. If we are serious about tackling it proper use must be made of the home-school liaison officer, a beneficial person on the ground who can investigate problems and decide on the responsibility, or otherwise, of parents. If they are not being responsible is it because they have experienced the same problems as their children with regard to literacy, unemployment, low self-esteem, lack of availability of part-time work and social services? If so, we must address them in a broader context and we must also have a statistical data base to assist in this regard.</P>
    <P>Teachers will often say they can spot at a very early age if a child has a difficulty, is slipping towards truancy and crime or is being neglected by their guardians. However, the resources are sometimes not available to enable them address these problems. We must ensure that if a child is spotted at an early age the services of the home-school liaison officer and remedial teachers are used. This includes the compilation of psychological assessments. There are not enough of them on the ground, although huge strides have been made in this regard. The present time of plenty presents a golden opportunity to tackle this serious social problem and only the State can tackle it by providing the necessary resources.</P>
    <P>We must look at how students are adjudicated. This is a difficult area. How are classes to be assessed and how are we to ascertain if there are children with difficulties, including the inability to stay in mainstream education? We must devise some kind of assessment within the classroom to pinpoint at an early stage children with difficulties, whether they be problems with literacy, social or psychological problems or problems at home.</P>
    <P>Many single mothers face great difficulties because of early or unplanned pregnancies and they are not provided with the necessary supports. Social welfare payments only enable them to live hand to mouth. In the area I represent this problem is on a big and growing scale. Many such girls probably come from a background of educational disadvantage. They find themselves pregnant at an early age and are unable to cope with their responsibilities as a parent. We must acknowledge that it is not good enough merely to provide them with social welfare payments without providing proper back-up services to enable them continue their education with the minimum of difficulty if that is their wish. This may entail the provision of extra resources from the State.</P>
    <P>Expulsion from school for behaviour unbecoming is a problem that is growing at an alarming rate. I recently encountered a serious case where two students were expelled at the age of 13 years for drug dealing on their school premises. It was <Col N="1187" /> a big problem to return them to formal education because of their track record. I do not blame schools for refusing to enrol pupils of this kind, but the State surely has a constitutional obligation to provide them with proper educational facilities, not 15 or 20 miles from where they live but within their community, to see if they can be rehabilitated and kept away from a life of crime. Whatever the statistics say I know as a public representative that children who are expelled from school at an early age and cannot find any other formal education will almost certainly end up in a life of crime. It is possible they have come from an area of social disadvantage, but that is not always the case. This problem must be addressed urgently.</P>
    <P>Speaking to teachers it is clear that their hearts go out to the parents of these children. They point out they must protect their school and the other pupils. For a long time the State has refused to meet its obligations in this area and in consequence these children are often left on the social scrap heap and end up back in the State's care, but unfortunately in Mountjoy Prison or at Rathmore Road in Cork. This area must also be looked at seriously.</P>
    <P>We must go beyond the statistical data. If an area or a school shows up problems of truancy we must be able to pinpoint it quickly, analyse the problems and immediately direct the necessary resources. A school which is functioning well without major problems of truancy or otherwise can, in a very short space of time, change for the worse in response to changes in the community it serves. The benefits of the Celtic tiger have not yet been reflected at all levels in society. In view of this an early warning system must be put in place to enable the specific targeting of resources.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that many of the children on the streets of our cities are being exploited. What have the authorities being doing to tackle the problem? People pass these children on the streets, throw them a few pennies and move on. I know the Minister, the Department and others share my concern. Legislation has been enacted to address this problem, yet neither the children nor their parents have been dealt with, nor has the problem been investigated properly. That is beyond me. We are failing seriously in our duties here. I hope this legislation, with the appropriate resources to back it up, will make a positive contribution to this problem.</P>
    <P>Schools are often looked on as buildings which provide education for children. However, they should become the focal point of communities, especially in urban areas where there is social disadvantage. They should be open from morning until evening and through the summer and winter holidays. Parents with difficulties should be allowed use them to attend adult literacy classes and computer courses. They should be made a focal point of learning, including helping parents returning to the education system with the development of their skills and abilities. Such par<Col N="1188" /> ents, who probably have children with similar problems, could attend the same school and identify with it. They could use the library facilities and help each other. This is something to which we must give serious consideration. There are huge resources in communities which very often are not being used. Adult literacy courses are being held throughout the city. I cannot understand why these cannot be held in the local schools. In areas of social disadvantage people are crying out for help and if these schools were made available and their doors opened up to society in general, they would be availed of. Most schools have computers and there is no reason computer courses cannot be held in the evenings during the summer. The Minister recently made grants available whereby schools can purchase books and make library facilities available. This is all very positive but there is a greater body of people out there who would avail of and benefit from these facilities.</P>
    <P>I compliment all those involved in bringing forward this legislation. I also compliment the Minister who has a deep insight and knowledge of this issue. I do not wish to sound parochial coming from Cork, but the Minister has the knowledge. He has professional expertise from his teaching days and is genuinely committed to addressing the issues. However, social disadvantage will be with us as long as we deprive people of the right to a reasonable education. Those who fall behind will never be able to afford grinds like those who have already achieved a high level of education. If we are serious, these issues must be addressed immediately and the resources to back up this progressive and positive legislation must be put in place. The rights of parents is one side of the coin but the responsibility of parents is the other. We must ensure that parents live up to their responsibility to protect their children and ensure that they receive a proper education.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister in his speech spoke about the difficulties teachers might have in co-operating with <Col N="1189" /> the school attendance officer or the welfare officer. I do not understand what difficulties there might be if roll books are maintained. It would take just a quick glance to determine who is missing.</P>
    <P>Deputy Richard Bruton made a valid point when he said, &ldquo;It is a dangerous precedent to create a legislative structure where school attendance issues are different from school development issues. It runs the risk of perpetuating the marginalisation of people who are being served by this agency. It sends the message to schools that to deal with poor attenders requires a separate strategy, that it is not the mainstream concern of the school.&rdquo; I agree with that statement. It would be dangerous to hand over truancy matters to some big board. Part of the school's responsibility should be to deal with pupils and the difficulties they face. Some schools have become too large. Schools with 1,000 pupils have lost the concept of what school should be about, that is, communication and a connection between teachers, pupils and parents. If schools do not communicate with parents they are whistling against the wind, so to speak. It is only where there is co-operation between teachers and parents that the schools function properly. I would not like someone to say in ten year's time that a board is appointed to schools to take responsibility for absenteeism or that the chief executive officer should be responsible for the problem. That would not be advisable.</P>
    <P>Teachers should know what is happening in homes. It is important to know what is going on in the home and the reason pupils are not anxious to attend school in this day and age when school has changed so much for the better. Is it because of fear in the schoolyard, fear of teachers if the pupil has difficulty learning, or is it that parents have their own difficulties and are not available to help their children? One cannot replace a school and staff with an interest in the pupils.</P>
    <P>There has been a great deal of talk about class sizes. This is a major problem. The smaller the class the more weaker children can be helped. However, there has never been a debate on the size of schools. Some schools have become too large. Secondary schools with more than 500 pupils are becoming like sausage factories. While staff may be appointed to look after different class years and so on and do a great job, I think they lose touch. Rural schools, particularly primary schools, have the advantage of smaller groups and smaller numbers. The staff know exactly what is happening in their area.</P>
    <P>The National Educational Welfare Board with responsibility for monitoring truancy will employ educational welfare officers. I could not find a definition as to what qualifications they will require. I remind the Minister that, unlike traffic wardens, I would not like these educational welfare officers to have a clamping mentality where they would go out to clamp either the missing child or the parent without being able to deal in a kind way with these people. Kindness should <Col N="1190" /> be one of the qualifications required in order to discuss and solve the problem. There is no point talking about bringing someone before the courts, fining them £500 or sentencing them to a month in jail. That will just add to the difficulties that already exist. That should be an option only when the person defies all the options put to them. We must understand that there is a reason why someone does not attend school. Under the provisions in the Bill, funds will be provided but we do not know what anything will cost. The number of staff on the board will be &ldquo;as it may from time to time determine themselves&rdquo;. There is no limit to the number of staff appointed. Will the cost of the board exceed that of appointing extra advisers or psychologists to deal with the problems that may arise throughout the country? Are we setting up a type of police force to deal with problems which, if prevented, might cost less money?</P>
    <P>A section in the Bill talks about rewarding pupils with good school attendance. I know the carrot and stick is important but there is always the danger that in rewarding someone who has a very good school attendance, one might be wronging someone who does not have as good a school attendance. This might be due to factors outside of his or her control such as bad health or lack of transport. While I would accept that it is important to use people's good attendance as an example, I would not like to go overboard by giving awards and national certificates. It is a different matter altogether when somebody has gone through primary school for all these years without any days being missed. One would want to be careful, however, because sometimes children attend school under very adverse conditions, in terms of their home life and other matters, and they should be encouraged. Since I left teaching I regularly repeat the fact that teachers do not encourage students enough. I never had less than 36 pupils in a class and I often had 40 in sixth class. A teacher is trying to get material across and wants to improve all the children to make sure they can hold their place in second level education. The teacher does not have time to encourage pupils and is inclined to criticise what is wrong. It is part and parcel of the job and I do not blame teachers for doing so, but if they were under less stress they might have more time to sit down with children to encourage and praise them. Mol an óige is still true and is very important.</P>
    <P>Deputy Michael Higgins referred to the term &ldquo;truancy&rdquo; which is being used instead of absenteeism. I also share a dread of that word because long ago an inspector, having heard me recite &ldquo;and every truant knew&rdquo; from &ldquo;The Deserted Village&rdquo;, asked me what a truant was. The teacher never thought it was worth his while to tell me what a truant was and I did not have a clue. Therefore, that word has always stayed in my mind. In fairness to Goldsmith, however, if he had used a simple term like a mitcher, or something else, I would have known it, but he was too clever by half, obviously.</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny)</i>
        <b>:</b> I suppose so. The legislation includes penalties for parents who do not send children to school. Today, I discovered a situation in Carlow, the details of which I have given to the Minister. It concerns a child who started his first year in second level education in Carlow and then transferred to another county for serious family reasons. He came back to Carlow having completed a year in Kilrush, County Clare, but cannot get back into the school in which he started his secondary education. In fact, he cannot get into any school in Carlow. His father, who is doing his best to get him in, contacted me. This Bill will clobber parents who will not send their children to school, yet this case involves an under age child who should be in school and cannot get in. The principal has explained to me that the second year classes are at their maximum capacity of 30. That figure is important I suppose, although many primary schools would be laughing if they could finish up with 30 in a class. They have their own reasons for it and I do not wish to criticise that, but it has come to the stage where a child has the right to an education yet cannot get it. We must have a better system. I know the Minister will deal with it and I hope he will come up with a suitable solution. I can see the difficulty the principal is in; the teachers' unions have agreed a certain number of pupils and all the classes seem to have reached that number. However, this is a child who deserves education and cannot get into school.</P>
      <P>We need extra teaching staff in schools and there are appointments available all over the country. It reminds me of when, in 1957, I looked up the advertisements in the newspaper for teachers. At that time there used to be four columns of teachings jobs and one had to decide which school to honour by applying for a post. Later, for many years there were no jobs. When my daughter was trained back in the 1980s, many of her classmates went to England because there were no jobs here, and they never came back. Maybe that is why we have a scarcity of teachers now because so many disappeared then. Nowadays jobs are available and one sees three or four columns of newspaper advertisements for teachers, yet we do not have them. One can make appointments and offer all kinds of resources teachers, but if there is no one there it will not do. Schools should be careful of because it would never do if some of the graduates who will be coming out after Christmas, with no teaching experience, are appointed to these jobs. Teachers with experience are required to help either as remedial or resource staff and the people who are teaching need experienced teachers to help in such specific areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One cannot have high enough standards when it comes to providing teachers. Now that I have <Col N="1192" /> left the teaching profession, I realise more and more the influence teachers have for good or evil, in a classroom on any given day. The good teacher is taken for granted, while the bad teacher is able to get away with it probably because it is the one profession from which it is very hard to be fired, unless one is on one's own and it is obvious that one is the guilty person. If one is in with a group of teachers, however, the people before and after can cover.</P>
    <P>The art of teaching is something I would like to mention. When my obituary is written, the people who write the great articles in the Sunday papers will only find time, if they do, to say &ldquo;A former Fine Gael Deputy died at last&rdquo;. That is probably all they will be able to put down. However, maybe Senator O'Toole would remind his colleagues in <i>Tuarascáil</i> that I stood up for the art of teaching. Qualifications are often seen as a <i>sine qua non</i>, but some people with qualifications could not teach diamonds. I wonder if Einstein could have got across one piece of information to a normal child? After a certain number of years teachers should sit down and listen to bad lecturers because some people with high qualifications cannot teach. The art of teaching should be drummed into student teachers.</P>
    <P>I attended teacher training college and, later on, I sat the H.Dip for secondary education, but had I depended on the H.Dip to teach me the art of teaching I would have achieved nothing. The skills of teaching are very important, yet they are often taken for granted. Some people who are awarded a degree in history and economics think they are able to lecture in those subjects. Lecturing is fine if one has university students with the savvy to do their own research, but at first and second level &ndash; and particularly second level because there is a major change in the system &ndash; it is important that teachers can teach.</P>
    <P>I have slight worries about the idea of people being so skilled in teaching at home. I do not wish to offend them but it is very difficult to educate children at home and give them a broad education that will stand to them in this day and age. I hope that everything goes well for those who are receiving their education at home but discipline is a serious problem. There should be a group to look after those who cannot fit into the normal stream of teaching. A disruptive pupil is a nuisance in a class, while at the same time such a pupil needs to be given an opportunity to learn. It is hard to balance the one against the other. There are many more issues I would like to discuss but I realise that my colleague has much to say in a short space of time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>On previous occasions I have made the point that I believe the Department of Education and Science is one of the most excessively centralised Departments of the 15 Departments. While the principles behind the Bill are worthy in themselves, I fear that we may be in danger of adding a layer of bureaucracy to an already creaking system, one that sees every educational <Col N="1193" /> establishment &ndash; primary, secondary and tertiary level, with the exception of the VEC sector &ndash; on a constant merry-go-round or treadmill, dealing with the Department at a centralised level. That is the case whether it concerns the repair of a pane of glass or a roof slate, through to the appointment of teaching staff, including remedial or resource teachers, and school building extensions. All of these matters could be dealt with more effectively by a regional administrative structure.</P>
      <P>While the objectives behind the Bill are to ensure that the maximum number of students attend educational institutions at primary, secondary and tertiary level for the maximum possible period, perhaps some of the structures could be better administered at regional and local level through the established VEC offices, rather than adding another layer of centralised bureaucracy to what is an already overloaded system.</P>
      <P>The Minister attended the debate earlier, as did his colleague the Minister of State. I regret, but understand, their inability to be in the House now because I wanted to raise a specific matter with both of them. In June I raised a matter on the Adjournment about the continuing educational disadvantage being perpetrated on Gaeltacht primary schools as opposed to their colleagues in gaelscoileanna. In a reply to me on 23 June, the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy O'Dea, indicated that &ldquo;He can expect some developments in this area because I am informed that the Minister will be making a general policy statement on this matter in the very near future&rdquo;. I am still awaiting that statement and I know that, with regard to the pupil-teacher ratio &ndash; the subject matter I raised &ndash; certain schools have since lost teachers. That matter was expected to be resolved before the commencement of the current academic year. I do not want to accuse the Minister of deliberately misleading the Dáil but unless an announcement is made shortly I can draw no other conclusion. I corresponded with the Minister on 1 September in respect of this matter and I ask him to make that announcement and address the anomaly to which I refer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note from the Minister of State's contribution that the purpose of the Bill is to provide a structure to encourage and promote school attendance up to leaving certificate level. No reference was made to third level but the point needs to be made. I have in my possession correspondence from the Minister for Education and Science, signed by Deputy Martin and dated 30 September. It refers to a student in my constituency who is confined to a wheelchair and attends a post-leaving certificate course and of whom the Department of Education and Science has washed its hands in respect of providing some form of transport to enable the child in question to attend post-primary education. I find the words spoken by the Minister and the Minister of State about improving access and attendance very hol<Col N="1194" /> low, given that the Minister put his name to a letter which states:</P>
    <P>While being sympathetic to the needs of [I will not name the pupil to which the letter refers] my Department have to consider the operation of the school transport scheme as a whole and a requirement not to breach guidelines.</P>
    <P>Guidelines are no use to that child if she cannot attend third level education and advance herself to a point where she can obtain employment.</P>
    <P>I regret that the time available is limited but I wanted to make those two brief points. I also wanted to make points about excessive centralisation and the appointment of resource teachers, secretarial staff and caretakers, who assist in the administration of the education system, but I will not impinge further on Deputy McGuinness's time. The words of the Minister and Minister of State ring hollow when I can instance examples in my constituency which make them so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness" hpid="Mr. J. McGuinness Mr. J. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and I compliment the Minister on the task he has undertaken in the Department of Education and Science since his appointment. A number of the issues he has taken on and resolved had been lingering in the Department for some time. I consider that the Bill before us deals with another of those outstanding problems.</P>
      <P>In his contribution to the Seanad the Minister stated that he would continue the process of consultation during the passage of the Bill and beyond. He also indicated that further consultations were already taking place. That is to be welcomed because there is no Bill that can deal with this complex problem in one fell swoop without the need for it to be revisited again and again. This issue will continue to change and there will be a constant need to introduce new legislation and take new action in order to ensure the success of the Bill before us.</P>
      <P>An audit of the success of the Bill and the points raised in it should form part of how we monitor legislation, particularly legislation of this nature because it can affect, in such a fundamental way, the well being of any child or family. Where the State is directly involved, as it is in education, it is absolutely essential that a Bill of this kind be policed and audited in respect of its success and changed accordingly and quickly, where necessary. In dealing with an issue of this sort, the solutions are not necessarily the normal conventional ones; they are not dictated or laid down by the Department. Some of the language used in the Bill in respect of truancy is the language of the past and it is a language which must change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because the problems are complex and the solutions many, all contributors on the Bill will have something to say about what they consider the solution to a specific problem that is outlined at various stages in the legislation. However, something different is happening in our communities, <Col N="1195" /> part of which is driven by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs which has set about funding family resource centres. Officials in that Department have set about empowering local communities to make decisions for themselves and the direction they will take in the future. That process of empowerment has led many of the participants to become involved in the area of education because the people involved at community level are mainly those who are marginalised, families who have, for one reason or another, found themselves on the edge of every activity, particularly education. The parents may have left school early and, as a result, the children may find it difficult to attend school or perhaps there is a leniency in the household which lets them off the hook in respect of a 100 per cent attendance or a good performance in mainstream education. However, these people have returned to the education system by way of the family resource centres and are participating again. They are assisting in the education not only of their children but of the general community.</P>
    <P>The process to which I refer has to be acknowledged because inherent in it is a true partnership between those responsible for providing the education structure &ndash; the Government and the State &ndash; the students and the parents who must make it happen. That partnership is proving to be a huge success for the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, and his Department in relation to other issues. I believe it can also prove to be a success in respect of the Department of Education and Science.</P>
    <P>Marginalised communities are not the only ones affected by poor education or large numbers of those dropping out of the education process. During my political career and in lobbying the different Departments since my election to the Dáil, I have heard how well off is my constituency. I am informed that the economy in my area is growing and that there is a certain wealth and affluence there. However, in a report entitled &ldquo;Hear My Voice&rdquo;, written by Scott Bolt in 1997, there is an interesting statistic which to this day is quite true. It refers to the percentage of early school leavers in a study sample taken nationally. The results were as follows: inner city Dublin, 41 per cent; Kilkenny came second in the national league at 27 per cent; Dublin north, 14 per cent; Dundalk, 12 per cent and Edenderry, 6 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>We will not revisit that now; it was a temporary setback. I find it astonishing that in a county such as Kilkenny, with its agricultural background, industry base, etc., 27 <Col N="1196" /> per cent of students are leaving school or dropping out early.</P>
      <P>I want to refer briefly to two studies which have been undertaken. We all bring to this debate our experiences from our own constituencies. Some people do not like referring back to their own constituency, or to the parish pump, but we all learn from our own ways in life and we can make an input at national level that may be important to this Bill in particular and to the policy on education. A study was carried out in 1997 and presented recently to the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Ahern, on his recent visit to the city. It relates to the Loughboy area of the city where 45 per cent of the population of Kilkenny live. The study has identified early school leaving as a major problem. The percentage drop-out in four schools was 11 per cent, and of that 11 per cent, 18 per cent were from this particular area of Kilkenny city. That 1997 study made four points: first, early school leavers are more at risk of long-term unemployment, and ultimately poverty, than those who remain on at school; second, early school leavers who have difficulty with literacy and numeracy or who exhibit low self-esteem tend to be much less likely to obtain employment; third, male early school leavers are more successful at obtaining employment; and, fourth, early school leavers who are unemployed and not involved in a training programme are more likely to be involved in crime or the use of illegal drugs.</P>
      <P>When a local community like Loughboy in Kilkenny city carries out a local needs analysis, identifies many problems and underlines the problem of early school leavers, it is incumbent on all Departments, not just the Department of Education and Science, to ensure that all the agencies begin to work in partnership with organisations like LARK in Kilkenny. I ask the Minister to examine that model, where a local community identified a need and asked the various Departments of State to come in because they realise, with the growth in house building over the next ten years, their problems will intensify and that the structures currently in place will begin to crumble, which will affect the very fabric of society in that area. We must be proactive in our approach to this problem, otherwise we will fail miserably in the coming ten to 20 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another successful model which I asked the Minister to examine &ndash; again it is in Kilkenny city &ndash; is the Father McGrath Centre which I understand he will visit shortly. That centre is located in an area where there was a high level of unemployment. The local communities came together and are now working in that complex which was declared a derelict building by the local authority. The local community refused to take &ldquo;no&rdquo; for an answer. They now have a major resource centre and are attracting parents from five marginalised communities to re-educate them so that in turn they can help with the homework studies of their children when they return home from school. In addition, they are working with 25 children on <Col N="1197" /> a one to one basis to improve their prospects in mainstream education. They have achieved this largely by voluntary contributions from retired nuns and other volunteers with little or no educational qualifications but who realise the importance of education and by FÁS workers.</P>
    <P>These volunteers help out in the afternoons and late into the evenings and with funding from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and some from the Department of Education and Science they have put together a package that is assisting in a positive way the young people of those marginalised communities. They have set themselves a target that by the year 2000 most, if not all, of the community will have an e-mail address &ndash; this is an unemployment blackspot in the city &ndash; the children of the estate, if not the parents, will be information technology literate and they will contribute in a positive way to expanding that model to other marginalised communities in Kilkenny city. They intend to run a programme called From Three to University because with the help of NUI Maynooth, a third level outreach facility has been established.</P>
    <P>I make these comments so that the Minister can note that this model is not so much driven by the Department of Education and Science but by the want in a local community to be educated and to participate fully in the advantages of the economy by way of education and acknowledging the value of education, even by those who have gone through the system and are not fully educated, for their young children. That is a significant development and it is one that is poorly acknowledged by every Department. The Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs is leading the way in this regard and I ask the Minister to acknowledge those models &ndash; I have just mentioned a few in my constituency, I am sure there are others in other counties &ndash; as being worthy of funds and to have an all-inclusive educational community. In doing that we will break the cycle that has plagued the marginalised for many years. Funding is the only tangible acknowledgement that can be put in place by the different Departments. They should examine the model on the ground, ensure it is transparent and provide the necessary funds to ensure that model continues to serve what will be a greater community in numbers. Given this debate, it is obvious that throughout the country a building programme is ongoing, regardless of what is being said, and it will definitely impact in a negative way on some of these marginalised communities and on the structures and agencies of the State if we do not take a proactive role in improving it.</P>
    <P>I want to give a statistic from the recently published needs analysis of Callan, a small town in Kilkenny. In response to the question, do you think it would be helpful to have classes for parents to make it easier for them to help children with their homework, 38 per cent of those surveyed said &ldquo;yes&rdquo;. I see this in my own home where one would almost need classes to ensure that one's children do not fall behind in school <Col N="1198" /> because of the advances taking place in an education system that is driven by technology. There is enormous demand but there is an answer also for the Minister. As is happening in many other Departments, we should adopt a truly partnership approach to this problem.</P>
    <P>I would like to see the many people involved in LARK, which is not funded properly by the various Departments, the Father McGrath Centre and the other centres that are cropping up in our cities and towns funded to a point where they can audit their own success and be encouraged by that success to move forward. If that happens the Minister will be faced shortly with the problem of dealing with university outreach centres because a natural progression is that the people who will educate themselves by way of the self-help ethos in these communities will want to further their education and will encourage their parents, brothers and sisters who have lost education to return to it. The natural progression is that they would want to access some form of outreach facility provided by a recognised university in their city or town. I commend NUI Maynooth on their activities in partnership with the local community in Kilkenny and St. Kieran's College. That is a success story and a community based model of partnership. The organisers did not ask for money and did not come to Dublin with a begging bowl but raised money locally through the local authority and commercial interests and made this happen in St. Kieran's College. If the Minister reached out to that partnership and offered it the same assistance, even if he ringfenced it and decided to take it as a pilot project, it would be worth considering.</P>
    <P>The benefit to those who have taken up courses there can be seen. The proof is in the people who have been given certificates and who have succeeded in the different courses. At the end of those courses they have lent their new found knowledge not just to commercial use but to community use. I know many who have taken those courses have come back to serve their local communities and one went on to become a county councillor. A travelling man from Wexford with little education went through a similar model in Wexford and worked through to the point where he was being considered by Wexford County Council as a full-time employee. He had no background in education but was simply encouraged by those who felt he had something to offer. He was rewarded by a full-time course that led to full-time employment. He said publicly that he was delighted such a model existed and was driven by the local community and that it delivered a sense of place and purpose to him. If we do nothing with these models but give our children aspiration we will show them there is a place, that they can aspire to be something else and to participate fully in their own communities. It will take the Minister and the Government to <Col N="1199" /> acknowledge what is happening and to work in partnership with communities. I commend the Bill as a first step and I ask the Minister to acknowledge what is going on.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge what Deputy Michael D. Higgins said about creativity. That is an essential part of this area.</P>

Ach beidh roinnt mhaith den mhaitheas atá i gceist ann ag brath ar na hachmhainní, mar is gnáth, a bheidh ar fáil ón Státchiste. Ba mhaith liom tagairt a dhéanamh do roinnt mhaith de na fadhbanna a bhaineann leis an mBille chomh maith, cé go bhfuil an-chuid maitheasa ann.</P>
      <P>Tá cuid den Bhille mí-Bhunreachtúil agus ba cheart é sin a athrú sula mbeidh sé ina Acht. Beimid ag obair chuige sin, le cúnamh Dé, ar gach taobh den Tigh. Tá trí phointe a sheasann amach gur gá leasuithe a dhéanamh ar an mBille fúthu.</P>
      <P>Ar dtús báire, tá ceist sa Bhille a árdaitear de bharr tagairt don bhunchaighdeán oideachais agus an cheist atá ann ná cad is bunchaighdeán oideachais agus cad é an sainmhíniú atá ann faoi sin. Níl aon sainmhíniú sa Bhille agus is dócha go bhfuilimid ag brath ar na cigirí nó ar an Roinn ó am go chéile é sin a chur i gcrích. Ach, níos tábhachtaí ná sin, fiú, an féidir leis an Aire nó leis an Rialtas caighdeán bunoideachais a chur i bhfeidhm ó thaobh na Bunreachta de, de bharr go bhfuil chéad áit tugtha don tuismitheoir mar mhúinteoir don leanbh? Níl fhios agamsa an feidir, ó thaobh na Bunreachta de, é sin a chur i gcrích dá bharr.</P>
      <P>Ar an dara dul síos, tá ceist achmhainní airgeadais, mar a luaigh mé ar dtús. Cé mhéid airgid a bheidh ar fáil chun an &ldquo;truancy&rdquo; a sheachaint agus tacaíocht a thabhairt do na scoileanna agus do na teaghlaigh atá ag fulaingt agus do na leanaí atá istigh ann, dar ndoigh?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ní dóigh liomsa, agus ní féidir liom é a thuiscint, cén fáth a bhfuil sé sa Bhille go mbeidh cead ag an Stát teacht isteach i dtithe daoine eile chun féachaint cá bhfuil na leanaí agus cén cineál oideachais atá ar fáil sa teach, mar shampla? Tá an cheist seo ag cur isteach ar a lán daoine, roinnt mhaith daoine a bhí ag caint le Teachtaí eile. Chuala mé an Teachta Michael Kitt ag déanamh tagairt do na daoine atá ag tabhairt oideachais dá leanaí sa bhaile, agus roinnt Teachtaí eile sa bhFreasúra chomh maith. Faoi láthair, chomh fada agus is eol dom, tá an cheist seo os chomhair cúirte cheana féin. Tá sé ráite ag an mbreitheamh a bhí ag éisteacht leis an gcás go bhfuil sé ró-luath a rá an bhfuil sé seo le dul os comhair cúirte i ndáiríre mar níl sé ina Acht fós. Mar sin, tá na cúirteanna ag féachaint ar an diospóireacht seo agus fanfaidh siad go dtí go mbeidh obair na Dála <Col N="1200" /> curtha i gcrích ach níor mhaith liomsa a bheith os comhair cúirte mar Bhall den Dáil de bharr go bhfuil mé tar eis rud éigin mí-Bhunreachtúil a dhéanamh. Le cúnamh Dé beidh leasú ar an Acht chun go mbeidh sé Bunreachtúil.</P>
    <P>Tá roinnt mhaith litreacha faighte agamsa faoin mBille seo agus ag daoine eile, is dócha. Is mian liom ceann amháin a léamh chun a léiriú cad tá i gceist ag daoine. Níor tháining an litir seo ón dáilcheantar agamsa, dála an scéal. Deireann sé:</P>
    <P>With regard to the draft Education (Welfare) Bill, 1999, in circulation in the Dail, we, as the parents of Rory [sa chas seo] recently have had to endure 16 court appearances before our constitutional rights as the primary educator of our child were recognised. We would like to make the following points in relation to any attempt to assess children or parents and label them.</P>
    <P>Any parents we have spoken to who have had their children assessed, it has been a disadvantage to them as parents and their children in any court case, as the assessment had been carried out in a one-sided manner. The only one the assessment will benefit is someone who wants to control other people's children and label them to cover up failures in the school system. This Bill being prepared is an attempt to get away from the real problems which are in the school system. Having a Bill set up to deal with child abuse would be more worthwhile. Don't let the Governemnt waste time on parents who care for their children and home educate them.</P>
    <P>We trust you will put our points forward and give parents and children a voice.</P>
    <P>Sin tuairim amháin, agus, dar ndóigh, tá an duine seo an-chrosta faoi cad a tharla dóibh siúd, an duine a scríobh an litir sin, an tuismitheoir. Ceist atá agamsa ná an féidir leis an Aire a thuiscint go bhfuil daoine sa tír seo ina gcónaí i bhfad ó scoileanna, agus is ceart a aithint go mbeidh oideachas níos fearr ag na daltaí sin más féidir leis na tuismitheoirí cabhrú leo sa bhaile. Bheadh níos mó ama i mbun foghlaime ag na leanaí sin dá bharr. Tá fhios againn go bhfuil fadhb ag na busanna scoile ó thaobh spáis de agus bheadh níos mó spás ar na busanna scoile dá mbeadh leanaí ag fáil oideachais sa bhaile. Tá ganntanas múinteoirí cáilithe ann faoi láthair agus is cabhair é má tá tuismitheoirí sásta cabhrú leis na leanaí atá acu féin. Tá sé do-chreidte go bhfuil Gárda Síochána in ann an dlí a chur ar thuismitheoirí agus iad a thógaint os comhair cúirte gan cigire a fháil ón Roinn Oideachais agus Eolaíochta agus ligint don bhreitheamh a rá an gá cigire a fháil. Cheana féin tá an duine seo sa chúirt i measc daoine atá tar éis rudaí a ghoid agus rudaí eile a dhéanamh. Níl an tuismitheoir mar an gcéanna leis na daoine eile sin. Tá seisean ag déanamh a dhícheall dá leanbh <Col N="1201" /> agus tá sé anois os comhair cúirte dá bharr. Ní féidir glacadh leis sin.</P>
    <P>Tá difríocht sa Bhunreacht idir an Béarla agus an Ghaeilge. Sa Bhéarla deirtear &ldquo;The State acknowledges that the primary and natural educator of the child is the Family and guarantees to respect the inalienable right and duty&rdquo; agus mar sin de. Sa Ghaeilge: &ldquo;Admhaíonn an Stát gurb é an Teaghlach is múinteoir príomha dúchasach don leanbh.&rdquo;  Mar sin, tá &ldquo;múinteoir&rdquo;, &ldquo;teacher&rdquo; sa Ghaeilge ach tá &ldquo;natural educator&rdquo; sa Bhéarla. Tá rogha mar sin ag tuismitheoiirí agus ba cheart dúinn é sin a aithint &ndash; sé sin oideachas a thabhairt do leanbh sa bhaile.</P>
    <P>I Meiriceá bhí an &ldquo;National Home Education Week&rdquo; ag tús mhí Meán Fomhair. Ní féidir liom an fógra go léir a léamh mar níl an t-am agam, ach deir sé:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Whereas dozens of of contemporary studies continue to confirm that children who are educated at home score exceptionally well on nationally normed achievement tests.&rdquo; agus mar sin de.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Now, therefore, be it resolved that the week begining on September 19, 1999, and ending on September 25, 1999, is designated as National Home Education Week. The President is authorised and requested to issue a proclamation recognising the contribution that home schooling families have made to the Nation&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Ní ceart go mbeadh tuismitheoirí atá ag déanamh a ndícheall dá leanaí sa bhaile sa Bhille seo.  Seo Bille atá ag iarraidh an dlí a chur ar dhaoine agus atá ag iarraidh daoine atá ag fulaingt a thabhairt isteach sa chóras agus mar sin de. Níl na daoine seo ag fulaingt. Tá siad go breá sásta oideachas a thabhairt de réir mar atá ceart acu sa Bhunreacht ach de réir an Bhille seo caithfidh siad clárú chun sin a dhéanamh. Tá sé sin míbhunreachtúil.</P>
    <P>Tá sé ráite sa Bhille gur féidir le cigire nó &ldquo;the board may, with the consent of the parent and child, arrange for a child to be examined as to his intellectual, emotional and physical development&rdquo;. An bhfuil an bord cáilithe chun mothúchán agus sláinte fisiciúil agus eile a mheas? Bheadh siad in ann cúrsaí intleachtúla agus mar sin de a mheas, ach b'fhéidir go bhfuil sin ag dul thar fóir.</P>
    <P>I gCuid a Trí tá caint mar gheall ar a register. B'fhéidir gur féidir rogha a thabhairt do thuismitheoir a bheith ar an gclár ach ní dóigh liom gur féidir brú nó iachall a chur air a bheith ann. Arís, is ceist bhunreachtúil í sin, chomh maith. Freisin i gCuid a Trí den Bhille tá cearta linbh i scoileanna aitheanta i gceist. Cad faoi na scoileanna nach bhfuil aitheantas acu, roinnt mhaith de na gaelscoileanna agus eile? Ba cheart dúinn a bheith níos cuimsitheach chun na scoileanna eile a aithint, nach bhfuil aitheantas acu go fóill. Tá sin tábhachtach.</P>
    <P>Dúirt an tAire Stáit, an Teachta O'Dea, nuair a chuir sé an Bille ós ár gcomhair: &ldquo;The establishment of the National Education Welfare Board will be a significant support to schools in the <Col N="1202" /> future.&rdquo; D'fhág sé ar lár na daoine atá ag tabhairt oideachais sa bhaile. Tá súil agam gur timpist a bhí ansin agus nárbh d'aonghnó a rinne sé é, mar níl sé ag tabhairt aitheantas cuí do na daoine sa bhaile atá ag déanamh a ndícheall chomh maith.</P>
    <P>Dúirt sé freisin: &ldquo;There is a strong relationship between the time pupils spend in the education system and the ability to partake in the economy&rdquo;. Is radharc an-chúng é sin ar chúrsaí oideachais. Labharamar mar gheall ar chúrsaí cruthaíochta agus creativity agus ní dóigh liom go bhfuil sé sin mar chuid den aisling ag an Aire anseo. It is quantity, not quality, mar a deirtear, atá i gceist aige agus ba cheart go mbeadh sé níos feárr.</P>
    <P>Dúirt sé freisin: &ldquo;The National Education Welfare Board is to be small and expert&rdquo;. An mbeidh ionadaíocht ar an mbord seo ag an home school network agus ag daoine atá ag plé le scolaíocht taobh amuigh de scoileanna?</P>
    <P>Dúirt an t-urlabhraí ó Fhine Gael, an Teachta Richard Bruton &ldquo;One in six pupils leaves school early and illiterate&rdquo;. Is chun leas na ndaoine is boichte atá ar scoil dul chun cinn an córas oideachais sa bhaile. Fágann sé sin níos mó acmhainní ag na daoine is boichte má thugaimid tacaíocht do na daoine atá ag fáil oideachais sa bhaile. Ní ceart oideachas sa bhaile a bheith sa Bhille seo. Ba cheart go mbeadh sé i mBille Oideachais ann féin chun é a chur chun cinn, chun tacaíocht a thabhairt dó agus chun a thaispeáint gur féidir, ó thaobh na Bunreachta de agus go praiticiúil, oideachas a thabhairt do leanaí ar scoil nó sa bhaile.</P>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute on this Bill. When the Minister launched it yesterday I thought it was aspirational and many items he mentioned were impractical in the context of what is happening today. It is a pity that he has lost this golden opportunity to provide a workable Bill. Unless it is radically modified it will gather dust like so many other measures and the practicalities which are intended will never be implemented. It introduces a further layer of bureaucracy on schools which are already overtaxed by the need for registering and reporting, both within schools, because of the necessity for change in the education system, and to outside bodies. We see again a provision for a local board to report to a centralised Government agency, but the report will gather dust and will never be implemented. Further, there is no indication of what finance the Minister will make available, and therein lies a huge problem.</P>
      <P>In today's newspapers we read that a section of the teaching fraternity, the ASTI, is pleading with the Minister to reduce class sizes so they can deliver good education to the pupils in their care. This is not just for selfish personal reasons but because they realise that in current conditions they cannot deliver the standard of education necessary for students to advance their lives. There is great pressure on the teaching fraternity to do that. We are adding further bureaucracy to an already overloaded system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1203" /> Prior to 1968 most people left school at an early age. Since 1968 there has been little recognition of early school leavers. We should have made resources available to children with problems who were identified by various Departments and services. There was no financial assistance to deal with their inadequacies and the problems in society and the system. The result is that many of our prisons are filled with the very people who needed intervention at an early stage when resources were inadequate. I do not know if it is possible to survey those who are in prison but I think the results of a survey would clearly indicate that many of them are early school leavers.</P>
    <P>Having been a member of the County Galway Vocational Educational Committee for 20 years, I compliment vocational education committees who were the first to intervene in any way. Their initiatives include Youthreach and other back-to-school projects. It is a pity their influence has been diminished. Will the Minister investigate, as a matter of urgency, the education of traveller children? He spoke about an integrated education service for this group. This has not worked and will not unless there a greater effort to identify their culture as it is separate from the settled community. There should be early intervention and then they can be moved into the education system. I ask the Minister to respond to this great need because they are a most vulnerable and neglected section of the community. It is only through concerned people, such as sisters, brothers and priests in the past and now lay people, taking the initiative that travellers are being introduced to formal education.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from Deputy Ulick Burke, who threw cold water on it, the Bill has received a positive response. It is seen as innovative legislation which is welcome and a milestone in education. The concern shown by Deputy Burke may have some merit. However, surely one should at least acknowledge the Bill has potential. I accept the jigsaw is not quite complete but that is not uncommon when a Bill of this nature comes before the House. This Bill is well intentioned and has tremendous potential. I look forward to progress being made, especially as regards the two broad aims of the Bill which are the right to a minimum standard of education and the promotion and encouragement of school attendance up to the leaving certificate or its equivalent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The encouragement of young people to achieve a decent standard of education is vital. The evidence shows that standard of education is the great divide between opportunity and exclusion. Sadly, the most common feature of households living in poor circumstances is a lack of qualifications. The rapidly changing employment environment, with a great emphasis on skills and qualifications, provides more reasons for the Department and the Oireachtas to be proactive as regards desired standards. The tremendous success of our economy is solidly based on our <Col N="1204" /> highly educated and well-motivated young people, whom I congratulate. Our rising educational achievement has given Ireland the critical edge in supplying qualified people to knowledge-based industries. As Chairman of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Enterprise and Small Business, I and the members of the committee have undertaken to visit knowledge-based industries in Ireland. Our success in attracting multinational and other industries to Ireland is due to the fact that we have such highly educated and well-motivated people available for employment. Ireland faces a future where knowledge and adaptable skills will continue to become increasingly important. Our education system faces a great challenge in meeting labour market demands in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>I have tremendous admiration for the children of the 1980s and 1990s because of their enthusiastic approach, standard of education, life skills and results. I pay tribute to educational practitioners who help them achieve these standards and results. Regrettably, people slip through many State systems. However, those who slip through the education system create lifelong problems and complications for themselves. It is right that we concentrate our efforts on the needs of those most at risk of suffering educational disadvantage.</P>
    <P>Questions must be asked as to why over 10,000 teenagers leave the education system every year without any qualifications. This flow of unqualified school leavers to the labour force must be stopped. It is unacceptable that this number of teenagers leave full-time education without completing the senior cycle. Any measures we can put in place to encourage a higher proportion of young people to stay at school until they leave with a qualification are clearly desirable. There can be no valid excuse for a young person leaving school without appropriate qualifications and life skills. It is up to the Oireachtas, the Department of Education and Science, education practitioners, teachers, parents and pupils to work in partnership to properly harness the tremendous potential which exists among young people who, unfortunately, fail to complete the school cycle. It is in the best interests of society that young people complete the senior school cycle because of the otherwise inevitable consequences.</P>
    <P>I have one concern about the Bill. Will the Minister review and reconsider his definition of a child in Part I (2) of the Bill? Why are we attempting to make radical changes yet reverting to the old benchmarks of definition? Why is this definition based on age qualification? As a public representative, I have witnessed certain schools using unacceptable leverage on parents to take a troublesome pupil out of the education system. In most cases the pupil is usually past the compulsory school leaving age of 15 years. A number of Deputies made this point during the debate. It is difficult for schools to keep troublesome children, who do not want to be there, in the system. One can understand why a school may be anxious to <Col N="1205" /> accommodate a request by a troublesome pupil to leave, regardless of how that request was sought. However, we must strike the right balance, create the right environment and encourage pupils to remain in the system without turning our schools into prisons.</P>
    <P>As the second aim of the Bill is to promote and encourage school attendance up to leaving certificate standard or its equivalent, why can this not be redefined in the Bill? The Minister is attempting to ensure our education system is all-inclusive. I would, therefore, welcome it if the Minister deleted section 2(1)(a)(i) and (ii). I recognise the need to put in place appropriate structures. The earlier such structures and accommodation are in place the better. Many people are surprised at what young children can learn. The Minister of State said the well established programmes have the &ldquo;aim of retaining children and young people in the education system for sufficiently long to enable them to benefit to the maximum extent from the system&rdquo;. He also said the &ldquo;Bill provides a structure to encourage and promote school attendance, up to leaving certificate level or its equivalent&rdquo;. I have only seen age qualifications being used by certain schools, which is in contrast to such aims. Is it not a contradiction to include three years of post-primary education? Surely that is not in line with our desire to have a leaving certificate standard or equivalent? Why are we excluding people over 18 years of age if we wish to be inclusive?</P>
    <P>I welcome the establishment of the national educational welfare board to examine school attendance and the underlying causes of truancy. Early identification and intervention and an appropriate support framework will be of considerable benefit. While I acknowledge the likely benefits of such a board, I hold strong views on the interpretation in section 2, particularly if we want to reflect the principal aims of the Bill. Every year I deal with cases where schools boldly use the current compulsory school leaving age to put parents and guardians of pupils under pressure to take them out of the system or face the possible consequences of expulsion. Other Members have also come across this issue which warrants special attention.</P>
    <P>Section 2(1)(a) refers to &ldquo;whichever occurs later, but shall not include a person who has reached the age of 18 years&rdquo;. I am interested in the support structures for pupils with special needs and I have tabled a number of parliamentary questions in this regard. Recently, it was brought to my attention that a pupil who is a few months older than 18 years of age was denied a place in a special school to complete the senior cycle because of the 18 year rule. The special school needed appropriate funding from the Department to ensure accommodation for the pupil, otherwise he would not be included. That is why the age qualification should be removed, particularly in the area of special needs. The Central Remedial Clinic, which is in my constituency, was involved in this case. I take this opportunity <Col N="1206" /> to pay tribute to the clinic for the great work it does and the broad range of disabled pupils for whom it caters. There are many people with disabilities, some of whom must attend hospital regularly for operations. This has a great impact on their education and a lot of time and effort is needed to catch up on their studies. I ask the Minister to reconsider this age qualification.</P>
    <P>I recently attended a meeting at a secondary school where I was considering sending my son next year. A large crowd was there and the principal gave a good speech about school activities. However, I was offended by something he said, although I was in the minority. A question was asked about discipline. The principal explained that when he recently brought a group of 15 and 16 year old children to a rugby match, one of them was caught carrying an illegal drug so he was immediately asked to leave the school. Parents who were considering placing their children in the school were delighted to hear the type of discipline meted out by the school. However, what type of pressure was put on the parents or guardians of that pupil to take him out of the school? Many unfair cases have been brought to my attention in my constituency but as far as the vast majority of parents or guardians are concerned the matter is addressed when the bold boy leaves the school.</P>
    <P>I dealt with an interesting case recently where the son of a garda was used by an individual to take property out of the school because he was the person least likely to be questioned. He had just turned 15 years of age. His mother was called and advised that if she withdrew her son from the school's enrolment, he would not be expelled and she might be able to place him in a nearby school. They said they would see what they could do to help, but if her son was not withdrawn from the school's enrolment, he would be expelled and it would leave him and his parents in a very difficult position. I am sure the Minister and the Department are aware of abuses in this regard by certain schools which want to be seen as acting in the interests of the pupils, parents and guardians. Any benchmark of this nature contradicts the aims set out in the Bill regarding the minimum standard and the promotion and encouragement of attendance up to the leaving certificate or equivalent. I appreciate a definition may have to be included but I ask that it reflect the principle contained in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The last speaker mentioned a further layer of bureaucracy and cumbersome reporting procedures. I note with interest the following comments which were made during the debate on the Bill in the Upper House that up to now the system has been fragmented. The speaker said that there have been many case studies involving teachers, guidance counsellors, educational psychologists, school attendance officers, the local health board and JLOs, who were good and worthy people in their own right, each dealing with a particular problem at any given time, but in isolation. This resulted in duplication of pro<Col N="1207" /> grammes which never got off the ground. If the proposed system is to work, there needs to be an integrated plan and well researched plans in place. These comments were made by a practitioner in education. In terms of Deputy Ulick Burke's comments, I understand that the Bill will address what has been a fragmented system up to now for dealing with truancy and its fall out. Hopefully, the Bill will also deal with the issue of the welfare board, which will be a positive support structure.</P>
    <P>As the chairman of the Eastern Health Board, I am particularly concerned about the number of young homeless people who are sleeping rough on our streets. I mentioned earlier that people slip through the system and this problem involves a relatively small group. It would require very little effort to appropriately address their needs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate and I welcome the Bill. My party's spokesperson, Deputy Richard Bruton, gave the Bill five marks out of ten. Hopefully, improvements can be made during Committee and Report Stages because that is the role of the Legislature.</P>
      <P>The Bill is welcome and overdue. It deals with concerns of which we have been aware for some time. As other speakers said, we must recognise that the key to our success is our education system. One does not achieve overnight success through education; the system must be developed. It is recognised that there is a high number of marginalised people who do not have educational opportunities or who do not consider education an opportunity. This is one of the areas which must be examined, researched and addressed because it affects a section of society. Most Members would be considered as having middle class values about education but this group does not consider that the syllabus in schools is appropriate for them and they do not respond to it. We must examine why they do not respond to it or consider it as a way to improve their lifestyle or life opportunities.</P>
      <P>All Members are aware of areas in their cities and towns where less than 1 or 2 per cent of the population is likely to reach third level. However, it can be said of other groups that 70 to 80 per cent will aspire to and obtain some form of third level education. There is a gap in terms of why it is possible to predict at an early stage that certain groups of people, who are easily identifiable with regard to the area in which they live or their family background or structure, will not have the opportunity, or consider it an opportunity, to obtain a third level education. The school system must be examined to ensure that this issue is tackled as quickly as possible. I appreciate this would be a vast project but it is very necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will deal with issues relating to the travelling community later. As the Minister is aware, I represent Rathkeale on Limerick County Council. About 45 per cent of the population of Rathkeale <Col N="1208" /> is made up by the travelling community and there are excellent relationships between the travellers and the settled community. It has one of the lowest rates of crime in any town in County Limerick. I remember asking young travellers what they considered would be a proper education for them. They said that their education was getting a driver's licence because that was how they intended to make a living. This is not enough and we must examine ways to develop this area for people who do not consider education as a route to success in life. They should be given opportunities. This problem is illustrated by the fact that one in six leave school early. The education system is failing these people and we must examine why. The subjects being taught in schools are not of interest to them or their parents and we must ask what would interest them.</P>
    <P>I remember reading about and being impressed by an experiment which was carried out in Jobstown, Dublin, involving people who were identified as having a high level of truancy, prone to dropping out early from school and likely to get involved in crime. The Minister is probably aware of this experiment in which these people were taught a level of literacy and numeracy. They were also taught how to deal with horses, horse riding, sports, including soccer, and other activities which might create opportunities for them. The people involved could not wait to attend the course because they could relate to it. They saw themselves playing soccer professionally or working with horses or in other spheres. They could relate to these areas and saw life opportunities in them because they were interested in them. The current curriculum may not be acceptable because certain people do not respond when they are told what they should know and what route they should take under the current education system. This area must be examined.</P>
    <P>Resources must be invested in ensuring that children with attendance problems are taken care of and their difficulties dealt with. An attendance problem is more complex than simply missing school. It may relate to a family situation that does not encourage school attendance and the fact that the person does not see the curriculum and what they experience at school as relevant to their future. Many resources are needed to deal individually with each case to ensure that the best opportunity is given to children with attendance problems, to understand why they have that problem and the background to their difficulties and to see how the problem can be handled. It is a painstaking, individual approach but it is the only way to deal with it.</P>
    <P>I note from previous debates in the House that the Department does not have a national database on absence levels in schools. Why is that, given the ease of communications in this day and age? The data is available and needs only to be collected. We should know the absence levels in different regions and counties to analyse why it is happening. If one does not have the facts, how can one determine the extent of the problem and <Col N="1209" /> the solution to it? I remember reading some years ago that every day in Dublin one out of ten children is absent from school. There is no information on the up to date position unless the Minister has it. Perhaps he would give the House details of absence levels if such information is available.</P>
    <P>The Bill creates a special agency for dealing with absentees. I agree with some of the comments made in this regard. Is it intended to select absentees and to deal with them individually? Most agencies take on a life of their own and tend to deal with an issue in isolation from general developments. Is it wise to have an approach outside the mainstream of the school by having an agency deal specifically with this matter? I question the approach, although I have an open mind on the issue. Perhaps the Minister would elaborate on the reason this special agency, independent of other bodies, is to deal with truancy.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier the education of travellers. This issue must be examined carefully because it is obviously a problem. Again, it is a problem with the parents in that they do not recognise the importance of education, although there is increasing understanding of its importance. Taking the child's point of view, we must ensure that the children of the traveller community have the opportunity to be educated. It is not good enough to claim that the community has a different culture and that their culture does not permit, in certain cases because of their travelling, a basic education. It is a difficult issue. It is also unacceptable that travellers have a high mortality rate and that their life expectancy is less than that of the settled community.</P>
    <P>It should not be possible to tell a traveller child that, because he or she is a traveller, they will not have basic numeracy and literacy skills. I often admire the skills of the travellers in other areas, for example, antiques and their ability to recognise the value of antiques. Their skills are unbelievable in that regard. Traveller children, however, should not be deprived of basic skills because of their cultural background. The issue must be handled with care and the traveller community must be involved in dealing with it.</P>
    <P>A high number of traveller children attend school in Rathkeale. There are specific problems in Rathkeale that should be dealt with. The mainstream approach which works in other schools, for example, through remedial teaching and so forth, is not good enough to apply in a town such as Rathkeale which is unique because of the number of travellers there. We are trying to encourage the basic education of that community without changing its culture. Education can be accommodated without interfering with their culture and the community is beginning to recognise that. However, the school requires a different type of assistance and special attention. I plead with the Minister to have his Department examine this matter. Departments are inclined to paint everything with the same brush and what they apply in Newcastle West, Castleconnell or Kil<Col N="1210" /> mallock must also apply to Rathkeale. However, Rathkeale is different. There must be special consideration given to education in the traveller community there.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the appointment of education officers. Perhaps the Minister would elaborate on this. It is an important matter for early school leavers and in ensuring that there is follow up contact with them, whether that is through the development of Youthreach or through another intervention. This is an important issue.</P>
    <P>We have learned in the past two years that the level of suicide is higher among early school leavers than among those who remain at school. For a number of years we heard talk of the pressure of examinations and so forth at second level. That has proven not to be as severe a factor as was previously thought. There is no evidence that there is an increase in the incidence of suicide either when examinations are being taken or when their results are released. However, there is definite evidence that there is a higher level of suicide among people who leave school early. The issue is a great deal more complex than simply making that statement. Perhaps the reasons for leaving school early in the first place are also the reasons people get into such despair that they take their own lives. No research has been done in that regard. Nevertheless, research by the late Michael Kelleher in Cork shows that people who leave school early have a higher incidence of suicide than those who stay in school.</P>
    <P>I was working on a paper today for the conference to be held this weekend by the Irish Association of Suicidology. We must examine the difficulties being experienced by young people in school, in college and by those who have left school. The pace of change in our culture has never been faster. The life expectancy of most jobs in Ireland is five years. That puts special pressures on young people. Skills quickly become redundant and people are expected to be more adaptable than they would have been previously when jobs tended to be for life and there was a level of job security which is now almost totally absent. This can be seen as an opportunity for some but for others, both boys and girls, it is a threat and a difficulty. Modern day stresses affect both young men and women, but young men seem to be affected more because they are less adaptable to change. Education which seems to protect both against suicide and attempted suicide must be broadened, particularly for boys, to encompass the varying modern social and domestic conditions.</P>
    <P>Whereas the physical health of young people today may be better than in the past, the same cannot be said of the social and psychological pressures to which young people are exposed. A part of this relates to the increasing instability of family life as changing sets of personal and family relationships occur. Such stresses must be carefully examined. We do not understand why young people feel so alienated from society, suffer from depression and feel utter despair. I appreciate this <Col N="1211" /> is not the Minister's primary responsibility and it should be that of the Minister for Health and Children but there is also an educational dimension to this. There should be a serious examination of the reasons young people despair, are more depressed and attempt or commit suicide.</P>
    <P>I refer to the concerns of ASTI, which communicated with all Members regarding class sizes. The survey it conducted in spring 1999 demonstrated that overcrowding in classrooms and a restrictive choice of subjects were a result of a direct refusal by the Department of Education and Science to implement changes to the appointment ratio. The survey showed that 60 per cent of second level schools offer general subjects to classes with more than the recommended maximum of 30 students, 30 per cent of schools have difficulty because of inadequate staffing in providing access to a full range of science subjects and 42 per cent have difficulty because of inadequate staffing in providing access to the full range of technical subjects. This is an important issue which can be discussed on another day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this measure, which provides for a substantial modernisation of the school attendance legislation. I am sure Members on all sides welcome the raising of the minimum school leaving age from 15 to 16 years and the establishment of a national educational welfare board, which will have responsibility for research, formulating policy in this area and implementing and operating the legislation. Members will welcome the establishment of an educational welfare service, with educational welfare officers, which will have a national basis. Up to now substantial areas, not only in rural Ireland, but in cities, which are part of existing counties but are not comprised in administrative counties, did not have the benefit of the school attendance officer system. It is desirable, as the explanatory memorandum points out, that this service should be extended nationwide and I welcome both features of this legislation.</P>
      <P>The Bill must be considered carefully as it addresses the social evil identified by the ESRI and referred to by the Minister in his contribution. Its research found that the absence of any educational qualifications among many school leavers leaves them seriously at risk of spending much of their lives unemployed. Of course, a legal underpinning is not just required to address this problem or the establishment of a board and a bureaucratic network, but practical initiatives are required which ensure that at primary level the basics of minimum literacy and numeracy are instilled in pupils prior to departure. It is extraordinary when one considers the investment in the education system that we have not yet been able to achieve this. Of course, I do not in any sense blame the teaching profession for this as it works in a particular social context, of which I am well aware in my constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1212" /> However, it is important that as well as this legal measure, which is essentially a lawyer's Bill, we have the underpinning that is required in terms of practical measures to address this problem. We must target the needs of a particular sub-group, the losers in our education system. I welcome a number of initiatives which have been taken by the Minister, but it would be remiss of me not to make a plea for the suburban losers outside the large concentrations of population in the State because, of course, over the past 20 to 30 years there have been huge developments on the outskirts of major urban areas. Many of the losers in the education system are located in those areas. There is a need for specific initiatives to ensure at a practical level that those basics are instilled into students prior to their departure from the education system because legal provisions raising the minimum school leaving age or imposing statutory duties on parents or educational welfare boards conducting research do not address that practical problem on the ground, although I accept, of course, that they are welcome and necessary.</P>
    <P>The Minister outlined a difficult matter regarding the relationship of the Bill with the wider constitutional provisions relating to education and the family. Our Constitution has always protected the right of a parent to educate a child at home and that has been respected in the legislation, but a system of certification and assessment is proposed by the authorities where parents choose to exercise this option, which is permitted under the Constitution. It was made clear by the Supreme Court in the School Attendance Bill, 1942, case that the State is entitled to define what a certain minimum education means and it indicated a minimum standard of elementary education of general application.</P>
    <P>The Bill is in accordance with the Constitution but when it is enacted by the Houses and signed, promulgated and brought into the force by the Minister, it will have to interpreted and applied in accordance with those constitutional provision and certification and assessment of parents by the board will take place under the legislation. Great sensitivity will have to be shown by the authorities because the constitutional requirement is only a minimum standard of elementary education of general application and, of course, the Constitution was carefully worded at the time of its enactment to exclude both religious and physical education from that guarantee.</P>
    <P>Religious education had to be excluded because that is a matter peculiarly within the preferences of a parent. The reason physical education was excluded in 1937 was because many of the totalitarian states in the Europe in the 1930s used it as a form of political indoctrination and our liberal enactor of the Constitution ensured that there would be no question of our Constitution or education system being abused in the manner that totalitarian states had abused the use of sport in schools for the promotion of their own political importance. The constitutional guaran<Col N="1213" /> tees were drafted with great care and the Bill must be construed, interpreted and applied in accordance with them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to refer to the appalling housing conditions which the travelling community must endure. I am the newly appointed chairperson of Kildare County Council's travellers' committee and the week before last, I toured some half a dozen official and unofficial sites in <Col N="1214" /> Kildare. The conditions which I saw filled me with disgust and anger &ndash; disgust that, at the turn of the century, families in this country are still forced to rear their children without basic water, sanitary and refuse facilities and anger at the indifference and, indeed, hostility towards the plight of these people. I met one woman who shares her caravan with six teenage daughters in Leixlip. She has no running water or refuse service available to her. The halting site is only a stone's throw from the Intel plant in Leixlip, one of the most impressive examples of Ireland's newfound economic confidence and technological skills. There is no sharper image of the chronic inequality which thrives in Irish society. Grinding poverty, which undermines people's basic dignity, exists cheek by jowl with the giants of the Celtic tiger. To add insult to injury, these people must tolerate the widespread discrimination which is practised against them. Travellers cannot even go to a pub for a drink or hire a hotel for a wedding.</P>
      <P>I also met a man who had been given a site by Kildare County Council. His caravan was surrounded on three sides by a brick wall and he was denied access to the river only yards away. On his own initiative, the man knocked the wall to give him a view of the river. He cleared away the refuse dumped by the riverside and erected a small shed, thereby creating a decent site for himself and his family. The bureaucrats in Kildare County Council now want to turn back the clock on his work and surround him and his family with a brick wall once more. Of course, he has been asked to foot the bill. The experience of travellers in Kildare is no different from the experience of travellers in many other local authorities. They are forced to endure appalling conditions and are often faced with administrative pettiness when they try to improve their position.</P>
      <P>In recent times the Oireachtas has passed legislation requiring local authorities to devise and implement housing programmes for travellers. However, I fear that the current Minister for the Environment and Local Government has treated this legislation as an excuse to off-load a difficult task from his desk. The legislation is in place but the goodwill and, more importantly, the political will to ensure travellers receive a fair deal in terms of housing and services is a long way off. Unfortunately, the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, and the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, seem quite content to walk away from this problem without providing any political leadership on the issue. No family in this country should have to raise children in the absence of running water and proper toilet and refuse facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the beginning of this century one of the founding members of the Labour Party, James Larkin, began his political agitation to ensure that the working people of the Dublin tenements would have these very basic services. As the century ends hundreds of travellers throughout the State must still endure primitive housing conditions. This is not an issue on which either the <Col N="1215" /> Minister or the Government can turn their backs. It is an issue which requires and demands political leadership at the highest level. I urge the Minister and the Minister of State to have the political courage to provide this leadership.</P>

      <P>This is the second motion on housing tabled in this House this year &ndash; a similar motion was tabled in February. Housing is one of the Government's top priorities and in An Action Programme for the Millennium the Government specifically pledges a continuing house construction programme by local authorities and voluntary groups. It also embraces the improvement and extension of social housing programmes generally. Everyone in this House is aware that substantially increased resources are being provided for the full range of programmes. Members are aware that provision has been made for much increased local authority housing construction this year which will allow 4,500 starts. They are also aware that this is the highest level of starts sanctioned by any Government in the past 15 years. I remind the Opposition that it was also in Government during that period. In that context, I find it difficult to follow the thinking behind this motion.</P>
      <P>The Opposition is demanding 10,000 starts per annum over the next four years. I would like to see that number of houses built but I would also like to see the Opposition's breakdown of the figures they believe will make their proposal and proposition an affordable reality. Where do they propose to get the additional workforce required to achieve the aims of the proposed motion? I would like to see the Opposition undertaking an exercise in reality. I ask them to admit that this is a totally unrealistic figure. Even if the Government could afford to provide the housing, the construction industry does not have the manpower or capacity to cope with this level of house building in the timespan cited in the motion.</P>
      <P>We are all aware that there is a current building boom and that construction output is soaring to unprecedented heights. We all know there is a shortage of skilled operatives. The Opposition is sinking to a new low by telling the many people on our waiting lists that we can provide them with housing in the near future. They are giving many people, who have already spent far too long waiting for local authority housing, false hope that all their problems will be solved in the short-term. That is a false and very unfair picture. I cannot understand why this motion is being put to this House for the second time this year. The Opposition has been in office for several periods during the past decade and did little to address the problem which faces us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The housing lists are far too long and the num<Col N="1216" /> bers on the lists are unacceptably high. However, they existed long before 1997. We on this side of the House intend to ensure that all those on the waiting lists will be housed at the earliest possible time. That is why I am supporting the Government's initiative and programme for house building. Our strategy to reduce and eliminate the backlog is embodied in our action plan which outlines realistic and achievable levels for local authority house building. We intend to provide housing in a manner which will not contribute to or reinforce social segregation. We intend to provide housing to the best standards of today's markets. We will demand the standards required in today's house building.</P>
    <P>If we look at the scene in relation to the house buyer we find that in today's society people cannot own a home without taking on impossible mortgages. Partners' combined incomes will not suffice for a home loan because of the soaring costs of the houses they wish to buy. This runaway prices will make it uneconomic for many young people to purchase a home in Ireland. Banks are now offering far in excess of the combined income criteria to enable people to meet soaring house prices. I shudder to think how couples in those circumstances will cope or survive if they ever suffer loss of income or long-term illness. We must make private housing more affordable.</P>
    <P>A growth economy is not an asset if the price of housing forces our workforce to financially saddle themselves with huge repayments for the rest of their lives. People should not be forced to spend a lifetime working for a home. They should not have to bring lifetime debts on themselves to enable them to purchase houses in their own country. They must have the space in their financial commitments to enable them to lead a fulfilling family life and to afford the necessity of relaxation. I know many people of my own generation with big families who have not been in a position to afford to purchase a family home during the course of their working lives. We see the problems faced by students in finding affordable accommodation in cities and towns in which universities and institutes of technology are located. It has become impossible for them to obtain housing at affordable rents. Any housing plan must embody targets which will enable students to secure housing at affordable rents while they are in pursuit of academic and technical qualifications. It is bad enough that they must worry about schooling pressures in this highly competitive age without loading them with the stress and worry of soaring rents and the burden this places on them and their parents. I urge the Opposition to come down to earth and give the Government its full support in setting realistic targets to achieve full and affordable housing for all sectors of society in the shortest possible period of time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness" hpid="Mr. McGuinness Mr. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I have served on the local authority in Kilkenny for the past 20 years. The problem of local authority housing has not just <Col N="1217" /> emerged recently, it has been with us all throughout that period. While it has gathered pace in recent years, it has not just come into existence since 1997. The Opposition played their roles in the history of this problem. Rather than putting forward motions such as this one time and again, they should perhaps look at the issue more constructively.</P>
      <P>An analysis has recently been carried out by many local authorities and it should be put before the members of the corporations and county councils for their consideration because there are many ways by which people can secure proper housing for themselves. This has led to a further problem which I wish to underline for the Department officials and the Minister. Various organisations, including the local authorities and the Department of Environment and Local Government, have made available to people mechanisms by which they can gain a local authority house, a voluntary agency house or, indeed, build or buy their own home. As a result, waiting lists in local authorities are, I agree, unacceptable &ndash; for example, there are over 1,000 people on the waiting list in Kilkenny. Yet, the profile of those on the list should be examined by the local authority. It will find that most of the people who find themselves on the housing list are those who are less well off and are not able or cannot afford to provide a house of their own.</P>
      <P>While the Bacon report indicates the need for greater density and authorises it, so to speak, greater density in the provision of local authority housing will not provide the solution. Providing local authority houses for the type of applicant on our lists at present is not the solution. We need less density in the housing schemes provided by local authorities. I refer to one being provided in Carlow where the site was to contain 22 houses but the local authority has now gone through a Part 10 process and will provide 46 houses on that site with no proper recreational facilities or social infrastructure to ensure problems in that area can be dealt with. The Part 10 process was put through very quickly by the local authority and was not considered. In fact, delegations to that local authority were either not allowed or ignored. I ask the Minister, as part of this debate, to take note of that particular development and to ask that those who were left out of the process in this case would be brought back into it and allowed to make their submission because of the changes in the density and the problems that will create locally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>Anybody who wants an analytical study of this complex issue should read Dr. Tony Fahey's article in the current issue of the <i>Irish Banking Review</i>. Rather than hurl abuse across the Chamber, I will draw attention to a number of points. In relation to the audit of lands in possession of the State and so on mentioned in the motion, Dublin Corporation, after the proposal of Deputy Briscoe in May, suggested pre<Col N="1218" /> cisely that and, particularly, that local authorities would have first call on church and State owned lands.</P>
      <P>I would like to remind Members of a few matters. In 1997, the last year that the Fine Gael led Government was in power, 500 starts were allocated to Dublin Corporation. Of those 200 had to be diverted to the area regeneration programme because of the shortage of building land. That gave us 300 starts; we were able to build 126 houses and we had to buy 173. The same number of starts were authorised in 1998 and we built 199 houses and bought 101. Six hundred starts were authorised this year and, again, we diverted 200 to the area regeneration programme. Up to July of this year, by either buying or building, we have set in train 247 units.</P>
      <P>As other speakers mentioned, it is a complex problem which we should not throw around glibly. I discovered that between 1898 and 1998, the local authority sector built 333,000 houses. Through a variety of tenant purchases schemes local authorities sold off 231,000, which means there are now 99,000 local authority homes in local authority ownership. That has been part of the problem. We promoted home ownership, which is among the highest in Europe, but the downside is that we are now short of housing stock.</P>
      <P>I am a great believer in the shared ownership loans. They have made a great contribution to help people who otherwise would not get housing. In 1992 there were 587 applications for shared ownership loans in Dublin Corporation, which rose to 853 last year. A total of 1,902 families are now living in shared ownership approved accommodation in Dublin city. It is a marvellous scheme and the modifications which have been made to it have been worthwhile. Something which might not be widely known is that while the limit of £100,000 applies to the value of houses in the Dublin Corporation area, it is now proposed to allow applicants to purchase a house up to the value of £130,000 provided the balance of £30,000 can be provided from their own resources &ndash; for example, a cash gift or savings or some evidence that same will be provided &ndash; this is according to the city manager's indication last Monday night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The improved procedures as regards the shared ownership loan have been very significant. There are a number of telling points to which I will refer. Between January 1998 and 31 August 1998, 138 transactions were completed comprising ten families who were on the housing list, 14 tenant purchasers and 114 eligible as regards income. The number of people applying from the standard housing list is diminishing. Between 1 September 1998 and 31 December last year, the breakdown is as follows &ndash;  141 transactions were completed; none were from tenants or tenant purchasers, eight were on the local authority housing list and 133 were eligible to purchase under the income guidelines. It can be seen from these figures that only 12 per cent of applicants in 1998 were on the housing list or were tenants <Col N="1219" /> or tenant purchasers. When you compare this percentage with 1993, the first complete year of the shared ownership loans when the comparable figure was 53 per cent, it is clear that the type of applicant has changed significantly. The fact that 70 per cent of all households on the Dublin Corporation waiting lists have incomes under £8,000 means that the shared ownership loan, regardless of the level of house prices, is not a real option for them. Other options must be considered.</P>
    <P>I compliment organisations like Focus Housing which is developing a scheme at Aylward Green in Finglas. It has been given significant funding by the Minister of State with responsibility for housing. It is a complex issue which is being tackled significantly by this Government. Slowly but surely the matters will be addressed in a comprehensive manner. I commend the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt that housing is a major issue of concern. People are genuinely concerned about house prices, the shortage of houses generally and increasing rents. That is why the Fine Gael motion is well intentioned. Nevertheless, the demand to build 10,000 houses for rent or tenant purchase each year for the next four years is simply impractical. It is a wonderful idea but it simply cannot be done. It would cost £3 billion, according to the Minister of State, and that is a conservative estimate. It would lead to sprawling poor quality housing estates &ndash; we have been down that road before and do not want to go there again. There is simply inadequate capacity in the construction industry to undertake a construction programme such as proposed by Fine Gael.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The housing problem became a major political issue from about 1997 onwards. I must ask, therefore, what were Fine Gael and Labour doing before that? House prices were rising sharply and nothing was done. Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats commissioned the Bacon reports, and Bacon got it right &ndash; the problem is essentially one of supply and demand. The Government strategy to decrease investment demand and increase supply, with all that this involves, will be successful. For example, in relation to private housing, £100 million has been invested in the serviced land initiative, stamp duty was significantly reduced on second hand houses, investors were taken out of the first-time buyers market by the removal of tax incentives, guidelines on greater residential density were published, improvements in the planning system freeing up bottlenecks and improving supply were introduced, strategic policy guidelines for the greater Dublin area were published to enhance the supply of housing and improved accommodation supply for students through comprehensive tax incentives were introduced. I also welcome the recommendations in this document, &ldquo;Housing in Dublin: a strategic review by the Dublin local authorities&rdquo;. In it there are many recommendations in relation to infrastructural works, water <Col N="1220" /> supply, sewerage, waste management and transportation. In all, there are 40 recommendations and these are being implemented.</P>
    <P>The assessment of housing needs has just been published. Households comprising one adult and one or more children total 17,000 or 43 per cent, and two-thirds of these have one child. We need to look at these statistics very carefully and seriously consider the type of housing units we are providing. In particular, we should look more carefully at maisonette type housing. I commend the financial contribution scheme, which has been put in place by Dublin Corporation, whereby an older couple would sell their house to Dublin Corporation and be offered senior citizens' accommodation and I also commend the surrender of larger accommodation scheme whereby older tenants of the corporation may surrender their house to the local authority and automatically get senior citizens' accommodation. In this situation, we need to build much more senior citizens' accommodation. Such an initiative would free many local authority houses for letting.</P>
    <P>Deputy Pat Carey dealt with the shared ownership scheme. One cannot buy a house in my constituency for less than £120,000 while up to recently the shared ownership scheme limit was £100,000 so that the scheme is about to become ineffective and needs to be reviewed. However, I welcome the recent modification whereby an applicant who offers £30,000 extra will be considered.</P>
    <P>I welcome Part V of the Planning and Development Bill, 1999. This is a major initiative which will take up much time in this House, particularly the provision that housing strategies must be prepared by local authorities and all that will involve.</P>
    <P>More local authority houses must be built and all the issues associated with the building of local authority housing will be dealt with in the national development plan. There is much more scope for building voluntary housing and co-operative housing. This will lead to difficulties, particularly in the Dublin area due to the shortage of land, and the discussions recently opened up with the churches will help in this regard. I also welcome the initiative announced last night by the Minister in relation to State lands. They too have a role to play in increasing supply and in increasing the rate of house construction. Much is being done but the solution will take time. It is not simply a matter of building more houses. Services must be put in place. That is being done and I am confident that the Government's plan will be successful when fully implemented.</P>

      <P>It is a priority of the Government and a personal priority to tackle the housing crisis. This does not simply stem from a social conscience. One sees the Celtic tiger on one side and, on the other, homelessness which is the human face of poverty. I recognise the realistic targets being set by the Government to meet housing needs. It is an indictment of all of us, Opposition and Government, that 39,176 people <Col N="1221" /> are in need of local authority houses. It is, particularly, an indictment of our society. It is also a reflection of our success. It is because of returning immigrants and greater prosperity that more and more people want to have their own houses. There are also 6,402 people in need of assistance. These figures show that we need a planned attack on housing lists and on the housing situation.</P>
      <P>The Government aims to build 22,000 dwellings over the next four years. This is a plan which can succeed unlike the one proposed tonight by the Opposition. The new starts, the investment being made by the Government, are particularly welcome. There is a need to focus on the Dublin area because Dublin now stretches from Wicklow to Mullingar and Kildare. I acknowledge the difficulty in relation to land and I welcome the Planning Bill which will ensure that 20 per cent of development on new land will be for affordable housing. This will help to reduce the number of people looking for local authority housing. The growth of the lists is due to the increase in prices in those houses. Former council houses in Sallynoggin are now selling for £140,000 which is beyond the reach even of many middle income earners. Fewer houses are available through local authorities as a result of the purchases of the past number of years. Many people are coming on housing lists because development is taking place in larger houses where even people who have always kept up their rent payments are being evicted. Added to these are people who are unable to match rent increases.</P>
      <P>Various schemes which have been introduced will help to reduce housing waiting lists but I will focus on the homeless who, according to a recent ESRI report, number 2,900 in counties Dublin, Wicklow and Kildare. Many of those are single men with no dependants which is particularly sad but I wish to focus on young women with children and particularly on Sandra who has been evicted from her private rented accommodation after 11 years of paying her rent. She has a two year old child but was not allowed even to approach the council until the sheriff arrived to evict her. She was then sent into Charles Street to queue with drug addicts and others to register herself as homeless with her two year old child in her arms. She was then sent back to a bed and breakfast establishment in Dún Laoghaire. It is a comfortable B &amp; B but she must walk out of it every day at 10 a.m. and she is not allowed back in until 6 p.m. She has no place to go to feed her child or to toilet train him so that he can be placed in a playgroup after Christmas. She is forced to go into fast food outlets to buy him a sandwich and a fizzy drink. This is not good enough. I ask the Minister to make special grants to local authorities to provide day centres where Sandra and others can go to look after their children, to avail of social services, to meet public health nurses and, at least, to have a base for themselves. Money which is being spent on housing should also be spent on practical care for the homeless.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1222" /> Housing lists could be reduced by allowing people on small private incomes to avail of the rent supplement to enable them to move into private rented accommodation. I would penalise landlords who do not accept the rent supplement. It is disgraceful that people with rent supplements are turned away by landlords, presumably because he does not want to become known to a tax inspector. I would encourage and facilitate transfers by local authority tenants. At present, in Dún Laoghaire, a tenant must be in a house for five years before applying for a transfer. If an old person wishes to move into a smaller house, releasing a bigger house for a family, the five year rule should be relaxed. Immediate investment in houses which are boarded up should be encouraged. It is sinful to see houses lying empty for six weeks at a time when any private house can be re-occupied in a weekend. There are great openings for the provision of smaller housing units for elderly people.</P>
    <P>Our aim is to reduce housing waiting lists and to ensure that people do not sleep on the streets. Building houses is just one of the ways of doing this. There are other ways. I hope the Minister will consider some of the ideas in the other schemes.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate. I compliment the Minister and the Government for putting housing at the top of its priority list. Over the years policies, developed in the main by Fianna Fáil led Administrations, have facilitated spectacular progress. Unprecedented economic growth, a major increase in the number employed, low inflation, fewer people emigrating and more people returning from abroad to work here are among the factors contributing to an increase in demand for housing in all sectors. In addition, house price inflation has also been fuelled by easier access to cheaper money and by investor activity in the market. As a result, house prices have increased dramatically and low to middle earners are prohibited from access to affordable homes, which has led to an increase in the demand for local authority housing.</P>
      <P>I compliment local authorities for the swift and efficient manner in which they carried out their housing needs assessment. It is evident from the overall picture that the need for local authority houses has grown. In the context of this growing demand, I welcome the fact that for the first time housing will be included in the new national development plan. Provision for an estimated 500,000 houses to cope with the demand over the next decade necessitates forward planning and investment. During the lifetime of this plan an increase in provision will be made for local authority housing as well as for social and affordable housing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The formulation of comprehensive local authority strategies is also provided for in the recently <Col N="1223" /> published planning and development Bill. In each local authority area measures will address the demands that are there at present and the demands that are anticipated. Local authority housing programmes have a major role to play in regeneration not only in urban areas but also in our smaller towns and villages. Deputy Farrelly will know that Meath County Council has a policy where planning permission is granted to people in villages on condition that the local need is met, but, unfortunately, the minute some people get planning permission they look for £40,000 to £50,000 for a site in a rural village. That is a shame and that problem will have to be addressed. We cannot condone people who get planning permission on condition that they will sell the site to a local person and meet a local need suddenly increasing the price of a site from £25,000 to £50,000. That is not good enough. I appeal to the Minister to examine this matter.</P>
    <P>It is vital in the context of future development in rural areas that local authority schemes continue to be provided in our towns and villages. In this regard I would like to record my appreciation for an allocation of £1.8 million to the North-East Voluntary Housing Association which, in conjunction with Meath County Council, provided 22 houses in my home town of Kells. People must have the option where possible of residing in their own areas. The future of rural economies depends to a great extent on the spending of local residents. Access to suitable, affordable accommodation is a fundamental necessity for everybody.</P>
    <P>Since it came to office the Government has taken a wide range of steps to tackle rising house prices and increase housing output. I am confident that a continuation of these very constructive initiatives over the coming years will have a very positive impact on our housing needs. The motion refers to 10,000 starts, but targeting that number of starts is unrealistic and unachievable, given that there is inadequate capacity in the construction industry to respond to such demand at a time when construction output is booming and local authorities are finding it very difficult to get contractors.</P>

      <P>I commend Deputy Hayes on tabling this motion. It gives the House a great opportunity to discuss the serious issue of the ever-increasing housing lists. Deputy Hayes's tenacity in forcing the Minister with responsibility for housing to admit that there is about 100,000 people on housing waiting lists at present is an <Col N="1224" /> indication of how we, as a society, are progressing. I cannot reconcile that with the statement by Deputy Hanafin in seeking to justify that the increasing number of people who are seeking houses is an indication of our success. I do not accept that in a fair and just society people, through no fault of their own but due to a lack of political will to give priority to this important issue, should be continuously placed on the housing waiting list. At a time of unprecedented prosperity it is difficult to explain to people the reason they have been on the housing list for three or four years. The waiting lists are ever-increasing. There has been a 22 per cent increase in the number of people on the local authority waiting list in County Kilkenny.</P>
      <P>Some speakers said that it is not possible to commence 10,000 local authority starts, but it must be remembered that in the late 1970s and 1980s, when the country was not well off, a much greater number of houses were built &ndash; about 9,000 starts were made in the mid-1980s. That was possible because the then Government gave political priority to those who were on the waiting list at that time. A large number of house starts in all local authorities were made at that time when the country had little money relative to the economic prosperity we have today. It is possible to deal with this problem if there is a will to do so, as the necessary resources are available at present. Given that 3,500 starts was the best the Minister could achieve in 1998, the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government is writing off housing as a political priority. We are, however, living in much better times now. Up to recently there were 40,000 applicants on the national housing list and, with various factors taken into account, it is estimated there are now 100,000 on the waiting list. In this motion Fine Gael proposes to give political priority in the new national plan and in the Estimates to the people who are in urgent need of housing.</P>
      <P>Our young people will continue to live in misery and will remain on the housing waiting list for years unless there is the political will to address their housing needs. It is time the Minister for the Environment and Local Government awoke to the reality of the misery endured by people who have to pay high rents for flats in many of our urban areas. The housing crisis will be resolved only by a greater political will to address this problem, not by continuing to hide behind another report like the Bacon mantra.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to say a few words on this matter. Since publication of the Bacon report the Government has made a number of attempts to do something about reducing the number of people on the housing lists. We have heard a number of Dublin Deputies on the Government side, but I would like to know why, when the Dublin County Council was divided <Col N="1225" /> into three authorities, 4,000 sites were sold by the local authorities rather than held for development purposes. The Government is responsible for building 7 per cent of the total housing stock built on a yearly basis. A few years ago that figure was 15 per cent. Is it any wonder the number on the national housing list is 40,000?</P>
      <P>The serviced land available is minimal compared to the income the Government is receiving from house sales. A year and a half ago the Government would have had an income from VAT on new houses of £1.25 billion. I call on the Minister to make a decision to put £0.5 billion into the servicing of lands around the country, especially in the north-east where the demand is greater.</P>
      <P>The Minister gave a directive recently to increase the housing density to 20 houses per acre, but I question whether he wants slums to develop in every corner of every town in Ireland. It is a retrograde step and I ask the Government to seriously examine that proposal. Will the Minister of State ask my colleague from Country Meath to give a directive to local authorities to allow 100 houses to be built in schemes on the new Bord na Móna puriflow system, which could be linked into the main sewerage schemes that are provided. That would make available immediately across the length and breadth of the country in the region of 100,000 sites for building. That would go some way towards helping to alleviate the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJoeCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Over and over again, generation after generation it seems there is a housing crisis, yet there is no justification for one in a rich economy. Employment is high, yet people cannot be housed. The State is saving on welfare payments for each person in employment. That saving must be redirected to provide housing.</P>
      <P>The numbers of people on council lists is growing at the rate of approximately 10 per cent per half year. While the number of new home starts by councils is increasing, it is not doing so at a rate which holds any prospect of dealing with the full scope of the problem. It is wrong that people should be denied a home of their own. A firm commitment should be made that every housing applicant will be offered a home within one year of making an application to a housing authority.</P>
      <P>In my local authority housing area the new housing list was published last Friday, 2 October. It shows an increase over the past six months of 40 on the base figure of 1,483 persons. This is an addition to the number the authority directly housed with the assistance of the shared ownership scheme and takes account of those who provided in some fashion for themselves, left the State or the elderly who applied in good faith in the hope of a home in their last years but for whom that hope will never be realised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of starts in Fingal has increased <Col N="1226" /> from 85 in 1998 to 134 in 1999 with approval for 500 in 2000. The increase is welcome, but it is not enough because the list stands at 1,523. Even if the authority got the keys in the morning for all these starts it still leaves 1,000 applicants to be housed and the lists are growing by 10 per cent per half year. The 500 starts due in 2000 will not be available until 2001. This is an inadequate response by the Government, which has the financial capacity to do much better.</P>
    <P>The figure the Department presents for national housing starts are overstated and include refurbishment of existing housing units as new starts. This is not accurate as refurbishment requires that existing homes are decommissioned. The Minister may present the true net start figures when he responds. He might also advise the House of his new proposals to assist the elderly in securing accommodation in sheltered housing, which would relieve family homes to meet the needs of new housing applicants while improving the quality of life for the aged.</P>
    <P>The current support provided under the shared ownership scheme is not realistic in the current market in the greater Dublin area. If the guideline of two and a half times salary is applied to a salary of £20,000 the loan available is £50,000 for the average house. The limit must be raised and the scheme must be revisited to make it function to the advantage of those using it.</P>
    <P>The Government can make an impact in ensuring that housing is available. It can, and should, enter leasing arrangements with property market investors, thereby controlling both the standard of properties which housing applicants rent and the rental charge.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has a strong record on macro-economic issues, but its record on housing is disgraceful, deplorable and almost unbelievable in the context of the strong economy we are enjoying. Seven council houses were allocated as late as today in Fermoy in my constituency, Cork East. There were not tens but hundreds of approved applicants. I spent approximately 15 minutes this afternoon speaking to a constituent, a married woman who has lived with her husband and two children for the past two years in a caravan beside her parents' house. She is unable to purchase a house on her own and is depending on the local authority for re-housing. What could I say to a person who has lived in a caravan located at the back of a house for two years and still remains unhoused this afternoon? There is nothing one can say. That sad experience is being repeated throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the booming Ireland of the 1990s local authority housing appears to have gone out of political fashion with the Government. In the meantime thousands of people are being added to the housing lists week after week and the problem is not being addressed. If any good will come from <Col N="1227" /> the motion it will be that the Minster of State finally appeared to wake up last night to the fact that there is a housing crisis.</P>
    <P>It is not surprising there is a housing crisis because in the tough economic circumstances of the 1980s, 30 per cent of houses were built by the local authorities. In the so-called booming economy of the 1990s the proportion is only 10 per cent. It is not good enough. We can have all the fancy schemes we want &ndash; and some good initiatives have been introduced by the Minister of State &ndash; but until he returns to the idea of local authority housing as a necessity we will go nowhere.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister of State, Deputy Dan Wallace, who is from Cork, to wake up to the figures in Cork city and county and to recognise that thousands of people are living in almost subhuman conditions in our so-called tiger economy. He knows that the solution is to put some of the millions in the Government's budget surplus into public housing and let people have the dignity of a proper home in the Ireland of the new millennium.</P>

      <P>I support the motion moved by Deputy Hayes. It presents a useful opportunity for Members to discuss this very important issue. It was interesting to hear members of the Government talk about live issues and individuals. Some of us had thought they had long forgotten to care for them.</P>
      <P>In my constituency, Cavan-Monaghan, 1,400 people are on the housing list. Young couples can no longer afford the sites, which now sell for from £30,000 to £50,000 anywhere around Monaghan or even in rural areas. The serviced land initiative, held up as one of the major approaches, at least in County Monaghan, is being held up by planning and ownership problems. It will be at least another year before the initiative will be of use. The new planning Bill is being heralded as another great weapon to solve the housing problem. However, it will not have any effect for years and may not even be constitutional.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fine Gael introduced a reconstruction grant scheme for residential dwellings in the mid-1980s. It had some flaws, but it served an important purpose. At its meeting last Monday Monaghan County Council unanimously passed a motion which stated: &ldquo;That this council again calls on the Minister for the Environment, Noel Dempsey, to reintroduce a reconstruction grant scheme for residential dwellings.&rdquo;  The motion was proposed by Fianna Fáil councillor Pádraig McNally and supported by his party. In his statement on the proposal, councillor McNally said there was a need for the scheme and that the Government had made a commitment regarding it in the programme for Government. He also said he understood the Minister was giving it serious consider<Col N="1228" /> ation. I supported the motion but stated that when introduced it must apply to owner occupiers. It could also have an income limit.</P>
    <P>Houses in rural villages and towns, many of them potentially valuable, could be brought into use. This would not only provide homes at minimum cost but would also help towards cleaning up the countryside and town centres.</P>
    <P>Housing is not just a problem for young couples and others who need it in their own area. My constituency has one of the lowest third level participation rates in the country. The cost of flats in Dublin or in any other towns with third level institutions is at crisis level and represents a serious impediment to students. If these trends continue there will be serious implications not just for families seeking housing but for students who may have to leave the country to be educated abroad.</P>
    <P>I beg the Minister to reconsider the situation. The Celtic tiger has produced a huge budget surplus. We should use the opportunity this presents because it may not always be there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>Recently the Government spoke about taking 20 per cent of developers' land. There is a simple answer to this problem, which is in the hands of the Department of the Environment and Local Government. There is plenty of land in every town and village in the country and there is no reason why local authorities cannot buy that land and service it. Instead of taking it from developers, we should use a portion of it to build local authority housing and sell the remainder to developers. The State has the money and resources to do this. If the will exists, the housing problem could be resolved tomorrow morning by buying and servicing the land, giving it to the local authorities and selling it to developers. This would be a very simple solution rather than the complicated one being introduced by the Minister which will end up in the High Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer to a matter I raised in this House previously. Tenants can buy local authority houses having lived in them for just one year. I have seen this happen on several occasions in my own county. Two years down the road I have seen people sell their local authority house and move into a new house. These people used the local authority until they could move on and build their own house. Local authorities should not sell houses to tenants unless they have lived in them for ten years. On moving on tenants should hand back these houses to the local authorities. Now that there is a crisis, the Minister should introduce a regulation whereby tenants would be required to live in local authority houses for ten years before being able to sell them. If the Minister checks the records he will find that many people lived in local authority houses for two years or less. I will stand over my statement that this is happening on a regular basis <Col N="1229" /> and it is time the Government introduced an order to deal with this problem.</P>
    <P>The £3,000 first time buyer's grant is no longer adequate. There should be two grants, an urban grant and a rural grant. We should entice people in rural areas by offering them grants of £10,000 or £12,000. A grant of £3,000 is no longer adequate; it should be increased to £5,000 or £6,000 in urban areas.</P>
    <P>Stamp duty should also be looked at. I know the Minister has done something about this in relation to first time buyers. There should be no stamp duty on a second hand house provided it is the purchaser's first house and he intends to live there. However, if that person sells the house within five years he or she should be required to pay the stamp duty. Everyone knows that grants should be reintroduced. Drastic action needs to be taken now. I would remind the Minister of State that the Government has the money, the land is available and it should be buying the land and trying to resolve the problem of 45,000 people on the housing waiting list.</P>

      <P>The first question to be addressed is have we got a housing crisis? There is a danger that the extent of the current crisis will be lost in the political debate around the Fine Gael motion. The figures are clear. There are approximately 50,000 applicants on housing waiting lists at the moment. This means that more than 100,000 citizens are without a secure roof over their head. If this is not a crisis, what is? As someone who has experience of the property market, I predict that the situation will get worse unless drastic action is taken. The leading independent commentator on housing matters is Tony Fahey of the ESRI. I read an article by him this week which states:</P>
      <P>Since 1987, social housing construction has consistently fallen below 10% of total new housing construction, in contrast with levels in the range 20-30% which were the long-term norm in the decades prior to the late 1980s. Increased funding for social housing in the public capital programme in 1999 will lead to some increase in output, but (at around 4,000 units) it will still amount to only half the housing output of the local authorities 25 years ago in absolute terms and less than a third in relative terms.</P>
      <P>The article also reads:</P>
      <P>Cutbacks in social housing were introduced in the late 1980s as part of fiscal retrenchment, but this does not explain why a low level of provision should persist in the very different fiscal environment of today.</P>
      <P>It would be no harm to mention his solution and again I quote:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1230" /> If we were to take traditional benchmarks as a guideline, where social housing typically accounted for something of the order of 25% of new housing construction, this would require an annual social housing output over the next ten years of around 10,000 units per year, compared to an annual average of 2,100 per year over the past ten years. In short, it would require a fourfold increase in social housing output over the next decade compared to the past decade.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the motion. However, my only complaint is that, in the light of what we have heard since Deputy Hayes put down our motion, he is probably a bit modest in his approach. He talks about building 10,000 houses over the next four years but the Government rejects that approach. I appeal to the Government to confront this crisis and I would say to anyone who supports the Government amendment that they are supporting a deepening of that crisis. That is my fear of the outcome of the vote tonight.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to support the Fine Gael motion calling on the Government to provide the resources to enable local authorities, county councils, corporations and urban councils to build 10,000 houses for rent or tenant purchase over the next four years. It is a disgrace that, at a time of unprecedented economic growth, waiting lists for local authority houses have increased by 50 per cent in two years. I frequently meet applicants who have been waiting two, three, four and five years for housing. This is not acceptable. A caring nation must assist those who cannot provide decent accommodation for themselves. It is not acceptable that people are living in mobile homes, often with children who develop illnesses because of their living conditions. It is not acceptable that people are forced to live in seriously over-crowded conditions, often with several families under the one roof.</P>
      <P>It is not acceptable that single parents, who comprise 43 per cent of the waiting lists at present, are often the forgotten people when it comes to housing. As a public representative I cringe when a single parent inquires about housing because in most cases it is a young single mother who is often very distressed because of their living conditions. One realises how deeply in need of assistance they are. While these people are eligible for housing accommodation, their chances of obtaining it are very low. Often there are serious domestic difficulties where a young mother is forced to live in over-crowded family conditions or in unsuitable accommodation outside the family home. If the Minister of State thinks this is acceptable, he should consider the children. We are expected to treat all our children equally. Are the children of people on these long housing waiting lists being treated the same as other children in society? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1231" /> There are 1,323 applicants awaiting housing in County Limerick. Given the present rate of local authority housing, how can there be any impact on this figure? How can these people be given hope? A start might be for the Government to accept the Fine Gael motion. Why is local authority building so low when the need is so high? Local authorities and voluntary organisations built 10,237 houses between 1996 and 1998. Between 1984 and 1986 local authorities built 1,941 houses. Given that half as many local authorities houses were built in the past three years, it is no wonder that local authority waiting lists are increasing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>If one reads today's newspapers one will see that the national media accept there is a major housing crisis. In my own county of Kerry the housing waiting list has increased by almost 30 per cent. In 1996, in the county council area the number of families on the housing waiting list was 500; that number has now increased to 670. The number overall on the housing waiting list throughout the county 1,241. In a county with a population of 120,000 this is quite serious. I wish to point out also that because of Government policy in the 1980s and pressure from county councillors, county councils sold off land to developers for a very low price. As a result they do not have the land bank now and it is almost impossible to buy it. For example, in Killarney where sites are making £40,000, how can a local authority afford to buy land at this rate, unless the Department of the Environment and Local Government is prepared to plough money into it? The Minister of State is a pragmatist. He has been involved in local authority housing all his life and he knows there is a major crisis. I appeal to the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, who agrees with me, that there must be a major investment in the provision of sewerage and other services. Perhaps the Government could do something about this, either in the national plan or in the forthcoming budget and Finance Bill. Sewerage, in particular, requires further investment to allow towns and villages to expand. Housing can thus be provided at a much lower rate where land is available and it brings life back into towns and villages.</P>
      <P>In the budget the Minister for Finance should do something to help first-time house buyers, whether by levies or other means. Young people are being taxed out of it at this stage. Where there is one child in a family, people should be encouraged to extend their homes rather than building another house. I fully support this motion and I compliment Deputy Hayes for being so proactive on this question. A year ago when he said there was a housing crisis he was hounded by the Government side and was shouted down, but his forecast has proved to be correct.</P>

The figures for cities and large towns leap from the page, but those for smaller towns and rural areas are no less damning for there, too, the need for housing has increased and thousands of people are in a desperate position. This represents a crisis in the lives of all those so affected. During questions yesterday, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, made an extraordinary statement when he said he presumed that a Deputy was, &ldquo;not asking the Government to undertake a series of measures which would decrease the price of houses and cause negative equity for those who already have houses&rdquo;. I view that as a very revealing remark indeed. It exposes a flawed understanding of the problem on the Minister's behalf. It showed little sympathy for the 88 per cent of those on the housing lists who have an average gross income of less than £10,000, for people living in overcrowded conditions and the homeless on our streets. Nor, indeed, does such a statement show much concern or sympathy for the many thousands who are forced to purchase homes at highly inflated, exorbitant prices.</P>
      <P>The Minister should not mind the property speculators. We want to see a decrease in house prices and easier access to home ownership. We must see local authority housing available for those who cannot aspire to that goal. The piecemeal approach of the Government has failed miserably to address the crisis. It should adopt the proposed measures outlined. I hope the proposer of the motion will take no offence when I say that the Labour Party's amendment goes further and clearly spells out additional and important measures that must be embraced by the Government if we are to tackle seriously the problem which must be faced. If afforded the opportunity, I will support the amendment in the Labour Deputy's name.</P>

      <P>The housing problem has been in the making for some years, probably for the past decade. We seem to have had this problem for a long time, particularly in the eastern region and the greater Dublin area. We had it in the 1940s and 1950s when a crash house-building programme was launched in Ballyfermot, Kimmage and Cabra. In the 1960s and 1970s we tackled it through the Ballymun scheme by rehousing people from inner city areas. In the 1980s and now, as the 1990s draw to a close, we have tackled it by building satellite towns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most recent bible of so-called solutions to the housing crisis is the Bacon report which seems to be the answer to many problems. Back in the 1980s, I had the responsibility of chairing a body called Ergo which was a cross-party group <Col N="1233" /> overseeing the eastern region. I signed a report in 1988 with a number of recommendations which now &ndash; dusted down and with a different colour on the front cover &ndash; turns out in effect to be the Bacon report. We talked about placing 16,000 to 20,000 units on the north fringe of Dublin and everybody agreed in principle. The Department of the Environment and Local Government, and Dublin Corporation have been concerned with a solution for sewage disposal for about ten years longer than they should have. The north fringe is not yet drained. According to the Bacon report 16,000 units could, supposedly, be accommodated but where is the scheme? How long more will it take? Why has it taken so long?</P>
    <P>As I left my office for the Chamber, Deputy Farrelly was speaking about Dublin Corporation which, at managerial level, dumped thousands of valuable sites in County Dublin on to the market &ndash; at minuscule values compared to today's &ndash; rather than transferring them to the South Dublin and Fingal councils. If those sites had remained in local authority ownership we could have done something about the housing crisis over the last three or four years.</P>
    <P>When the Government took office two years ago, I said housing would be one of the main problems it would have to face. We now have an audit of State lands. Recently, the Eastern Health Board sold off land at Blanchardstown hospital. Every week in the newspapers there are reports of more land being sold on the market by religious orders and other institutions. The current measures are an attempt to address the problem but they are taking too long. There does not seem to be any line management of responsibility. Lucan, where I reside, is the focus of a major potential for 5,000 new homes, as per the new south Dublin plan. However the planning authority cannot even process the current applications. The absence of forward planners and design engineers on the provision of services is a problem.</P>
    <P>In the 1960s, the late Seán Lemasss said the way to control the price of building land is to service more than is needed. That is the point Deputy Deenihan has just made. We must grapple with the problem with vigour and an intent to achieve what needs to be done. We have decided to move away from large local authority housing schemes because we do not want the problems that arose in the past, as in the areas I have already referred to. However, if one is to cater for the numbers required, it can only be done through a major local authority housing drive coupled with affordable housing, which is the new phrase. For the past three or four years, young couples have been paying £20,000 to £40,000 more for their first home than they should have had to. Young couples are penalised with a heavy debt which they cannot afford to take on. In addition, there are single parents on local auth<Col N="1234" /> ority housing lists and the tragedy of the homeless.</P>
    <P>It will take a wide ranging combination of issues to combat the housing problem. The 20 per cent take is a laudable and principled idea and I hope it will succeed. but it could be cumbersome and cause serious delay.</P>
    <P>I will finish now because I know the Minister of State has many more important things to say. I ask the Minister and those in positions of responsibility to take line management action to ensure that what needs to be done is done, and done speedily.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies who contributed to the debate. I welcome the opportunity this House has to support the measures being taken by the Government in the area of social housing.</P>
      <P>Deputy Hayes and others contributed to the debate last night and nothing any Member said countered the point forcefully made by my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Molloy, that the Government has a credible and coherent housing strategy in place which is designed to increase housing supply, improve access to housing for lower income groups and improve the housing conditions of local authority tenants and other key groups such as the elderly, the homeless and the disabled. Each of the Deputies indicated last night that we need more local authority and social housing. Fine Gael is calling for 40,000 houses while Labour is seeking 50,000. It certainly comes easy to Opposition parties to make soundbite appeals of that nature. The Government knows that we need more local authority and social housing and it is doing something about it. We have strategies in place and we will deliver on them.</P>
      <P>Housing is a priority for the Government. It is hugely important to individuals, to households and, indeed, to the well-being of the entire economy. Let there be no doubt that the Government is sympathetic and it regards addressing the housing needs of the increasing numbers on local authority housing lists as a key priority of its overall social policy. The Government's actions will deliver more local authority houses and, furthermore, these will be well designed and located in a high quality environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The assessment of housing needs released yesterday indicates that just over 39,000 households are in need of local authority housing, compared with 27,400 in 1996. This represents a significant number of people on the waiting lists. The Minister of State last night referred to the sample survey of lettings of houses by five local authorities during the first six months of this year which was carried out by the Department. This survey found that an average of 56 per cent of those who <Col N="1235" /> obtained houses were less than one year on the waiting list, 22 per cent between one and two years, 10 per cent between two and three years and only 7 per cent were more than four years on the list. These facts contradict the exaggerated claim that very needy households are spending many years on waiting lists.</P>
    <P>Local authorities will make over 7,000 new lettings this year and this means that those in the greatest need of housing have reasonable prospects of securing local authority housing within a reasonable period.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ulick Burke raised the issue of design of local authority housing and the need for facilities in estates. It must be remembered that the local authority housing programme of the 1990s is fundamentally different in character from that of previous decades. A key policy consideration is to provide housing in a manner which does not contribute to or reinforce social segregation. Local authorities are providing very well designed housing schemes, often on infill sites, and many of our recent local authority housing developments are a credit to the local authorities.</P>
    <P>This approach is crucial in redeveloping rundown areas of our towns and cities and providing a quality environment for residents, particularly older or disabled people, in close proximity to shops, churches and other services. In order to ensure that good design practice is developed further, my Department recently issued new guidelines on social housing design which give comprehensive guidance on achieving quality design and on how to respond in a positive fashion to the changing nature of social housing needs, which have become more diverse and are now characterised by different household types with specific household requirements. Needs being met include not only the traditional family household but also lone parents, homeless persons, elderly persons, travellers and those with physical and mental disabilities.</P>
    <P>Local authorities were particularly asked to ensure that the housing schemes to be developed under the new multiannual programme not only provide a good living environment but also contribute to the integrated development of local areas. Particular efforts should be made to use suitable infill sites where development can help to restore, strengthen or upgrade the social and physical fabric of an area and generally facilitate the creation of vibrant and sustainable communities.</P>
    <P>A more recent development has been the use of the local authority housing programme as a mechanism to regenerate existing housing in major urban areas. The redevelopment of areas of older housing, mainly flats, experiencing social problems and physical decline, sometimes associated with the nature of the housing itself, is under way in a number of areas and is most welcome. <Col N="1236" /> The most prominent example is Ballymun where the redevelopment of housing is the focus for the social and economic regeneration of the area as a whole.</P>

      <P>A welcome feature of the debate is the acknowledgement by most Government backbenchers that there is a crisis in respect of the construction of local authority housing. The Minister and Minister of State should listen to their backbenchers in this regard. This week the Minister acknowledged that there are 45,000 applicants on the housing waiting list. In Galway city there are 1,000 applicants on the waiting list and in the county area it takes up to four or five years for an applicant &ndash; I refer to successful applicants &ndash; to obtain a local authority house.</P>
      <P>There is a great deal of red tape attached to the sanction of local authority houses. Some of the responsibility for this lies with the Minister's office and his Department. For example, when a rural house exceeds the contract price of £55,000, permission must be obtained from the Minister's office to proceed with the contract. This is an unnecessary delaying tactic because everyone knows that one cannot build a local authority house or any other house in a rural area for £55,000. I ask the Minister to raise the minimum price at which local authorities can proceed with contracts. For example, early this year we went through the planning process for nine local authority rural houses, mostly in the Connemara area, and almost a year later we have not received permission to build them. It would greatly alleviate the problem if that upper limit was changed. In the short-term, we should also greatly increase the grant for first time buyers. This should be increased to £12,000 or £15,000 to encourage people to purchase their own houses rather than remain on the local authority list where, in some cases, they have no chance of obtaining a house.</P>
      <P>Another matter which is causing great concern is repairs to local authority houses. The repair sections of councils are working on a shoestring budget. There are many local authority houses, particularly on estates in urban areas, that are boarded up simply because repair crews cannot be sent out to carry out repairs. This leads to vandalism and the dereliction of houses. As a result, estates become rundown. I suggest that the Minister introduce a system which would allow local authority tenants to carry out repairs, the cost of which, on production of certified receipts, could be offset against their rent. It is absolutely ridiculous that local authority tenants are obliged to approach the repair section to have a window or door put in or to have a tap or ballcock repaired. Local authority tenants should be allowed to carry out those works themselves and offset the cost against their rent. Many authorities would facilitate that. Housing repair grants, which could be means tested, should also be reintroduced. This would be a step in the right direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the debate. A number of years ago the now retired European Commissioner, Padraig Flynn, introduced a plan for <Col N="1238" /> social housing and a number of innovative schemes in response to what was allegedly a housing crisis in the early 1990s. With the numbers on housing waiting lists today &ndash; approximately 40,000 &ndash; there is a need for innovation from the Department of the Environment and Local Government. That plan for social housing included a scheme whereby those living in substandard accommodation would be given a grant towards repairing the accommodation rather than being provided with a conventional local authority house. That scheme, which also included shared ownership, needs to be revamped to take account of trends in housing prices since that date. The shared ownership scheme in particular could be significantly revamped to take account of the increased cost with a greater subsidy by way of grant being provided by the State to facilitate a number of those on the housing lists.</P>
      <P>I was disappointed with the tone of the reply from the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, last night which seemed to suggest that if we could only discard the 43 per cent of the waiting lists made up of lone parents we would not have a problem, as if these people were second class citizens. That tone in the debate was disappointing and not conducive to an inclusive society where everybody on the housing lists is treated equally. There is no doubt that many lone parents would be better off in a family support network but there are others who live in extremely over-crowded conditions and for whom only alternative accommodation will meet their housing needs. In this regard a number of local authorities have much catching up to do to take account of the trends reflected in the family composition of their waiting lists. The knee-jerk reaction of local authorities, even in my own constituency, is to provide a three bedroom house rather than a variety of house styles taking account of the social circumstances of the applicant. There is a greater need for a variety of house styles to be constructed and a better social mix in terms of the design used by local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An innovative scheme which cost a considerable amount of money a number of years ago was the house improvement grants. The problem with the provision of house improvement grants in the 1980s was that there was no income restriction and no reference to whether a person was renovating a second home or whatever. A modified house improvement grant focused on those on the housing lists would go some way towards alleviating the crisis. One of the positive measures introduced to help rural areas experiencing difficulties in sustaining their current population is the serviced sites initiative that local authorities can use to far greater advantage. There is no doubt that serviced sites in villages and towns throughout rural Ireland can be acquired at a far cheaper rate per unit cost than acquiring sites in larger urban areas and they offer a significant <Col N="1239" /> outlet for taking numbers off the housing waiting lists, particularly those who cannot acquire a site which in some rural areas can cost £20,000 or £30,000. The serviced site initiative could bolster numbers in rural communities and thus safeguard local services, schools, post offices, Garda stations, etc. Any leadership the Department can provide in relation to serviced sites would be welcome, particularly in rural constituencies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Once again, in the contribution of the Minister for Housing last night and his colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Wallace, this evening, the response of the Government to the housing crisis is disgraceful. It is also disgraceful &ndash; and I refer to this on every occasion we debate the matter &ndash; that the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, has effectively done a runner tonight; he is nowhere to be seen. Every time a chimney pot is being put on a new house in Galway the Minister of State can be seen cutting the ribbon but when it comes to debating probably the most important political issue facing our country, providing housing for our people, he is nowhere to be seen. He does not want to take the responsibility for this issue and that was obvious yesterday when he decided to publish his housing assessment which confirmed the prediction I made 12 months ago that there has been a 50 per cent increase in three years in the number of people looking for local authority homes.</P>
      <P>We have a new &ldquo;yuppified&rdquo; Fianna Fáil backbencher in the House at the moment who is of the view, as we quite clearly heard in the comments this evening from the other side of the House, that the poor can wait until the market is right and then they will be able to buy their houses. The poor will not wait. People on low incomes will no longer live in appalling conditions where seven or eight adults and three children are living in a three bedroom house. They will not wait any longer and the motion before the House this evening in the name of my party is asking the Government to rapidly expand the local authority house building programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some people argue that it is impossible to build more local authority homes. That is nonsense. Since 1921, the State has built over 330,000 local authority homes. In the 1970s, a third of our total housing output was made up of local authority homes. Today it is about 10 per cent. The point was clearly made by Dr. Fahey, a well known, well respected sociologist who has written extensively for the ESRI, that the gap is growing consistently between private housing and the output of housing for the social sector. Interestingly, he stated in his article that since 1987 the construction of social housing has consistently fallen. What happened in 1987? That was the time when <Col N="1240" /> health cuts hurt the old, the sick and the handicapped &ndash;&ldquo;Vote Fianna Fáil&rdquo;. Every time the Minister's party gets its hands on the tillers of power, low income families are confined to living in appalling conditions. Is it not astonishing that in 1987 there was a massive reduction in the number of houses in the social housing sector? This year the percentage of the amount of money being spent on social housing, the total percentage of the capital budget, has fallen.</P>
    <P>I note the comments of the Minister's colleague last night when he said there had been an 18 per cent increase in capital expenditure. That is not the point I was making about this issue on various radio programmes during the summer. The point I was making was that the actual amount of money that the Government is spending as a percentage of the total amount of money available is significantly lower than it was when our party was in Government three years ago. When our party was in Government we spent 8 per cent and 9 per cent of capital expenditure on social housing projects. The Minister's party is spending 6.9 per cent. That is not from my own propaganda department but from the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for giving me the opportunity to raise this matter. I am disappointed that the Minister, Deputy Harney, is not here. This closure is a devastating blow for the workers of IEC in Longford and it is the second closure there within six months &ndash; 180 jobs were lost in Atlantic Mills six months ago, and it was announced last Friday that 116 jobs are to be lost. The IEC workforce are excellent and conscientious, there was no industrial trouble and any company would be proud to employ them. The closure has come about due to the problems of the parent company in the US. I make no reflection on the Minister of State but at a time like this I want to hear what answers the Minister has for the people of Longford, who are in a state of depression. We hoped an announcement of new jobs was on the way and on two visits the Minister assured us this would happen, but there has been no announcement so far. Instead of that, we received this devastating blow last Friday.</P>
      <P>I call on the Minister to provide a permanent IDA office in Longford for the local area. Drastic action must be taken because this is a drastic situation. An inter-agency group is already established and I compliment it on its efforts. However, at this stage drastic action is needed. I will be disappointed if the Minister does not accede to the request for a permanent IDA office in Longford to promote it as a special area which needs special treatment. The workers are there and are ready, willing and able if they are given a chance. I emphasise to any potential investors or industries interested in coming to Longford that the workforce is as good as one can get.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister of State will convey my disappointment about this to the Minister, Deputy Harney. We want and deserve action and results. I will not restate how the Celtic tiger has not come to our area etc. but, unfortunately, that is the sad reality. Longford has lost 300 jobs in the last 12 months which in any language is a major disappointment which needs to be acted upon. I will continue to press this matter until we see action and results.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter on the adjournment. As Minister of State, I will convey the views of the Deputy to the Tánaiste and I regret she could not be here in person. I share responsibility and will be glad to answer the matter raised. The Tánaiste and I share fully the Deputy's concern and disappointment over the recent decision by IEC Electronics to discontinue <Col N="1244" /> operations in Longford. I am conscious of the effect which this will have on Longford and most immediately on the employees concerned.</P>
      <P>IEC Electronics Corporation is a US publicly quoted company engaged in the provision of an electronic contract manufacturing service to companies in the electronics industry. It employs over 2,000 worldwide. IEC purchased the Longford plant from Oshima in 1998. The decision to invest in Longford was on the basis of start-up business from Pioneer UK and supplementary business from new customers being developed by IEC. Shortly after the sale, Pioneer decreased its business with IEC. In addition, the development of a viable contract manufacturing business base required far more time than was originally anticipated. IEC continued to aggressively seek new business with the assistance of IDA Ireland. However, IEC has been unable to convert the business to profitability during the past year and continued losses projected for the coming fiscal year led the company to the closure announcement on 1 October 1999.</P>
      <P>IDA Ireland has made contact with senior IEC management in the US and Ireland. IEC has indicated that its preference is to dispose of the plant as a going concern and I am hopeful that it will be successful in its efforts. IDA Ireland will work closely with it in its efforts to secure a potential buyer. However, if this proves to be unsuccessful, the plant will close at the end of 1999. Accordingly, a profile of the Longford facility is being prepared which will be circulated by IDA Ireland to its network of overseas offices to assist in securing a replacement project for the facility.</P>
      <P>This news is a further blow to the community following so closely on the closure earlier this year of Atlantic Mills. In December 1998, in response to the announcement by Atlantic Mills of its intention to close, the Tánaiste set up an inter-agency task force comprising representatives of IDA Ireland, FÁS, Enterprise Ireland, the county enterprise board, Longford County Council, Longford Community Resources and Atlantic Mills. At the request of the Tánaiste, the task force met yesterday to determine a response to the proposed closure of IEC. At that meeting, the company's commitment to co-operate fully with the task force was welcomed. FÁS agreed a programme which will initially identify the skills profile of the workers and in the event that the plant does close, will initiate retraining for suitable job opportunities. IDA Ireland will continue to seek a direct replacement for the plant and will be targeting specific industry areas, that is, sub-supply to the IT industry and the hardware testing industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The State agencies are very active in the Longford region. Longford is a priority town for IDA Ireland and continues to be aggressively promoted for inward investment. Efforts are continuing to find a replacement for the Atlantic Mills facility. FÁS is continuing its work programme with the former workforce. Confidence building programmes are complete and training aspir<Col N="1245" /> ations are being met. Tracking and follow-up are ongoing. IDA Ireland continues to aggressively promote the advance factory in Longford town. Over the past 12 months, a total of 26 companies have visited the factory. Unfortunately, none of the visiting companies have ultimately opted to locate in the Longford factory, despite the very generous grant package and a special low rent and purchase package on offer.</P>
    <P>Employment in Enterprise Ireland aided companies in the county has increased steadily over the last four years from 1,279 in 1995 to 1,734 in 1998. As the Deputy is aware, in June 1998 the Tánaiste officially opened the Key Tech precision engineering facility in Longford which will result in 40 jobs in the manufacture of precision metal components for Irish and overseas industry. In November 1998, she announced the establishment of Longview Technologies Limited, a start-up company which will employ 37 people in the provision of programming and IT consultancy services to the financial services sectors in Ireland, UK and the US. Based in Longford, the project provides opportunities for skilled IT personnel. Enterprise Ireland is at an advanced stage in negotiations with a number of companies in the region and is confident of a positive outcome for the creation of a number of jobs. Given the ongoing efforts of the State agencies, we are confident that the work of the inter agency task force will prove successful.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>I have raised the matter of unemployment in the Athy area on a number of occasions in this House and in the Seanad. Sadly, however, we have not seen any significant action. We have suffered lay-offs in a number of factories and numerous factory closures, including the closure of a knitwear factory in the past few days resulting in the loss of 50 jobs.</P>
      <P>As the Minister of State is aware, I have asked his Department to establish a task force for south Kildare. Task forces in other areas of the country have been very successful when there have been major job losses. Athy and south Kildare have not suffered high profile factory closures such as Seagate in Clonmel or Packard in Tallaght. However, the loss of jobs in my constituency has been gradually increasing for the past 15 years with little or no new investment &ndash; five factories have closed in that period alone. The net effect of these job losses is equivalent to the closure of a Packard or Seagate facility. The people of south Kildare deserve the same official response as the people in towns where factory closures have hit national newspaper headlines and there is an expectation on the Minister to produce a response.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1246" /> I acknowledge the Tánaiste met with Athy UDC and elected representatives of south Kildare and that she played a role in setting up the Athy Forum which is in the process of putting in place a structure which will assist Athy in the future. However, this is not enough. There is a need for the Minister to establish a task force for the area to work in tandem with Athy Forum, the chamber of commerce and other local community groups to attract significant industrial investment to the region. Athy has major advantages for industry. The River Barrow can provide ample water supply for any new industries. Land for industrial development is readily available. One of the best institutes of technology in the country is within 11 miles of Athy and produces excellent skilled graduates. Our secondary schools also have a proud record in giving pupils the skills and qualities necessary in today's labour market. However, at present, these people have to leave the area to find decent employment.</P>
    <P>In tandem with the establishment of a task force, there is a compelling case for Athy to be included in any new decentralisation programme drawn up by the Government. The location of a major Government agency or Department in the town would transform commercial life in Athy and give a much needed economic boost to the region. The fact that no new industry has located in Athy in the past 25 years raises serious questions as regards the commitment of State agencies towards supporting employment and investment in Athy.</P>
    <P>Athy is a marvellous location for any new industry locating in Ireland. However, I cannot understand why no prospective investor has visited the area for some time. I ask the Minister to rectify this situation immediately. Athy and its hinterland needs new industry to replace the constant job losses it has endured in recent years. A task force is a vital element in achieving this goal. I ask the Minister to focus the energies of the various State agencies on working together with the local community and the elected representatives to ensure that investment in employment is brought to the people of Athy as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Deputy's concern at the loss of jobs in Athy following the recent announcement by J. A. Hickey to close its plant in the town. I am assured that Enterprise Ireland made intensive efforts over an extended period to assist the company compete against ever-increasing levels of international competition. However, in the final analysis, despite best efforts by all concerned, the company was faced with a deteriorating market situation and decided it had no choice but to cease operations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite this setback for Athy, I reassure the Deputy that co-ordinated efforts are being made by the industrial development agencies to assist the growth of industry in County Kildare. In this regard, IDA Ireland has been successful in <Col N="1247" /> attracting overseas industry to the county. In particular, key multinational companies in the electronics, health care and pharmaceutical sectors have established significant manufacturing operations in Kildare. Specifically as regards south Kildare, Enterprise Ireland is working intensively with new and existing local industry to assist them in increasing their capability and international competitiveness, thus developing their sales and exports with a view to maintaining and increasing employment.</P>
    <P>I understand a number of initiatives have been developed collaboratively between the local development agencies to arrange specific training and development programmes to cater for the needs of long-term unemployed in Athy. In addition, Enterprise Ireland is working closely with the Athy Investment Development and Employment Forum in examining the issues militating against the establishment and development of industrial undertakings in the south Kildare area. The forum, which was established by Athy Urban District Council, has been operating since the spring of 1998 and comprises representatives of the key State agencies, local development agencies and representatives from Athy Urban District Council and Kildare County Council.</P>
    <P>One of the sub-groups established by the Athy forum was given the task of exploring the possibility of developing either an enterprise centre or an enterprise incubation centre in the town. However, the group which was supported by way of a technical assistance grant from the Kildare County Enterprise Board concluded there was no demand at this time for such a centre in the town. Another working group comprising representatives of a variety of State agencies and local development agencies is looking into the opportunities for training and development and is drawing on expert advice from Maynooth University. Under the auspices of the Athy forum, the local development agencies are compiling an up-to-date socio-economic profile of Athy to establish the full and current socio-economic needs of the town with a view to developing integrated solutions which best respond to such needs.</P>
    <P>IDA Ireland is developing facilities to attract inward investment to the county. Construction of a new advance factory will commence shortly in Athy. In addition to an existing strong base of companies, Newbridge has an advance factory which is being vigorously marketed by IDA Ireland. A number of site visits have taken place so far in 1999. These two facilities will greatly enhance the promotion of the southern region of County Kildare for new investment.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that the industrial development agencies will continue to promote Kildare for both overseas and indigenous investment and will work closely with the Athy forum to ensure that efforts are co-ordinated to secure employment for the area. I have identified the action that has been taken. Against this background, I am satisfied that the establishment of a task force for <Col N="1248" /> this area, as requested by the Deputy, is not justified.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>At approximately 8.50 a.m. yesterday, 5 October, a collision occurred between a passenger train and an articulated milk truck at an unmanned level crossing at Woodfarm, approximately one mile from the village of Dromkeen in County Limerick. The 8.35 a.m train was travelling from Colbert station in Limerick to Limerick Junction when the accident occurred. Some 30 passengers on the train, although shocked by the sudden impact, escaped injury and were able to continue their journey. However, the driver of the truck, Mr. P. J. Bourke from Oola in County Limerick, was not so fortunate. He suffered head injuries and his condition was described as critical in Limerick Regional Hospital. I understand he was transferred to Cork University Hospital this afternoon. I take this opportunity to sympathise with Mr. Bourke, his family and his wide circle of friends.</P>
      <P>The cab of the truck was extensively damaged when it collided with the first carriage of the train and the line was closed for several hours. According to newspaper reports, experts are working on a theory that the unmanned crossing gates, which must remain closed under penalty of prosecution except when they are being used for crossing, had been left open or had not been securely fastened.</P>
      <P>There are 2,000 level crossings in the country and Fine Gael has demanded that these should be upgraded. The A. D. Little report called for an investment of £128 million in level crossings, whereas the Government study through IRMS recommended only £15 million for such upgrading. This accident, however, underscores the necessity for immediate and extensive upgrading of level crossings.</P>
      <P>It is a coincidence that the horrific London rail crash occurred on the same day. The London tragedy is a reminder to everyone that rail travel is not always safe and that when an accident occurs the level of death and injury can be catastrophic. The Minister for Public Enterprise has an obligation to ensure that rail travel in Ireland is safe. However, her actions indicate that she is not taking her responsibility for rail safety as seriously as she should. Everyone who drives a car will appreciate that the difference between a fatal and a non-fatal accident can be slight. The grace of God and a minor circumstance can differentiate between a catastrophe and a non-fatal crash.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister of State to confirm that the accident occurred because of the safety inadequacies of the unmanned crossing. I also ask him if he has received a preliminary report from CIE on this accident and if he is satisfied that an internal inquiry, which has been commenced, is a sufficient response to this accident or if an inquiry under the Transport Act should be instituted. I take this opportunity to thank the gardaí and the <Col N="1249" /> emergency services who were on the scene a short time after being alerted. I wish Mr. P. J. Bourke a speedy recovery.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Noonan for raising this important issue. Before dealing with the substance of this matter, it is appropriate to extend my deep sympathy and best wishes to the driver of the milk truck who was seriously injured in this accident in Limerick yesterday. I am sure everyone joins with me in extending our hopes for a speedy recovery to him and his family.</P>
      <P>We have also been saddened by what was a particularly black day for the railways in the UK yesterday. On my own behalf and on behalf of the Minister for Public Enterprise, I extend my sympathy to the families and friends of those killed and injured in the train crash near Paddington. I am sure everyone agrees that the emergency services involved in the rescue effort should also be commended for their exceptional work in such difficult circumstances. I also commend the efforts of the gardaí and the emergency services in the Limerick incident.</P>
      <P>The accident at Dromkeen took place at approximately 8.50 a.m. on 5 October 1999 when a laden milk truck struck the leading passenger carriage of the 8.35 a.m. Limerick to Limerick Junction passenger train. The collision took place at Woodfarm level crossing, approximately two kilometres from Dromkeen, when the milk truck was attempting to cross the railway line. Iarnród Éireann has informed me that the train driver sounded the train hooter when he saw the truck approaching the level crossing but that the truck driver appeared to be unable to stop the vehicle. The truck subsequently collided with the side of the train. As a result of the collision the driver of the truck sustained serious injuries and was removed to hospital in Limerick. Some damage was caused to the railway carriage hit by the truck while extensive damage was caused to the cab of the truck. Iarnród Éireann says there were no reported injuries to train passengers or crew. However, the railway remained blocked until approximately 11.40 a.m.</P>
      <P>Woodfarm is a user-worked level crossing. This means that it has gates which are normally closed against the road. To access the crossing a driver of a vehicle should, after observing due caution, open both gates before driving the vehicle across. The driver should then go back and close both gates. These instructions are clearly posted on both gates and there are also warning signs on both approaches stating that the crossing is unmanned. The crossing, which is on a public road and ends in a cul-de-sac, is not attended by Iarnród Éireann staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, Iarnród Éireann reports that there have been problems in the past at Woodfarm crossing due to road users persistently leaving the <Col N="1250" /> gates open. In the normal course of events, there are approximately five regular users of this crossing and Iarnród Éireann has in the recent past taken steps to address the problem of misuse of the crossing by directly informing the users of the risks inherent in not taking the necessary precautions in closing the gates after crossing.</P>
    <P>A railway inspecting officer from my Department was informed of the collision at approximately 10 a.m. yesterday and travelled immediately to the site of the accident. Inspectors from the Health and Safety Authority were also present. The railway inspecting officer is now preparing a full report of the accident for the Minister and Iarnród Éireann has already commenced its own internal inquiry.</P>

      <P>Medical card holders should not be charged £25 for receiving the anti-influenza injection from their general practitioners. They are the meat in the sandwich, so to speak, in the row between the Department of Health and Children and the general practitioners. This should not happen particularly as this is the year of the older person. If there is a serious 'flu epidemic this winter, it could cause serious hardship to many medical card holders who are elderly. It could even be worse than hardship, depending on the seriousness of the outbreak. The cost to the State of the possible hospitalisation of some of these people would be increased.</P>
      <P>It is penny wise and pound foolish and, at the same time, grossly unfair to medical card holders. I ask the Minister of State to ensure that either the Minister or his representatives deal with this problem with the doctors and ensure the people who cannot afford to pay for medical care, which is why they have medical cards, are not deprived of the anti-influenza injection.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Browne for raising this matter on the Adjournment. On behalf of the Minister for Health and Children, I wish to take this opportunity to set out the position in relation to this important issue.</P>
      <P>Annual vaccination against influenza of all older people and others who are at risk is an effective way of reducing infection, associated illnesses, hospitalisation and mortality. Influenza outbreaks occur virtually every year. Global epidemics or pandemics occur approximately every ten to 15 years and it is therefore important that vulnerable groups are vaccinated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1251" /> Each autumn the health boards purchase a quantity of influenza vaccine for provision to at-risk persons with medical cards. In 1998 the quantity purchased was increased by 100,000 doses to approximately 300,000 doses and a similar quantity has been purchased this year. The strains against which the vaccine should protect are recommended each year by the World Health Organisation and the vaccine purchased is in accordance with its advice in this regard.</P>
    <P>Up to this year this vaccine was given to medical card holders by their general practitioners as part of the service covered by the capitation payment they receive for medical card patients. The Irish Medical Organisation has sought a specific payment for providing the vaccine to medical card holders. There is no funding in the 1999 Esti<Col N="1252" /> mates for the payment of such a fee to general practitioners. This matter was the subject of discussion between the Health Services Employers Agency and the Irish Medical Organisation on 9 September. The Irish Medical Organisation subsequently indicated that it had advised its members to charge GMS patients for administration of the vaccine.</P>
    <P>A further meeting between the Health Service Employers' Agency and the Irish Medical Organisation has been arranged for tomorrow morning, Thursday, 7 October. I do not consider that I should comment any further on this matter pending the outcome of this meeting. However, I share the Deputy's concern in relation to this matter, particularly as we are approaching the season where influenza may become prevalent.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 to 18, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>Social partnership has played a hugely significant role on the transformation of Ireland over the past decade &ndash; in both economic and social inclusion terms. The Government is deeply committed to the process, as exemplified by the latest progress report on Partnership 2000 which has been placed in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>The development of the partnership model has been a priority and this is, perhaps, most clearly illustrated by the wide-ranging and systematic monitoring mechanisms in place and the establishment of the National Centre for Partnership. The further development of the model in the years ahead remains a priority, particularly in terms of deepening partnership at the enterprise level but, for that to happen, there must be confidence on the part of all participants that the terms agreed will in fact apply.</P>
      <P>Against that general background, the Tánaiste, the Minister for Finance and I met with representatives of IBEC and ICTU separately on 13 September. We conveyed the Government's concern at the apparent willingness of some groups to substitute strikes and industrial conflict for the partnership approach and a corresponding concern that the terms of Partnership 2000 should be honoured fully by all sides. We emphasised that the Government has honoured the terms of the present and previous partnership agreements &ndash; especially in the area of public service pay.</P>
      <P>It is clear that IBEC and ICTU share the Government's view that social partnership has delivered substantially in terms of employment creation, higher living standards across the board, better public services, and improved public finances.</P>
      <P>In our meeting with ICTU specifically, it was agreed that social partnership is only possible in a climate of trust, based on the honouring of commitments. It was further agreed that, in the present context, developments in any part of the public service cannot be viewed in isolation, but will have direct implications for pay and conditions generally, through established relativities. This reinforces the importance of developing a new framework for the management of public service pay in its entirety. My recent address to the National Centre for Partnership was anchored on these points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was also agreed with ICTU that social partnership could evolve to support a continuing improvement in living standards &ndash; keeping the benefits of a high value-added, high income and socially inclusive economy. It was further agreed that discussions on the shape of a renewed model of social partnership, to succeed Partnership 2000, would continue. These would include the shaping of a consensus through the forthcoming NESC strategy report, the continuing talks on a <Col N="1255" /> new framework for managing public service pay and the radical investment programme set out in the national development plan. In that context, the Tánaiste, the Minister for Finance and myself are engaged in a final round of consultations with the social partners on the plan which will represent an important building block for the next stage of social partnership.</P>
    <P>Regarding the July plenary meeting of Partnership 2000, the main item on the agenda was an overview assessment of progress on social inclusion. The principal areas covered were unemployment, educational disadvantage, income adequacy, urban disadvantage, rural poverty and equality issues. Further meetings under the present partnership agreement are planned &ndash; the social partners met in secretariat format on Wednesday last and will meet in plenary mode at the end of this month to review overall implementation, including from the perspective of the next budget.</P>
    <P>In response to Deputy Bruton's question on the National Competitiveness Council, I met with the chairman and a number of members of the council on 13 July. The members briefed me on papers they had prepared on the issues of social cohesion, telecommunications and e-commerce, and skills. This was one of a series of meetings between the council and relevant Ministers.</P>
    <P>Subsequently, on 13 September, the Competitiveness Council published a Statement on Social Partnership which concludes that &lsquo;social partnership has been central to the significant social and economic progress made in Ireland over the past ten years'. The council believes it is essential that formal partnership agreements be maintained and has identified a number of issues pivotal to Ireland's international competitiveness which need to be addressed in a new agreement. I share the council's views in this regard.</P>
    <P>As regards the work programme of the NESC, I understand that this will be settled by the council on the completion of its strategy report at the end of this month. The council and the NESF are now sharing premises and support services. I expect that the legislation to place both bodies and their shared support structure on a statutory basis will be published before the end of this session.</P>

      <P>As I informed the Deputy previously, the Government announced on 13 October last that it had agreed to commission a feasibility study for the development of a stadium for the new century and appointed a stadium ste<Col N="1256" /> ering committee to oversee the process. A consortium of consultants led by PricewaterhouseCoopers was appointed to conduct the feasibility study. I understand the study has just been completed and has been presented to the stadium steering committee. On receipt of the study from the steering committee, I intend to bring it at an early date to Government for consideration and decision.</P>
      <P>The nature of this high prestige initiative is such that it requires cross-departmental and cross-organisational co-ordination and my Department is best placed to do that. There is a significant time commitment involved and the official who acts as secretary of the stadium steering committee has undertaken this task in addition to his normal duties. In addition to the administrative costs arising from the work of the stadium steering committee, the main cost to my Department will be that of the feasibility study which is IR£380,033 or 485,542 euro.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 20 and 21 together.</P>
      <P>The information society represents enormous opportunities and challenges for Ireland. The Government is keenly aware of the importance of ensuring that Ireland takes full advantage of modern information and communications technologies, or ICTs, both in the fields of e-commerce and e-government. We need to respond quickly to make sure that the benefits of the information society are availed of by Irish citizens and Irish businesses.</P>
      <P>That is reflected in the Government's action plan on the Information Society &ndash; published earlier this year and also accessible on my Department's website.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the recommendations of the action plan, implementation is monitored and guided by an interdepartmental group, with representation at assistant secretary general level, and by a four person team. This latter group,   the Information Society policy development team, works closely with CMOD in the Department of Finance and liaises as appropriate with other expertise elsewhere in the civil and public service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The team, the full complement of which has only been in place since summer, has produced a progress report on the action plan; worked with <Col N="1257" /> Departments to identify resource requirements for action plan projects for the remainder of 1999; and prepared draft guidelines for Government websites &ndash; to be issued this month, following consultation with Departments. The current main focus is on assessing resource requirements for action plan projects.</P>
    <P>In July, the Government agreed to the interim allocation of approximately £7.7 million for projects arising under the action plan for the remainder of 1999 &ndash; subject to the assessment process. These include projects to provide Internet access to the public through the local library network; electronic filing of tax returns, and Netd@ys, an Information Society Commission initiative to promote Internet awareness. I am circulating in the official report a full list of the projects to which this funding relates.</P>
    <P>I would clarify that this funding will be man<Col N="1258" /> aged by the Department of Finance, not by the Information Society Commission. The Information Society Commission will, like other Departments and agencies, be allocated funding in respect of particular initiatives for which it is responsible under the action plan.</P>
    <P>This funding relates only to anticipated expenditure on the projects in question to the end of 1999. Projects in question must be assessed and approved by an evaluation team which includes representation from the Department of Finance and my Department. The evaluation process is under way at present.</P>
    <P>In approving funding for 1999, the Government also agreed in principle to further substantial expenditure on information society projects over the coming years. The amount of expenditure required is currently being assessed with a view to determining requirements for the 2000 Estimates.</P>

      <P>Netd@ys is an annual, international initiative to promote the effective use of interactive media in learning and teaching. In previous years, the initiative has been co-ordinated in schools in Ireland by the National Centre for Technology in Education. This year, the Information Society Commission has teamed up with the NCTE to expand on the activities of previous years by involving not just the schools but the community at large.</P>
      <P>Netd@ys 1999 will run from 13 to 21 November. Schools, libraries and other commercial and voluntary organisations are being encouraged to open their doors to the public over that period so that people can access and learn about the Internet. The commission has also hired five mobile computer laboratories &ndash; or computer gyms, as they are known &ndash; which will be located at various places around the country to provide additional access points for the public.</P>
      <P>Information material is being developed by the commission, in conjunction with the NCTE, to assist organisations participating in the initiative. Special information packs are also being prepared specifically for schools, which will include suggested ways of involving the broader community in the initiative.</P>
      <P>The Information Society Commission will also launch a millennium project &ndash;&ldquo;eWish for a new millennium&rdquo;&ndash; to encourage people to access a special website and to record their personal wish for Ireland as we enter the new millennium. In this way, a permanent record of the wishes of the Irish people will be created and a representative selection will be published on CD and on the Internet.</P>
      <P>In addition to a contribution of £150,000 by the Government towards the Netd@ys initiative, the commission has also secured sponsorship from Eircom to help with the costs of the school packs, hiring the computer gyms and advertising, and RTÉ has agreed to become a broadcast sponsor.</P>

      <P>The intranet for the Government secretariat will enable Ministers' offices to establish an electronic link with the secretariat. The first issue, which is being addressed at present, is to identify the appropriate electronic security to safeguard documents being transmitted electronically. These security features will in turn determine the computer and communications infrastructure on which the intranet will be based.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1260" /> Designing and implementing the intranet will also involve a re-appraisal of the existing manual methods for dealing with what is an almost exclusively paper based system. The aim is to exploit the potential of the available communications and computing technology to allow for the electronic submission of documents, for streamlining the consultation processes which are part of Government procedures, and for the transmission of Government memoranda, agendas and decisions. Consultations will be held with Departments in due course on the development of new processes and procedures which will be required. The intranet is intended primarily to provide facilities for Ministers' offices to link and conduct business electronically with the Government secretariat.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 24 to 26, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995, deals comprehensively with the matter of gifts to officeholders. Section 15 of the Act provides that gifts which exceed £500 in value and which are given to an officeholder by virtue of office be deemed to be gifts to the State. In these circumstances the gift, or in certain circumstances its value, is transferred to State Custody or the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>The Act expressly exempts gifts given by a friend or relation of the recipient for personal reasons only.</P>
      <P>Government guidelines prepared in accordance with section 15 (4) of the Act provide that all officeholders are expected to adhere to the fundamental principle that an offer of gifts, hospitality or services should not be accepted where it would, or might appear to, place him or her under an obligation. The guidelines go on to make specific provision for dealing with such matters. Again the guidelines provide that the supply of property or services below £500 in value or made for personal reasons by a friend or relative are exempt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995, each Member of Dáil Éireann and Seanad <Col N="1261" /> Éireann must make an annual statement of registrable interests. Registrable interests excludes living accommodation etc. supplied by a relation or friend of the person for personal reasons only, unless its acceptance might reasonably be seen to have been capable of influencing him or her in the performance of functions as a member, officeholder, etc. The Cabinet Handbook refers to the statutory requirements and contains a copy of the guidelines to which I have already referred.</P>
    <P>It is evident that the treatment of gifts is addressed comprehensively in the statutory framework and the steps to be taken in different circumstances are clearly specified. The Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995, was a long time in preparation and strikes a fine balance between the right of individuals to have personal lives and the need for accountability in the conduct of official business. I regard the balance struck as appropriate. I have no proposals by way of fresh legislation or addition to the Cabinet Handbook which would interfere with the balance so painstakingly established in the Act.</P>

      <P>As I mentioned in the House in reply to a similar question on 12 May last, I asked Departments to report to me on proposals for constitutional amendments in relation to their functional areas of responsibility arising from the recommendations of the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution and from the Programme for Government. My Department is currently examining the responses received from other Departments and is considering how proposals for constitutional amendments might best be brought forward in a structured and consolidated way. I intend to report to Government on this matter at an early date.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 29 to 31, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The report of the public prosecution system study group has been considered by Government and presented to the Houses of the Oireachtas. The Government has accepted the study group's key conclusion and recommendation that the present prosecution system should not be replaced by a unified system but should be enhanced to improve co-ordination and effectiveness. Among the recommendations in the report are the transfer of responsibility for the criminal division of the CSSO and the State Solicitor service to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions. The Government has accepted this in principle and implementation will be agreed by the Minister for Finance and the Attorney General. The report also contained a number of recommendations designed to improve the information and communication capabilities of the system and these will take place over time.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Victims' Charter which was recently published by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. In relation to the Offices of the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Chief State Solicitor, the charter reflects the practice of these offices for many years. The charter will have the effect of formalising this practice and will generally make the public more aware of the services provided. This may involve an increase in the demand for such services and any resulting staffing and administrative issues will be addressed as the need arises.</P>

      <P>Following approval by the Government of the report of the interdepartmental committee on the protection of classified official information, the Department of Finance issued guidelines for Departments in October 1998. In accordance with those guidelines, it is a matter for each Department to adopt procedures to preserve the confidentiality of its classified documents. The procedures to be adopted would vary from Department to Department and from division to division within Departments, depending upon the nature of individual records, the reason for classification, the number of people who must have access, the frequency of access, etc.</P>
      <P>The guidelines were brought to the attention of heads of divisions in my Department in November 1998. In accordance with the requirements of the Finance circular, a review at assistant secretary level of the amount of, and necessity for, material classified as &ldquo;top secret&rdquo; will be undertaken shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1265" /> Overall, and having regard to modern developments in this area such as the Freedom of Information Act, the intent of the Finance circular was to keep the number of documents to be designated &ldquo;top secret&rdquo; to an absolute minimum, to restrict their circulation and to ensure appropriate arrangements for their safekeeping. Documents to be classified in this way would be of a type whose release would: put at risk the life or safety of any individual, pose a serious threat to security, defence or international relations, undermine the police or judicial processes involved in dealing with serious crime, adversely affect developments in relation to Northern Ireland, and pose a serious risk to the economic interests of the State.</P>
    <P>Access to &ldquo;secret&rdquo; documents in my office is very restricted. My private secretary retains all documents of this nature in a locked safe if they are not in my personal possession. Certain senior staff in my Department and certain of my senior advisers see some documents but only on a need to know basis. They are individually responsible for such documents while they are in their possession.</P>
    <P>In the case of the report of the authorised officer in the Ansbacher affair the report was sent to my private secretary and marked strictly private and confidential. The last paragraph of the covering letter indicated that the material enclosed was to be retained in strict conditions of secrecy under the Companies Act. In the circumstances I instructed my private secretary to place it in the safe in my office and it remained there ever since under my direct control. I did not, in this instance, circulate it or give a copy of it to any of my officials or advisers.</P>

      <P>Lead responsibility for the policy function on the social economy is a matter for my colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. My Department was represented on the social economy working group set up by the Tánaiste under Partnership 2000 to undertake a detailed examination of the potential of the social economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government in July 1999 approved the introduction of a social economy programme through the phasing in of a dedicated social economy programme with effect from 1999 and the establishment of a national monitoring committee representative of the social partners to oversee the development and implementation of the social economy programme. My Department will be represented on the monitoring committee. The intention of the social economy programme is to <Col N="1266" /> support imaginative, locally based initiatives in disadvantaged communities.</P>
    <P>This Government is committed to a strategic approach to poverty and social inclusion. Investment in community development and capacity building is a key priority to ensure that socially excluded groups and local communities can be active participants in identifying and meeting their own development needs. The national anti-poverty strategy was published in April 1997. The strategy set out to reduce poverty and social inclusion both in general and in a number of key policy areas. Immediately on taking up Government, we established a Cabinet committee on social inclusion to deal with issues of poverty and social inclusion. To date great progress has been made in meeting targets set out in the strategy. One of the Government's key objectives is the building of an inclusive society and this objective will be reflected in the contents of the National Development Plan, to which my Department &ndash; along with other Departments &ndash; has contributed.</P>
    <P>The National Development Plan is currently being finalised and it would be not be appropriate for me to discuss the specific contents at this stage. However, I can assure the Deputy that the social economy and social inclusion will be priorities in the context of the National Development Plan. The plan will also address the specific needs of the regions.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for the administration of the disabled person's maintenance allowance transferred from the health boards to my Department on 2 October 1996 when the allowance was renamed disability allowance. At that stage a total of 34,500 persons formerly in receipt of disabled person's maintenance allowance became entitled to disability allowance. In the three years to date, the number of recipients has increased by over 40 per cent or some 15,000 to just under 49,500. This is evidence of the improvement which has been brought about in the provision for those at whom this scheme is directed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the scheme was introduced, the transitional arrangements provided, <i>inter alia</i>, that the rate of disability allowance would be no less favourable than the rate of disabled person's maintenance allowance at the date of transfer. These arrangements facilitated the transfer of beneficiaries from one scheme to the other without having to apply under the new scheme and without interruption of payment. They did not <Col N="1267" /> confer ongoing rights in cases where the medical condition of the applicant would not justify ongoing entitlement or where there was a material change in the recipients circumstances.</P>
    <P>Continuing entitlement under the disability allowance scheme is dependent on the person satisfying both a means test and the medical eligibility criteria and this is assessed through a process of periodic review. Since the inception of the disability allowance scheme, some 28,900 claims have been reviewed, of whom 27,400 had transferred from disabled person's maintenance allowance and 1,500 had not. The position in relation to the former is that 37 have had their allowance terminated on the grounds that they no longer satisfy the medical criteria for receipt of disability allowance, 446 had their allowances reduced and 399 had their entitlement terminated because of changes in their means. In all such cases the persons concerned were informed of the decision, the reasons for it, and duly advised of their right of appeal to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.</P>

      <P>I am very aware of the valuable work being done by community development projects on the ground. Since coming to office in 1997, I have increased the annual budget for the community development projects from £5.6 million in that year to £7.986 million currently. Support for community development continues to be an integral part of the Government's overall social and economic development strategy. Community development is the means by which the capacity of disadvantaged local communities and communities of interest to participate in mainstream development initiatives is increased.</P>
      <P>The community development programme is a part of the overall framework of support for community development and family support groups provided by my Department. Support under these schemes ranges from small, once-off grants to three-year, renewable funding commitments under three main community development support programmes. These programmes are the community development programme, family and community services resource centre programme, core funded community and family support groups programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure the Deputy will understand that I am not in a position to announce, in advance of negotiations actually opening on a successor agreement to Partnership 2000, my detailed position in those negotiations. However, I will say that these individual programmes need to be <Col N="1268" /> regarded as part of an overall package, rather than being treated in isolation in that or any other context.</P>
    <P>I can also inform the House that I will be mindful of a number of different issues in looking at the further development of these community development support programmes. Firstly, there is a need to strengthen the existing support structures within the programme in line with the expansion in the number of projects that is already taking place &ndash; some 40 additional community development projects and 60 additional family resource centre projects coming on stream shortly. Secondly, there is a need to enhance the capacity of existing projects operating successfully at local level to have a real impact on the quality of life of the most disadvantaged communities.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, it is important that there continues to be a focus in these programmes on the most marginalised in society. This latter point emphasises the importance in reaching out to specific communities of interest experiencing poverty and marginalisation, as well as geographical communities in need not currently supported under these community development programmes. Finally, I am concerned to ensure greater synergy between these programmes and other economic and social development initiatives operating locally, the current programme for local urban and rural development, in the context of the development of the next National Development Plan and community support framework for 2000-2006.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 52 and 58 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recommendation to which the Deputy refers was contained in the report of an interdepartmental committee which was published in August of this year. The committee was established in 1996 under the aegis of the Department of the Environment and Local Government, with representatives from that Department and from the Departments of Health and Children, Finance <Col N="1269" /> and Social, Community and Family Affairs. Its brief was to consider the issues arising in the transfer of the administration of rent and mortgage interest supplements under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme and to make recommendations.</P>
    <P>The Government has considered the interdepartmental committee's report and has decided in principle to implement its main recommendations.</P>
    <P>It is not intended to transfer the present rent supplement scheme to the local authorities. Instead, a new rent assistance scheme will be put in place, operated by the local authorities, to serve people with long-term housing needs, including those who currently rely on SWA rent supplements on a long-term basis. Income support elements of the SWA scheme, including assistance with rent costs on a short-term basis, will continue to be met though the social welfare system.</P>
    <P>The Government has asked my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, to submit detailed proposals for the new scheme so that final decisions on the implementation of the new arrangements can be taken. It is expected that this will take about six months and a further two year time frame is envisaged for introducing the new arrangements once the detailed proposals have been agreed. This will deliver an important element of the Government's An Action Programme for the Millennium, which commits the Government to the maximum co-ordination of housing policy under one Department.</P>
    <P>The second Bacon report, published by my colleague the Minister for the Environment and Local Government in March 1999, found that rents have been rising in line with trends in house prices. The report concluded that this reflects excess demand for accommodation generally and the optimal course of action is to expand supply.</P>
    <P>The provision of new allowances for employed persons in private rented accommodation would not help to increase the supply of such accommodation. To introduce a housing allowance in the context of excess demand in the housing market generally would be likely to give rise to further increases in rent levels.</P>

      <P>As part of the budgetary process, my Department organises a pre-budget forum annually for voluntary organisations representing the welfare interests of a wide variety of people in Irish society including the elderly, people with disabilities, widows and widowers, lone parents, unemployed people, carers and family support groups. The forum gives these organ<Col N="1270" /> isations the opportunity to have a meaningful input into the budgetary process by ensuring that both I and my officials are fully appraised of their views, concerns and priorities in relation to social welfare improvements.</P>
      <P>There was strong consensus among the various organisations attending the forum that this year's budget should share the benefits of economic growth with the poor and those on low incomes. The costs of the main proposals submitted amount to over £2 billion on a full year basis.</P>
      <P>The establishment of an inclusive society, where all citizens have the opportunity and the incentive to participate fully in the social and economic life of the country, is a fundamental objective of this Government. In formulating proposals for inclusion in the 2000 budget, therefore, the Government will be endeavouring to ensure that the benefits of economic growth are invested in our social infrastructure to bring our social services up to the best standards.</P>
      <P>The Government's action programme contains a wide range of commitments relating to the areas for which I have responsibility, including commitments to provide for substantial increases in social welfare payment rates, including increasing the old age pension to £100 per week over a five year period; to progressively relax the qualifying criteria for the carer's allowance to ensure that more carers get the benefit; to refocus the tax and welfare system in favour of the family unit; to establish a national mediation service; and to implement the report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities, including an overhaul of the means by which the State supports the incomes of people with disabilities.</P>
      <P>As a result of the improvements provided for in the last two budgets, substantial progress has already been made in relation to many of the above commitments. For instance, the £6 per week increase for pensioners provided in last year's budget means that, in the two years since taking office, the Government has moved half way towards meeting its commitment to increase the old age contributory pension to £100 per week by the year 2002. The full year cost of all the 1999 improvements was a record £316 million.</P>
      <P>My priorities for budget 2000 will include making further progress towards implementing the various programme commitments outlined above and responding where possible to the various concerns brought to my attention during the course of the budget process, having regard to the available resources.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 54 and 62 together.</P>
      <P>Non-contributory pensions are means-tested assistance payments and, as such, all income, including income from other pensions, is assessable as means. An Irish non-contributory pensioner whose means increase for any reason is obliged to inform my Department so that the rate of pension may be adjusted if necessary.</P>
      <P>As part of its ongoing programme of control measures the Department periodically reviews the means of non-contributory pensioners.</P>
      <P>This year a review of widow and widower non-contributory pensioners who are also in receipt of other pensions is being conducted. Approximately 850 pensioners who are also in receipt of a British widows or British retirement pension are having their entitlement reviewed. In the course of those reviews any other changes in circumstances which may affect the pension entitlement will also be taken into account.</P>
      <P>There are some 1,555 widows receiving mean-tested widow's non-contributory pension who are also in receipt of British widows or British retirement pension. So far this year reviews have been completed in respect of 574 of these cases, with 542 cases resulting in a reduction in pension entitlement. The total saving of pension payments arising from the cases reviewed to date is £475,000. The average reduction in payment is £13 a week. Eighty three per cent of reductions were less than £20 a week. The maximum reduction in one case was £65.50.</P>
      <P>These reviews arise from the need to ensure that pensioners are receiving their correct entitlements. Pensioners are obliged, under the legislation, to report changes in their means. The reductions to which I have referred arise directly from increases over a number of years in means deriving from other pensions, increases which were not reported to my Department.</P>
      <P>Failure to report such increases in other pensions as they occur leads to significant reductions in the means-tested pensions payable by my Department when entitlements are periodically reviewed. Pensioners who do report such changes in their means as they arise have their entitlements reviewed more frequently and will experience regular but smaller adjustments.</P>

      <P>The Comhairle Bill will establish a new agency, to be known as Comhairle, which will be responsible for the provision of independent information, advice and advocacy services throughout the country. This new agency will combine the National Social Service Board with relevant functions of the National Rehabilitation Board. This move towards a new integrated agency follows a Government decision to replace the NRB with a new national disability authority and to transfer certain functions to a number of Departments-agencies providing mainstream services to the community.</P>
      <P>The improvement of information and support services for people with disabilities was among the key recommendations contained in the Report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities. The establishment of Comhairle will ensure that services for people with disabilities will become an integral part of an enhanced mainstream information, advice and advocacy service for all citizens, building on the resources and expertise of both existing organisations.</P>
      <P>This new agency will incorporate the resources of the NSSB and the relevant areas of the NRB and will support the provision of information throughout the country using the existing network of 85 citizen information centres and, as appropriate, facilities currently operated under the aegis of the NRB. The drafting of the necessary legislation is now almost complete and I intend to bring the Comhairle Bill before the House shortly.</P>
      <P>My Department has provided grants on an annual basis to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions (ICTU) towards the cost of a central unit supporting a network of centres for the unemployed throughout the country. These centres have traditionally operated as an independent network providing a range of services, including information and advice, to people out of work.</P>
      <P>The new agency, Comhairle, will continue the role of the NSSB in supporting and developing the capacity of the independent information sector in meeting the information, advice and advocacy needs of all citizens at local level. This is currently achieved by providing a range of services e.g. information and training, for the support and development of the independent information sector. It will include a continuation of the strong links that already exist with a variety of organisations such as area partnerships, youth information services and centres for the unemployed. The board of Comhairle will be happy to consider any proposals for closer co-operation with other organisations, including any potential for integration of services leading to improvements in the delivery of information and advice at local level.</P>

      <P>The bonus payment was first introduced in December 1980 as a double payment &ndash; 100 per cent bonus &ndash; and continued at that level until 1984. Lower levels of payment applied during the period 1985 to 1988. In 1989 it was pitched at 70 per cent and has remained at that level since.</P>
      <P>An amount of £42 million is provided in my Department's 1999 Estimates to provide for payment of a Christmas bonus for approximately 715,000 recipients of long-term social welfare payments. This estimate is based on the payment of a bonus in 1999 similar to the bonus paid in 1998 and earlier years i.e. 70 per cent of the person's normal weekly payment subject to a minimum payment of £20.</P>
      <P>The bonus will be paid to recipients of disablement pension; death benefit, by way of pension, old age contributory and non-contributory pension; retirement pension; invalidity pension; widow's and widower's non-contributory pension; orphan's contributory and non-contributory pension; pre-retirement allowance; blind pension; carer's allowance; one parent family payment; unemployment assistance at the long-term rate; disability allowance; farm assist; payments to people formerly in receipt of deserted wife's benefit and allowance and prisoner's wife's allowance.</P>
      <P>The Christmas bonus is payable to recipients of long-term social welfare schemes. Any change in the amount of the bonus or in the categories of persons to whom it is paid would have substantial cost implications and would have to be considered in the context of other priorities and commitments.</P>

      <P>The information requested by the Deputy is not readily available as it would require a very extensive trawl of the computer-based records system of my Department which could not be completed within the timeframe available for answer of this question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, indicative figures regarding the PRSI status of persons employed in the public service are available. These are outlined in the tables which I am making available to the Deputy. The tables show the numbers of persons employed in the public service, the commercial state sector and the total public sector in the period from 1995 to 1999 inclusive, and the number of PRSI contributors who paid PRSI at the modified rates <Col N="1274" /> applicable to the public sector in the contribution years 1994-95 to 1997-98 inclusive.</P>
    <P>The tables show that, as at January 1998, there were more than 280,000 persons employed in the public sector, of which around 160,000 paid modified rate PRSI. Accordingly, the balance, approximately 120,000 employees, were paying PRSI at the full rate.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, all new employees recruited to the public service after 5 April 1995 are subject to full PRSI rates. Prior to that date, permanent and pensionable employees in the public service, including civil servants, public servants and employees of public authorities were insurable at modified PRSI rates. These persons continue to pay PRSI at the modified rates provided there has been no break in their service. These modified rates provide cover for a limited range of social insurance benefits.</P>
    <P>Employees in the public sector, who do not pay PRSI at modified rates, pay PRSI at the full rate and are covered for the full range of social insurance benefits. The numbers of public sector employees paying full rate PRSI has increased since 1995 and will continue to increase as modified rate contributors retire or leave the public service for other reasons.</P>
    <P>If the Deputy requires further information regarding the PRSI status of persons in the public sector generally or in specific areas of the public sector, I will arrange for my Department to supply same in due course.</P>

      <P>Provision was made in 1974 that, where a pensioner dies, the deceased person's pension continues to be paid to the surviving spouse in respect of the six week period following the death. Where entitlement exists to the six weeks after death benefits, payment is normally issued to a widow(er) within one week of receipt in my Department of notice of date of death and the deceased person's pension book. The payment is made in one cheque covering the six week period. In all over 7,000 cases are dealt with in a year and the system is operating satisfactorily.</P>
      <P>In a high proportion of cases, the pension in payment to the deceased will have been paid by means of a pension book which may only be cashed by the pensioner. On the death of the pensioner, continued payment cannot be made on this book which must be returned for cancellation and replacement by a cheque for the six week period.</P>
      <P>A widow or widower can return the pension book of the deceased spouse to my Department through the local post office network or the nearest local office of the Department or directly to the appropriate headquarters office of my Department.</P>
      <P>The person may also contact their local social welfare office for advice on the documentation needed and the staff will do all they can to ensure the speedy issue of payments due.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To facilitate the transaction of this and other business at local level, continuing development of local offices is planned to ensure that people have improved access to services, better privacy facilities, better information and speedy attention to <Col N="1276" /> meet their needs. At the same time, ways of improving access and transacting more business by telephone are under consideration.</P>
    <P>In many cases the surviving spouse of a deceased pensioner will have an automatic entitlement to a contributory widows/widowers pension, and in that case, payment of pension normally commences immediately after the six weeks after death payment ceases.</P>
    <P>Where my Department is notified of the death of a qualified pensioner a claim for bereavement grant is automatically initiated by my Department. Since 2 February 1999 the bereavement grant scheme has also been significantly improved by increasing the amount payable from £100 to £500 and easing the qualifying conditions. This improvement, at the cost of £10 million a year, is of significant benefit to bereaved families.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>While the ESRI report, Monitoring Poverty Trends, indicated that there was some increase in the numbers falling below relative income poverty lines between 1994 and 1997, a central finding was that there was a sharp reduction in consistent poverty, as targeted by the national anti-poverty strategy, over the period. In fact, the number of households experiencing consistent poverty fell from 9 per cent &ndash; 15 per cent of the population in 1994 to 7 per cent &ndash; 10 per cent in 1997.</P>
      <P>This welcome fall is the direct result of sustained real increases in social welfare rates which have increased the buying power of all households leading to a sharp reduction in deprivation. For example, between 1995 and 1998, social welfare payments increased by some 13 per cent to 14 per cent compared to a total rise in the Consumer Price Index of less than 6 per cent over the same period. This policy has been continued under the present Government with all social welfare payments having been increased so that they are now at or above the minimum rates recommended by the commission on social welfare, meeting a key objective of both the NAPS and Partnership 2000. This is complemented by the success of the Government's employment strategy which has led to unemployment standing at a record low, a key contributor to reductions in poverty in recent years, including falls in child poverty. Since this Government has come into office the live register has dropped by 70,000, 27 per cent, and an estimated 160,000 net new jobs have been created since 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The future direction of social welfare rates generally is a matter which is under continuing consideration within my Department, particularly now that the minimum rates as recommended by <Col N="1277" /> the Commission on Social Welfare have been achieved. The research presented in Monitoring Poverty Trends, as well as other research including the ESRI's Review of the Commission on Social Welfare's Minimum Adequate Income, the National Pension Policy Initiative's Securing Retirement Income, various publications from the Combat Poverty Agency and a forthcoming strategy document from the National Economic and Social Council will all have an important role to play in the formulation of a future policy direction in this regard. Such consideration will include examination of the implications of social welfare indexation.</P>
    <P>It is important to bear in mind that there is a very real difference between earnings and income, with average household income levels also being influenced by employment levels, social welfare payment levels, numbers of two-earner households, etc. in addition to wages. In circumstances where average household incomes increase faster than average earnings, there is a possibility that social welfare increases of this magnitude might result in problems regarding incentives to employment in the future. As such, it is essential that the full implications, including employment and budgetary considerations, of all the options would be teased out before any final decisions can be made.</P>
    <P>It may also be that there are some methodological issues which have to be addressed in this context. Specifically there is no readily available index of average household incomes as there is, for example, for inflation and average industrial earnings. At present, information on average household incomes is only available following analysis of the living in Ireland surveys and is subject to, at least, a two year time lag. While the ESRI have produced forecasts of average incomes using the SWITCH model, the question of producing regular, timely and accurate data relating to average household incomes would have to be addressed before this could be used as a base measurement for any payments.</P>

      <Quest>his views on the replacement of family income supplement with a comprehensive family tax credit scheme which can enable long-term unemployment assistance recipients with dependent children to secure a permanent net profit from re-entering employment with particular preference to child dependant allowances.</Quest>

      <P>The family income supplement scheme provides an incentive to low-paid employees with families to take up or remain in full-time employment by ensuring that such people are better off than they would be if they were instead relying on welfare payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been suggested that the replacement of FIS with a system of tax credits would ease the take-up problems associated with FIS and could ensure that all eligible families would automati<Col N="1278" /> cally receive the payment. There are, however, a number of difficulties associated with this approach which would need to be addressed.</P>
    <P>First, a substantial number of FIS claimants have income which comes below the tax exemption limits appropriate to their family size. In order for such families to benefit from a tax credits system the payment would have to take the form of a refundable tax credit. Refundable tax credits are not a feature of the current tax system here and the practicalities of introducing such payments would require further consideration.</P>
    <P>Second, entitlement to FIS is not determined solely on the basis of the claimant's earnings. Account is also taken, for instance, of family size, hours worked, the likely duration of employment, as well as any earnings which the spouse or partner of the claimant, where relevant, may have. Not all of this information is collected at present through tax returns made to the Revenue Commissioners, and the tax system is therefore not currently capable of automatically identifying the households with an entitlement to FIS. Any payment through the tax system would therefore still have to operate on the basis of the individual in the first instance supplying the additional information needed to establish entitlement to the payment.</P>
    <P>A third area to be addressed relates to the nature of the payment. FIS is a weekly payment which is paid on a current-year basis. In the USA, for example, where a system of earned income tax credits operates, payment is generally received in the form of a tax refund after the end of the year. While there is provision for an advance payment option enabling employers to pay the credit throughout the year, a negligible number of recipients avail of this option.</P>
    <P>In summary, it is clear that any move to a system of tax credits would have significant implications which would have to be carefully examined. Pending such an examination, it remains unclear whether the outcome would significantly advance the interests of low paid workers with families.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 66 and 75 together.</P>
      <P>As stated in An Action Programme for the Millennium, this Government is firmly committed to the achievement of an old age pension rate of £100 per week by 2002. An important step towards achieving this objective was taken in last year's budget which delivered increases of £6.00 per week in all personal pension rates &ndash; well above the average inflation rate and, when taken together with the improvements in the previous year's budget, represent an increase of £11 per week since this Government came into office.</P>
      <P>From June last the weekly rate of the old age contributory and retirement pension represents 124 per cent of the main rate recommended by the commission on social welfare, while the maximum rate of the old age non-contributory pension is 109 per cent of the commission's recommended rate.</P>
      <P>The pensions board, in its report Securing Retirement Income, recommended that social welfare pensions should be increased in line with prices at a minimum and, ideally, in line with earnings, and that it would be desirable to aim, over a five to ten year period, to increase social welfare pensions to 34 per cent of average industrial earnings. The Irish Senior Citizens' Parliament makes a similar recommendation in its pre-budget submission.</P>
      <P>The Government has noted the recommendations of the board and the senior citizens' parliament in this regard and considers that the question of further increases in the rates of social welfare pensions and the PRSI financing implications of these will be examined in the context of the overall budgetary situation and economic climate.</P>
      <P>In relation to the rate of payment for qualified adults, the Commission on Social Welfare recommended that the appropriate level at which the qualified adult allowance should be paid was 60 per cent of the personal rate. Recent research undertaken on behalf of the working group examining the treatment of married co-habiting and one-parent households under the tax and social welfare systems would suggest 70 per cent as a more appropriate level.</P>
      <P>The question of increasing the QAA rate to this level will be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>My Department operates three schemes under which once-off grants are made available for community and family support groups as follows: scheme of grants to voluntary <Col N="1280" /> organisations; community development education and training grants scheme; scheme of grants for locally-based community and family support groups. While some grants have been approved, the bulk of the allocation has not yet been spent for 1999.</P>
      <P>I might mention that details of the expenditure under each scheme and all the grants made in each year 1990 to 1998 have been placed in the Oireachtas Library for the information of Members. As soon as details of all grants paid in 1999 have been compiled, they will also be placed in the Library. I will arrange for a copy to be made available to the Deputy at that time.</P>
      <P>Applications under these schemes are assessed at regional level within my Department. While there is an element of flexibility to ensure that larger projects that are particularly worthwhile can be funded even in the regions with a smaller share of the population, the available funds are allocated to each region in accordance with its portion of the population of the State. The funds under these schemes were allocated in the same way in each of the years since 1995 and there has been no change in the system this year.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 68, 73, 74 and 87 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report of the working group examining the treatment of married, cohabiting and one-parent <Col N="1281" /> families under the tax and social welfare codes was published in August this year. The group was chaired by my Department and comprised representatives from the Department of Finance, Department of the Taoiseach, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Revenue Commissioners, the Combat Poverty Agency and the National social Service Board. The issues examined by the group are wide ranging and complex. They included: the current operation and interaction of the tax and welfare systems with regard to different types of families; options in relation to restructuring the tax system so as to redirect resources to child income support; options in relation to restructuring the social welfare system to provide for a more individualised systems; the possibility of increasing the qualified adult allowance payable under the social welfare code; the treatment of cohabiting couples in the tax code in relation to income and capital taxation; the financial disincentives for recipients of the one-parent family payment to marry or cohabit; and the operation of the community employment scheme in relation to recipients of the one-parent family payment.</P>
    <P>Taking into account the diversity and complexity of the issues examined, it is understandable that it was not possible for the group to reach definitive agreement on the future direction of policy on all of these areas. There is, perhaps, no right answer to the options considered. The report of the group does, however, provide considerable analyses on a range of possible options with regard to the issues it examined and certain policy directions were suggested. The report is a very useful contribution to the debate on the structure and objectives of the tax and social welfare systems and how these are adapting to changes taking place in Irish society. The report builds on previous work in this area, including the work of the expert working group on the integration of the tax and social welfare systems and the report of the Commission on the Family. The options and analyses contained in the report will now be considered further both by the Government and hopefully also by others concerned with the policy issues it examines.</P>
    <P>Issues considered by the group in relation to the position of lone parents will be considered further as part of an interdepartmental review of the one-parent family payment under the Department's expenditure review programme. It is hoped to complete this review by early 2000.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of the qualified adult allowance, the commission on social welfare recommended that the appropriate level at which the allowance should be paid was 60 per cent of the personal rate. Research carried out by the Economic and Social Research Institute for the working group suggested that 70 per cent of the personal rate would be a more appropriate level for this allowance. This analysis will be considered further in a budgetary context.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department has in place a wide-ranging programme of measures designed to tackle abuses of the social welfare system. The programme involves a range of activities including claim reviews, employer visitation for the purpose of inspecting PRSI records, data matching and other computer trawling exercises, liaison and transfer of information with other agencies in accordance with the law and special intensive team review activities on a local basis.</P>
      <P>In early 1998 my Department accepted an invitation from the gardaí to participate in multi-agency checkpoints. This has involved staff from my Department participating in checkpoints along with the gardaí and officials of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of the Environment and Local Government. Initially involvement in the checkpoints was on a pilot basis. They proved to be an effective anti-abuse measure and it was considered that they should continue and complement other control activities. A provision was included in this year's Social Welfare Act in order to copperfasten the legal basis for these operations.</P>
      <P>I note recent speculation in the media as to the future of these multi-agency checkpoints. The gardaí in high level contact with my Department officials have since confirmed that no decision has been taken by them to cease these checkpoints. I expect that they will continue to be operated as before.</P>
      <P>It is not correct to state that there is a lack of workplace inspections by my Department. There were 1,487 employer inspections in September bringing the total for the year to date up to 4,666. Involvement of social welfare inspectors in the implementation of the farm assist scheme meant that in some areas the number of employer inspections had to be curtailed during the summer months. The significant increase in employer inspection numbers during September is part of a renewed emphasis on this aspect of control activity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>In assessing the value of capital for the purposes of unemployment assistance the first £400 is assessed at 5 per cent and the balance is assessed at 10 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the years different methods of assessing the value of capital have been applied to the var<Col N="1283" /> ious social assistance schemes. For instance, until recently under the old age non-contributory pension scheme the first £200 of capital was disregarded; the next £375 was assessed at 5 per cent; and the balance was assessed at 10 per cent. Where the weekly means exceed £1, an additional £1 was added. In the case of the widow's non-contributory pension scheme and analogous payments the first £200 of capital was disregarded; and the balance was assessed at 5 per cent. Again, where the weekly means exceed £1, an additional £1 was added.</P>
    <P>This led to significant differences in the treatment of capital under the various social assistance schemes. Accordingly, it was decided to introduce a standardised method of assessing capital across all social assistance schemes. The introduction of the disability allowance scheme in October 1996 and the one-parent family payment in January 1997 presented the opportunity to commence this process.</P>
    <P>Under the revised capital assessment method, which was provided by my predecessor, the first £2,000 is disregarded, the next £20,000 is assessed at 7.5 per cent and the balance is assessed at 15 per cent. This standardised method has now been extended on a progressive basis to all social assistance schemes, other than unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare allowance.</P>
    <P>However, since the standardised method of assessing capital was first introduced in 1996, interest rates available on investments have fallen significantly. In the circumstances, I have arranged for my Department to review the current standardised method of assessing capital.</P>
    <P>As I have already indicated, the original intention had been to extend the standardised method of assessing capital to all social assistance schemes. However, in view of the changed circumstances in relation to interest rates it would be preferable to await the outcome of the review before making any changes in method of assessing capital for unemployment assistance purposes. I should point out that any relaxation of the current rules would have financial implications and could only be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <Quest>his views on whether there is a need to increase the fuel allowance last increased in 1985 when it was established at £5 per week in line with the increase in inflation between 1985 and today; and the proposals, if any, he has in this regard.</Quest>

      <P>The aim of the national fuel scheme is to assist householders who are on long-term social welfare or health board payments and  who are unable to provide for their own heating needs. A payment of £5 per week &ndash; £8 per week in smokeless zones &ndash; is paid to eligible households for 26 weeks from mid October to mid April.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to be eligible for assistance under the <Col N="1284" /> national fuel scheme, the person must satisfy a means test. A substantial improvement in the means test was introduced by me in the 1999 budget. A person may now have a combined household income of up to £30 per week or savings/investments of up to £22,400 over and above their pension and still qualify for fuel allowance.</P>
    <P>Any increase in the rate of payment would have to be considered in the light of the modest increase in domestic fuel prices since the current rate of the fuel allowance was set, taking into account the substantial increases in primary payment rates over the same period.</P>
    <P>The fuel and light component of the Consumer Price Index rose by 9.6 per cent between August 1985 and August 1999. Increasing the basic allowance by this amount would increase the rate from £5 to £5.48 per week. The additional expenditure for the 1999-2000 fuel season would be £4.4 million.</P>
    <P>The national and smokeless fuel schemes were reviewed in 1998 as part of my Department's series of programme evaluations. The review group took the view that improvements in the national fuel scheme cannot be looked at in isolation from the improvements in the primary weekly payment rates. With regard to the payment rate, the group concluded that the present rates of payment should remain unchanged if improvements in primary payment rates fully compensated recipients for all price inflation, including fuel price inflation. In that regard, substantial increases in all the social welfare primary payments of either £3 or £6 per week were paid from June 1999.</P>
    <P>Fuel allowances are not the sole mechanism through which assistance is provided to people with heating needs. There is a facility available through the supplementary welfare allowance scheme to assist people in certain circumstances who have special heating needs. An application for a heating supplement may be made by contacting the community welfare officer at the local health centre.</P>
    <P>Where a person would not normally qualify for a heating supplement there is provision under the SWA scheme to pay an exceptional needs payment. ENPs are payable at the discretion of the health board taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case.</P>
    <P>Expenditure on the national fuel scheme has increased by approximately 20 per cent in the last six years from £37.5 million in 1993 to £44.9 million in 1998. This year a sum of £46.4 million has been provided in the Estimates for the scheme.</P>
    <P>Any change in the rate of payment would have significant cost implications and could only be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>Information officers are already in place in each of the 57 social welfare local offices throughout the country. These officers are trained to deal with inquiries regarding all social welfare entitlements. In addition, social welfare inspectors in over 50 locations provide a call-in service at least one day per week for members of the public who wish to make inquiries regarding their entitlements.</P>
      <P>Agreement was reached recently with the 70 social welfare branch offices to enhance the information service currently provided by them to include all social welfare schemes. The enhanced service will be put in place as soon as certain preparatory work, including training of branch office staff, has been completed.</P>
      <P>The position regarding Dungarvan is that it is served by a branch office at Church Street and by an inspector who is located in the new civic offices in the town.</P>
      <P>Information queries on unemployment and disability payments are normally dealt with at the branch office, but a wide range of other queries are dealt with by the inspector on his office morning.</P>
      <P>Following the recent agreement with the branch offices it is planned to develop a fully integrated information service at the branch office. This will provide a focal point in the town for those seeking information on my Department's services.</P>
      <P>Information on the full range of social services is also available nationwide through a network of citizens information centres. The Dungarvan centre is one of 85 centres throughout the country supported by the national social service board.</P>

      <P>Following the agreement among the social partners in July 1998 on a pilot poverty proofing system to assess all significant policy proposals for their potential impact on the poor, the Government adopted this process in official Cabinet procedures. To assist in its implementation, the national anti-poverty strategy unit, based in my Department, produced a set of guidelines on poverty proofing which were distributed to all Government Departments in April of this year. These guidelines also provided worked examples of the application of the process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the responsibility of each Government Department to ensure that its policy proposals are poverty proofed. The NAPS unit has met with NAPS liaison officers in all Government Depart<Col N="1286" /> ments and discussed poverty proofing with them in order to assist with any difficulties. My Department will also be pursuing the possibilities for incorporating appropriate training modules into general service training courses.</P>
    <P>In July of this year, the NAPS unit organised a meeting of the Partnership 2000 sub-group which drew up the original poverty proofing framework to review progress and exchange experiences with regard to implementation of the process to date. In advance of this meeting, Departments were asked to report on their individual experiences of poverty proofing implementation. Feedback from Departments in this instance was generally positive and conscious efforts were being made to raise awareness of the process and ensure its implementation across departmental sections. There are, of course, some teething difficulties with applying the process in all circumstances but it is hoped that these difficulties will be addressed in a forthcoming review.</P>
    <P>In relation to a review of the process, it was agreed with the social partners during the initial discussions that poverty proofing would be reviewed and revised if necessary after a period of one year. Terms of reference for this review are currently being drafted and it is hoped that the outcome of the review will enhance the current process and help address any difficulties associated with its implementation.</P>
    <P>The introduction of poverty proofing of significant policy proposals is a major tool in assisting this Government in halting the drift towards a two-tier society by keeping social inclusion to the fore at all times. It ensures that Departments are now kept aware of the possible implications of policy on those most in need and it is a system to which this Government is committed as part of its strategy on social inclusion.</P>

      <P>The first annual report of the national anti-poverty strategy's Interdepartmental Policy Committee was published in June and consisted of a comprehensive overview of developments and progress in the area of anti-poverty and social inclusion policy since the launch of the strategy. The ESRI report, Monitoring Poverty Trends, also published in June, showed that substantial progress had been made towards achieving the original NAPS targets on consistent poverty and unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In light of these developments and this Government's ongoing social inclusion strategy, an ambitious target was introduced to reduce consistent poverty to below 5 per cent by 2004. In the context of the employment action plan, further targets were set in relation to unemployment. These are; reduce unemployment to below <Col N="1287" /> 5 per cent by end-2000; reduce long-term unemployment to below 2 per cent by end-2000.</P>
    <P>Since this Government has come into office the Live Register has dropped by 70,000 &ndash; 27 per cent &ndash; and an estimated 160,000 net new jobs have been created since 1997.</P>
    <P>I also announced at the launch of the NAPS report that the Government had asked the Interdepartmental Policy Committee to examine possibilities for new targets to reflect the changed environment, for example, in relation to education and adult literacy, and to consider setting targets in relation to particular groups such as children in poverty.</P>
    <P>The IDPC has begun consideration of this matter although, given the complex nature of the issue, it is likely that it will take some time before meaningful targets can be set in appropriate areas. The outcome of the negotiations of a new partnership agreement, as well as the forthcoming budget and the national development plan, will provide an important context in finalising any additional targets. The input of the social partners will also be sought in due course.</P>
    <P>The cross-departmental group on literacy, which was established by the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion, is due to report shortly and intends to provide recommendations to Government which may inform target setting in this area. Attainment of a sufficient degree of literacy is a core life skill and this Government has already provided much increased investment in adult education to assist in combating deficits in this area.</P>
    <P>In relation to child poverty, it should be noted that discussions are still at a very early stage and that child poverty is a complex problem, the alleviation of which requires policy responses on a number of fronts. The preparation of a national children's strategy will form a major input into this process. This Government's increases in child benefit, allied with investment in education initiatives such as Breaking the Cycle and Early Start, have made significant strides in this area. The latest ESRI figures from the living in Ireland survey show that the percentage of children experiencing consistent poverty has fallen from 18-23 per cent to 15-17 per cent, while the numbers living in households below the 50 per cent relative income line have fallen from 29 per cent in 1994 to 24 per cent in 1997.</P>
    <P>Housing and homelessness are issues which have been prominent in Ireland for decades. Recognising the problem of homelessness, the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion established a cross-departmental working group in late 1998 to prepare an integrated response to homelessness and report to Government. This report is expected shortly.</P>
    <P>In relation to housing, this Government has consistently continued to address this problem. The recent Planning and Development Bill, Action on House Prices, and the serviced land initiative were all designed to increase supply of housing, in particular for those who are being priced out of the market. In addition, a multi-annual local authority housing programme was <Col N="1288" /> announced in April 1999. Under this initiative, a comprehensive funding package has been agreed which will deliver 22,000 local authority houses over the next four years, starting in the year 2000.</P>
    <P>This Government has pledged its commitment to halting the drift towards a two-tier society. It has set targets in numerous areas and has made progress towards achieving them. These targets are useful in that they enable us to monitor progress but that progress can only be attained through effective policy actions which assist in alleviating poverty and promotion social inclusion &ndash; a strategy to which this Government is firmly committed.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 78 and 80 together.</P>
      <P>The value of the child benefit scheme as an effective mechanism for the provision of child income support is reflected in the substantial investment which the Government makes in the scheme, at a full year cost of around £475 million per annum. The last budget provided for increases in child benefit of £3 per month for each of the first two children in a family and £4 per month for the third and subsequent children. This brought the monthly rates payable from September 1999 up to £34.50 and £46 respectively.</P>
      <P>The Combat Poverty Agency &ndash; CPA &ndash; in its analysis of the report of the Expert Working Group on Child Care, recommended that child benefit rates should be doubled from the current levels over a three-year period. It suggested that increases of this order would make a substantial contribution to the costs of bringing up children irrespective of whether they are cared for primarily by their parents or by childcare providers. The agency noted that child benefit does not link provision for child care with employment status, it does not act as a disincentive to women's participation in the labour market, or create employment or poverty traps.</P>
      <P>It is my intention that the potential of the child benefit scheme as an effective mechanism for the delivery of child income support should be exploited to the greatest possible extent.</P>
      <P>The level of any further increase in child benefit is a matter for consideration in the context of the forthcoming budget.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I am sure the Deputy is aware, prior to 1953 different types of contributions were payable &ndash; national health insurance, widow's and orphan's pension and unemployment insurance contributions &ndash; which gave specific entitlement only to the benefits of the schemes under which they were paid. The unified system of social insurance was introduced in 1953 and the first major extension to the range of contingencies covered came in 1961 with the introduction of the old age contributory pension scheme.</P>
      <P>While contributions paid prior to 1961 contained no pension element, it was decided to count all such contributions paid under the unified scheme towards qualification for the new pension. Special transitional arrangements were also made for people who were close to reaching pension age at that time, which permitted certain contributions paid before 1953 to be taken into account for satisfying the yearly average test.</P>
      <P>In addition, provision was made for pre-1953 contributions, paid under the national health insurance Acts, to be taken into account for the purposes of satisfying two of the qualifying contribution conditions for the old age contributory pension, namely that a person must (i) have entered insurance at least ten years before pension age and (ii) have, at least, 156 contributions paid. This arrangement still applies.</P>
      <P>I have often stated my commitment to ensuring that contributory pension coverage is as widely available as possible, and in this context, the Department is examining the issue of contributions paid prior to 1953 as part of a wider review of the contribution conditions applying to the old age contributory and retirement pensions. This review is nearing completion but I have to say that any change to the existing situation in relation to pre-1953 contributions would have to be carefully considered in the context of overall budgetary resources.</P>

      <QRef>[18887/99]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The central outcome of the ESRI report, Monitoring Poverty Trends, <Col N="1290" /> which represents the first update on the 1996 publication, Poverty in the 1990s, on which the original National Anti-Poverty Strategy &ndash; NAPS &ndash; targets were based, is that there has been a sharp reduction in the numbers experiencing consistent poverty as targeted by the strategy.</P>
      <P>In fact, the proportion of households in consistent poverty fell from 9 per cent &ndash; 15 per cent of the population in 1994 to 7 per cent &ndash; 10 per cent of the population by 1997 with the NAPS targets for 2007 almost achieved. In light of these very encouraging results, I announced, as part of this Government's social inclusion strategy, ambitious new targets to halve the numbers of people in consistent poverty to below 5 per cent by 2004.</P>
      <P>While the ESRI report found that increases in lower incomes did not keep pace with average incomes over the 1994 to 1997 period, it is important to note that there have been substantial increases in all social welfare rates in recent years. For example, between 1995 and 1998, social welfare payments increased by some 13 per cent to 14 per cent compared to a total rise in the Consumer Price Index of less than 6 per cent over the same period. Indeed, all social welfare payments are now at or above the minimum rates recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare, achieving a key policy objective of both the National Anti-Poverty Strategy and Partnership 2000. These substantial real increases have contributed to a sharp reduction in levels of basic deprivation and, consequently, consistent poverty.</P>
      <P>Of course, social welfare rates, while important, do not of themselves show the full picture. Having a job is recognised as the best route out of poverty. As such, the dramatic progress which has been made in reducing the numbers of unemployed has had, and continues to have, a very beneficial impact on the overall numbers in poverty. Since this Government has come into office the live register has dropped by 70,000 &ndash; 27 per cent &ndash; and an estimated 160,000 net new jobs have been created since 1997. The ESRI results show that, while the unemployed and persons on home duties made up a similar proportion of the consistently poor in both 1994 and 1997, these groups have both benefited from the sharp reduction in poverty generally. This is evident from the fact that households headed by an unemployed person and experiencing consistent poverty fell by over two percentage points to just over 3 per cent of the population between 1994 and 1997. A similar outcome was evident for such consistently poor households headed by persons on home duties which comprised less than 3 per cent of the population in 1997 having fallen by over 1.5 percentage points since 1994.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards senior citizens, it is important to note that, while there was an increase in the numbers falling below relative income lines, this was not reflected in the numbers of older people experiencing consistent poverty. Indeed, Monitoring Poverty Trends and other ESRI research <Col N="1291" /> into quality of life for older people demonstrates a relatively weak link between low incomes and deprivation for older people. One of the main reasons cited for this is the wide range of free schemes which are of particular benefit to the elderly but are not taken into account in the ESRI's calculation of household income. In addition, this Government continues to make progress towards its target of £100 per week for the old age pension, a rate of increase well in excess of increases in earnings, the achievement of which will certainly contribute towards an improvement in their relative income position.</P>
    <P>The question of an appropriate future direction for social welfare rates generally is under consideration within my Department, particularly now that the minimum rates of payment as recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare have been achieved. This consideration will take account of all relevant publications from the ESRI, Combat Poverty Agency and others, such as the national pensions policy initiative. This examination will also, of course, have to take account of all relevant factors such as employment implications and budgetary considerations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The minimum personal rate of payment recommended by the commission on social welfare was £50 a week, in 1985 terms. Up-rated to take account of increases in the cost of living in the interim, this minimum target rate now stands at £71.80 a week. The lowest current rate of social welfare payment is £72 per week.</P>
      <P>The commission also recommended that the rates of payment for adult dependants, now qualified adults, should be set at 60 per cent of the basic payment for a single person. Accordingly, the commission's up-rated target rate for a couple now stands at £114.90 a week. The lowest social welfare rate for a couple, that is, where a QAA is paid, is £115.20 per week.</P>
      <P>As a consequence of the increases in social welfare rates which took effect from the beginning of June 1999, all personal rates are now above the commission's minimum target rate, ranging between 100 per cent and 124 per cent. In addition, all rates payable to couples are above the commission's target rate, ranging between 100 per cent and 130 per cent. This year's social welfare increases fulfil the commitment contained in Partnership 2000 to implement the minimum rates recommended by the commission before the end of the partnership.</P>
      <P>The commission did not make any specific recommendations in relation to the minimum rates to be paid in respect of child dependants. They did, however, recommend that child dependant allowances &ndash; CDAs &ndash; should be rationalised across the range of social welfare schemes &ndash; there were 36 different rates payable at that stage. The commission suggested that this could be achieved on a cost neutral basis by providing for a standard CDA rate of £10 a week, in 1985 terms, for all schemes, although this suggestion was not included as a specific recommendation in their report. It should be noted that this proposal would have involved reducing the CDAs payable for certain social welfare recipients, e.g. widows.</P>
      <P>The rationalisation of CDA rates has been largely achieved and there are now just three different rates in existence &ndash; £13.20, £15.20 and £17 a week &ndash; the commission's suggested CDA rate of £10 up-rated to 1999 terms would amount to £14.35.</P>
      <P>However, on the wider policy front, it is now generally recognised that the loss of child dependant allowances by social welfare recipients on taking up employment can act as a disincentive to taking up available work opportunities. This problem has been highlighted in various reports, most notably the final report of the expert working group on integrating tax and social welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The policy direction followed by this and, <Col N="1293" /> indeed, previous Governments has therefore, been to concentrate resources for child income support on child benefit. This approach, which centres on making child income support more neutral<i> vis-á-vis </i>the employment status of the parent, has the effect of reducing work disincentives.</P>

      <P>The contract between my Department and An Post under which certain social welfare payments are delivered at post offices will reach the end of its current term in December next. The Government decided in May 1999 to extend the term of this contract for an additional period of three years, 2000 to 2002, inclusive. This decision was taken in the context of advice from the Attorney General regarding the application of EU law to this procurement.</P>
      <P>Following the Government decision, my Department consulted the Office of the Attorney General about a number of matters of a technical nature concerning this procurement.</P>
      <P>My Department is currently in negotiations with An Post regarding the detailed business terms and conditions which will apply to this business arrangement during the period of the extension to which I have just referred. I expect that this process will be completed shortly. Further legal advice will be obtained if additional issues of a legal nature arise from this process.</P>
      <P>Questions relating to the application of EU directives are for national governments to determine in the first instance. For this reason, my Department has not issued to the EU Commission any notice of the kind referred to by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the negotiations with An Post have been finalised, my Department will issue to the EU Commission such notices or reports as may be required. Needless to say, the Government <Col N="1295" /> intends to fully comply with its obligations in EU law in all matters relating to this procurement.</P>

      <P>To be entitled to an unemployment payment a person must satisfy a deciding officer that he-she fulfils, and continues to fulfil, the statutory conditions of being capable of, available for and genuinely seeking but unable to obtain suitable employment.</P>
      <P>The employment action plan &ndash; EAP &ndash; has been in operation since 1998 and is a joint initiative between FÁS and my Department. It applies to certain unemployed persons under age 25 and, since 1 May has been extended to longer-term unemployed persons aged 25-34. Its purpose is, following a detailed interview conducted by a FÁS placement officer to develop an action plan for the individual which will help him-her to return to the active labour market.</P>
      <P>As part of the programme ongoing support is provided, including training for as long as the person needs it.</P>
      <P>Where a person is referred to FÁS for interview under the employment action plan &ndash; EAP &ndash; and fails to attend, then the question as to whether he/she continues to fulfil the statutory condition of genuinely seeking suitable employment must be tested.</P>
      <P>In these circumstances the case is referred to a deciding officer for review. Where a deciding officer decides, following an interview with the person, that he-she does not fulfil this condition, the claim is disallowed. If the person is dissatisfied with the deciding officer's decision he-she has a right of appeal to the independent social welfare appeals office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I introduced regulations in 1998 which set out in detail the steps a person is required to take in order to be deemed to have satisfied the availability and genuinely seeking employment conditions. When the regulations were being drafted a wide range of interests were consulted. In order to ensure that a uniform approach was adopted to the application of the regulations detailed guidelines were issued in June 1998 and training was provided to deciding officers. My Department's decision advisory office provides ongoing training and support to locally based deciding officers and every effort is being made to ensure <Col N="1296" /> uniformity in relation to decisions across the network of local offices.</P>
    <P>I have had no reports of any punitive enforcement of the regulations in any of my Department's local offices.</P>

      <P>The Pensions Board report, Securing Retirement Income, on the national pensions policy initiative &ndash; NPPI &ndash; published in May 1998 is a comprehensive document, containing almost 100 specific recommendations.</P>
      <P>At the time of the publication of the report, I set out the Government's response in Action on Pensions, a copy of which was furnished to each Deputy at the time. This response welcomed the broad thrust of the proposals and commented on the key recommendations.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to say that the Government has already announced in July last that it intends to implement one of these key recommendations, namely, that the future costs of social welfare pensions should be partly pre-funded, while in the Social Welfare Act, 1999, I provided for the board's recommendation to prohibit reductions in occupational pensions already in payment, arising from increases in social welfare pensions.</P>
      <P>In relation to other proposals, working groups are examining key recommendations such as how best to increase occupational pensions coverage and the mechanism suggested for achieving this  &ndash; namely, the personal retirement savings accounts &ndash; PRSAs &ndash; as well as the simplification of the pensions taxation regime. Other recommendations relating to access, vesting, preservation and revaluation of occupational pensions are also being examined and developed by the Pensions Board and the Department, while I will also be considering reports from the board arising from the report in relation to the treatment of pension scheme surpluses, equal treatment, the establishment of a pensions ombudsman and the introduction of a compensation fund.</P>
      <P>I propose to give legislative effect to the NPPI report in a comprehensive new occupational pensions Bill, which I hope to introduce early next year.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 92 and 207 together.</P>
      <P>The farm assist scheme, which introduced the special arrangements for farmers on low incomes, was provided for in the Social Welfare Act, 1999, and is effective from 7 April 1999.</P>
      <P>To date there have been 9,069 applications received for farm assist, comprising 2,364 new applications and 6,705 claimants formerly in receipt of smallholders unemployment assistance, widows non-contributory pensions, pre-retirement and disability allowances.</P>
      <P>The number of claimants in receipt of a farm assist payment, on week ending 24 September, was 6,519.</P>
      <P>The farm assist scheme was designed specifically for farmers on low incomes. It replaced the smallholders assistance scheme. The scheme is means-tested, taking into account both farm and off-farm income of farmer and spouse. Eligibility is based on actual income assessed being within specified income thresholds. Only 80 per cent of self-employment income is taken into account and there is also a child related disregard. Any person who is aged between 18 and 66 and engaged in farming and satisfies the means test can qualify for farm assist.</P>
      <P>I do not accept that my Department is adopting a restricted view in relation to the application of the eligibility requirements.</P>
      <P>Comprehensive guidelines were issued to the staff who are implementing the scheme and training seminars were organised for them. These guidelines are available to the general public.</P>
      <P>On the application form completed by former smallholders, many indicated that their circumstances had changed since their last assessment. Reviews of these cases are ongoing. At present 3,271 claimants who have had their means reviewed have received an increased level of payment, while 803 have had a reduction in payment.</P>
      <P>It is open to any person who is dissatisfied with a decision of a deciding officer in relation to the assessment of means in his-her case to appeal to the independent social welfare appeals office.</P>

      <P>As the Minister of State with responsibility for trade, I expect to attend the third ministerial meeting of the World Trade Organisation, scheduled to be held in Seattle from 30 November to 3 December 1999. This ministerial will take the necessary decisions to launch a millennium round of trade negotiations in the WTO in 2000.</P>
      <P>The European Union has been, and is, engaged in the detailed work, within the WTO, preparing for these negotiations. Ireland has participated fully in the preparation of EU positions.</P>
      <P>The EU is firmly convinced that a comprehensive trade round, involving a broad range of issues is the best way to address the challenges resulting from rapid and far-reaching economic changes, to manage properly and effectively the globalisation process, to promote equitable growth and development and to respond in a balanced manner to the interests of all WTO members, in particular the developing countries.</P>
      <P>Eight rounds of trade liberalisation and strengthening of multilateral trade rules have made a major contribution to global prosperity, development and rising living standards. Since 1951, global trade has grown seventeen fold, world production has more than quadrupled, and world <i>per capita</i> income has doubled. The multilateral system has helped a large number of developing countries to successfully integrate into the international economy and developing countries' share of world export trade has increased by nearly 50 per cent over the past three years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The WTO, since the conclusion of the Uruguay round, has brought about major improvements in market access and more predictable rules that have benefited the membership as a whole, in <Col N="1299" /> particular smaller countries. Over the period 1995-97, the volume of global trade increased by almost 8 per cent annually, far outpacing the growth in GNP. WTO and OECD studies on the impact of the Uruguay round have confirmed the positive impact on the world economy as its results are taking effect.</P>
    <P>In addition to a decision to launch a new round of trade negotiations, I would hope that the Seattle ministerial will take decisions that will strengthen the WTO as an institution. These could include improvements to the dispute settlement understanding, the creation of an institutional basis to better address development concerns, the improvement of co-operation between the WTO and other major international institutions and improved procedures to create greater transparency and public awareness of the WTO.</P>

The client base of Enterprise Ireland is comprised of companies which are Irish based and whose growth and development can be enhanced through working with Enterprise Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1300" /> The key metrics of sales, exports and employment underpin the need for Enterprise Ireland to focus strongly on companies with the willingness and potential to trade internationally. Given the limited size of the domestic Irish market and its increasing openness in a globalised competitive environment, significant growth in sales and employment can only be achieved through exporting. Enterprise Ireland accordingly give priority to assisting companies with export potential. This approach is reflected in the three year strategy &ndash; 1999-2001 &ndash; which was recently published by the agency.</P>
    <P>If the Deputy is aware of particular companies which are having difficulty in securing support I would be glad to forward details to Enterprise Ireland and arrange for a client development executive from the agency to consult with them on their development needs.</P>

      <P>At the outset let me state that there is no change proposed in the agreed participation level of 37,500 on average over the current year. However, proposals for restructuring the CE programme were agreed by Government earlier this year. As a result of the restructuring process, which is aimed at securing better targeting and outcomes from the programme, there will be a reduction in the number of places on CE on a phased basis over a five year time frame, including through the transfer of resources equivalent to some 5000 CE places &ndash; about £40 million &ndash; to the social economy programme.</P>
      <P>I have had consultations with the social partners and I hope I have reassured them on matters of concern to them. In particular, I have committed to further consultations on how best to allocate resources freed up by the restructuring of CE to meet the needs of the long-term unemployed, and on the proper funding or mainstreaming of essential services currently provided under CE.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy, in his question, is referring to recent press reports alleging the refusal by a major insurer to quote for motor insurance business in certain parts of the country. We have no statutory powers to compel a particular motor insurance company to offer quotes for motor insurance nor to interfere or influence the accepted standard criteria used by insurance companies for covering motor insurance risks. Our primary role, in so far as the regulation of insurance companies is concerned, is to ensure that the companies remain solvent, thus ensuring the protection of policyholders in that regard. Allied to that function is the pursuit of policies to ensure that motor insurance cover is available at reasonable cost and that a competitive market is maintained. The challenge is always to strike a balance between prudential considerations on the one hand and a high level of consumer protection on the other.</P>
      <P>Motor insurance underwriting criteria are normally based on underwriting experience including trends in the level, frequency and cost of claims for particular risks and classes of risk and are a matter of judgment by individual private insurance companies. Any changes in circumstances affecting the risk insured would have to be assessed by the insurer from an underwriting standpoint. The premiums charged and the availability of a quote will reflect any material increase in the risk.</P>
      <P>In the light of normal practice in this regard, we were surprised by the recent press reports. We are also concerned at the implications for targeted motor insurance policyholders. Accordingly, I requested our officials to urgently seek clarification on the issue from the company. I also forwarded papers regarding this matter to the Motor Insurance Advisory Board for its immediate attention and appraisal. The company subsequently assured the Department that it was continuing to quote for new business throughout the country but that, from time to time, there may be specific individual cases where a quote may not be forthcoming. In cases of refusals to quote for motor insurance, the declined cases agreement between the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Irish Insurance Federation offers the motorist the opportunity of a motor quotation subject to certain criteria.</P>
      <P>I have asked our officials to continue to monitor the situation in the public interest.</P>

      <P>The special £5,000 seafarer's income tax allowance referred to by the Deputy and the correspondent concerned is a unique, sector specific, fiscal incentive aimed at reducing EU seafarer labour costs in accordance with EU maritime policy. The allowance operates as follows: section 472B of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, provides for a seafarer's allowance of £5,000 for seafarers absent from the State for at least 169 days in a tax year for the purposes of performing duties of employment on a sea-going ship on an international voyage. Section 472B(2) specifically defines absence from the state for a day as absence from the State at the end of the day. This is in line with the definition of presence in the State for residence purposes contained in section 819(4) of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997.</P>
      <P>Following approval of the allowance by the European Commission under EU maritime state aid guidelines in December 1998, I successfully secured an extension of the allowance to qualifying seafarers working on board vessels servicing mobile or fixed rigs and platforms of any kind in any areas designated under the Continental Shelf Act, 1976, that is, in Irish waters. This amendment was included in the 1999 Finance Act and it received European Commission approval in June 1999.</P>
      <P>My Department and the Department of finance keep the range of fiscal allegation measures applicable to the shipping industry under continuous review having regard to their objective to maximise employment of Irish seafarers and support and facilitate the development of a competitive Irish flagged and owned shipping sector. The measures involved, as well as the special seafarer's tax free allowance, include beneficial rates of corporation tax and PRSI refunds to employers of seafarers. The views of the person in question will be taken fully into account in the context of this ongoing review and in light of the need to encourage greater productivity and competitive manning practices in our shipping sector.</P>

      <P>Ireland is seeking election to one of the two non-permanent seats on the United Nations Security Council which are designated for the Western Europe and other groups of states for the two year term 2001-02. The election will take place in the 188 member United Nations General Assembly in October 2000. The election is being contested by three other candidates: Norway, Turkey and Italy.  Successful candidates will require the support of two thirds of those states present and voting. In effect, this means that the support of around 120 states will be needed to secure election. The election is by secret ballot.</P>
      <P>In September last, before the campaign entered a more intense phase, we had around 30 commitments. This level of support has been built on and the Government is determined that by October 2000 when the election takes place we will have the necessary number of votes to secure election.</P>
      <P>I have sought support for Ireland's candidacy on all appropriate occasions, including on official visits abroad. I recently attended the 54th Session of the United Nations General Assembly in New York where, in addition to participating in the general debate, I had bilateral contact with Foreign Ministers or Prime Ministers from around 60 UN member states. These contacts were productive, both in terms of promoting our Security Council candidacy among the broad UN membership, and in terms of discussing important issues of bilateral and international concern.</P>
      <P>As I indicated previously, this is a contested election. I am reluctant therefore to indicate the exact level of support committed to Ireland at this stage. Let me say simply that the Government is gratified by the broad support that Ireland's candidacy has attracted.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 105 and 106 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The murder of Robert Hamill as the result of an attack in Portadown on 27 April 1997 has been actively pursued with the British authorities, at official and ministerial level, through the framework of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference. I met with Robert Hamill's family on 30 April 1998, and officials of the Department of Foreign Affairs, in particular through the Anglo-Irish Secretariat in Belfast, have closely monitored developments in relation to the case. The <Col N="1305" /> status of the RUC investigation has likewise been raised on a number of occasions with the British authorities.</P>
    <P>Of the six people originally charged in 1997, only one was convicted on 25 March 1999 of causing an affray on the night in question, but not of murder. The British authorities have said that the RUC investigation is continuing in an effort to bring those responsible for the murder to justice, that the file on the case remains open, and that any new evidence arising would be acted upon.</P>
    <P>The Independent Commission for Police Complaints &ndash; ICPC &ndash; supervised the RUC investigation into the actions of the RUC officers present on the night in question and the file was referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions for direction in February 1998. A decision not to proceed with any prosecutions of RUC officers involved in the case was made on 30 September 1999. An internal RUC disciplinary action against the officers is now being considered.</P>
    <P>Following the decision on 30 September not to proceed with prosecutions of any RUC officers in relation to the murder, we have conveyed to the British authorities, through the framework of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference, the widespread and deep concern that exists about this case, which is fully shared by the Government, and an urgent report on the matter has been requested. In the light of this report, I will consider what appropriate action to take.</P>
    <P>Since the cold-blooded killing of Rosemary Nelson in March this year, the Government has impressed on the British Government that the investigation into her murder must be &ndash; and be seen to be &ndash;  thorough, transparent and independent. The Government is keenly aware of the concerns which have been voiced in the Nationalist community and on the part of human rights groups, in Ireland and internationally, about the role of the RUC in that investigation. The Department of Foreign Affairs maintains ongoing contact on a broad range of issues relating to the investigation with the British authorities within the framework of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference. Progress has been recorded, for example, in relation to the establishment and use of a non-RUC confidential telephone line. The Government will remain closely in contact with interested parties about the case and the conduct of the investigation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>On the basis of studies carried out in Switzerland and elsewhere, I am informed that mobile telephones in use in Ireland meet the exposure standards recommended by major health advisory bodies worldwide, including the International Committee on Non-Ionising Radiation Protection  &ndash; ICNIRP &ndash; which is adviser to the World Health Organisation on these matters.</P>
      <P>In regard to mobile phone masts, compliance with the 1988 International Radiation Protection Association &ndash; IRPA &ndash; guidelines is a condition attached to all communications licences for mobile telephony services issued in Ireland.  In this regard, the Deputy should note that in 1996 a major review of the health issues raised by non-ionising radiation emissions was carried out by the ICNIRP and its subsequent report confirmed the appropriateness of the IRPA guidelines.</P>
      <P>The most recent European recommendation for limiting public exposure to electromagnetic fields in the frequency range 0 Hz to 300 Hz was that approved by the Council of Health Ministers at its meeting on 12 July 1999. This recommendation, which was supported by all member states except Italy, proposes limits for public exposure at 900 MHz &ndash; mobile phone frequencies &ndash; of 4.5 watts per square metre. Exposure of the public in Ireland to emissions from phone masts and mobile phones are well within this recommended limit. In the case of phone masts, public exposures are typically less than one thousandth of this recommended permissible limit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The concern in the United Kingdom follows a report of the House of Commons science and technology committee concerning mobile phones and health, published on 22 September 1999.  In its report the committee recommended that the <Col N="1307" /> United Kingdom move to adopt the guidelines of the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation as a precautionary measure to protect users of mobile phones.  The current UK standard for mobile phones is that published by the UK's National Radiological Protection Board &ndash; NRPB &ndash; and is five times above the ICNIRP guideline level used in Ireland.</P>

      <P>The report to which the Deputy refers was in fact published by the UK Civil Aviation Authority safety regulation group on behalf of the Joint Airprox Assessment Panel in November 1998. The incident concerned the loss of separation between two commercial passenger jet aircraft on the Irish register in the London area. The incident was reported by London ATC and one of the aircraft captains. The airspace around London is quite busy as we are all aware, and pilots and controllers being human, are all prone to error. However, as the report into the incident shows, the aircraft could see each other and took no avoiding action. The incident was fully investigated by the appropriate authorities. I am satisfied that while the UK air traffic services are very busy, their safety oversight and incident reporting and investigation systems ensure a safe environment for passenger aircraft.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Conclusions of Investigation</i>The investigation concluded the airprox was caused by the London Air Traffic Control Centre Terminal Control North-West Departures controller who in a period of high workload, overlooked the presence of the BA 146 at FL90 (9,000 feet when clearing the B737 to climb through its level from Flight Level 80 to Flight Level 120 from 8,000 feet to 12,000 feet. It was considered fortuitous that the aircraft passed about 1m apart as the confliction was not apparent on radar and no remedial action was taken by the controller.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Review by Airprox Panel</i>1.Discussion</P>
      <P>The Joint Airprox Assessment Panel accepted the summary report of the CAA. This was a serious where separation was a matter of chance and there was evidence that the actual separation may have been less than was recorded.</P>
      <P>2.Casual Factors</P>

The Dublin Transportation Office also submitted its proposals in the transportation blueprint 2000-06. These documents included proposals relating to the matters referred to in the Deputy's question. These documents provided the background to my Department's submission on the public transport investment element of the national plan.

At a board meeting of the company on 19 May 1999 the two worker directors, and their alternates voluntarily relinquished their positions on the board. At the same meeting Mr. Bill Attley, on my nomination, was appointed to the board to fill one of the vacancies.</P>
      <P>Under the employee share ownership plan ESOP for Telecom Eireann, the employee trust is entitled to nominate a director for appointment to the board of the company, and that this nomination would be facilitated by the replacement of one of the worker director positions.

      <P>I am always concerned when an airline offering services to or from any Irish airport withdraws those services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under EU regulations all airlines licensed in EEA countries &ndash; the 15 EU countries and Norway and Iceland &ndash; are free to operate on any route within the EEA. There are no longer any <Col N="1317" /> governmental controls on intra-EEA routes. The operation of any particular route is a matter for the commercial judgment of the carrier, subject only to the availability of slots at either end of the route and overall safety considerations.</P>
    <P>AB Airlines Ltd. is a UK based airline and is licenced to operate by the UK Civil Aviation Authority CAA. In accordance with EU regulations the airline did not need any permission from my Department to operate routes between the UK and Ireland. As the licensing authority, the UK CAA is responsible for monitoring the financial circumstances of AB Airlines. My Department would have no function in this regard and would have no knowledge of the ongoing financial situation of the company.</P>
    <P>However, on becoming aware of the imminent withdrawal of AB Airlines's Shannon-London Gatwick service, my Department made inquiries of the UK Civil Aviation Authority and of the court appointed administrators BDO Stoy Hayward. For reasons of confidentiality, neither body was able to give my officials detailed information as to the difficulties facing the company at that time.</P>
    <P>According to the most recent information available to my Department from the administrators, AB Airlines ceased scheduled operations on 8 September and ceased all operations on 22 September 1999.</P>
    <P>Any moneys which may be owing by AB Airlines are matters between the company's creditors and the administrators. I understand that under UK law a meeting of all creditors must be called before 30 October 1999.</P>
    <P>I understand that Aer Rianta set up a taskforce to look after passengers who had made advance bookings on AB Airlines Shannon-London Gatwick service and that most of the passengers who were discommoded were accommodated on other Shannon-London services.</P>

      <P>I have received no proposal regarding a new airport for Galway city and county at Oranmore. However, the long-standing policy of my Department as regards the development of aviation facilities is that private interests may provide and develop airports in whatever location they wish, provided the requirements of the Irish Aviation Authority are met and planning permission is secured. It is, of course, for the promoters to satisfy themselves that an airport can function as a viable commercial entity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, Galway Airport <Col N="1318" /> was allocated a grant of £3.1million last year towards the cost of widening and extending its runway. This funding was allocated for this particular project. The provision of funding for a different project at a different location would be a matter for consideration by me and eventual decision by the Government.</P>
    <P>As regards the provision of adequate air transport services for Galway, the operation of any particular route is a matter for the commercial judgment of an airline.

      <Quest>the position regarding the sale of the six Army barracks; the cost to date for security for each barracks; the number of meetings he has had with local authorities in each area to complete his Department's commitment to transfer 15 per cent of the land to the authorities and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government, on 15 July 1998, approved a programme of evacuation and sale of six barracks which are considered surplus to military requirements. The barracks in question are located at Fermoy, Ballincollig, Naas, Kildare, Castleblayney and Clancy Barracks, Dublin. With the exception of Clancy Barracks, which will be vacated by 1 July 2000, the other five barracks have been evacuated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the Government decision, I had consultations with public and community representatives in each of the five locations in which barracks were subsequently evacuated. In addition to those initial meetings, I met with Members of the Oireachtas and local councillors in relation to Castleblayney Barracks on 3 February, 3 March, and 15 July 1999; local councillors and officials from Naas Urban District Council on 3 March, and 10 March 1999 in relation to Devoy Barracks, Naas, and I have met with councillors and an <Col N="1320" /> official of Kildare County Council on 14 September 1999 in relation to Magee Barracks, Kildare. Discussions also took place between my officials and officials of Cork County Council on 2 December 1998 in relation to Fitzgerald Camp, Fermoy, and Murphy Barracks, Ballincollig. I propose meeting with members of Fermoy Urban District Council and officials of Cork County Council on 28 October 1999, to discuss a tender from Cork County Council relating to Fitzgerald Camp.</P>
    <P>In relation to Castleblayney, I have decided to sell the site to the North-Eastern Health Board for £600,000. The legal and financial formalities have yet to be finalised. As regards Devoy Barracks, agreement has been reached between my Department and Naas Urban District Council on the transfer of part of the property to the council for local purposes. The balance of the property has been re-zoned for housing in line with the development plan for Naas UDC, which was adopted on 29 May 1999 and this property will be offered for sale in the near future.</P>
    <P>Arising from a request from the Department of Foreign Affairs for accommodation to house Kosovar refugees, I offered that Department the opportunity to inspect the five vacated barracks to check their feasibility or otherwise for the accommodation of the refugees. Currently Magee Barracks, Kildare, is being used for this purpose on a temporary basis. In the interim, tenders from independent consultants are under consideration for the preparation of an area action plan in respect of the former barrack lands. The consultants will submit a report within three months of appointment. The sale of the barracks will proceed as soon as is practicable following evaluation of that report.</P>
    <P>Following a tender competition for the appointment of independent consultants to draw up an integrated action area plan for Murphy Barracks, Ballincollig, consultants were appointed on 23 August 1999. That plan is due for completion by 23 November 1999 and the property will be disposed of following evaluation of that report.</P>
    <P>The total cost, to date, of employing private security firms at the vacated military barracks is £549,737.58 while the amount by individual location is as follows : Devoy Barracks &ndash; £125,683.42; Fitzgerald Camp &ndash; £87,124.84; Castleblayney &ndash; £76,966.9; Murphy Barracks &ndash; £171,041.93; Magee Barracks &ndash; £88,920.48. The costs for security at Magee Barracks have been borne by the Eastern Health Board since that property was handed over to accommodate Kosovan refugees on 12 May 1999.</P>
    <P>The military authorities have estimated that the savings to date on security duty allowances amount to £370,000 approximately. In addition, there have been significant savings on utilities such as telephone and electricity charges.</P>
    <P>It is expected that up to £50 million will be realised from the sale of the barracks.</P>

      <P>As the person named does not live within 70 miles of his disadvantaged lands he is not eligible under the terms and conditions of the 1997 and 1998 headage schemes for payment of grants. His case was reviewed by the independent headage and premia appeals unit and the decision of ineligibility was upheld.</P>
      <P>In May 1999 the person named sought a further review of his case on the grounds that he is only in part-time employment and spends 50 per cent to 70 per cent of his time within commuting distance of his holding. The only supporting evidence he submitted was a letter from his employer stating that he works on a four-day week basis. He was asked to submit more definite evidence such as payslips showing the number of hours/days/per week that he worked in 1997 and 1998. To date no reply has been received.</P>
      <P>The person named applied under the 1999 ewe premium scheme, the 1999 sheep headage scheme, the 1999 suckler cow premium scheme and the 1999 cattle headage scheme. Under the 1999 sheep headage scheme and the 1999 cattle headage scheme, he remains ineligible as he does not live within 70 miles of his disadvantaged lands.</P>
      <P>Following an inspection carried out on 7 April 1999 he was ruled out of the 1999 ewe premium scheme because he failed to notify my Department's district livestock office of the change in location of his flock as required under clause 3(v) of the terms and conditions of the scheme. In addition, he failed to keep an up-to-date sheep register as required under clause 3(vi) of the terms and conditions of the scheme. He has been given the opportunity to appeal this decision by writing to my Department setting out any new facts which he wishes to put forward to support his case. Any such appeal will be considered as a matter of urgency.</P>
      <P>His 1999 suckler cow premium scheme application is currently being examined.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the difficulties which are at present being experienced by sheep producers. Prices have been low in recent weeks due, to a large extent, to particularly <Col N="1326" /> high supplies of British lamb in the second half of the year.</P>
      <P>In response to representations which I made to the EU Commission, a scheme of aid for private storage was agreed at a specially convened meeting of the Sheepmeat Management Committee on 17 September. The objective of this scheme is to take up to 130,000 lambs off the market in Ireland and the UK. I am happy to say that there has already been strong interest in the scheme and Ireland's allocation under this scheme has now been fully taken up. I am confident that this measure will play a significant part in restoring market confidence to the sector.</P>
      <P>At my request, An Bord Bia was recently launched a promotion campaign to encourage demand by informing consumers about the positive qualities of Irish lamb. A similar promotion, directed specifically at hill lamb, will be launched shortly.</P>
      <P>Headage payments, which will amount to £22 million, commenced last week. In addition, the second instalment of the 1999 ewe premium has been fixed recently and payments, amounting to £25 million, will commence as soon as EU regulations permit. In view of the particular difficulties facing sheep producers at the present time, I had asked the Commission to fix the second instalment at 50 per cent in order to provide an immediate income boost to sheep producers. However, in spite of support from a number of member states, the Commission refused to accede to my request.</P>
      <P>The Sheepmeat Forum, which I set up in February 1998, has now submitted its report to me. The report contains a number of recommendations which, if implemented, would help to improve the overall position of the industry including the income of sheep producers. I look forward to working with the industry in successfully implementing these recommendations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation which prevailed in Northern Ireland was quite different to the problems experienced here. The aid scheme in Northern Ireland was introduced on animal welfare grounds. Following a fire at a pigmeat plant there, a backlog of overweight and potentially unsaleable pigs built up arising from a loss of approximately 40 per cent of the slaughtering capacity in the region and in turn to severe overcrowding on holdings as pig producers were unable to find alternative slaughtering outlets.</P>
      <P>In the Republic, pig producers in the Border counties, while initially experiencing some difficulties in getting pigs slaughtered, were facilitated by the reopening of a pigmeat plant in Cavan which provided an increase in slaughtering capacity for the region. In addition two more plants, in County Westmeath and County Meath, were given EU export status further increasing slaughtering capacity for the region. Also overtime and weekend slaughtering at certain other EU approved export plants was arranged, and led to the backlog being quickly eliminated.</P>
      <P>While pigmeat prices paid to producers at the time were low throughout the EU, the generous increases in export refunds, the introduction of an aids to private storage scheme and the agreement of a food aid package for Russia, which included 100,000 tonnes of pigmeat, all combined to strengthen and improve the pigmeat market.</P>
      <P>Pig prices have increased substantially since the beginning of the year and indications are that the market will improve further. In the circumstances of the current state of the pigmeat market, the introduction of an aid scheme for pig producers would not meet with EU Commission approval.</P>
      <P>Commission Decision 1999/591/EC of 9 June 1999, which contains details of the aid scheme introduced in Northern Ireland clearly shows that it was the exceptional circumstances of the case which allowed aid to be paid for pigs to be removed from the food chain and sent for rendering. It also indicates that the prices paid to Northern producers for their overweight animals &ndash; 110 kg. liveweight and above &ndash; was set at a maximum of £30 sterling per pig which is equivalent to about IR£36. Average prices paid to producers in our Border counties during this time were considerably higher. I will arrange for a copy of the Commission decision to be sent to the Deputy.</P>

      <P>The title of my Department was changed, with effect from 27 September 1999, to the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development to reflect its role as the lead Department in providing the central focus and drive for rural development policy matters.</P>
      <P>As set out in the White Paper, a Cabinet sub-committee chaired by the Taoiseach and comprising Ministers and Ministers of State whose responsibilities impinge on rural development will ensure policy co-ordination at the highest level. An interdepartmental policy committee comprising senior officials of the relevant Departments will report directly to the Cabinet sub-committee.</P>
      <P>The input of local and regional authorities, the social partners and the wider voluntary and community sector to rural development policy issues will be ensured through the establishment of a national rural development forum.</P>
      <P>In addition, procedures will be introduced for the rural proofing of national policies so that policy makers are aware of the likely impact of their proposals on the economic, social, cultural and environmental well-being of rural communities.</P>
      <P>The Government's intention is that the general principles and commitments in the White Paper will be reflected in the national development plan.</P>

      <P>The enforced replacement of imported food products with home produced products is a concept which is completely contrary to the principles of the Single Market and one which would not be at all in our best interests. The free movement of goods within the Single Market and the increased trade liberalisation which has taken place at international level is very much to the advantage of the Irish food industry. The proof of this is that in 1998 the value of our food exports, at just over £5 billion was more than double that of our imports.</P>
      <P>The food industry development group which reported earlier this year identified competitiveness as the key factor which would influence the industry's ability to sustain and increase its share of both domestic and export markets. The group also made a number of recommendations as to how the industry's competitiveness might be improved. These will form the basis of the future development programme for the industry which is being drawn up as part of the National Development Plan.</P>

    <P>Orthodontic services are provided on an out-patient basis and my Department has recently begun to collect information regarding waiting lists in this area. I will arrange to have information in respect of the Western Health Board forwarded to the Deputy as soon as it is available.</P>
    <P>The provision of medical services is a matter for the Western Health Board in the first instance. The board received funding of £867,000 under the waiting list initiative in 1998 which represented an increase of 44 per cent on the funding approved by the previous Government in 1997. In 1999 I provided a total of £1,773,000 to the Western Health Board under the waiting list initiative. The board's waiting list returns for the quarter ended 31 March 1999 indicate that a reduction of 523 or 13.48 per cent has already been achieved in the numbers waiting since the start of the year.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that nationally, the waiting list figures at the end of June 1999 show a reduction of 1,072 on the March figures. This means that waiting lists have fallen by almost 3,000, 8 per cent, since the beginning of this year. The reductions in March and June 1999 are the first since December 1996. The results are the first time in which waiting lists have fallen in two successive quarters.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1336" /> Since coming into office I have taken an integrated approach to the problem of waiting lists. As the Deputy will be aware, I commissioned a review of the waiting list initiative. I am now implementing a series of measures aimed at tackling the root causes of waiting lists. I allocated £20 million this year to agencies specifically to undertake waiting list work, with £3 million of this funding being allocated to the agencies who achieved the greatest improvements in their waiting lists in the first quarter of the year. This was in line with the recommendations of the review group report.</P>
    <P>I also allocated £9 million to services to older people and £2 million to accident and emergency services with the aim of freeing acute hospital beds by ensuring the streamlining of emergency services and providing additional step-down and rehabilitation facilities for older people.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the measures I have taken in tackling waiting lists represents the best way of addressing the underlying causes of waiting lists and long waiting times.</P>

      <P>The provision of medical services to eligible persons at Waterford Regional Hospital is a matter for the South-Eastern Health Board in the first instance. The board received funding of £697,000 under the waiting list initiative in 1998 which represented an increase of 44 per cent on the funding approved by the previous Government in 1997. In 1999 I provided a total of £1,351,000 to the South-Eastern Health Board under the waiting list initiative. The board's waiting list returns for the quarter ended 30 June 1999 indicate that a reduction of 139 or 84.2 per cent has already been achieved in the numbers waiting for general surgery at Waterford Regional Hospital since the start of the year.

      <P>The drug cost subsidisation and drugs refund schemes were merged into one new drug payment scheme with a threshold of £42 per month per family unit on 1 July.</P>
      <P>A common list of reimbursable medicines was introduced for the GMS scheme and the new drugs payment scheme to ensure equity in relation to the range of medicines paid for by the State under both schemes. Previously, medicines which were not available to medical card holders under the general medical services scheme, generally over the counter items such as cough bottles, vitamins, skin treatment preparations, etc., were reimbursable under the drug cost subsidisation and drug refund schemes.</P>
      <P>To facilitate a more equitable system, the list of drugs, medicines and appliances available to GMS patients as specified in the current GMS code book, including all updates, now forms the common list of items for both the GMS and the new drugs payment scheme. Products available on the common list must meet a set of criteria which includes requirements on the uses for and licensing of medicines and also that the products should not be advertised or promoted to the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Emollient products of the nature referred to by the Deputy were the subject of considerable examination in my Department when the common list of items to be reimbursed under the new drugs payment scheme was being examined. On the basis of this examination, it was decided to make available a range of emollient products on a generic basis and for which a flat rate price was established. Under this arrangement the follow<Col N="1338" /> ing products were added to the scheme, namely, aqueous cream, emulsifying ointment, silcocks base and haldens emulsifying base. Hydrocotisyl has been reimbursable for many years.</P>
    <P>Emollient products are considered to be borderline medicinal/cosmetic products and only when used in certain circumstances may they be considered as being eligible for reimbursement under the scheme as if they were medicinal products. It is on this basis that arrangements for the reimbursement of the above products were made. Emollient products are often used in association with other products which are available under the scheme.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the common list provides a comprehensive range of the most modern therapies and I would add that this common list is subject to ongoing review and is updated on a monthly basis.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Provision is made for the civil registration of marriages, including marriages according to the rites and ceremonies &ndash; usages of the different religious denominations. The manner in which marriages are registered is provided for under the Marriage (Ireland) Act, 1844, and the Registration of Marriages (Ireland) Act, 1863. Depending on the denominational nature of the <Col N="1339" /> marriage ceremony, the registration will be effected by a Register of Births, Deaths and Marriages, the solemnising minister or the Registrar for Civil Marriages. There is no fee directly payable by a party to a religious marriage for the civil registration of that marriage. Fees payable to a Registrar of Marriages are set out in SI No. 278 of 1987, in respect of a certified copy of the entry in the marriage register.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Long stay charges can be made under two sets of regulations. Charges can be made under the Institutional Assistance Regulations 1965, where the patient receives &ldquo;shelter and maintenance&rdquo; rather than treatment. These charges apply from the date of admission and are payable by all patients who are in receipt of incomes including medical card holders and persons with dependants.</P>
      <P>Charges can also be made under the Health (Charges for In-Patient Services) Regulations 1976, as amended by the Health (Charges for In-Patient Services) (Amendment) Regulations 1987. These regulations enable charges to be made towards the cost of providing hospital in-patient services for persons with income who have been in receipt of such services for more than 30 days or for periods totalling more than 30 days within the previous 12 months. Medical card holders are exempt from these charges. In practice, however, persons in long stay care do not usually hold medical cards as the hospital takes responsibility for all of the person's health needs. Persons with dependants are also exempt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The over-riding consideration in applying long <Col N="1340" /> stay charges is that persons with means who are in receipt of long-term care should make a contribution towards the cost of their maintenance. In deciding the amount to be contributed health boards have regard to the person's individual circumstances. Allowance is made for any financial commitments the person may have and a reasonable amount is left to meet the person's personal needs. Charges may be waived if, in the opinion of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board, payment would cause undue hardship.</P>

The health boards decide, in consultation with their local co-ordinating committees for physical and sensory disabilities, the priorities for development of services in their functional area. In 1999 a total of £3 million, rising to £6 million in the year 2000, was provided to the health boards for the development of services to people with physical and sensory disability services. Of this funding £300,000, rising to £600,000 in the year 2000, was provided to the Western Health Board.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In light of the increased funding available, library authorities were asked by my Department in January 1999 to submit a prioritised list of library projects in order that an expenditure programme could be formulated by the Department. The priority building proposal identified by Kerry library authority to my Department was the Tralee library and headquarters, pro<Col N="1345" /> posals for which are currently under examination in my Department. The proposed new library in Castleisland is included in the list supplied by the library authority but with a lower level of priority.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year I approved a multi-annual expenditure programme for library development which, together with projects already under construction involves a commitment of over £25 million in grant aid in the period 1999-2002. The programme includes the funding of a mobile library and a delivery van for Kerry library authority.</P>
    <P>The intention, arising from the &ldquo;branching out&rdquo; review of public library policy, is to complete a major redevelopment of our public library infrastructure over an eight year period from 1999-2006.

The application of an income limit and the manner of its operation are matters for individual housing authorities but they must be satisfied that applicants are in need of housing and unable to provide it from their own resources. In relation to the latter, authorities have been advised that they should, in assessing applications, have regard to household income. Authorities have also been advised that the specification of a rigid income limit might unreasonably exclude from housing certain persons who, because of their overall circumstances, might not be in a position to provide adequate and suitable accommodation from their own resources.</P>

      <P>Information supplied by fire authorities indicates that fatalities from fires in the home which were attended by fire brigades totalled 45 in 1998, 45 in 1997 and 50 in 1996.</P>
      <P>Fire safety in the home is the responsibility of the individual householder. Better awareness of the dangers of fire and of fire hazards, together with simple common sense fire prevention practices and the installation of smoke alarms, can help to prevent and reduce the number of fires and the consequent tragic fatalities and injuries. Accordingly, the National Safety Council actively encourages fire safety in the home as part of its ongoing fire safety education and publicity campaigns. Particular stress has been placed in recent media campaigns on the routine tasks to be carried out nightly to guard against fire and on the value of smoke alarms which, if properly installed and maintained, can provide early warning of fire and save lives. In addition, local authorities have been asked by my Department to consider the provision of smoke alarms in all their rented dwellings.</P>
      <P>The consolidated building regulations and revised technical guidance documents, which I published in 1997, recommended that all new dwellings commencing on or after 1 July 1998 be fitted with a smoke alarm operated off the mains electricity supply rather than a battery operated system.</P>

      <P>The affordable housing scheme involves <Col N="1350" /> the provision by local authorities of additional new houses specifically for low income house purchasers on land provided by the local authorities. On the 8 April 1999, all housing authorities were requested to assess the extent to which the new affordable housing scheme could appropriately be used in their areas and to formulate proposals for specific developments which should be brought to construction at the earliest possible date.</P>
      <P>The development of suitable sites, including, where necessary, the acquisition of land and the planning and construction of houses does, of necessity, require some time to arrange. Nevertheless, the new scheme is progressing satisfactorily and I expect that some 100 houses will become available under the scheme by the end of this year. There are a significant number of affordable housing projects at planning stage throughout the country and I envisage that some 1,400 houses will be provided under the scheme by the end of 2000.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 198 and 199 together.</P>
      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme provides entitlement to any person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs. The scheme is administered by the health boards on behalf of my Department. Payment is made in accordance with the relevant legislation as long as the person is resident in the State. Payments to asylum seekers, and to people who may be found in due course to be illegal immigrants, are made on the same basis as payments to other recipients.</P>
      <P>Total expenditure on SWA payments to asylum seekers was approximately £22 million in 1998. Expenditure to date in 1999 is estimated at £25 million and is expected to reach £35 million by the end of 1999.</P>
      <P>The proportion of this expenditure attributable to persons who may be found to be illegal immigrants is not available. In relation to feedback from community welfare officers, my officials liaise regularly with health board staff. Control measures are in place to ensure that action is taken when inappropriate claims for SWA are made, whether by illegal immigrants or by any other groups.</P>
      <P>The United Kingdom has not, in fact, introduced a new system to meet the basic needs of asylum seekers but it intends to do so with effect from 1 April next. The new system will be overseen by the UK Home Office and my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, is monitoring those developments.</P>

      <Quest>his views on the allowance of £5 per week payable under the national fuel scheme from October to April to old age pensioners and other recipients of social welfare payments; and if he will increase the national fuel scheme allowance to £10 per week.</Quest>

      <P>The aim of the national fuel scheme is to assist householders who are on long-term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs. A payment of £5 per week &ndash; £8 per week in smokeless zones &ndash; is paid to eligible households for 26 weeks from mid October to mid April.</P>
      <P>In order to be eligible for assistance under the national fuel scheme, the person must satisfy a means test. A substantial improvement in the means test was introduced in the 1999 budget. A person may now have savings/investments of up to £22,400 or a combined household income of up to £30 per week over and above their pension and still qualify for fuel allowance.</P>
      <P>Any change in the rate of payment would have significant cost implications and could only be considered in a budgetary context.</P>
      <P>The fuel and light component of the consumer price index rose by 9.6 per cent between August 1985 and August 1999. Any increase in the rate of payment would have to be considered in the light of the modest increase in domestic fuel prices since the current rate of the fuel allowance was set, taking into account the substantial increases in primary payment rates over the same period. In that regard, substantial increases in all the social welfare primary payments of either £3 or £6 per week were paid from June 1999.</P>
      <P>Fuel allowances are not the sole mechanism through which assistance is provided to people with heating needs.</P>
      <P>There is a facility available through the supplementary welfare allowance scheme to assist people in certain circumstances who have special heating needs. An application for a heating supplement may be made by contacting the community welfare officer at the local health centre.</P>
      <P>Where a person would not normally qualify for a heating supplement there is provision under the SWA scheme to pay an exceptional needs payment &ndash; ENP. ENPs are payable at the discretion of the health board, taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case.</P>

      <P>Farm assist is a means-tested scheme which was introduced to provide weekly income support to low income farmers. Payment is based on a factual assessment of means which is designed to reflect the person's actual net income, i.e., gross income less any expenses necessarily incurred. Income and expenditure figures for the preceding year are generally used as an indicator of the expected position in the following year, although account is taken of any exceptional circumstances in an effort to ensure that the assessment accurately reflects the current situation. Income from the sale of animals would have to be taken into account where it is a feature.</P>
      <P>For farm assist purposes, deductions are allowed from net income in respect of qualified children and the balance is assessed at 80 per cent. In this regard, the provisions are more favourable than the scheme's predecessor, the unemployment assistance scheme for small-holders.</P>
      <P>Each applicant for farm assist is given a copy of the report upon which entitlement is determined and may request a review if he or she is not satisfied with the basis of the assessment. In addition, any farmer who is not happy with a decision may appeal it to the independent social welfare appeals office.</P>

      <P>The back to school clothing and footwear allowance scheme is administered on behalf of my Department by the health boards. The scheme is designed to assist certain recipients of social welfare and health board payments with the cost of children's school uniforms and footwear. Certain people on low incomes who are in receipt of family income supplement may also qualify.</P>
      <P>In order to qualify for the allowance, the claim must be in respect of a qualified child, the applicant must be in receipt of a qualifying payment and they must satisfy a specified means test. A qualified child is one who falls into one of the age groups specified for the scheme and in respect of whom a child dependant allowance is payable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Comptroller and Auditor General examined the administration of the scheme in 1998 and <Col N="1354" /> concluded that the current system of administering the scheme through the health boards should be changed. A working group has now been established to undertake a fundamental review of the scheme as part of my Department's series of programme expenditure evaluations. Over 50 statutory and voluntary organisations and interest groups have been invited to comment on all aspects of the scheme.</P>
    <P>The working group will examine all aspects of the scheme, including the procedures for applying for the allowance. The conclusions reached by the Comptroller and Auditor General and the views expressed in the widespread consultation process which is now under way will be carefully considered when the working group is making its recommendations.</P>

      <P>As stated in An Action Programme for the Millennium, the Government is firmly committed to the achievement of an old age pension rate of £100 per week by 2002. An important step towards achieving this objective was taken in last year's budget, which delivered increases of £6 in the maximum personal rates of all pensions. This means that in the two budgets since taking office the Government has moved half way towards achieving the £100 target old age pension rate.</P>
      <P>In formulating proposals for budget 2000, I will be endeavouring to make further progress towards achieving the £100 target rate.

      <P>Mink became established in the wild in Ireland, having escaped from mink farms in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Descendants of these mink, known as feral mink, are now present in every county in Ireland. There are no detailed population estimates for mink but mink densities vary considerably in Ireland and are largely determined by the quality of habitat. While mink numbers can vary slightly from year to year in response to favourable conditions or during the early colonisation of habitat areas, their numbers soon stabilise. Vermin is not a term defined under the Wildlife Act, 1976, but mink are considered an unwelcome predator by many interests, such as the hunter, farmer and fishcatcher who do not wish their game or domestic stocks to be subjected to an unwelcome and agile hunter. As mink are not protected under the Wildlife Act, 1976, they can be freely hunted or controlled by landowners and/or their agents.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 213 and 215 together.</P>
      <P>I have not received a specific proposal from the organisation concerned requesting grant aid to develop a seven acre coastal site given by Fingal County Council. However, I would refer the Deputy to my replies to Questions No. 308 of 9 Márta 1999, No. 312 of 16 Feabhra 1999, No. 305 of 8 Nollaig 1998 and No. 21 of 7 Bealtaine 1998 regarding funding by my Department for the organisation concerned. My primary responsibility under the Wildlife Act, 1976, is for wildlife conservation and, in the case of seals relates to ensuring the protection and conservation of the species. However, the care of individual seals is an animal welfare matter for which I have no function under the Wildlife Act, 1976.</P>

      <P>The only water level controls south of Athlone operated by Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department, are the sluices and weir boards at Meelick. I understand that the weir boards were removed and the sluices fully opened three weeks ago. The rise in the level of the Shannon was solely due to the recent unseasonally high amount of rainfall which was well over double the average level for September.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 216 to 219, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>A major programme of works, involving conservation and presentation of the castle and its demesne, has been under way at Portumna Castle since 1989. The current phase of works has been funded under the European Union's Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-99, and I am obliged under that programme to complete a project with a strong tourism dimension before the end of 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1359" /> I am pleased to inform the Deputies that significant progress has been made at Portumna Castle under the current phase of works and that the original allocation of £1.6 million for this phase of the project will in fact be exceeded by end 2000. An important feature of my Department's activities at Portumna was the decision to allow incremental tourist access to the castle as works proceeded, rather than close off the site until the project's conclusion. As a result, Portumna Castle and its estate has already contributed to the economic and social development of the Portumna area.</P>
    <P>Expenditure on the project during the period 1997-99 was: 1997 &ndash; £411,000, 1998 &ndash; £399,000 and 1999 (to end of August) £218,000.</P>
    <P>Specifically the works since 1997 have involved the construction of some new floors of the castle; expert repair and specialist glazing of the extensive window complex at the castle; plaster conservation works in the stairwell; resurfacing and public lighting of the road from the entrance gate to the marina; research on and preparation of an enhanced exhibition on the lifestyle of the Clanricarde family, as well as major archaeological investigation of the drainage system and subsequent remedial repairs to the drains in order to alleviate flooding in the basement; associated re-instatement of excavated areas; major works to the external boundary walls and paths and surfaces for the herb garden and its walls.</P>
    <P>On the subject of the installation of a stairway to the castle, the priority is to facilitate the maximum visitor access to the castle by the end of this phase and, to this end, a stairway of oak and steel construction will be installed next year in the courtyard wing of the castle. This will permit access to the upper areas and meet the essential health and safety requirements of visitors to this national monument.</P>
    <P>The current EU funded project will be completed next year with the completion of the first and second floors at the castle; provision of the oak and steel stairway; some additional plaster conservation works; the repair of the chimney stacks and miscellaneous minor works; the provision of an enhanced exhibition and the tidying up of the adjoining courtyard. This courtyard area can then be considered for possible new use. My Department's workforce, which is currently accommodated in this courtyard will, in the meantime, move to the 19th century courtyard located several hundred metres away on the estate where some refurbishment work has already taken place.</P>
    <P>Regarding the next national development plan 2000-2006, I have yet to finalise my Department's <Col N="1360" /> capital programme of works for that period. In this regard, however, I must refer the Deputies again to the fact that a significant investment will have been made at Portumna Castle by the completion of the current phase of works and that a significant and discrete tourist amenity will be in place as a result.</P>
    <P>The Deputies will be aware that a draft management plan for Portumna estate was completed last year and I have received a number of submissions from local interest groups on the contents of that draft plan. I am keenly aware of the proposal from the wild geese heritage research group for the use of a library space at the castle and I will keep this proposal in mind when drawing up my programme of capital works under the national development plan 2000-2006.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should inform the Deputies that Portumna Castle is now in the care of Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department, and that the Office of Public Works no longer has responsibilities in this area.</P>

    <P>(a)It should be noted that these decisions refer to the year in which the decisions were taken and not to the year in which the applications were lodged.</P>
    <P>(b)The practice of granting temporary leave to remain at the first instance ceased with effect from December 1997 following the introduction of revised procedures for processing claims as notified to the UNHCR. The granting of temporary leave to remain is considered by the Minister after the asylum process.</P>
    <P>(c)The grounds on which it may be determined that an application for asylum is manifestly unfounded were introduced in December 1997.</P>
    <P>(d)In addition a total of 452 cases were withdrawn in 1998 prior to the implementation of the procedures for deeming cases abandoned. These cases are reflected in the statistics in table 1 in the category &ldquo;applications withdrawn before decision&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>The Irish nationality and citizenship legislation provides that the granting of a certificate of naturalisation is at my absolute discretion. The legislation also provides that an applicant must comply with certain conditions. These include that an applicant has five years residence in the State, is of good character and has an intention to continue to reside in the State following naturalisation.</P>
      <P>I considered the application from the person referred to by the Deputy on the basis of the legislative provisions and the information contained on the applicant's departmental files. If the Deputy is in possession of information which he believes is at variance with the information which was available to me, I would ask him to write to me with further details. I will then give the case further consideration and advise both the Deputy and the applicant of the outcome.</P>

      <P>I am further informed that the Land Registry issued a query on this dealing to the applicant's solicitor on 7 September 1999 and a reply is awaited. The query raised must be satisfactorily discharged before the matter can proceed.</P>

      <P>The pupil-teacher ratio in second level schools has reduced significantly in recent years.</P>
      <P>The actual pupil-teacher ratio in 1998-9 was of the order of 15.4 to 1. The Deputy will be aware that an additional 225 teaching posts are being created in second level schools for the 1999-2000 school year. In addition, a retention ratio of 18:1 is being applied which has resulted in schools being allowed to retain teachers who might otherwise have been redeployed.</P>
      <P>School authorities may apply for an increase in the approved teacher allocation to cater for particular circumstances. Applications of this nature are considered under the curricular appeal process and each case is considered on its merits.</P>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that the question of further reducing the pupil-teacher ratio and thereby reducing class sizes will be kept under review in the context of available resources.</P>

      <P>The development of the new service must occur on a phased basis. It is envisaged that all schools will have access to the service provided by the agency at the end of a five year period. It is hoped that there will be the nucleus of an educational psychological service in every county, including County Kildare, by the end of 1999. The service will be organised on a regional basis in close consultation with the clinical psychological services of the health boards which will continue to provide a service to parents and children.</P>
      <P>One of the issues which will be considered by the National Educational Psychological Service Agency is how interim support may be provided to students and schools that do not yet have access to its service.</P>

      <P>An additional 19 teacher posts have been sanctioned for schools in County Galway as a result of improvements in the staffing schedule for the 1999-2000 school year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An additional 16 remedial teacher posts have been allocated to the county as a result of the extension of the remedial teacher service to all schools in the country with a pupil-teacher ratio of 10:1 or more. There are three schools in <Col N="1372" /> County Galway with a pupil-teacher ratio below 10:1. The remedial service has not been extended to these schools. However, the schools in question are free to make an application to my Department for such a service provided they can demonstrate a need for such support.</P>
    <P>Under a major new initiative in the special education area, all children in the primary system assessed as having special needs arising from a disability are now entitled to an automatic response to those needs. The nature and level of the response in each case will depend on the assessed needs of the child or group of children involved. The response may take the form of full-time or part-time teaching support or child care support, or both, depending on the number of children involved and the nature of their needs.</P>
    <P>Prior to the commencement of the current school year, a total of 26 resource teacher posts had been allocated to schools in County Galway. Applications in respect of an additional 14 resource teacher posts for the county are currently being examined by my Department's inspectorate.</P>
    <P>The estimated cost of the 35 additional teacher posts allocated to County Galway for the current school year is £875,000.</P>

      <Quest>the reason a person (details supplied) in County Mayo, who works as a resource teacher for traveller children, is not entitled to a full teacher's salary in spite of the fact that she does not require Irish to carry out her duties and teachers who do not use Irish to carry out their teaching duties have been exempted from this rule.</Quest>

      <P>My Department allocates resource teacher for traveller posts to primary schools to cater for the educational needs of traveller children. Pupils from the travelling community are taught all areas of the primary school curriculum, including Irish.</P>
      <P>Teachers selected for such post are required to be fully qualified primary school teachers, who, having satisfactorily completed their probationary period, have secured the Department's teaching diploma. Traveller pupils are taught in an integrated setting, either within the ordinary classrooms, where the resource teacher for travellers works in partnership with the ordinary classroom teacher, or are withdrawn in groups for intensive tuition by the resource teacher for travellers.</P>
      <P>My Department grants restricted recognition to certain teachers who have a recognised primary teacher qualification from another jurisdiction. These are teachers who are qualified to teach aspects of the primary school curriculum to pupils aged four to 12 years but who are not qualified to teach in mainstream national schools because they do not have an appropriate Irish language qualification. Restricted recognition gives eligibility to teach only in certain categories of special schools and in certain categories of special classes in mainstream schools where Irish is not a curriculum requirement. Resource teachers for travellers do not fall into this category.</P>
      <P>The teacher referred to by the Deputy has been granted restricted recognition by my Department to teach only in certain categories of special schools and special classes.</P>
      <P>However, the board of management of the school where this teacher is now working as a temporary resource teacher for travellers experienced difficulties in recruiting a suitably qualified primary school teacher for the position. As an exceptional measure, the board was allowed to employ this teacher in a temporary capacity. However, as she is not fully qualified for this post, she is paid the rate applicable to her qualification which is the EU qualified rate.</P>
