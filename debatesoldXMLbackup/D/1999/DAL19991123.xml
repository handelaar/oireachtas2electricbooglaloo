    <P>Mr. J. Bruton: On a point of order, with the indulgence of the Chair, if the Taoiseach proposes to take Questions Nos. 1 to 20 together, would he agree to postpone Questions Nos. 2, 3, 7, 8, 10 and 11 to another day given that they concern matters of an economic nature that were discussed during his visit to New York which might be better dealt with separately from the important issues concerning Northern Ireland? I understand Deputy Quinn would agree to his question being postponed. I have not had an opportunity to ask Deputies Joe Higgins or Ó Caoláin if they would agree, but if they do I hope the Taoiseach will agree to the questions concerning his trip to New York being taken tomorrow rather than dealt with in conjunction with the questions of great national importance concerning Northern Ireland he has to deal with today.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1, 4, 5, 6, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 and 20 together.</P>
      <P>It is no exaggeration to say that today we stand at the threshold of a transformation in the history of this island and these islands. It is 18 months since the people, North and South, so overwhelmingly endorsed the Good Friday Agreement. We knew then that its implementation would not be easy, but I doubt if any of us expected so prolonged and frustrating a stalemate but, finally, the path ahead has been mapped. The only outstanding question is whether we can all together, North and South, Nationalist and republican, Unionist and loyalist, summon up the resolve needed to take that path.</P>
      <P>The successful conclusion of the Mitchell review would have been impossible without the patience, wisdom and commitment of its extraordinary chairman. Many well-deserved tributes have been paid to George Mitchell, but no words, however glowing, would be enough to convey just how much we all owe him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The contribution of the parties was also enormous. They all worked extremely hard during the review, and each showed courage and determi<Col N="452" /> nation. The slow development of mutual trust and confidence did prove essential, but over and above that, the leaders of both the Ulster Unionists and Sinn Féin have taken risks and displayed leadership of the highest order in moving towards an accommodation on issues which are profoundly difficult for them and their communities. The SDLP has offered support and insight at all times and will play a central role in the new institutions. I wish David Trimble and his supporters the best of luck in their efforts to win the backing of the Ulster Unionist Council.</P>
    <P>What we all want to see is the full implementation of the Agreement, in all its aspects. We said during the referendum campaign that it had to be accepted as a package. Understandably, perspectives on the individual elements differ, but those elements will stand, or fall, together. All must be delivered in accordance with the terms of the Agreement.</P>
    <P>The review was about finding an agreed basis for the achievement of devolution and the establishment of the institutions and for the achievement of decommissioning. It has long been clear that both are essential if the Agreement is to work. That is why I welcome and endorse Senator Mitchell's key conclusion in which he said he believed &ldquo;that a basis now exists for devolution to occur, for the institutions to be established, and for decommissioning to take place as soon as possible&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Senator highlighted the central role of the de Chastelain Commission in achieving decommissioning, which we had stressed for the past 12 months, and its assessment was also published on Monday week last. The report of the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning was obviously a further welcome development in maintaining the momentum for progress.</P>
    <P>The commission accepted that the implementation of the Agreement in full would create a new context in which the situation would be transformed. In particular, it called on the paramilitary organisations to appoint authorised representatives to discuss modalities with it. We, in Government, agreed that this would represent a significant confidence building measure. Last Wednesday, the IRA responded positively to that call.</P>
    <P>Its statement's reiteration of the IRA's unequivocal commitment to peace, its comments on the significance on the Good Friday Agreement in terms of building a lasting peace and its acknowledgement of the leadership of Sinn Féin, taken together with the ceasefire over what is now a protracted period, carried real value. The decision of the IRA leadership, announced in the statement, to appoint a representative to enter into discussions with General de Chastelain and the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning, following the establishment of the institutions provided for in the Good Friday Agreement, was particularly significant.</P>
    <P>The British and Irish Governments are now moving to make the necessary arrangements to <Col N="453" /> proceed in accordance with the recommendation in the Senator's report. The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland will convene a meeting of the Assembly on Monday, 29 November, for the purpose of running the d'Hondt procedure for nominating Ministers. Subject to Ministers having been nominated, the Devolution Order will be laid before Parliament on 30 November to take effect on 2 December.</P>
    <P>Next Thursday, 2 December, is, therefore, the date on which powers will be devolved and the British-Irish Agreement will enter into force. The North-South Ministerial Council, the implementation bodies and the British-Irish Council will all be formally established on that day. Early inaugural meetings of the new institutions will be held. With the entry into force of the new Agreement, the Anglo-Irish Agreement of 1985 will cease to exist. The Government has always looked forward to the day when a new and broadly based agreement, negotiated by and with the support of both traditions, would replace and transcend that Agreement.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, on 2 December the Government will also meet to make the declaration necessary to bring the amended Articles 2 and 3 of our Constitution into effect, as the Agreement requires us to do. Some people have asked what will happen if, over time, other elements of the Agreement do not stand. This question arose during the referendum campaign last year. In the course of the negotiations on the Agreement and its implementation, all sides have been asked to take risks. We are playing our part. I confirm that the amendments, once made, will stand. It is my firm view that the new Articles 2 and 3 are a clear and updated expression of our people's basic principles.</P>
    <P>The Good Friday Agreement is based on the principles of inclusivity, equality and mutual respect. I welcome the Ulster Unionist Party's recognition and acceptance of these principles and of the legitimacy for nationalists to pursue their political objective of a united Ireland by consent through exclusively peaceful and democratic methods. The institutional and constitutional aspects of the Agreement are at its core. However, as I said earlier, all elements must be implemented. In particular, although decommissioning is a voluntary act and cannot be imposed, it is essential, as all parties have recognised.</P>
    <P>The consistent position of the Irish Government has been that we want to see the earliest possible decommissioning. There is now agreement that the right and only context for the achievement of decommissioning is the implementation of the Agreement as a whole, including the establishment of the institutions. As the independent commission has said, that will &ldquo;create a new context in which the situation will be transformed&rdquo;. Conversely, as Senator Mitchell has said, it is certain that if the institutions are not established there is no chance of decommissioning.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="454" /> I agree with Senator Mitchell's belief that in the context of the full implementation of the Agreement and in the transformed situation it will bring about there will be decommissioning. It is vital that all parties continue to exercise their influence, singly and collectively, to achieve that end. I pay tribute to the leadership they are already offering in that regard.</P>
    <P>The role of General de Chastelain and his commission will be central in taking the decommissioning process forward, as all parties agree. The commission will meet the authorised representatives of the paramilitary organisations after their appointment and will report shortly afterwards. Let us now be prepared to wait and see what the commission then says about the detailed issues involved and not involve ourselves in speculation.</P>
    <P>We are planning for, and we expect, success. The whole Agreement is based on mutual confidence, partnership and the sense that everybody is acting in good faith in implementing all of its terms. If there is difficulty either in relation to devolution or decommissioning we are by definition in a very serious situation. In those circumstances, where the Agreement was not being implemented in significant respects, the Governments would have to step in and assume their responsibilities, including through appropriate suspension arrangements. I repeat, we are not planning for failure. Our focus is on success and on ensuring that each of the provisions of the Agreement is implemented, as the people voted for last year. That is the task that is ahead of us and which we must all press on with.</P>
    <P>Despite the massive public support for the Good Friday Agreement, as expressed in the referendums, and despite the appalling outrage that was the Omagh bombing, a handful of dissidents continue to threaten the peace. The Government will take further vigorous pre-emptive action to frustrate the activities of any dissidents who do so. We will at the same time continue to refute a deeply flawed and outdated political analysis which misleads people into attempting futile but potentially lethal attacks that risk killing innocent people, whether in Northern Ireland or elsewhere. We have the laws in place to deprive them not only of their liberty but of their property and those laws will be used to the full in the case of any dissident group or individuals who store arms for use, or otherwise attempt to destabilise the peace. The British authorities will, I am certain, continue to move with equal determination against dissidents on all sides there, including those responsible for continuing sectarian attacks.</P>
    <P>With regard to the North South bodies, Deputies will be aware that the necessary legislation is in place and commencement orders require to be signed. This will be done as soon as the British-Irish Agreement enters into force. Intensive work has been under way to ensure that the bodies will be in a position to commence operation immediately on entry into force of the Agreement and that all steps necessary for their <Col N="455" /> full operation will be taken as soon as possible thereafter.</P>
    <P>With regard to constitutional change, when notifications are exchanged and the British-Irish Agreement then comes into force, the Government will make the declaration provided for in Article 29.7.3º of the Constitution, thus bringing the constitutional amendment into force with immediate effect. It is envisaged that the declaration will be made at a meeting of the Government, if necessary specially convened for that purpose.</P>
    <P>I thank the House for its patience with this long reply. I felt it would be more appropriate to make a statement in the House as part of a reply to questions. I thank the Opposition leaders.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome what the Taoiseach has said. Does he agree that Mr. Trimble needs not only the best of luck in getting agreement but every support that can be given to him from every quarter to ensure that the Ulster Unionist Council takes the right decision and works towards the full implementation of the Agreement?</P>
      <P>In that context, that the Taoiseach has stated clearly that the new wording of Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution will stand once the amendments are made represents an unconditional commitment which is very welcome and should be noted, particularly by members of the Ulster Unionist Council. Does the Taoiseach agree there is great significance in his saying that he believes there will be decommissioning? For a Taoiseach to make such a statement, with all the information that is available to him by nature of his office, is something of great importance. Does he agree that that should also be seen as something of great reassurance to the members of the Ulster Unionist Council in coming to their very important decision &ndash; a decision of great importance for them, for unionism and for all the people who live on this island and the neighbouring island?</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach has stated that in the event that he proves to be wrong &ndash; and I do not believe he will &ndash; and decommissioning does not take place, the Governments would have to &ldquo;step in and assume their responsibilities&rdquo; and suspend the Agreement. What account would be taken of the respective positions of parties in that circumstance, some of whom had completely fulfilled all their obligations under the Agreement and others who might not have, either themselves or through their associates? Would the Governments, in implementing those suspension arrangements, take account of the respective and relative performance of their obligations of different parties or would all parties be treated alike?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Bruton for his support. In reply to his first question, we have an obligation to do all we can to help all the parties. I do not underestimate the task of Mr. Trimble and I agree with what Deputy Bruton has stated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="456" /> There is a number of matters in my statement which should be emphasised. I thought it best to be absolutely clear and unequivocal about Articles 2 and 3. The question has been raised and people should take note of what I said. That also applies to how the Governments must deal with their responsibilities.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Bruton said, everyone is aware we are at a very sensitive time in this process. It is best that everyone speaks with a clear understanding of the position that has been agreed. That position was spelled out clearly last week in all the statements. I hope everyone has the same understanding of this. I am glad Gerry Adams said unequivocally in a statement last night that Sinn Féin had no hidden agenda, that its private position is the same as its public position and that it wants to see the full implementation of the Agreement.</P>
    <P>In reply to Deputy Bruton's point, that means that decommissioning by May 2000 was part of all the dealings in the past 19 months. I said today I would like it to happen as soon as possible. It was always the case that, while it was a voluntary act, it had to happen to give confidence in the Agreement. That is strongly my position. The sooner that happens, the better, because that would remove the pressures the issue would cause if it were ongoing &ndash; even if we get an enormous vote on the right side next week, as I hope we will. It should not delay getting to this position. The statements by Gerry Adams, the IRA and Sinn Féin last week can only be interpreted that way. It has always been my understanding that it is a voluntary act but it must happen. We got agreement on 25 June last on three issues &ndash; that there would be an inclusive Executive with devolved powers, that we would deal with decommissioning by May 2000 and that it would be dealt with under General John de Chastelain's commission. Those issues must be fulfilled for the Agreement to be a success.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton's last question related to the position we would take if we ran into difficulties. I wish to stress the positive, as does Deputy Bruton and, I am sure, every Member of the House. However, if the position is not positive &ndash; and we have had enough difficulties in the past 19 months and decades to require us to think about that issue &ndash; the Government will have to deal with its responsibilities and look at the institutions. The Government would then have a real dilemma, part of which would be having to see what could be established from the process. We would have to take everything into account. I do not have the answer today on what the Government would do. However, Deputy Bruton asked if we would take everything into account and, of course, we would. We have always said that is our view on devolution and, therefore, it is also our view on decommissioning that we would take every circumstance into account.</P>
    <P>However, all our efforts in this regard have been to make it an inclusive process and not to exclude people. I hope the confidence that has <Col N="457" /> been generated by the parties working together in the review period of 11 or 12 weeks will allow people to understand it. Everything I have heard and read and every report I have been given indicate strongly to me that if people are given the democratic right to say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; we will not have these difficulties but will be able to positively move forward to set up the institutions and to work collectively to deal with the economic, social, security and other problems of Northern Ireland. That is the trust and confidence we have. Let us hope the Government will not be called upon to make difficult decisions but if it is it will have to do so.</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that every act of every participant in putting together and implementing the Good Friday Agreement was voluntary? All agreements rest on the voluntary consent of those involved. The decommissioning of weapons therefore under the Good Friday Agreement is by definition and by its nature a voluntary act. There should not be consideration of the possibility of coercion being involved in the sense that all parties to the Agreement voluntarily became parties to it in all its aspects and are therefore voluntarily implementing it. In the event of any party, either itself or through its associates, being unable or unwilling to implement the Agreement in full that party will not be in the same position as parties which have implemented their part of the Agreement in full if a political assessment has to be made.</P>

      <P>There have been a number of cycles but we are back where we started in all respects. The best way to get everyone to work together, communicate and achieve success is as per the Agreement. Decommissioning has been the main but not the only difficulty and it is only right that it be dealt with. This has to be done voluntarily within the mechanism set down in the Agreement &ndash; the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning. We have now succeeded in doing this with the agreement of all the parties concerned. I am confident that everyone wants to deal with the issue and move on to deal with the many other important issues that remain to be dealt with. While I am aware of the importance and psychology of decommissioning which has been spoken about at length, General John de Chastelain and his colleagues on the independent international commission will deal with the issue. We have received the necessary commitments. We have achieved in the last week what we were not able to achieve in July when it was impossible to secure an IRA statement that the matter would be dealt with in its totality. It is unambiguous. The necessary rules and regulations are in place to achieve decommissioning if people work with General John de Chastelain. It is a fair assumption for me and others to make that it will happen. If it all goes wrong the two Governments, to use Deputy Bruton's own words, would have to take account, look at the <Col N="458" /> circumstances and ascertain where it all went wrong, the blame lay and difficult though it might be, construct a way forward.</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach welcome, as I do, the positive developments in the peace process, including the reiteration by Sinn Féin and the Ulster Unionist Party of their commitment to implement all aspects of the Good Friday Agreement and the statement by the IRA that the Agreement will contribute to a lasting peace? On a directly related matter, does the Taoiseach recognise and has he raised with the British Prime Minister an issue that I have raised here many times, the need for urgent progress on demilitarisation, particularly in south Armagh? Is it not hugely unhelpful, at a time such as this, that the Minister for Foreign Affairs has indicated in a reply to me recently, which I have already referred to in the House, that he has no intention of visiting south Armagh at the invitation of the South Armagh Farmers and Residents Committee as he promised to do over a year ago in my presence? Has the Taoiseach raised with the British Prime Minister the recent discovery in Stonyford Orange Hall, County Antrim, of so-called confidential British army files on some 400 Nationalists in different parts of the Six Counties area? Does the Taoiseach not agree that this is yet another damning indictment of collusion between the British forces and loyalists paramilitaries? What guarantee can be given now, that information passed from the Garda Síochána to the RUC will not end up in the hands of loyalist paramilitaries in the same way? Will the Taoiseach now require the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to end the flow of such information?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge the substantive statements that have been made to try to create peace and progress, and I welcome them. On the issue of demilitarisation, the Irish Government has continued to try to achieve the paper which has been discussed for some time now, as the Deputy is aware, which would lead to a substantial change in the current position, whether it is to do with towers or other military infrastructure in south Armagh and in other areas. Current issues will have an enormous influence on that. However, much of the military infrastructure there could be have been moved already, and we have continually emphasised that point. From my information and information from security journalists who have pointed to statistics over the years, these tower blocks, in addition to causing great difficulty for local communities, have not achieved much in terms of stopping terrorists and military operations on innocent people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have raised the issue of the files. It is of deep concern to the Government that so many names of Nationalist people, all of them innocent, as far as I know, were found in files in an orange hall. I note that the orange hall leadership has dis<Col N="459" /> sociated itself from any use of or storing of these files on its premises and has condemned the use of them by any loyalist organisations for attacks against Nationalist people. Garda and RUC activity and co-operation must continue because of the attacks that have taken place, but we would always emphasise that any information which has to be passed on should remain of a confidential nature. We are investigating where this information came from, the reason it came out, how it is being used and the contacting of people in relation to it.</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree with the comments made by the British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, in the House not so long ago that we have all gone too far to consider going back? Neither I nor the leader of Fine Gael believes things will go wrong, but if they do will the Taoiseach assure the House that some things will remain untouched. For example, as and from 2 December, assuming that the timetable proceeds, <Col N="460" /> will Articles 2 and 3 be forever changed? Will the Taoiseach confirm the view of the Labour Party and, I suspect, other parties, that there is no desire to reinstate the original Articles? This is an important matter for some people in Northern Ireland. Will the Taoiseach confirm that, irrespective of anything else that might happen, Articles 2 and 3, as amended and voted on so overwhelmingly by the people in the South on 22 May 1998, will remain?</P>
      <P>Will he further agree that we in this jurisdiction must be concerned for peace on the entire island, devolution within Northern Ireland and complete decommissioning according to the terms of the Agreement? Will he also reaffirm his statement that the Irish Government, in close collaboration with the British Government and the relevant security forces, will take every step to ensure no self-appointed group without a democratic mandate will have the right to attempt to frustrate the implementation of the Agreement? Will he further confirm that the full rigours of the law will be brought to bear on any such group which might attempt by physical means to disrupt this historic passage which will create a new beginning and a new set of relationships for all the people on this island and for the peoples of these two islands?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy's sentiments and we hope for success. The importance of success is greater than anything I have said in that it will give people a chance to live in peace and safety without the enormous security concerns with which they have lived for more than a generation. If this Agreement is successful people should look at all its aspects. I do not wish to add to the comments of many members of the Unionist Party over the weekend. They have stated that there are economic and social issues involved and that, important though they are, there is more to the world than constitutional and institutional issues. Ken Maginnis rightly stated that everyone on this island shares the desire for an ordinary economic life, investment, encouragement for people to work, to train and be educated and to see a better future. I would like the Agreement to succeed for these reasons, in addition to all the arguments concerning constitutional and institutional issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I stated in my reply that the issue of Articles 2 and 3 has arisen. I was asked this question several times last year and the situation is clear. I am not saying anything new, but I am conscious that some people in Northern Ireland think I and Members of this House have a different agenda. I wish to make it clear that on devolution day the Cabinet will meet and sign the relevant orders, and that the new Articles 2 and 3 will express the view of the people. That view could not have been better expressed in a relatively high poll, in terms of polls these days. There was a 96% vote for change and no one would argue with that view. I remind people, particularly our friends in Northern Ireland, that the people of the South <Col N="461" /> voted for change. The Government, on behalf of the Irish people, will implement that wish and Articles 2 and 3 will be the clear and updated expression of the people's basic principles.</P>
    <P>There are those who believe that, in some way, they have a greater right than the democratic Government and political system and that they can continue to engage in military activity. If they believe they have a right in that regard then we have an obligation to take that right away. I know the House supports the view that the legislation we reluctantly passed in autumn 1998&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;which we would like to amend again as it is not in line with the philosophy we like in terms of legislation, is necessary as we have found people training in bunkers, moving arms, still importing explosives and involved in other activities. If those people do not desist and if it becomes evident that they will continue, the full rigours of that legislation will have to be implemented in the toughest form. Otherwise we will return to a situation where our work will be undone and the country will again be in a difficult security situation. I am sure I speak for the Government and everybody in the House when I say that the only way to counteract such activity is to enforce the legislation in the toughest possible manner. I hope this is not necessary, but if it is it will be done.</P>

        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> In mentioning the role of various political leaders and parties in the peace process, will the Taoiseach acknowledge that above all it was the desire of the huge majority of ordinary people in the North for peace that constrained the parties and made them turn away from the disastrous sectarian and paramilitary strategies which were employed over the past 30 years? Will the Taoiseach acknowledge that while sectarian bigots on both sides did their best at times to plunge communities into civil war, it was the active intervention of the majority of working class people, including the ranks of trade unions who mobilised in their tens of thou<Col N="462" /> sands at crucial stages against sectarianism, which played a key role in moving towards peace? </P>
      <P>Will he further agree that in the event of some small unrepresentative sectarian or paramilitary group flying in the face of the desire of the vast majority for peace, draconian laws here or in the North will not be effective, but the solution lies in mobilising the will of the vast majority of people on the island and bringing it to bear on those who fly undemocratically in the face of it? Is the Taoiseach disturbed by the trend in recent years of dividing areas in the North according to religious affiliation, which amounts almost to a cantonisation? Will the Taoiseach agree that positive action to bring Protestant and Catholic communities together again is critical and that cross-community organisations have a crucial role in this regard?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledged the role of the SDLP and the loyalist parties. The SDLP, the Social, Democratic and Labour Party, has for a long time tried to mobilise and work with trade union movements. Later some loyalist parties and, more recently, all parties have done that. I freely acknowledge the work done, especially that of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions which has worked across the political and sectarian divide <Col N="463" /> down the years. It has been involved in a great deal of work, even when it was difficult to do so.</P>
      <P>Sectarianism will not go away overnight. There are still those who thrive on it and who believe that the creation of division by forcing people out of their homes is a legitimate plan. I totally oppose that as I am sure does everyone in House. We must support all the many community groups and organisations which endeavour to stop it. There has been a huge growth in human rights groups and the legislative structure has now been put in place under the Good Friday Agreement to deal with these issues. The agenda of most of the human rights work is to try to remove sectarianism. We spoke about that in the House recently and the need for people of all parties to try to stop sectarianism. I support those initiatives and will continue to do so.</P>

I hope the delegates and members of the UUP, who have a fine political tradition, will see that the issues which created difficulties and which could not be resolved at Hillsborough or Castle Buildings in July have been comprehensively dealt with and that as much understanding and agreement as possible has been reached.

Does the Taoiseach agree that the allies have had a number of good days recently but that we look forward to many more of those on this coming Saturday, during next week and into the new millennium? Has it come to the Taoiseach's attention that the Secretary of State, when referring in the House of Commons, to what the two Governments would do in the event of failure &ndash; I do not accept there will be failure &ndash; used the phrase &ldquo;it is understood that.&rdquo;  and went on to outline what he understood.

If one were to look at the negatives all the time in these discussions and debates and continually pose the question &ldquo;what will happen if..?&rdquo;, one would never arrive at the positives. If we approach this matter confidently, we will achieve resolution. All of the party leaders, through being positive and confident, have managed to arrive at new resolutions. Nobody has worked out all the possible permutations of what might happen if we run into difficulties. If that happens, the parties and Governments will have to take everything into account and assess the situation at that stage. It is not an underestimation to say that people will vote and support their various parties &ndash; I am conscious that it is not merely one party which must carry its people with them &ndash; in an effort to move forward. The Ulster Unionist Council, in particular, will vote for the future and the new millennium next week. They will vote to see whether Northern Ireland can have a new future where people can work together or whether the <i>status quo </i>will be maintained. I hope people will realise that the future can be better than the past.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Deputy's request for the cumulative mileage of the members of the Mountjoy visiting committee relates to the period January to July 1998. Should the Deputy require details of the cumulative mileage for a period other than that, I will provide them at a later stage.</P>
      <P>The cumulative mileage of the members of the Mountjoy visiting committee for the period January to July 1998 was 12,883 miles. It would not be possible to determine the cost of individual meetings without substantial uses of staff resources and time, given that it would involve the extraction and examination of each claim. In this regard, it should be noted that some visiting committee members submit claims monthly while others submit them less frequently, putting several claims on one form. However, the following data has been gleaned from the financial management system relating to travel and subsistence payments to the members of the Mountjoy visiting committee in respect of the period 1 January to 31 July 1998.</P>
      <P>The total travel costs for the Mountjoy visiting committee for the period in question was £8,770 and the total subsistence paid was £1,489.37. This translates to an average of £974.44 in travel costs and £165.49 in subsistence payments for each meeting. I should point out that visiting committee members do not receive any remuneration. Travel and subsistence allowances are paid in line with Civil Service rates.</P>
      <P>The composition of visiting committees is drawn from a wide geographical area to help to ensure that the diverse needs of prisoners are understood and met. This is the long-standing practice used by successive Ministers in appointing members of prison visiting committees. Moreover, previous visiting committees have generated similar levels of travelling expenses etc. to the membership of the committee referred to in the Deputy's question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were seven ordinary meetings and two <Col N="468" /> special meetings of the Mountjoy visiting committee between January and July 1998. The seven ordinary meetings were held to carry out the normal functions and duties of the committee. These functions and duties are provided for in the Prisons (Visiting Committee) Act, 1925, and the Prisons (Visiting Committee) Order, 1925.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information.</i>

      </i>These include: to visit the prison at frequent intervals and to hear complaints which may be made to them by any prisoner; to report to me any abuses observed or found by them in the prison and to report to me any repairs which they think may be urgently needed. The visiting committee has free access, either collectively or individually, to every part of their prison. In inspecting prisons, the visiting committee focuses on issues such as quality of accommodation, catering, medical, educational and welfare services and recreational facilities.</P>
    <P>Two special meetings were held by the committee to prepare their annual report for 1997 for submission to me, as required under the Prisons (Visiting Committee) Act, 1925.</P>

        <b>:</b> How can the Minister stand over a system, albeit a long-standing one, where the main monitoring unit for monitoring the performance of the prison system and the membership thereof is basically decided by virtue of a person's political affiliations? Membership is in no way related to a person's competence, skills, ability or training. In a prison system which is in chaos, there is an absolute need for professional monitoring carried out by people competently trained with suitable qualifications to carry out this task. Does the Minister agree it is high time to change the system, and I am not being political in this regard?</P>

      <P>The position in relation to the visiting committees is simple. People are not selected willy-nilly but on the basis of their capabilities. They are also selected to ensure a geographic spread. It is obviously in the interests of the prisoners that there is a vibrant visiting committee &ndash; there is in Mountjoy and I venture to suggest in other prisons as well. Successive Ministers for Justice have appointed good people to these committees and the work done by them <Col N="469" /> should not be denigrated in the manner Deputy Higgins seemed to do.</P>

Does he accept it is high time to introduce some fundamental regulations? Some 90% of the prison population in Mountjoy, for example, comes from the Dublin area. Therefore, people from within the Dublin catchment area should be on that visiting committee. Will the Minister not set down, as a binding regulation, that the membership of visiting committees for all prisons should be confined to people from within a 70 miles radius?</P>

That was the position under the previous Minister and those before her. In regard to the location of the people concerned, there is a good geographical spread. I have no doubt there was one or two people from Ballina on the prison visiting committees when Deputy Higgins was Government Chief Whip.

      <P>My Department provides funding for Victim Support which this year amounts to £651,000. This is an organisation dedicated to the provision of emotional and practical support to all victims of crime. It is a community based organisation with a large number of volunteers and a small professional staff. It has a 24 hour helpline and a number of special services, <Col N="470" /> including the support of victims before, during and after court proceedings.</P>
      <P>In relation to specialist counselling services for victims of sexual abuse, it, therefore, acts only as referral agency to other specialist groups, although many victims receive counselling in the context of the court accompaniment scheme.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware, however, that the Taoiseach this year announced a special fund of £4 million per annum to establish a dedicated counselling service in all regions. The health boards, in conjunction with the Department of Health and Children, are currently finalising proposals for the establishment of this service.</P>
      <P>Given the expertise in the health boards in regard to the organisation of services, including counselling services, the Department of Health and Children has not sought an input from my Department in regard to this specific issue.

      <P>Recently a woman in my constituency, who is the victim of a sexual assault, was confronted by her offender who had been convicted, sentenced and released. This confrontation took place at a supermarket checkout. It is unsatisfactory for such convicts to be released from prison without the victim being informed. Release, particularly of sex offenders, should be halted at least until the victim is informed of the release so that he or she is aware this person is returning to the community.</P>

      <P>This is a difficulty I recognised and, in the recently published charter for the victims of crime, there is provision whereby, if requested by the victim of sexual assault, the Prison Service would notify the Garda prior to the release of the perpetrator from prison on temporary release or at the end of his or her sentence. It is a different matter when the release is ordered by the courts because prior notification would not normally be possible for obvious reasons.</P>
      <P>I regret the situation Deputy Flanagan outlined and I sincerely trust the new charter for the victims of crime will ensure there will not be a recurrence of this. I would, however, caution that where the courts are concerned, it would not normally be possible to give the type of notification I would wish to see.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I put it to the Minister that the best possible support available to the victims of sexual abuse is that they would have an opportunity to take a civil action against the perpetrator of the crime. This Government and this Minister, in particular, are, in effect, barring hundreds of victims of crime from bringing civil actions under a new Bill which recently passed Committee Stage. The Minister has infuriated hundreds of victims of sexual abuse by this legislation which, in effect, offers a measure of protec<Col N="471" /> tion to abusers rather than lifting the bar on the statute of limitations.</P>

      <P>The extreme shortage of staff in prison headquarters and pressure of other work in local prisons led to this situation. Since the publication of the annual report relating to the year 1994, published in February 1997, a shortage of staff in the prisons division of the Department has meant that all staff time was prioritised to deal with day to day operational work. An integral part of the annual report is the provision of statistics on the throughput of prisoners. At present, the compilation and analysis of these statistics must be done manually as there are no computerised systems in most prisons. This is an extremely time-consuming and staff-intensive process. It has not been possible to release staff to work on the statistical analysis and editing required for the publication of the outstanding reports.</P>
      <P>The staffing situation is being addressed in the context of the establishment of the independent prison service. Under the proposed legislation to set up the service as a statutory authority, that body will take over the publication of the annual report. In the meantime, since the publication of the 1994 report, the annual reports of the visiting committees of each institution, which form part of the annual reports, have been published as they have been submitted to the Minister.</P>
      <P>A new £6 million information technology programme for the prison service is well advanced. As part of the programme, a comprehensive prisoner records database will be deployed across the prison service next year. This programme will address the lack of accessible information about prisoners, provide management with necessary information and enable the automation of many existing functions. Information will be more easily accessible once this new system is in operation. As an interim step, the Director General of the Prison Service, Mr. Sean Aylward, has informed me that he has deputed a senior member of his transition team to draw together material for a composite report to cover the years 1995 to 1998, inclusive, for issue in the first half of the year 2000.</P>

        <b>:</b> Does the Minister acknowledge it is an appalling admission from him that for the past five years, since 1994, we have had no report from the Prison Service? In those five years 50,000 people, 10,000 per annum, went through the prisons. We do not have a clue who they are, where they came from, what they were in for or whether they have been released. Does the Minister accept that to advance the argument now, or at any time in the past five or six years, that computerisation is not available is simply not an excuse? Computerisation should have been available. Does the Minister accept that, in view of prison being seen as a crucial instrument of our criminal justice and social poli<Col N="473" /> cies, we need an annual report with detailed information on who constitutes the prison population so that we can plan, monitor and improve the situation?</P>

At present Mountjoy and St. Patrick's are the only committal prisons linked to a computerised prison records system.

      <P>I am not satisfied that there are sufficient statistics available on the operation of our prisons and that is why the director of the Prison Service is moving to change the situation. There will be a modern system where data can be stored, analysed and publicised. Regarding the publication of reports, reports are published as they become available. I anticipate that the Council of Europe report, which has been brought before the Government, will be published shortly.</P>

      <P>Obviously I reject Deputy Higgins's remarks about the management of the Department. There are defects in our criminal justice system which I have been trying to remedy for the past two and half years. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is making a substantial investment in information technology for the Prison Service and the cornerstone of the programme is a new, comprehensive prisoner record system. It is at an advanced stage of development and is expected to be in operation in all prisons by the middle of next year. It will provide, for the first time, ready access to data on our prison population. The first year in which full statistics will be available from computers will be the year 2000. Perhaps Deputy Higgins would like to acknowledge that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Prisoners are committed to prison on foot of a court warrant which empowers the governor of the particular institution to hold the person named on the warrant. On committal to prison, the details on the warrant are read over to the person to be committed to ensure that he or she is aware of the reason for committal. If the person concerned contests the warrant, for example, if he or she states that he or she is not the person named on the warrant, verification is then sought. If the committing garda can identify the person, this is endorsed on the warrant. If the person is not known to the committing garda, he or she is taken away again and recommitted at a later time with some form of identification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of the committal procedure, a document known as a committal details form is completed. A prison reception officer enters the pris<Col N="475" /> oner's details on this form. The information entered is quite detailed and includes particulars of the current sentence and previous committal periods as well as personal details such as date of birth, address, next of kin, marital status, physical features and drug and psychiatric history. This form is signed by the reception officer and countersigned by the prisoner.</P>
    <P>A medical orderly or prison nurse also interviews each prisoner on committal. The medical orderly or nurse takes medical details from the prisoner, including particulars of his GP, if any, current medication and medical history. The prisoner is also questioned regarding his history of drug or alcohol abuse, psychiatric illness and previous self-harm to provide the relevant information. The details are recorded on a medical record form.</P>
    <P>The accuracy of the personal information entered on the committal and medical forms relies largely on the willingness of the prisoner to give full and frank details. The provision of any immediate follow up medical or other attention will often depend on the provision by the prisoner of accurate information.</P>
    <P>Each prisoner is seen by the prison doctor within 24 hours of committal. In the event that the doctor considers, on the basis of his examination or the details declared by the prisoner, that further specialist referral, including psychiatric referral, is necessary, this is arranged. In the case where a prisoner declares a medical issue requiring verification or consultation with other medical agencies in the community, the prison doctor would make the appropriate inquiries having obtained the prisoner's consent to do this.</P>

There are no details on previous convictions other than &ldquo;did you do this, that and the other or have you had.?&rdquo;. The information is all elicited by way of direct questions and answers with the person being incarcerated.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister not accept that what is needed is a detailed questionnaire which would provide detailed information that can and will be verified and cross referenced rather than taken at face value from the individual concerned?

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 34 and 40 together.</P>
      <P>The agreement reached in the multi-party negotiations in Belfast on 10 April 1998 included a commitment on the part of the Government to initiate a wide-ranging review of the Offences Against the State Acts with a view to both reform and dispensing with those elements no longer required as circumstances permit. Arising out of that commitment, I obtained Government authorisation to establish a committee to carry out such a review under the chairmanship of former Supreme Court Judge, Mr. Anthony Hederman. The committee also includes a number of independent legal experts as well as representatives from interested Departments, offices and agencies.</P>
      <P>The terms of reference of the committee provide that it will examine all aspects of the Offences Against the State Acts, 1939 to 1998, taking into account the view of the participants to the multi-party negotiations that the development of a peaceful environment on the basis of the Agreement can and should mean a normalisation of security arrangements and practices; the threat posed by international terrorism and organised crime; and Ireland's obligations under international law. The committee is to report to me as soon as practicable with recommendations for reform.</P>
      <P>The work of the committee is still ongoing. Deputies will appreciate that the terms of reference are very broad, requiring the committee to examine all legislation related to offences against the State over a period of 60 years and to consider how legislation might best respond to current threats from various sources while also bearing in mind our obligations under international law. Covering such an important issue is a heavy workload for the committee and it would be both unfair and unwise to impose any deadline on it for completion of its report. Suffice to say that the terms of reference ask it to report as soon as practicable. I am, therefore, unable to give a precise date for completion of its report.</P>
      <P>On the matter of the Special Criminal Court, any decision to establish a second or additional number of such courts is a matter for the Government and I could not say in response to a parliamentary question what action the Government might decide to take on a particular matter. The workload of the court is under continuous review in my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Ó Caoláin asks about public consultations undertaken as part of the review. While this is a matter for the committee to decide, I understand that newspaper advertisements were placed in the newspapers, North and South, on 23 July inviting written submissions from interested individuals or groups before 30 September. For obvious reasons, I am unable to say at this stage, <Col N="478" /> in advance of receiving the committee's report, what the response was to this invitation.</P>

      <P>I acknowledge the Government's commitment under the Good Friday Agreement. However, the review of the Offences Against the State Acts covers all legislation since 1939. It is, therefore, comprehensive in its work and terms of reference. All legislation is to be reviewed, including, for example, the 1998 Act which was introduced by me in response to the bombing in Omagh.</P>
      <P>With regard to public consultations, the review is not like the Patten Commission. This is a review of legislation and it was believed that advertisements inviting submissions from the public would be sufficient to obtain the views of interested parties. It is a matter for the committee to work out a <i>modus operandi</i> based on its assessment of the best way to obtain people's views. I am not involved in this respect. The committee placed advertisements in newspapers, North and South, seeking submissions from individuals, groups and so forth. I am certain that interested parties, including the Deputy, will avail of the opportunity to make their submissions.</P>

      <P>Yes. That is why I will try to facilitate the Deputy in so far as I can.</P>
      <P>There has been a considerable amount of criticism of the Special Criminal Court over the years, but much of that criticism was uninformed. While the court was originally used for the trial of subversive related offences, the courts have recognised that trials before it were not confined to those associated with subversive activity, but the question of which cases may be prosecuted by the Special Criminal Court is a matter for the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>
      <P>At present, the future of the Special Criminal Court is being considered in the context of an examination of the offences against the State legislation. The Government has not made a decision to have a second Special Criminal Court. It might decide to have a second Special Criminal Court, but it must be recognised that such a decision would merely mean the court would hear two cases at the one time. In other words, it deals with the realities on the ground rather than being geared towards a major crackdown. The Special Criminal Court sometimes hears cases related to organised crime on the basis that the ordinary courts are not effective in securing the administration of justice in such offences. The debate on this matter should not only concentrate on the offences against the State legislation but should recognise that the Special Criminal Court has been used to deal with other types of offences in the past.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 35 and 47 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was not an expression of annoyance about this matter by the Swedish Foreign Minister who represented the Swedish Prime Minister at the Tampere Summit; the Swedish Prime Minister did not attend the summit because of a family bereavement. As was made clear by the Taoiseach in this House on 2 November 1999, the <Col N="481" /> Swedish authorities did not raise this case with any representative of the Irish Government at the summit nor have they made any complaint to the Irish authorities at any stage about the matter.</P>
    <P>The request for mutual assistance in this case was received from the Swedish authorities on 22 January 1998. The request did not mention a money laundering offence or a money laundering investigation nor was there any question of freezing an account; in fact, the evidence in the District Court disclosed that there was not any money left in the account at the time the request was made.</P>
    <P>The case as outlined in the request by the Swedish authorities was one of &ldquo;gross breach of trust and gross embezzlement&rdquo; concerning Trustor, an investment company. The request sought information concerning transactions on a Bank of Ireland account in the name of the Selrex Corporation.</P>
    <P>The request was fully executed and the information sought was furnished to the Swedish authorities on 11 June 1999. The request was processed, as in the case with all such requests, in accordance with the relevant statutory provisions and the conventions to which Ireland is a party. Apart from my Department, the other bodies involved in handling the Swedish request were the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Chief State Solicitor's office, including counsel, the Attorney General's office, the Garda Síochána and the District Court. This is a new area of work for all of these bodies as the legislative framework was put into effect less than three years ago.</P>
    <P>Apart from the time taken by the agencies here, time was also taken up by the need to revert to the Swedish authorities on two occasions; first, for additional documentation to meet our legal requirements and, second, for additional information that counsel required before the case could be brought before the court.</P>
    <P>It is usual in cases where the matter is of particular urgency, for a requesting authority to specify a deadline and to follow up the request either by 'phone call or letter. That did not happen in this case nor was there any reference by the Swedish prosecutor to expediting the case when responding to the inquiries raised by the Irish authorities. In sending in the request the prosecutor referred to it as being urgent, but that is par for the course in these cases. Where deadlines are given, the authorities here go to great lengths to meet them and I am informed they have been successful thus far in meeting all deadlines set by requesting authorities.</P>
    <P>As part of international mutual evaluation procedures, two independent bodies of experts have commented favourably on Ireland's arrangements for mutual assistance with regard to money laundering.</P>
    <P>A report by an EU team of experts of August 1999 on Ireland's arrangements for mutual assistance was highly complimentary, while recommending some streamlining of procedures. These recommendations have been accepted and are in the process of being implemented. This exercise <Col N="482" /> will help in speeding up the time taken to execute requests. An evaluation report on Ireland in October 1998 by the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering was also highly complimentary.</P>
    <P>There is concern at European level with reducing delays generally in the operation of the system for mutual legal assistance. The EU mutual evaluation process, to which I have referred, is part of the response to that concern and Ireland is fully committed to its successful outcome and to the improvement of judicial co-operation.</P>

        <b>: </b>Apart from the courtesy aspect of the matter, does the Minister accept that when a request comes from another jurisdiction, particularly where the file is marked &ldquo;gross embezzlement and gross breach of trust&rdquo; and also marked &ldquo;urgent&rdquo; , it should be treated as a matter of urgency and that an 18 month delay, irrespective of whether there was any foundation for it, is unacceptable? This request had come from another jurisdiction, which had a certain amount of information on a particular account and it should have been expedited straight away. How can we expect interagency co-operation in relation to the Criminal Assets Bureau, which we are advocating on an international level, Europol and judicial co-operation, if we are so tardy in responding effectively, efficiently and at an early date to requests that come from other Governments, particularly EU Governments?</P>

      <P>I remind the Deputy that we have been complimented on our performance in relation to money laundering co-operation and mutual assistance generally. This is only one of many cases that are dealt with, but I acknowledge the delay in this case was unacceptable. I accept that it is important that we should respond expeditiously to all such queries. Normally, when cases are urgent, the requesting authority would specify a deadline or follow up the request with either a telephone call or a letter. That did not happen in this case. I am not using it as an excuse. I accept that in this instance Homer nodded, but this one instance should be placed in the context of all the others where the performance of the authorities has been outstanding.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Director General of the Prison Service that the incident referred to by the Deputy arose on Saturday, 18 September 1999 in the wake of an assault on a prisoner by a number of other prisoners. When prison staff intervened, they in turn were attacked by a group of prisoners. Order was quickly restored and a number of prisoners were moved to other parts of the prison to relieve tension in the wing where the incident occurred. Eleven prison officers and one injured prisoner required hospital treatment. The injured prisoner required in-patient treatment and remained in hospital until 18 October 1999.</P>
      <P>Two investigations are under way into the incident &ndash; an internal investigation by the Governor of Mountjoy Prison and a Garda investigation. The principal focus of both investigations is an alleged assault on the injured prisoner. Arising from the incident, a prison officer has been suspended pending the outcome of the investigations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the two investigations in question are <Col N="484" /> ongoing, it would be inappropriate for me to comment any further at this stage. I request and strongly advise the House that we should avoid at this time getting into further detail about the incident and the individuals involved as this could be subsequently deemed prejudicial to ongoing investigations and to have tainted any subsequent court proceedings that might arise or disciplinary action.</P>

An investigation is being carried out by the Garda and within the Prison Service. I assure the Deputy that if at the end of these investigations an issue emerges which needs to be addressed, the appropriate action will be taken. The Director General of the Prison Service and the local prison management will have my full support in carrying out any required measures.</P>

If the Ministers made the announcement, can the Taoiseach tell the House what legislation they propose which could be enacted and in force by next March?

    <Title>Stamp Duties Consolidation Bill, 1999: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a consolidation Bill and I do not propose to detain the House for long in expressing my views on it. I congratulate the officials from the Department of Finance and the <Col N="495" /> Revenue Commissioners who have been so assiduous in putting this together. The Taxes Consolidation Bill, 1997, was, in many ways, a <i>magnum opus</i> and the officials could have been forgiven for resting on their laurels and not finishing the job by drafting the stamp duties Bill. I am glad, however, they did not do that but have brought together this particularly good piece of work. I offer my congratulations unreservedly to them. Without wishing to carp or be negative, they should flaunt their laurels a little, to mix my metaphors, when they next pass the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Areas of our criminal law would benefit hugely from being consolidated, not least of which are relatively non-contentious areas such as road traffic legislation. If the energy shown by the officials from the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners were brought to bear elsewhere, we would all be the better for it.</P>
      <P>I do not intend to say a great deal on this consolidation Bill. However, I invite the Minister to share his thoughts on several issues, either today or on Committee Stage. In a recent conversation, one of the Minister's officials &ndash; who is not here today but would be known to the officials present &ndash; said that stamp duty was a truly wonderful tax because it increased incrementally every year without the need for the Minister for Finance, or anyone else, to do anything with it; the thresholds were set in stone and had not been changed in decades but the tax take continually increased as long as house prices increased, which they consistently have done in the past decades. For many years that argument held good and Ministers for Finance benefited from it, but given the current state of the Exchequer's coffers there is a case for looking anew at the argument for indexation. The principle of indexation has been accepted in the case of capital gains tax and the thresholds for capital acquisitions tax. In relation to the CPI or, more meaningfully, the increase in house prices, the possibility of indexing the thresholds for stamp duty should be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>More recently, in the wake of the first Bacon report on the housing crisis the rates of stamp duty charged were changed in the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1998. I would be interested in hearing either on Second or Committee Stage the Minister's reflections on what has happened since. The specific purpose of the changes was to remove the incentive for investment in housing property by removing the exemption from stamp duty and to increase it for those who wanted to buy for the purpose of living in it. There were indications in the months immediately following the introduction of the Act that it had some effect, that the rate of increase in new house prices had slowed down and in some cases plateaued. That seemed to change around the turn of the year and there is no indication at this stage that the changes have had any long-term positive effect. As the Minister of State is aware, the Minister undertook at the time to review the operation of the changes <Col N="496" /> within a relatively short space of time to ascertain if they had been effective. There is a need to refocus the thrust of stamp duty, not on assisting the construction industry, the traditional focus, but on assisting individuals seeking to buy houses. Rather than exempting new houses from stamp duty the Government should seek to exempt first-time purchasers. That argument still holds good.</P>
    <P>On more trivial matters, why is stamp duty charged on documents such as the assignment of life insurance policies? The stamp duty chargeable is only £10. I do not understand the reason for it. From a purely revenue point of view, it seems there can hardly be an argument in favour of stamp duty on ATM cards or cheques. What are the Minister's reflections on the matter?</P>
    <P>On a more serious issue, the Minister will be aware that the argument has been made by business in recent months and years that the stamp duty charged on share transfers, more popularly called companies' capital duty, should be reduced, if not eliminated. It is currently charged at a rate of 1%. I see no persuasive argument why this should be the case. It seems that share transfers and Stock Exchange activity are proceeding apace, notwithstanding the rate of duty charged on share transfers, but the case has been made by the industry and the Stock Exchange. I would be interested in hearing the Minister's view.</P>
    <P>As the Minister is aware, in my former existence I was a practising solicitor. In presenting a document for stamping is one required to present a PD &ndash; particulars delivered &ndash; form. I would be interested in knowing what this document is for. Certain information is required in regard to a particular transaction from the purchaser and the vendor, including their RSI number, which is a recent development. Does this contribute to an information bank in the Revenue Commissioners and to what use is it put?</P>
    <P>I am conscious of the good work done by the Revenue Commissioners on the Bill, for which I congratulate them. We will facilitate passage of the Bill not just now but also on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity of speaking on this Bill, the second consolidation Bill to be introduced in the 28th Dáil. The Taxes Consolidation Bill was enacted in 1997. As a new Member, I had the privilege of serving on the select committee to which it was referred and I gained an excellent insight into the benefits of consolidation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I praise the officials of the Department of Finance who have worked on this Bill, having previously worked on the Taxes Consolidation Act. I also compliment the parliamentary draftsman. The task of drawing together the various Acts into one consolidation Bill was a difficult one. Other Departments should follow suit. The relevant Oireachtas committee should review their activities to identify the areas in which there is a need for consolidation. The Social Welfare Con<Col N="497" /> solidation Act, 1994, was of tremendous benefit. While our first duty is to enact legislation, we also have a duty to review legislation to ascertain if it is operating effectively and user friendly to ensure it is being complied with. I hope the Bill will have a smooth passage through Committee Stage. As it is much shorter than the Taxes Consolidation Act, it should not take as long to process. We should apply the lessons learned on that occasion.</P>
    <P>Approximately 60 Acts are being repealed or revoked in the Bill, including the Stamp Duties Management Act, 1891; Finance (Customs and Stamp Duties) Act, 1929; Finance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1935; Solicitors Act, 1954; Value-Added Tax Act, 1972; Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983; Disclosure of Certain Information for Taxation and Other Purposes Act, 1996; Criminal Assets Bureau Act, 1996, and Finance Acts up to 1999. The phraseology used will be the subject of many queries on Committee Stage. While the ideas are similar, different terminology is used. Consequential amendments will be required to possibly 20 other enactments. The Attorney General has issued a certificate confirming that no new legislation is involved.</P>
    <P>Stamp duty was first introduced 225 years ago in 1774 as a temporary measure. As we are all aware it has since become a permanent feature of the taxation system. A total of 47 documents were covered by the original legislation. This number increased to 95 in intervening years but has since been reduced to 15 following rationalisation by the Department of Finance. There were changes in stamp duty over the years and with modern information technology, for the first time in 1996 company law was amended to enable title to shares to be transferred electronically. The Finance Act, 1996, provided for the application of stamp duty in respect of electronic messages which are sent to the registrar of a company advising the registrar to update the register to respect the new ownership interest. The brush with modern technology is not over yet and no doubt developments in e-commerce will permit electronic conveyancing in the not too distant future. Just as electronic share dealing was accommodated within the stamp duty system, so too will electronic conveyancing. Major changes in the administration of stamp duty will have to be made to introduce modern technology. The Revenue Commissioners are applying resources from their annual Vote to invest heavily in computerisation of stamp duties, and this is now nearing completion.</P>
    <P>The process of consolidation involved consultation with all the practitioners in the legal, accounting and taxation areas as well as the consultative bodies of the various accountancy organisations. I thank them for working with the officials in the Department of Finance to bring this matter to a conclusion and enabling the Bill to come before the House tonight.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="498" /> One of the greatest benefits of consolidation will be the restructuring of the stamp duty code in a clear, coherent and logical manner. It will be far more accessible and user friendly for everyone, including Members of the Oireachtas who may have to cope with changes in stamp duty on an annual basis. I hope that when the Bill is finalised, the rules and regulations regarding stamp duty will be available on a CD-ROM and also on the Revenue Commissioners' website, making it accessible to everyone.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all the Deputies for their contributions on the Stamp Duties Consolidation Bill. I was not here the other day but Deputy Noonan was correct in his presumption of a connection between stamp duty and the American War of Independence. I am told that the imposition of stamp duty in the American colonies was one of the catalysts for that famous conflict which was so influential on the history of our own country. I apologise again to the Deputy that I was not here but I believe he knows where I was on that occasion.</P>
      <P>Deputy Noonan also raised the issue of stamp duty on housing. As he correctly pointed out, this is a consolidation Bill and matters of policy do not arise, but I have noted the point he made. I have no doubt that issue may arise following the budget and in the debate on the Finance Bill. I express my appreciation for the way the Deputy facilitated the passage of the Bill through the House and his complimentary remarks with regard to Revenue and the people involved in the preparation of this legislation.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ardagh praised the Revenue Commissioners' website, and I share those sentiments. The Deputy also raised the issue of stamp duty on transfers of businesses from a parent to a child. As I said previously, the debate on this consolidation measure is not the appropriate place to deal with this type of issue. There will be many opportunities in the coming weeks to raise it in its proper context. That also applies to the Deputy's views on stamp duty on share trading. While I have taken note of his suggestions, the totality of the taxation environment is benign for equity investments. That is also the case for other types of investment. On the Deputy's point about stamp duty on the transfers of family businesses, he will be aware that such transfers are assisted by significant reliefs under the capital acquisitions and capital gains tax codes. This is a consolidation measure and it will be transferred to the standing joint committee of both Houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank Deputy McDowell in particular, for his compliments to the Revenue Commissioners. Given everything that is happening in that department, it is welcome that they have kept their eye on the ball and, following from the Taxes Consolidation Bill, kept this agenda moving forward. If we do not do that, there is always a danger that years may pass before we address it again. There is an appetite for moving on these <Col N="499" /> issues and I am glad that is what we are doing here.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell raised the question of the effects of Bacon <i>vis-à-vis </i>stamp duty. As far as I am aware, there has been a deceleration in that area in the context of house prices. I do not have an answer to the question he raised about the specifics of the stamp duty issue but I am sure it will be raised over the coming weeks under a different heading. In regard to the question the Deputy asked wearing his legal hat, I understand a copy of the form he referred to is given to the Revenue special inquiry branch. Information assists them in coming to a view on a taxpayer's overall liability for tax. The Deputy raised other specific matters but, as he pointed out, they do not specifically come under this Bill which is a consolidation measure. I have no doubt he will raise these issues following the budget and during the deliberations on the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputy Fleming for his comments on the Bill. As he said, the passage of the Taxes Consolidation Bill was an interesting experience, and we can all see the benefits of it. I have no doubt this Bill will add further to the armoury involved in that legislation.</P>
    <P>I thank all Deputies who contributed to the debate on the Bill and reiterate my thanks to the people in the Revenue Commissioners and the officials involved in the Department of Finance.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="500" /> The purpose of the Bill is to facilitate the sale of ICC Bank. As Deputies may be aware, the Government decided on 27 July 1998 to dispose of the State's interest in ICC Bank plc. At this stage there is no strategic or policy justification for continuing State involvement on the margins of the banking sector. The market has moved on, industry has developed and State guarantees are not appropriate going forward. The bank should benefit from access to capital, broader expertise and, possibly, international opportunities.</P>
    <P>In its decision on the matter, the Government authorised me to enter into negotiations with staff on an employee share ownership plan, an ESOP, of up to 14.9 per cent of the State's shareholding, 5% in return for change in the bank and 9.9 per cent through purchase.</P>
    <P>ICC Bank was established in 1933 at a time when economic circumstances were very different from those pertaining today. At that stage, the aim was to encourage the financing of the development of an industrial base in Ireland. Since then the bank has been a strong supporter of the Irish SME sector. In focusing on the financial needs of indigenous SMEs, ICC Bank has played no small part in the development of indigenous industry, particularly in recent years.</P>
    <P>ICC Bank has expanded steadily and has enjoyed consistent profitability. While the State has made equity investments totalling £36.9 million over the years, the bank has grown through its own efforts to a stage where its balance sheet now amounts to over £2 billion.</P>
    <P>ICC has paid regular and increasing dividends to the Exchequer over the past two decades. In the past five years alone, such dividend payments amounted to £14 million, while corporation tax payments in the same period came to £10 million. In 1998, the bank made pre-tax operating profits of £21 million. In any assessment of the contribution of ICC Bank, its performance in the venture capital field deserves special mention. The bank has had a pioneering role in the provision of such funding in Ireland and continues to hold a market leader role in the venture capital area, an area vital to ensuring the continued accelerated development of Irish SMEs.</P>
    <P>As regards the sale process, last February I appointed ABN-Amro and McCann FitzGerald to advise me on the corporate finance and legal aspects of the sale of my interest in the bank. During the following months officials of my Department and my advisers worked with the board, management and staff of ICC Bank to prepare the necessary documentation on the sale, to negotiate an employee share ownership trust and to agree procedures for the sale process. Expressions of interest in acquiring the State's remaining shareholding were sought by advertisement on 12 July 1999. Up to ten banks expressed an initial interest in acquiring the bank, but only three firm indications of interest were received on the closing date of 23 August. Having reviewed these tenders, it was decided that all <Col N="501" /> three should enter stage 2 of the sale process where they would be permitted to carry out due diligence on ICC. One of these banks withdrew from the process shortly thereafter. The two remaining banks undertook a preliminary due diligence exercise on ICC and availed of the opportunity to meet key management and union officials. One of these parties subsequently withdrew at a late stage and one final bid from Bank of Ireland was received by the deadline of 19 October 1999.</P>
    <P>Following consultations with the board of ICC Bank, the receipt of advice from my financial advisers and a discussion with senior representatives of Bank of Ireland, I issued a press release confirming that bank as the preferred bidder. Final due diligence on ICC Bank is now being undertaken following which final negotiations will take place. On completion of this exercise I intend to bring proposals to Government for its consideration. In firming up on my approach to the Government I will take into account the long-term interest of all the stakeholders &ndash; the company, staff, customers, suppliers and shareholders.</P>
    <P>At this point the final price on offer from Bank of Ireland has not been finalised. Various figures on the valuation of the bank, many of them totally unrealistic, have been mentioned in the media. Obviously, I would like to have more competition in the latter part of the sale process, but I assure Deputies that ICC Bank will not be sold for other than a fair price.</P>
    <P>In considering any sale I will take into account various aspects of the offer, including Bank of Ireland's business plan for the operation. I understand many Irish firms are appreciative of the support forthcoming to them from ICC Bank over the years and I would presume this is part of the attraction of the bank for any bidder. In such circumstances it should be in the interest of all parties to continue the SME focus which has been successful in the past. I hope that ICC Bank, if it changes hands, will continue to fulfil and expand its role in the development of Irish Industry. As much of the attraction of ICC Bank is attributable to its SME focus, it would not make sense for a purchaser to lessen the drive to expand that part of the business. Furthermore, from a seller's point of view, it is desirable to achieve a conclusive outcome at this stage if one can be reached on a satisfactory basis.</P>
    <P>ICC Bank has been on the market in one form or another since the early 1990s and it is time to bring this uncertainty to an end. If a basis for selling is not achievable at this point, it would not be feasible to bring the bank to the market for a minimum period of about 2 years in circumstances where a full tendering process would again be necessary. In the prevailing climate of consolidation in the Irish and European financial sectors, it is debatable whether the value of an operation of ICC's size would appreciate in the meantime. Capital injections by the State would also be needed. Furthermore, the morale of staff <Col N="502" /> and management could be affected by continuing uncertainty and it could be difficult to maintain the confidence of funding agents and customers. In short, the bank would have to run just to stand still.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the main provisions of the Bill. Section 1 is the definitions section and is self explanatory. Section 2 provides for the transfer of relevant shares to an employee share ownership trust in line with the Government decision, and for related matters. The employee share ownership plan envisages 5 per cent of the issued ordinary shares in the company being provided in return for change in the bank and a further 9.9 per cent stake being available for purchase by staff.</P>
    <P>Section 3 provides for the continuation of existing guarantees given by the Minister. No guarantees will be given in the future and the amount which is subject to guarantee will continue to be reduced. Section 4 is essentially an enabling provision to allow the Minister to dispose of his interest in Fóir Teoranta. Under the Fóir Teoranta (Dissolution) Act, 1990, the assets and liabilities of Fóir Teoranta were transferred to ICC Bank plc, then the Industrial Credit Corporation. It is proposed to sell the residual Fóir Teoranta portfolio to ICC Bank for its estimated realisable value, less a consideration in relation to releasing ICC's management contract therefor.</P>
    <P>Section 5 provides that the borrowing limit of ICC Bank plc be increased by order. This provision is transitional to cover the period up to the sale of the bank. Section 6 is a standard provision requiring ICC Bank plc to take relevant action to alter its memorandum and articles of association in the context of the Companies Acts to make them consistent with the terms of the Bill. Section 7 provides that the borrowing limit of ACC Bank plc be increased by order.</P>
    <P>Section 8, and the accompanying Schedule to the Bill, provide for the repeal of the ICC Bank Acts, 1933 to 1997, and the deletion of references to ICC in other legislation. This would be done by ministerial order under section 10.3 of the Bill. The relevant order will not be made until ICC Bank plc is granted a licence by the Central Bank. Section 9 is a standard provision in relation to the expenses of the Minister. Section 10 gives the Short Title, construction and commencement provisions.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his brief and succinct summary of the reasons ICC is on the market and for his equally succinct explanation of the main provisions of the Bill. I also thank him for providing me with a briefing by his officials in advance of this debate which was very helpful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fine Gael shares the Minister's objective. We believe the State has no business being involved in banking and that the private sector can provide the banking and other financial services necessary for the country and the economy. We would like <Col N="503" /> more competition in the banking sector and would be concerned if the takeover of small units by larger units became the norm. As we continue to become increasingly involved in the euro zone, competition will arrive from Europe and not just from the UK, which is not in that zone. However, we have seen competition being introduced into the market by the Bank of Scotland and Northern Rock, if that is the correct name for the north of England bank now advertising for deposits at a decent interest rate.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael agrees with the purpose of the Bill, which is to sell ICC Bank. However, I am concerned that the sale did not attract greater attention in the financial services sector. The ten initial inquiries were quickly reduced to three when the discussions became serious. Of the three, one dropped out immediately and the other two went to preliminary due diligence. One of these then dropped out at a late stage and only Bank of Ireland is left. The Minister will maintain that the market will decide the value of ICC Bank but when there is only one willing buyer it is difficult for him to claim that whatever price we get from Bank of Ireland is fair and is the market price. There are and were many considerations in the market when this process began. In his reply, will the Minister dwell a little on the price he is going to get for the bank? Will he state whether he believes it is a fair market price or if he is in a situation where, having gone so far down the road, he has to sell? Obviously, the Minister is correct in saying that if the last purchaser dropped out it would not be possible to bring the bank to the market again for two or three years and that it would have run very fast to stand still. This would also continue the uncertainty for both staff and customers. It is a serious issue on which I do not want to dwell unduly for obvious reasons. However, I would like the Minister to give us further assurances that the final price being negotiated between his Department and the Bank of Ireland will represent a fair market value for ICC.</P>
    <P>It is important to pay tribute to ICC. At a time when the banks were extremely averse to risk and when the concept of venture capital was very far from the minds of the main banks, ICC in the 1930s and subsequently provided what is now termed venture capital for many industries. It continued to be used by emerging industries, beginning the industrialisation of Ireland. Frequently behind tariff walls indigenous industry was developed and much of the credit is due to ICC. Like anyone supplying venture capital, it took on many bad customers and historically had many bad loans. However, as the economy grew and prospered this also changed and ICC's returns over the past five years are worthy of compliment. They have returned £24 million by way of dividend or corporation tax to the Exchequer over the past five years, a very creditable performance for a small bank. Not only is credit due to the board and its directors, but prin<Col N="504" /> cipally credit is due to the dedicated staff. I am glad the Minister intends that the staff will be rewarded by a share allocation when the bank is finally sold.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the second purpose of the Bill which is to enable the Minister to require the company to create extra shares and to dispose of them. I presume the principal intent is that there will be an allocation of shares to the trust on behalf of the employees which will act as a safe deposit for the shares. The employee share option trust will acquire a 5 per cent stake in ICC Bank &ndash; I am working from the briefing provided by the Minister's Department. It will do so in exchange for a transformation agreement, namely, changed work practices, etc. On an optional basis it will acquire a further 9.9 per cent stake through purchase. It is envisaged that this will be financed through a loan. This seems to be the norm in State companies. It is beneficial for this material to be made public and for the transactions to be transparent. Under the replacement share mechanism the ESOT will exchange its shares in ICC Bank for shares in the purchaser company. The shares in the purchaser company will be mortgaged to secure the loan, which seems straightforward enough. In effect, the Government will get cash for the company which will be returned to the Exchequer. However, the employees of the company will get shares &ndash; free and purchased by loan &ndash; which will be exchanged for shares in Bank of Ireland, to put it bluntly. It is good that the shares will be used as security on the mortgage which will be provided to the ESOT for the purchase of shares.</P>
    <P>When the ESOT is in place allocation of notional shares, ie shares which will not actually be passed to employees, will commence, the first on the establishment date and the others at six month intervals. Three years after its establishment shares will be transferred from the ESOT to an approved profit sharing scheme at a rate of shares to the value of £10,000 per employee per year. These will then be transferred to the APSS to individual employees. Neither the ESOT nor the APSS will pay any capital gains tax on the disposal of the shares. Similarly, employees do not pay tax on the value of the shares received, although there is a suggestion that they might pay tax on subsequent dispersals over £10,000 from the residual fund. Dividends received by the ESOT will be used towards servicing the loan. Neither the ESOT nor the employees will pay tax on dividends in these circumstances. However, after the loan is paid off, dividends received by the ESOT will be distributed to employees. In this scenario the ESOT will pay no tax, but employees will be subject to tax in the usual way. Along the way each employee's notional allocation will be reduced by the amount of shares appropriate to him or her and by any shares sold by the ESOT to clear the loan. Participants may either hold or sell the shares in the market. If employees chose to hold the shares they will be liable for capital gains tax in the usual way when <Col N="505" /> they subsequently dispose of them. This will continue for a maximum of 20 years after the establishment of the ESOT, if there are sufficient shares. At this stage the ESOT will be wound up and any remaining shares must be distributed among employees. To the extent that the value of such distribution to any employee is in excess of £10,000, that person will be liable for income tax on the excess.</P>
    <P>It is a complex but very carefully worked out scheme and I think the employees will sign up to it, or perhaps have already done so. It will be used as a template for other sales in the public sector and that was why I put the outline of the scheme on the record.</P>
    <P>The Minister should examine the taxation provisions of the scheme because some of the provisions being put in place according to the briefing note of the Department are not similar to the provisions which would apply where companies follow the advice of the Tánaiste and profit share by way of share options with employees. The Minister will be aware of the advice of the Tánaiste in the past few days that companies should be willing to profit share and that this will be part of the negotiations for a new social partnership agreement.</P>
    <P>One of the current difficulties is that when employees decide to divest of the shares they have been given by way of option they will be charged income tax on the basis of benefit in kind, rather than being subject to capital gains tax. Having to pay tax at 46 per cent rather than 20 per cent takes much of the good out of the scheme. It becomes a deferred employment package and is not a real share option scheme.</P>
    <P>I see the Minister has protected the ESOT and the APSS from any tax and that an employee on the disposal of shares will be subject to capital gains tax and that income tax will apply only to the residual amount over £10,000. There is a serious issue concerning tax in this context and I am using this debate to point out a more general matter. If the intention of the Government is that share option schemes will be one of the planks on which the next social partnership agreement is built, the Minister will have to decide before the budget whether the shares on disposal should be subject to income tax, capital gains tax or both. The scheme which the Government, including the Tánaiste, is advocating will not be a runner if share options are treated as benefit in kind and are subject to income tax at the time of disposal, whereas it would be a strong runner if they were subject to capital gains tax at 20 per cent.</P>
    <P>State guarantees are maintained in the Bill but the intention to run them down in an orderly fashion has been signalled by the Minister. I would like him to return to this in his reply. Under what circumstances will guarantees continue? What practical situations does he envisage emerging where new guarantees may have to be given? I would also like him to comment on whether the provision of such guarantees in future might be regarded as an aid to industry <Col N="506" /> by the European Commission. Perhaps he would reflect on that and give his views on it.</P>
    <P>Would the Minister comment further on the section which allows him to dispose of his interest in Fóir Teo to the company? What liabilities are now in this portfolio? How will he handle the management costs which will accrue to the company arising from the Fóir Teo portfolio? Does he intend making provision for a deduction to compensate the company for the administrative costs which would arise from administering the portfolio?</P>
    <P>I note the Minister is increasing the borrowing limit of ICC bank from £2.3 billion. If this were ordinary legislation, I would disagree not with the increase in the limit but with the manner in which the Minister does it. Rather than following the traditional route and setting a new limit, he is taking the power to set the new limit at his discretion. In effect, if he has a rush of blood to the head, he can make it £5 million, £10 million or £100 million as the case may be without any reference to the House. In all such Bills as this, be they concerned with the IDA, Shannon Development, the ACC or the ICC, it has been customary to set a new ceiling on borrowing. The Minister is not doing that on this occasion and it is acceptable to my party on the basis that this is effectively an enabling Bill to facilitate the Minister to dispose of the company and that he needs flexibility when he addresses these issues.</P>
    <P>However, I have a different view when, in the same section, he takes the power to raise the borrowing limit of ACC. This Bill is about ICC, not ACC. I understand why the Minister would use it as a vehicle to introduce a provision to raise the borrowing limit of ACC at the same time, but he is not justified in empowering himself to do this by order without setting a new limit. I would prefer if he separated the two issues and returned on Committee Stage with a borrowing limit for ACC. I have no difficulty with the Minister using this legislation as a vehicle for increasing the borrowing limit of ACC. It is also on the market with its merger with TSB. Things may happen later next year. However, the Minister should return with a specific ceiling on ACC and follow the tradition. The same arguments which he might advance for raising the ceiling by order in respect of ICC do not apply to ACC at this point. I take issue with the Minister in respect of that.</P>
    <P>I also notice in section 10(3) that the Minister does something with which I would normally disagree. The section states:</P>
    <P>The Act shall come into operation on such day or days as, by order or orders made by the Minister under this section, may be fixed therefor either generally or with reference to any particular purpose or provision, and different days may be so fixed for different purposes...</P>
    <P>The Minister takes the maximum flexibility on board. This Bill and its various provisions will become law whenever he decides. That is effectively what the provision says. That would be bad <Col N="507" /> legislative practice if this were normal legislation and I would oppose it. However, I understand, with the negotiations with Bank of Ireland at their penultimate stage, and in light of the fact that there is now one willing buyer, that the due diligence conducted by Bank of Ireland is either complete or almost complete and that we are down to a final set of decisions, it is important that the Minister should have maximum flexibility to allow him control the calendar of events from now until the company is signed off. As it is an exceptional measure, I will not object to this type of catch-all provision. It is a very generous provision for the House to allow the Minister and we will allow it in these exceptional circumstances.</P>
    <P>We do not have any difficulty with the principle underpinning the Bill nor with the individual measures in it as they apply to ICC. However, I have a difficulty with the measure as it applies to ACC. I will return to that on Committee Stage, but perhaps the Minister would facilitate me by bringing forward his own amendment at that stage to place a borrowing ceiling on ACC. I wish the Minister well as he conducts the final stages of this negotiation. It is important that ICC be sold to Bank of Ireland. It would be a great pity if anything went wrong with the process. My party does not intend creating any difficulty for the Minister. I hope the business can be concluded expeditiously and to the satisfaction of the Minister, the Bank of Ireland and the employees of ICC.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to contribute to this debate. I do not approach this from the same point on the ideological spectrum as the Minister or Deputy Noonan. I will explain why as succinctly as possible. The Minister said, &ldquo;...there is no significant strategic or policy justification for continuing State involvement on the margins of the banking sector&rdquo;. I do not agree with him, and he continued after that to make a case for a strategic involvement.</P>
      <P>ICC has played a significant role in the SME sector. It may be less vital than it was ten years ago but who knows what might happen in future. However, the main point is that the Minister has got it the wrong way around. We should not say there is no significant justification for the <i>status quo</i>. We must justify the sale. We must especially do so when there is only one bidder and when all the indications are that the Minister is receiving a good deal less from the sale of the bank than he thought he might receive a few weeks ago. The Minister has not discharged that onus in his contribution to the House nor in any of his contributions on this issue over the past two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a sad day because it marks the definitive end of a concept my party introduced into politics some seven years ago, namely, the notion of a State-owned third banking force. The truth and harsh reality is that it did not happen because we <Col N="508" /> failed to bring about the degree of consensus necessary to make it work. We lost the argument. It is worth recalling that the notion of a third banking force was first developed in 1991 by MSF, the principal union in ACC and ICC. We in the Labour Party were happy to co-operate with our colleagues in the trade union movement, and we included it as an issue in our manifesto in 1992. A commitment to explore the possibility of a third force in banking was contained in the Fianna Fáil policy outline of December 1992 and was later included in the programme for Government of the 1992-94 Fianna Fáil-Labour Government of which the Minister was a member.</P>
    <P>The idea was simple. We were and still are aware that the State banks had been drifting for some time. ICC is a significant player in the SME sector. ACC is still struggling to find a niche, having previously been identified with the agricultural population. TSB, at that stage, had emerged from the savings bank sector with a distinct identity but no clear mission. Last but not least, the post office system still is in need of massive upgrading entailing the provision of new services and the installation of new technology.</P>
    <P>On the other side of the coin, the banking sector is dominated by two big banks and there was widespread concern that they were, in effect, operating as a cartel to the detriment of real competition and, ultimately, at the expense of the consumer and economy as a whole. I mention all this now because I think it will quickly be seen that much of it still holds true today.</P>
    <P>In the event, it proved impossible to get agreement at any one time from the management or staff of the banks concerned and, ultimately, the proposal ran into the ground. It was a good idea whose time never came. It foundered in the face of political hostility and indifference or opposition on the part of many of the interest groups concerned. The question that now arises is whether there is a distinctive role for ICC within the State banking sector. Had that question been posed a few years ago, I would have said &ldquo;yes&rdquo; definitively. Now, I am not quite so sure.</P>
    <P>The ICC has fulfilled a clear and distinct role over the six decades since its establishment. It has, as the Minister pointed out, provided venture capital and loan facilities to the SME sector. It is probably fair to say that that part of the economy is well catered for as things stand, but that has not always been the case. Back in the dark days of the 1980s, it was decidedly difficult for people with a good idea to gain access to finance. In many cases, they were required to give personal guarantees if they did not have some track record and were made to do so in a way which made a complete nonsense of the whole idea of corporate liability. It was not at all unusual for someone starting out in business to be required to borrow on the security of the family home. If one adds in the exorbitant rates of interest then being charged, one will see there was a distinctly unattractive cocktail for someone trying to set up a small business.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="509" /> ICC was important in that it was prepared to tread where others refused to. It developed a relationship with small business and came to hold about 10 per cent of the SME sector business. In 1994 the then Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn, made available a fund of £100 million to small and medium sized enterprises at favourable rates of interest. The money was quickly availed of and the major associated banks were quick to match the ICC intervention. In effect, the ICC was very appropriately used as a vehicle to lever funds from the bigger banks. The bad days of the 1980s are behind us and start-up capital is no longer quite so difficult to find.</P>
    <P>It would be wrong to think, however, that the bad old days will never return. It is not difficult for banks to lend at times when the economy is expanding, particularly at the current extraordinary growth rates. When I look at the credit figures produced by the Central Bank, I wonder whether the banks are not lending too easily and whether we might, at some future stage, come to regret the generous nature of their current lending.</P>
    <P>What will happen when the cycle turns, as it inevitably will? What will happen when the returns on lending are not as assured as they currently are? Can we say for sure that we will not then need the foot in the door which the ICC gave us? The Minister is confident that the market will provide, but I do not share his confidence in the banking sector in the marketplace.</P>
    <P>This is a time of extraordinary change in the banking sector. Irish Life has been privatised, Irish Permanent has been demutualised and the two have merged into Irish Life and Permanent. By all accounts, the new bank is seeking further expansion. The First National Building Society has also demutualised and it too is struggling to find a new identity as a bank. Ulster Bank looks set to be sold and ACC and TSB will be merged and may well be floated. The word on the street is that National Irish Bank is seeking to make further acquisitions and may leave if it does not succeed. The overall effect is to consolidate the sector and reduce the number of players in the market. This in turn will reduce the choice available to potential customers, which may or may not be a bad thing. The central question is whether the reduced number of players will reduce the level of competition. It is of little benefit to customers to have a wide choice of banks if they are all offering the same product at the same cost.</P>
    <P>Ultimately, what matters to consumers is the level of competition between banks. Our experience in this regard is mixed, to say the least. The main associated banks have operated as an effective cartel for many years. They may differ in relation to individual charges but the overall level of charges is much the same. There have been occasional shocks to the system such as the arrival of the Australians some 15 years ago, but these have been the exception rather than the rule. <Col N="510" /> More recently we have had the experience of the Bank of Scotland. Only a few months ago we were told by the domestic mortgage holders that they were not in a position to pass on the full benefit of the ECB interest rate cut. We were told they would be unable to maintain the rates paid on deposits if they had to pass on the cut. Then Bank of Scotland arrived on the scene and offered mortgages at 3.99 per cent. Within a few days, this rate was matched by all the major banks without any reduction in deposit interest rates. On the contrary, deposit interest rates have started to rise following a further intervention by a UK bank. Ulster Bank has raised its deposit interest rates in recent days and, doubtless, other banks will follow suit.</P>
    <P>The banks are constantly balancing the interests of their shareholders with those of their customers. A quick glance at the profits of some of the bigger banks gives a clear picture as to who is winning out. Only genuine competition in the market can decisively alter the way in which that balance is struck. More likely than not, competition will come from the new players in the market, but we cannot afford to depend on this happening. We need an effective competition policy and a means of enforcing it. At the moment, we have neither. As things stand, prudential supervision of the banking sector is in the hands of the Central Bank. The Director of Consumer Affairs has responsibility for bank charges although her responsibility does not extend to interest rates. The Competition Authority looks at competition issues, usually on foot of individual complaints.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed, in principle at least, to setting up a single regulatory authority to deal with financial services. The Government should consider setting up a competition directorate within the SRA whose function would be to promote the maximum possible level of competition within the banking sector and to take action to prevent anti-competitive practices. The advantage of having the directorate within the SRA is that they could benefit from the exchange of information, particularly that which becomes available to the SRA by means of its exercise of the supervision and prudential part of its remit. This would offer us a reasonable chance of ensuring direct, genuine benefits to the consumer.</P>
    <P>In the context of all the exceptional changes which are occurring in the banking sector, there is, or could be, a role for a small State-owned bank with a defined and important place in the market. The question arises as to why the Minister so badly wants to offload the ICC and the other State banks. I have repeatedly asked the Minister this question and have yet to receive a satisfactory reply. The Minister merely repeats the mantra that he sees no role for banking in the State sector and he persistently tells us he is taking a non-ideological view of the issue. What is the Minister's problem with a State-owned bank with a strategic role? I suggest his view is driven by the precise ideology he is so anxious to <Col N="511" /> eschew. He is opposed to State banks because he is opposed to the whole notion of a commercially successful semi-State sector. I suspect he is greatly taken with the views of his colleague, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, who recently referred, rather laughably, to the &ldquo;joy of flotation&rdquo;. I suggest the Minister's view is quite simple, namely, that if a bank can be sold, it should be sold. This holds good even if the needs of consumers and the needs of a particular company or a particular sector suggest otherwise.</P>
    <P>The Minister is quick to accuse those of us on this side of the House who have always argued in favour of public service that we do so out of what he would call &ldquo;ideology&rdquo;. I suggest that in this case, it is the Minister who is putting ideology ahead of the needs of the circumstances. When this process started, there were ten potential bidders, three of which made indicative offers. Two of those have since withdrawn, leaving Bank of Ireland as the sole bidder. All the indications suggest the final offer will be somewhat lower than the indicative offer made earlier by Bank of Ireland. We are entitled to know how this happened. Why has this apparently attractive offer attracted only one bidder? </P>
    <P>I asked the Minister in the House last week if he was determined to push ahead despite the collapse of the competitive tendering process. He repeated the mantra that he sees no role for State banks, which he again repeated today. The implications are clear. The Minister is determined to sell come what may. He is determined to sell not to the highest bidder, but to the only bidder. Bank of Ireland has the Minister, and I am tempted to use a colloquial phrase but I will confine myself to saying, somewhere between a rock and a hard place. He has to sell because he has no other strategy. The Minister is in no position to get best value for the taxpayer because he is ideologically committed to selling the bank come what may.</P>
    <P>In any event, this Bill does not even require the Minister to satisfy himself or anybody else, much less the House, that he is getting best value, for what is a public asset. On the contrary, section 2 gives extraordinary powers to the Minister for Finance. In effect, it allows him to dispose of the ICC Bank in whatever way he chooses. The section is nothing less than a blank cheque and I object in the strongest possible terms to being asked to sign this blank cheque on behalf of the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>The Minister should give us every possible detail of the proposed sale at this stage. I accept there is some information which is commercially sensitive but given that this is an asset in public ownership, there is a special onus on the Minister to make the maximum possible level of disclosure. Let us face it, he has given almost no details to the House today. If that cannot be done now, it should be done later. Whenever the deal is done, as surely it will be done, the Minister <Col N="512" /> should be required to put the terms of the sale before the House for approval, and I will table an amendment on Committee Stage to oblige the Minister to do that.</P>
    <P>I will outline an analogous case. In the past, the Minister was a member of a local authority and those of us who are members of local authorities will be familiar with the statutory requirement whereby local authorities, to dispose of property in their ownership, must put the details of that property before the city or county council for approval. I see no reason in principle that a similar provision should not apply to the sale of a major asset such as a bank.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan referred at some length to the ESOP and the ESOT and I concur with everything he said, particularly as it relates to the taxation of ESOTs. The Minister in his Budget Statement last year introduced a sale as you earn scheme and he has indicated in the past, as have some of his colleagues, his general support for ESOPs and ESOTs and that is something with which I concur. There is justification for looking at the taxation of increases in the value of shares, particularly as they are dealt with under the income tax code. I concur with Deputy Noonan in that regard.</P>
    <P>We must stop and reflect on the use of ESOPs in the context of this Bill and Bills of its kind. In a sense, ESOPs are now being used in the State sector as a straightforward bribe to facilitate privatisation. I see no reason in principle that we should not allow an ESOP or ESOT to operate within any semi-State company where the workers want it. It should not be seen as a bribe to facilitate privatisation but as a normal part of the social partnership structure to which this Government and other parties in the House claim to be committed.</P>
    <P>The details of this ESOT are not dissimilar to those of the Telecom Éireann ESOT and it seems likely that workers will benefit to a considerable extent. I congratulate them on the deal they have done; it is a very generous one and, from their point of view, a good deal. I wonder whether employees of Bank of Ireland, who presumably in time will find themselves working side by side with ICC Bank workers, will have some cause for envy and jealously regarding the type of conditions and benefits enjoyed by former employees of ICC Bank.</P>
    <P>We need to generalise this matter. It must become more than just a means to facilitate privatisation. By all means, we should grant a certain percentage of shares to workers in exchange for a transformation deal, but it should be immediately available as a matter of principle and right within the ESB and CIE, for example.</P>
    <P>In a statement of July 1998, the Minister guaranteed the current employees of ICC Bank that their terms and conditions of work would be respected in any sale. What does that mean? We know from the experience in the merger of TSB and ACC Bank that the terms and conditions of people working in ACC Bank have been signifi<Col N="513" /> cantly changed. Some have been transferred from Dublin to Cork, which they apparently did not want. What does the Minister's commitment to retain the terms and conditions mean? Does it mean, for example, that employees cannot be transferred from one branch to another or within the Bank of Ireland system generally without their consent? What does the commitment not to have any compulsory redundancies within the company mean in the context of the overall Bank of Ireland structure in the future? Does the Minister intend to draw up an agreement with Bank of Ireland? Does he expect the trade unions currently involved in ICC Bank &ndash; I understand it is principally MSF &ndash; to involve themselves in an agreement with Bank of Ireland before the sale goes through?</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that the proceeds of the sale should be simply absorbed into an ever increasing Exchequer surplus. I will make a suggestion to the Minister. We all agree An Post is greatly in need of considerable investment. We need to increase the use of new technology and improve the level of service provided by An Post. That is something which will require investment, perhaps not in each post office but certainly in the main post offices in county towns. That would be a useful way to earmark the £200 million or £250 million which the Minister will obtain from this sale. He should plough it back into that section of the State banking sector, namely An Post, which I assume he intends to keep.</P>
    <P>The sale of ICC Bank, assuming it goes ahead, will leave a gap which is currently being filled largely by banks such as the Anglo-Irish Bank, AIB and, to a small extent, by Bank of Ireland. There will always be a need for the State to get involved directly in providing venture capital in circumstances where companies find it difficult to get it or, for that matter, in providing additional capital or loan facilities to companies seeking to expand. Companies seem to experience difficulties, not at the entry level, but at the expansion level when they reach a certain size and want to increase the number of workers, their output and perhaps get into the business of export. They seem to find it difficult to make that crossing or to bridge that river. At that stage there is a role, which has been identified by Enterprise Ireland, for the State to provide not only loan facilities and capital but the type of back up facilities, advice and consultancy sometimes required in those circumstances. Does the Minister see a role for Enterprise Ireland, for example, in filling the gap that may well be left by the absence of the ICC Bank?</P>
    <P>The Bill, as the Minister and Deputy Noonan pointed out, allows for an increase in the borrowing requirement of ICC Bank. I presume we will have an opportunity to debate the issue of ACC Bank and TSB at a later stage. I supported the Minister in the case of the ACC Bank and the TSB. I believe ICC Bank has a potential strategic role and for that reason should be retained. However, I see no such strategic role in the State D511&ndash;A10</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="514" /> banking sector for ACC Bank or the TSB which are, in effect, small banks with no obvious strategic role in the State sector. I supported from the start what the Minister proposes to do and I am well aware of the origins of those proposals.</P>
    <P>We are in some difficulty here, and the proposal to merge and float virtually at the same time is the core problem. I do not want to get into the industrial relations difficulties. It would not be useful to explore them on the floor of the House.</P>
    <P>The Minister will be aware that there is a feeling within ACC Bank that it is being taken over, in effect, by TSB in advance of its flotation and that to date the merger has served the interests of TSB rather than the employees of ACC. I do not want to debate the pros and cons of that, but the core problem here seems to be the decision to do everything in one bite. The Minister has, in effect, bitten off more than he can chew in that decision and should at least keep it under review, even if he cannot reverse it at this early stage. If the Minister has to reverse this decision early next year there would be a benefit in signalling it now so that we do not inflict untold damage on the bank when we ultimately get to float it, which I imagine will happen in the next two to three years. The Minister has asked Mr. Phil Flynn to intercede as a trouble-shooter and has appointed people within his Department to perform a similar role. I wish them well, as that is a good concept and one I hope we can bring to fruition. However, given that there are difficulties here and that we cannot be sure the flotation will happen, or if it will happen soon, I share Deputy Noonan's concerns about giving the Central Bank and the Minister unfettered power to increase the borrowing limit of ICC. The Minister should specify a particular limit in the Bill on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Let us be honest, we are talking about a takeover by Bank of Ireland and I am a little bothered about it because I am not sure what the Bank of Ireland is seeking to do. Neither the Minister nor the Bank of Ireland have informed us in that regard, but that may be expecting too much from them at this stage. However, before the process is finished we should know what the Bank of Ireland is planning to do and we should have sight of its business plan. We need to be reassured that Bank of Ireland intends that ICC, when in the ownership of Bank of Ireland, will continue to provide particular facilities to the SME sector. That sector of our economy is vitally important, particularly as it is largely indigenous, unlike the multinational sector where so much of our recent growth has been centred. We are entitled to see that business plan and I urge the Minister and Bank of Ireland to make it available to us before the process is completed. It is fair to say that the Bank of Ireland has not always been to the fore in helping small businesses and if it was being honest it would acknowledge that. I hope this move signals a sea change and is not just a move to acquire market share. I hope it signals that it <Col N="515" /> will be more helpful to that sector in future. If that is the case it is a welcome move.</P>
    <P>I do not like the principle of this Bill, though I acknowledge we are a considerable way down the road with it. It would be difficult to row back at this stage and I am not suggesting that is possible. However, I do not like the way in which this deal has come out or been carried through. I do not like the way the Bill effectively gives the Minister a blank cheque to do with as he wishes, and for that reason I will oppose it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelOFlynn" hpid="Mr. O'Flynn Mr. O'Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Minister in bringing forward this Bill. I agree that the time is right to sell off ICC Bank. I note the main reasons for the sale of the bank and the Minister's statement that there is no significant strategic or policy justification for continued State involvement in the banking sector.</P>
      <P>ICC Bank was established in 1933 when economic circumstances were very different from today. The aim then was to encourage the financing and development of an industrial base in Ireland and since then the bank has been a strong supporter of the small and medium sized business sector. The market has moved on and industry has developed. It is envisaged that under its new ownership ICC will continue to play a role in the development of indigenous industry. I note that State guarantees are not appropriate going forward and that the bank will be able to raise capital more readily at the time and level needed to expand under its new private sector ownership. I also note the problems the bank would face if not sold.</P>
      <P>The sale of ICC Bank has been mooted for a number of years. It is time to bring matters to a conclusion and I agree with the Minister in this regard. If we do not sell ICC Bank now it may not be feasible to bring it to the market for a number of years. In light of consolidation in the European banking sector, it is debatable whether the value of an operation the size of ICC Bank would appreciate in value in the meantime. I also note that capital injections from the State would be needed if we do not proceed with the sale of the bank now. Also, the morale of staff and management could be affected by the continuing uncertainty and I appreciate the Minister is trying to bring the matter to a conclusion in their interests also. It would also be difficult to maintain the confidence of funding agencies and customers in those circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank the Minister for empowering the employees with the employee share ownership trust. I understand the Government authorised the Minister to enter negotiations with staff on an employee share ownership plan for up to 14.9 per cent of the State's shareholding: 5 per cent in return for change in the bank and 9 per cent through purchase. Details of the scheme have been worked out and will be implemented on the sale of the bank. Disposal of benefits to employees will be managed in an agreed way <Col N="516" /> which will be tax efficient from the perspective of the employees. This gives those employees reasonable compensation for their full co-operation with the necessary changes at the bank as well as facilitating their buying into the new operation in a way that will prove mutually beneficial for owners and employees. I understand that ICC Bank employees are in favour of the decision to sell the bank.</P>
    <P>I wish to turn to the bank's progressive Cork branch. I must declare my interest, as I have been a customer of the bank since 1992 in a number of business transactions. I do not have any money in the bank, but I have always considered the arrangement as a partnership &ndash; business people provide the projects and the bank provides the finance. The Cork branch is highly regarded in business and banking circles in the Cork region and I hope under its new ownership it will retain its own identity and unique corporate market. ICC Bank is located in a landmark riverside building facing the South Mall on Grand Parade since 1980 and sees itself as a very important business market. The bank celebrated 30 years of business in Cork this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I might do that; I think I get one from him every year. The bank is in the old Legion of Mary premises in Cork and since the first regional office was established in Cork in 1969 it has held a very strong financial position in the southern capital and throughout Munster. It has been very supportive of small businesses in Cork and the greater Cork area and I am particularly pleased that this year it entered a prime example of public-private partnership with Aer Rianta and the developers of the Cork Business Enterprise Park at Cork Airport. This is a prime example of the bank and the public sector, in the form of Aer Rianta, becoming involved in a unique e-commerce project which is turning out to be very successful. Several years ago the bank was involved in providing finance to small businesses at 6.75 per cent. That percentage was probably very low &ndash; interest rates on long-term or term loans was 9 or 10  per cent. This was a Government initiative, but the bank was most successful in supporting small businesses which wanted to develop their factories or business premises. At the time those rates were extremely competitive and they helped the business sector grow, although they would be considered high compared to the rates available now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another important aspect of this bank which I hope will not be lost. It has a venture capital investment programme to which it appointed a director in Cork earlier this year. It got involved in a number of businesses and venture capital projects in the Cork area, for example, Alps Electric Ireland Limited in Millstreet and Phoenix Peripheral Solutions which was established in Mallow. I <Col N="517" /> hope the bank will not be absorbed completely into the Bank of Ireland and that it will retain its unique position serving the corporate sector. I hope it will retain its identity and continue the many services it has been providing to businesses in the greater Cork region and throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I am not sure if Deputy Noonan has ever been in business or been involved with ICC Bank. I have personal experience of the bank and I would be the first to say if I thought it was doing a bad job. My experiences have all been good and the business people with whom I am associated in Cork have nothing but the highest praise for the bank.</P>
    <P>Contrary to Deputy McDowell's comments, in my experience Bank of Ireland has been to the fore in assisting small businesses. I am involved in a number of business enterprises in the Cork area and I have great admiration for Bank of Ireland which has been most supportive of small business in Cork. Perhaps the Deputy has had different experiences.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister luck with the sale. Many business people in Cork will continue to support the ICC Bank when the sale is completed.</P>

        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> The Minister for Finance is an advocate of capitalism, red in tooth and claw. Fine Gael, as Deputy Noonan indicated, is of the same philosophy. In his contribution, he tried to make a weak excuse about competition, but ICC Bank is not being sold to a competitor in the market but to a massive banking corporation which already controls a huge sector of that market. Competition is being lessened, not increased. In any case, where Irish banks are concerned, there has been a cartel for many years wherein the banks' profits had primacy over all other concerns and the customer was far down the line in the order of priorities.</P>
      <P>The banks in this economy already wield enormous power. The two major players, Allied Irish Bank and Bank of Ireland, each have annual profits of nearly £1 billion. Unquestionably, these institutions wield huge power over virtually all aspects of the economic lives of ordinary people. This power is wielded by faceless men and women in the boardrooms and policy making sections of the banks which have no democratic accountability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take, for example, one of our most fundamen<Col N="518" /> tal human needs, shelter. Two cartels, the builders and landowners, on the one hand, and the banks and financial institutions, on the other, control the ability of people to put a roof over their heads. In the process of fulfilling that basic human need, people are bled dry by those institutions. They think they are paying £90,000 for a modest home, which is an enormous sacrifice for them. This Government and, to a certain extent the previous Government, sat on their hands for four years and allowed profiteers to put up the price of houses to these levels. However, people do not pay £90,000 for such homes, they pay £250,000 or more over 20 years. There is now talk of homes being bought over two generations, over 30, 40 or even 50 years. That is enslaving people to the financial institutions, to whom the Minister is now proposing to give further power and control over the lives of these people.</P>
    <P>What is the track record of these institutions? All the major banks have been exposed as being up to their necks in tax and other fiddles over the past 15 years, yet nobody has alluded to that in this debate. Major banks have systematically defrauded the tax system to a level that is currently unknown, although we know it is substantial. Banks and financial institutions colluded in the establishment of bogus offshore accounts to assist a privileged minority to defraud the taxation system while ordinary people paid heavily. In some cases, bank charges were falsified behind the customers' backs to maximise the profit of these powerful economic cartels.</P>
    <P>A major investigation is being carried out by a committee of the Dáil into those financial irregularities and fraud. It has not yet reported and will not do so for a number of months. A High Court inspector is currently examining the Ansbacher affair, which may well touch on the activities of other banks, yet the Minister informs the Dáil that he has already agreed to sell ICC Bank to one bank, the Bank of Ireland. Why not wait until these investigations are concluded? Why not wait until the Committee of Public Accounts publishes its report? We will find out if the Bank of Ireland or any other institution is fit to be considered a suitable purchaser of a vital State asset. The Minister is showing utter contempt for the investigation by the Dáil and other investigations into the tax fraud activities of the banks by proceeding with this sale before the investigation results have been announced.</P>
    <P>There has been an extremely unhealthy relationship between the banks and the major political parties for many years. The major banks have made substantial financial donations to Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Labour Party. Banks and financial institutions have written off substantial debts to leading former members of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael. The Labour Party, which admittedly came up a poor third in the stakes, was also found to benefit at a time when these institutions squeezed the life blood out of the ordinary people and small businesses. No ordinary person believes that relationship <Col N="519" /> between the political establishment in this State and the banks means politicians, parties and Governments are not influenced in their policy decisions towards the banks at budget time and in respect of other decisions. Perhaps there is no corruption in the sense of illegality, but ordinary people believe a legally corrupt relationship exists where financial institutions pay massive sums to the parties who make crucial decisions that affect the profitability of those institutions. One or two percentage points in tax can mean tens of millions of pounds for these institutions. That has been the nature of the relationship between the political establishment, the parties which make up Governments and these institutions.</P>
    <P>The Government proposes to sell an asset that was created by the labour of our working people and by the involvement of the ordinary people in its dealings over the past several years. As was the case with Telecom Éireann, that asset is to be handed over to a private cartel.</P>
    <P>On the question of share ownership for its employees, workers should beware of Fianna Fáil and PD Ministers bearing gifts in the form of shares in privatised institutions. There are a number of things happening. The Government and the champion of privatisation wants to wipe the eye of workers with this offer of shares, for which they must pay. It wants to draw workers into the loop and thereby overcome opposition to privatisation. It also wants to draw in trade union leaders, in particular, who shamefully had their eyes wiped by the Government in regard to privatisation and who now go along meekly with ideas that are alien to the co-operative spirit and philosophy that underlines the idea of the trade union and labour movement. Workers who become involved in these share ownership deals should watch out.</P>
    <P>The international financial markets are infested with sharks, not with benign people who want to protect the welfare of these workers and their families and work for the good of society. Workers will be given the impression that shares can move only one way, up in value, but the opposite is the case. Workers would do well to read some of the articles in newspapers that are not found on every news stand, <i>The Financial Times </i>and <i> The Wall Street Journal,</i> which highlight how tied in all the international markets are at present and how dependent shares in the banks here are on the health or otherwise of shares in the stock exchanges of New York, London or Tokyo. Those stock exchanges will have a major influence on the value of Irish shares and, therefore, directly on the lives of Irish workers, particularly the workers being tempted into the privatisation loop by these deals.</P>
    <P>The boom in the economy of the United States has extended for much longer than many commentators predicted due to certain worldwide events, including the flight of capital from South East Asia in search of safe havens in the United <Col N="520" /> States. However, that boom is built on enormous indebtedness of households and corporations in the United States. By common consent, stock exchanges are greatly overvalued internationally, and that is also true of the Dublin Stock Exchange. Under the laws of capitalism, it is inevitable that a shake out will come and then workers will see their shares tumble in value. What will the Minister's promises and blandishments mean when workers see the asset that was supposed to guarantee them some kind of remuneration fall significantly in value?</P>
    <P>Who really benefits from privatisation? All we need do is reflect on what happened across the water. It was not the ordinary people who benefited from privatisation in Britain, but the major institutions, the fat cats, who were given the privatised companies at knock down prices and who then went on to enrich themselves obscenely at the expense of the ordinary people whose asset was handed over to them. The water companies were notorious. We have seen the Government ape what happened in Thatcher's Britain. The Government privatised Telecom Éireann, a vital national asset, and within a matter of weeks those who were appointed by the Government to positions in Eircom moved in for a slice of the action. The Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, appointed a former member of her party, Ray MacSharry, to an important position, chairman of Eircom, and within weeks his income from a part-time job was bumped up from £7,500 to £100,000 a year.</P>

        <b>: </b>Far from handing <Col N="521" /> over this national asset to the banking cartels, the matter of public ownership of the banking system as a whole should be under discussion. Any institutions that wield such enormous economic power over the lives of ordinary people should be democratically accountable for their decisions. If there was support or desire for real democracy in the financial institutions that serve the needs of ordinary people, they should be under the democratic control and ownership of the people whose lives they influence to such an degree. Instead of banking being an activity for speculation on the international marketplaces, it would be run on the basis of social and human need, for the wellbeing of society, for the planning our economy to meet the needs of our people, for progress, for economic security, for environmental protection and for all that would make life so much better for our people. Far from making the banks more democratically accountable, the Government wants to give them more power.</P>
      <P>Tá mé glan in aghaidh an Bhille seo, glan in aghaidh príobháidiú an ICC agus glan in aghaidh fealsúnachta an Rialtais seo go dteastaíonn uathu gach comhlacht mór stáit a phríobháidiú. Tá Eircom déanta acu cheana féin agus teastaíonn uathu agus an rud céanna a dhéanamh le Aer Lingus, le Aer Rianta agus le comhlachtaí stáit eile. Tá sé riachtanach go seasfadh daoine suas agus go ndéarfaidís leis an Rialtas seo go gcaithfear stop a chur leis an bhfealsúnacht seo agus leis an rás seo ag an Rialtas i dtreo gach comhlacht tábhachtach stáit sa tír seo a thabhairt do na boic mhóra, do lucht an rachmais.</P>

      <P>I strenuously oppose the Bill. People should take more interest in it than they have up to now. They should rise up and cry stop in case the Government thinks it can move from Eircom to ICC Bank and on to Aer Rianta and Aer Lingus, which is its intention. It is time the trade union movement cried stop instead of doing sweet heart deals with employers and bosses in Government and haggling over valuable State assets, the handing over of which is anathema to the spirit of the trade union movement. We will be denounced as being old fashioned, as party after party, including the Labour Party &ndash; although I am glad it is opposing the Bill &ndash; bow their heads to the new gods of privatisation and the marketplace.</P>
      <P>The wheel will turn and the pendulum will swing again in the same way as it is doing in Britain where 73 per cent of people now want to renationalise the railways as a result of the catastrophic effect of privatisation on people's lives.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fleming</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill, the purpose of which is to facilitate, not to finalise the sale of ICC Bank. Much background work has already been done. The Minister should sell ICC Bank only if the price is right as it would not be in the public interest to do otherwise.</P>
      <P>There are two options when it comes to selling State assets, such as ICC Bank. The first is a public sale, like we had with Telecom Éireann, and the second option is to invite interested parties, both nationally and internationally, to make an offer. Because ICC Bank is a small bank, a public sale would not be suitable. The only feasible option, therefore is to invite banks to state their interest.</P>
      <P>ICC Bank has always played a key role in the area of small and medium sized businesses. I hope the new owner ensures it continues to provide, through its five branches, for this special niche in the market, whether it operates as part of a group or as a separate subsidiary. One of the reasons Bank of Ireland has expressed an interest in ICC Bank is that it is not a strong force in this area. I do not fear for the future operations of ICC Bank or for its staff when it is in private ownership. Because of its size, the State does not have a strategic interest in having a bank specifically for this sector. Over the years the assets and liabilities of Fóir Teoranta have been absorbed into ICC Bank so that is no longer an issue.</P>
      <P>As regards the employee share option plan, this Bill proposes that employees will get 5 per cent of their shares free and that they will have the option of purchasing 9.9 per cent of the company thereafter. I ask the Minister to weigh up the final sale price because it will have implications for the Exchequer. The price must attract one or more purchasers. We must also consider the rights of the customers who have been with ICC Bank over the years and the rights of the employees. These factors must be taken into account before a final price is decided.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to clarify the tax employees will pay on their shares. If employees sell shares, will they be subject to capital gains tax or income tax? I presume if they pay income tax, it would be at the top rate of 46 per cent, whereas the capital gains tax would be at a lower rate. Perhaps there will be an announcement in the forthcoming budget about the tax payable on the sale of shares in an organisation in which employees have a stakeholding. Deputy Joe Higgins said share prices do not always increase. Perhaps the Minister could clarify if an employee's PAYE tax will be reduced if the shares are sold at a loss? I understand employees will receive shares in whatever bank purchases ICC Bank and that they will not receive direct cash payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="523" /> I am pleased the employees in a subsidiary of ICC Bank are being dealt with fairly under this Bill. When Telecom Éireann was sold, there were long and protracted difficulties about the employees of <i>Golden Pages</i> who were excluded from the employee share option plan because it was not a wholly owned subsidiary. Perhaps the Minister could clarify the position on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Section 5 provides that the borrowing limit for ICC Bank be increased by order, following consultation with the Central Bank which is the appropriate regulatory authority and is responsible for the prudential supervision of the bank. Section 7 provides that the borrowing limit of ACC Bank be increased by order following consultation with the Central Bank which is the appropriate regulatory authority and is responsible for the prudential supervision of the bank. The role of the Central Bank in the banking sector and the importance of the prudential management of the banks must be highlighted. This Bill deals with one of the largest and one of the smallest banks in the country. The prudential management of banks has strong implications for the quality of management in banks. Last year, the Governor of the Central Bank told the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service that the Central Bank has a responsibility in relation to the quality of management in various banks. In that regard the Central Bank has a prudential role.</P>
    <P>My comments relate to the banking and financial services industry. They are not specific to ICC Bank, ACC Bank or Bank of Ireland. The Minister said that a due diligence test would be carried out on ICC Bank by the purchaser. I ask the Minister to ensure the Revenue Commissioners carry out a due diligence and revenue audit on the potential purchaser. I would like the purchaser to provide a tax clearance certificate confirming that the tax audits of this purchaser of a large State asset are fully in order and are confirmed as such by the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners. The smallest sports club in the country must provide a tax clearance certificate before it can draw down a grant from the sports capital programme or the National Lottery. The same should apply to the potential purchaser of this bank.</P>
    <P>I have major concerns regarding the non-compliance of the banking sector with regard to the payment of tax. Despite recent inquiries and revelations the banks and other insitutions in the financial sector are still not paying their correct taxes. When the annual report of the Revenue Commissioners was issued in July I asked the chairman for details of amounts recovered by the Revenue Commissioners from the banking and financial sector as a result of their audit tax procedure. Banks exist for the sole purpose of making profit for their shareholders. We have been far too reverential in our treatment of the banks and have placed them in an exalted position. <Col N="524" /> They are run by mere mortals and are subject to the same human failings as the rest of us, and we should always bear that in mind. The chairman of the Revenue Commissioners confirmed to me that Revenue had uncovered £40 million of unpaid taxes by the banking and financial services sector in the years 1996, '97 and '98. In 1998 alone, the Revenue Commissioners carried out 169 audits of the banking and financial services sector and uncovered £16.7 million that should have been paid in tax. This money has now been paid as a direct result of tax audit activity. In 1997, 115 audits were carried out by the Revenue Commissioners, uncovering £9 million in unpaid tax and in 1996, 126 audits were carried out into the banking and financial services sector, uncovering £13.3 million of unpaid tax. This is a major indictment of the banking system in Ireland which is still trying to avoid paying its full share of tax. The chairman of the Revenue Commissioners has also informed me that recoveries have been made to date in 1999 although it is not possible to give a final figure for those. The banks are still up to their old tricks.</P>
    <P>The recently published annual report of the Revenue Commissioners for 1998 highlights that the Revenue carried out 19,260 audits last year yielding £160.7 million. This is an average yield of approximately £8,000 per audit. The average yield of audits in the banking sector was £99,000. More than 10 per cent of the total amount recovered last year &ndash; £16.7 million out of £160 million &ndash; was recovered from the banking and financial services sector. This is information which I received in writing from the chairman of the Revenue Commissioners. The number of audits conducted in this sector was less than 1 per cent of the total audits carried out in the entire country, but it yielded approximately 13 per cent of the total amount of money.</P>
    <P>The banks and financial institutions have a clear obligation in an era of self-assessment to pay their proper tax. If they have any queries on the tax due they should contact the Revenue Commissioners for clarification. They will talk about technical adjustments and interpretational differences but that does not seem to apply to the other tax audits. Everyone must pay his or her proper share of tax. This money &ndash; £40 million in the last three years &ndash; would not have been paid over to the Irish taxpayer had the Revenue Commissioners not done their work. I congratulate the Revenue Commissioners on their outstanding work in uncovering this amount which the banks and financial institutions would not otherwise have handed over to the Irish taxpayer. Is the banking and financial services sector still a high risk category in terms of paying proper tax? If so, I ask the Revenue Commissioners to seek additional powers in the forthcoming Finance Bill. I would be happy to support the Revenue Commissioners in that.</P>
    <P>I make two final comments. First, the purchaser of ICC should provide a certificate that its tax affairs are in order. That requirement would <Col N="525" /> apply to any institution dealing with a State organisation. Second, the Minister should sell only if the price is right. I am sure the Minister's excellent negotiating skills will achieve an excellent price and in that regard I wish him every success.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Fleming for sharing his time with me and I welcome this opportunity to discuss the broad thrust of the Bill.</P>
      <P>This is a Bill to facilitate the sale of ICC Bank. In view of the fact that there is now only one bidder, I am concerned that the Government may not receive a fair price for ICC Bank. I hope the Government has already decided on a minimum price and that the sale will be called off if this is not achieved. Time could then be allowed for other bidders to tender for the purchase of ICC Bank. The bank has been on the market for quite a while and since the early 1990s has been spoken of as a bank which could be sold.</P>
      <P>One could argue that there is no need for State involvement in banking at this point in Irish economic life. The Industrial Credit Corporation is a very small player in Irish banking but in its early years ICC Bank played a very important part in developing the ethos of business in Irish society. I hope whoever purchases the bank will allow that ethos to develop and flourish. One could argue that the bank which purchases ICC Bank will have that business ethos. However, if it is bought by a large bank, ICC Bank could be absorbed completely and the driving force which made it a success could be diluted. I am concerned about that possibility. I am concerned about the customer. A customer with a business plan involving a long-term loan with ICC Bank who suffered a slight hiccup in regard to repayments could renegotiate with ICC Bank if it were on its own. However, there could be difficulties for such customers if ICC Bank were taken over by another institution which did not have the same mentality in regard to lending to small and medium sized businesses. While I hope that will not arise given our healthy economy and low interest rates, it could have a bearing if there were a downturn in the economy or, more importantly, an increase in interest rates.</P>
      <P>I am a little concerned about the sale. I hope the Government and the Minister's advisers and officials have a bottom line and that if the bid is short of that, a plan will immediately be drawn up to allow ICC Bank to continue and to provide any investment necessary for it to grow and flourish. I understand a further State injection would possibly be needed to allow that happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am also concerned about interest rates. Far too often we have heard of individual cases of overcharging by banks in regard to interest rates. We need to appoint an ombudsman on a statutory basis who would have the full authority and legislative power to, at the behest of any bank customer, investigate their documentation and arbitrate on whether they were overcharged. I have heard of numerous occasions of overcharg<Col N="526" /> ing by banks, whether intentionally or unintentionally. My main concern is not mortgage loans because people are very conscious of mortgage interest rates, which are very high profile. However, there is potential for the banks not to pass on interest rate reductions on smaller loans such as credit cards, motor loans and home insurance loans. The banks have been very slow in the past to reduce interest rates on those type of loans because the market for them is not as high profile or cut and thrust as that for mortgages. We must take a serious look at the whole banking system because of the evidence that is emerging about overcharging.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fleming referred to the fact that banks are avoiding tax. If people in the banking sector are avoiding tax, it may also be suggested that they are continuing to overcharge their customers. Not every customer has the ability or expertise to find out how much they should be charged on a loan, particularly the smaller loans which do not relate to house purchases.</P>
    <P>Publicans need a tax clearance certificate to renew their licences. I am of the firm opinion that anyone purchasing ICC Bank or any other State asset should have to produce a guarantee from the Revenue Commissioners that they are fully up-to-date in the payment of their taxes. We were too soft on these institutions in the past and it is time for us to state firmly that tax avoidance is not acceptable at any level, whether by small farmers or large banks.</P>

      <P>The Minister is much better than Deputy Noonan on that programme.</P>
      <P>I share the deep and profound reservations of my colleagues on these benches in relation to the sale of ICC Bank. Six years ago, in the happy early days of the partnership Government, the Minister and I would have strongly supported the idea of a third force in banking. We recognised that key elements were lacking in the then system, particularly the total lack of competition. There was, effectively, a cosy cartel among the clearing house banks. They set the interest rates and consumers had to respond as best we could. We also felt we desperately needed a bank which reflected the ethos of the credit union movement and the TSB, not just because those institutions were more relaxed in how they dealt with consumers and more supportive of people on very low or no incomes, but because they provided financial services which were much more consumer oriented. On that basis, the third force was a relevant idea which we could have pursued in relation to ICC Bank.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are similar institutions in many of our <Col N="527" /> European partners, such as the Banques Populaires. The Unity Trust Bank, which is part of the co-operative movement in the UK, visited the Labour Party a few years ago. Those are examples of banks which are oriented towards very small businesses, households and consumers in a way that the big banks in this country have not been.</P>
    <P>The fundamental question always asked by people on the right in politics is should the State be involved in running a bank. As my colleague, Deputy McDowell, has so cogently outlined, the short answer in relation to ICC Bank is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;. There is a continuing, long-standing role for a bank providing essential services to SMEs. When one of my close relatives was starting her first business she and her colleagues depended on ICC Bank to get the business going.</P>
    <P>Throughout Europe, especially in the UK, there has been a recent rethink about the whole privatisation mania. That is noticeable in the current controversy between Vodafone and Mannesmann, where Vodafone is trying to effect a reverse takeover. The German financial regulatory authorities are examining whether a major German utility should be allowed pass into what they regard as volatile foreign ownership. This is also the situation in regard to utilities generally, such as rail, water supply, nuclear fuel and so on, in the United Kingdom. Anyone who travels on the new rail networks, as I did last year from Newcastle to London, and who compares it with the performance of British Rail some years previously, would have to conclude that the privatisation of the railways has been a tragic mistake which set the whole situation back ten or 15 years. The money business is regarded by many people as the most important utility. We must examine closely every step we take in that area.</P>
    <P>I welcome a provision in the Bill which our party has supported strongly in the past. We were, along with the MSF union, the progenitors of the ESOP and ESOT concepts. I remember the battles I had in this House last year during the Dublin North by-election to encourage the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, to finally put in place the ESOP in Telecom Éireann. When Telecom Éireann was sold, many citizens asked why they did not get free shares in their own company. It is hard to answer that question. However, it has given the Minister the huge sum of £6 billion to chart our progress over the next number of years.</P>
    <P>Like most of my colleagues on these benches, I am opposed to the sale of ICC Bank. It is the wrong institution at the wrong time. There is a need to rethink. Ownership of State enterprises should not be transferred willy-nilly in response to the privatisation mania which has reduced many services in neighbouring jurisdictions to a primitive state of performance. I oppose the Bill.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputies for their contributions and Deputies Noonan and McDowell in particular for facilitating the early taking of this necessary Bill. I appreciate their assistance. Many of the points raised can be teased out in greater detail on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>Deputy Noonan said there is only one willing bidder left. The financial institutions market has changed in recent months. Each financial institution which was to make a bid has its own views on why it later changed its mind. I would prefer if there was more than one preferred bidder at this stage but such are the realities of the marketplace, and the appetite for smaller banking institutions is not what it was six months to one year ago. We and other financial institutions have a lesson to learn from this.</P>
      <P>I do not envisage long-term involvement by the State in any of the State banking institutions. The proof, if proof were needed, is the lack of interest in the sale of the ICC Bank, a small but very good institution. No one would say it has not been well managed and run for a long time. It has filled a particular niche in the marketplace. Yet, there is only one preferred bidder left. Recent events in the financial sector show how difficult it is for small operations to compete.</P>
      <P>The question has been asked how we can guarantee competition if financial institutions are amalgamated into larger institutions. The climate in Ireland has changed as a result of developments in Europe, particularly in the last six months with the introduction of greater competition in the mortgage market. This will become the norm. One will have to be able to compete in the financial world. This will bring its own problems.</P>
      <P>I announced recently at the Institute of Bankers dinner a strategic review of the banking industry. It is time to consider what is likely to happen and to tease out the problems and opportunities. We are in danger of waking up one fine morning in six or seven years' time to find that none of the financial institutions operating in Ireland has an Irish base and somebody is likely to ask how did it happen overnight.</P>

Perhaps there are changes we should think about now, but it has happened in other countries. I do not know what the shareholdings are, but I suspect ownership of the two major banks in Ireland &ndash; the AIB and Bank of Ireland &ndash; which have been floated on the Stock Exchange is held by persons living abroad. Yet, they are regarded as Irish banking institutions. In the present climate <Col N="529" /> if someone makes a bid for either of them, nothing can be done about it.</P>

    <P>I will endeavour to deal with the questions raised by Deputies Noonan and McDowell on Committee Stage. It is important that we facilitate the passage of this necessary Bill. The final due diligent process has been initiated by Bank <Col N="530" /> of Ireland, the only preferred bidder left in the race.

    </Speaker>
    <P>&ndash;the total inadequacy of his policy on asy<Col N="531" /> lum seekers, which has been described by a Minister of State in the Government as a &ldquo;doom-laden <i>ad hoc</i> policy&rdquo;, &ldquo;chaos&rdquo; and &ldquo;a shambles&rdquo;;</P>
    <P>&ndash;his failure to ensure that adequate procedures are in place to allow applications for asylum to be processed effectively and efficiently and the consequent hardship caused to many applicants;</P>
    <P>&ndash;his failure to bring forward any comprehensive immigration policy;</P>
    <P>&ndash;his action in officially opening Clover Hill Prison and the Mountjoy Women's Prison when neither of these jails were in a position to take inmates due to serious flaws in the construction process;</P>
    <P>&ndash;the continued overcrowding in prisons, particularly in Mountjoy Prison where almost twice the official numbers have, on recent occasions, been detained overnight;</P>
    <P>&ndash;the death of five prisoners in apparent suicides in prisons since the beginning of 1999;</P>
    <P>&ndash;the renewed spate of armed robberies;</P>
    <P>&ndash;the failure to provide adequate protection for communities continuing to suffer severe problems from crime and vandalism;</P>
    <P>&ndash;the ongoing industrial relations and morale problems in the Garda Síochána;</P>
    <P>&ndash;the unacceptable waiting lists for appointments with solicitors at legal aid centres, which in some cases have increased to almost two years;</P>
    <P>&ndash;his failure to deal with the shortages of resources and over-heavy workload in the Chief State Solicitor's office, which were identified by the Director of Public Prosecutions as having contributed to errors made in the prosecution of the Nora Wall case; and</P>
    <P>&ndash;his failure to introduce necessary legislation to regulate the private security industry,</P>
    <P>has no confidence in the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
    <P>Moving a motion of no confidence in a Minister is a most serious matter. Short of tabling a motion of no confidence in the Government itself, it is probably the most serious step an Opposition party can take. It is not a step that should be taken lightly, casually or without sufficient justification. In the case of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, I am satisfied that this motion is well merited and many Government Deputies, and not just those in the Progressive Democrats, believe it is well justified.</P>
    <P>It is my intention to judge the performance of <Col N="532" /> the Minister solely on the basis of the criteria and standards he himself set down. His period in office since July 1997 has been characterised by a sequence of failed policies and broken promises. When in Opposition, Deputy O'Donoghue was merciless in his criticism of those in power for any failures, however minor, in regard to justice, prisons or policing issues. There was hardly a corner shop robbery during that period that did not lead to a call for the then Minister to give the House an explanation. More serious crimes led to regular calls for ministerial resignations.</P>
    <P>On the Order of Business, during Question Time and in Private Members' time he denounced any perceived policy shortcoming, demanded accountability and did not accept any excuses. The law according to Deputy O'Donoghue when in Opposition was that the buck stopped with the Minister and that the Minister had to accept political responsibility for every armed robbery, prison escape and failed prosecution. In Opposition, Deputy O'Donoghue was the man with all the answers and all the solutions. In Government, however, his record as Minister shows that he has feet of clay.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the people who work in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, from the Secretary General down, are individually fine, decent, sympathetic and hardworking people. However, there is little doubt that the Department, as an institution, is one of the most conservative in the State. It requires a politician of exceptional character and strength to break free from the influence of the Department and to ensure that it is the Minister's agenda that is pursued, and not the conservative, narrow agenda of the Department. The Minister has proven himself unable to fulfil this task.</P>
    <P>The previous Government forced the Refugee Act on a reluctant Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The Department dragged its feet in terms of the implementation of the Act until there was a change of Government. One of the first things Deputy O'Donoghue did when he took office was to announce that the Refugee Act was effectively being shelved.</P>
    <P>Nothing illustrates the total transformation of Deputy O'Donoghue from Opposition to Government more than his attitude towards the position of asylum seekers. Speaking in this House in October 1995, Deputy O'Donoghue, then Fianna Fáil spokesperson on justice, said:</P>
    <P>The status of refugees is an issue which should strike a chord with every man, woman and child here who has any grasp of Irish history, our history books being littered with the names and deeds of those driven from our country out of fear of persecution.</P>
    <P>I could quote many other fine sentiments expressed by Deputy O'Donoghue when in Opposition in which he called for a more caring and sympathetic approach to asylum seekers. However, now that he is safely in power and <Col N="533" /> when he has the opportunity to do something about this issue, his approach is characterised by a lack of sympathy or understanding, and is noticeably short on compassion.</P>
    <P>Anyone who has taken the time to talk to asylum seekers and illegal immigrants will know that, at its core, this is a human problem. The constant reality for illegal immigrants and asylum seekers is the fear facing those who have sought refuge in our country, the uncertainty of their circumstances, the inability to make plans for the future, their status in a virtual legal limbo, the terror of being deported back to the jurisdiction from which they fled and, increasingly, the verbal and physical abuse they receive from the small minority of racists in our society.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the Minister seems to see this problem primarily through the eyes of the bureaucrat or the accountant. The preoccupation is with figures on a balance sheet, the potential cost, the gross numbers, the need for effective administrative procedures and neat solutions to deal with the problem. If we have learned anything it surely should be that problems involving human beings cannot be dealt with in a rigid, unyielding and inflexible way.</P>
    <P>It is wrong to suggest that Ireland is being asked to carry a disproportionate share of the refugee problem in Europe. Even if one assumes that the figure of 8,156 applications for asylum in Ireland is correct, and many people believe that there is an element of double accounting in this number, it is still far below the level experienced by most of our fellow members of the EU. There were 45,000 applications in Holland last year, 57,000 in Britain and almost 100,000 in Germany. Belgium, a country with six times as many inhabitants per square kilometre as Ireland, received around 22,000 applications for asylum last year.</P>
    <P>In light of these figures, those like Deputies Callely and Noel Ahern, who imply that this country is in some way being overrun by asylum seekers, are grossly overstating the scale of the problem, unnecessarily creating fear and fanning the flames of intolerance. It is true that, unlike most of our European neighbours, there has been little or no tradition of refugees seeking asylum in Ireland. It is a relatively new phenomenon, but it is a manageable challenge for us to reach and solve. In particular, there is no excuse for the organisation and administrative failures that have, in recent weeks, seen asylum seekers treated in a deplorable manner, or for the failure of the Government to develop in two and a half years a coherent and humane over-arching immigration policy.</P>
    <P>The Irish are a predominantly humane and tolerant people and I believe that the great majority have been shocked not just by the appalling scenes that have been witnessed at the refugee application centre in Mount Street over the past two weeks, but also by the increasingly harsh and intolerant tone that has come to characterise public pronouncements by senior Ministers on this issue in recent times.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="534" /> Irrespective of the economic status of people arriving here or their nationality, skin colour or ethnic background, they are entitled to be treated by the institutions of State with courtesy, respect and dignity. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has failed to ensure that those seeking asylum in the State are treated in an acceptable manner. I do not blame the staff at the refugee application centre who have been working under intolerable conditions for some time. Indeed, in many respects it was the decision of the staff to take action that finally forced the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, to acquire additional accommodation and provide some extra staff, although it is clear from the continuing problems that not enough is being done.</P>
    <P>Prior to coming into the House I was informed that negotiations between the unions and negotiators on behalf of the Minister have broken down. The level of service provided as of now for asylum seekers and those seeking support at the Minister's much vaunted one stop shop is very much in doubt.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue must take responsibility for allowing a situation to develop last week that frankly besmirched the good name of the country. The Minister has been in office since July 1997 and it is time he stopped blaming the previous Administration and accepted that he has failed utterly to do what is needed. Two and a half years after the Minister came into office promising to end the delays in processing applications for asylum, we had the appalling spectacle of men, women and children queuing from as early as 5 a.m. for hours with nowhere to sit or shelter from the weather, without even the most basic toilet facilities, only to be turned away and told that no service was available at the office. As we speak, this situation is ongoing. Despite the pressure of recent days the Minister has proved unable to deal with this basic problem.</P>
    <P>If these scenes were not bad enough, the atmosphere has been further inflamed by a series of harsh and intolerant pronouncements by Ministers. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, in a phrase that will be music to the ears of the minority in the country who are racist, recently spoke on RTE about the country being &ldquo;swamped&rdquo; by asylum seekers. On &ldquo;Questions &amp; Answers&rdquo; last week the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, suggested that the problem, as he categorised it, had been solved by June or July of this year and blamed the Government decision in July to allow employers employ asylum seekers as attracting more to enter the country. Since the Government decision of last July just 15 work permits have been issued to employers to take on asylum seekers. This must be considered in the context of the thousands of asylum seekers in the country. In Wexford, my home town, there are 215 asylum seekers, only four of whom have received permits to work, despite the fact that the bulk of them are skilled and able and are most anxious to work. I can give details of individuals who have been allowed <Col N="535" /> work, who have been welcomed into paid employment and have proved a huge asset to the companies in which they work.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, quite correctly described the Government's approach to dealing with asylum seekers as &ldquo;doom laden&rdquo;, &ldquo;<i>ad hoc</i>&rdquo; and &ldquo;a shambles&rdquo;. Nowhere is the shambles more obvious or the <i>ad hoc</i> nature of the policy more evident than in relation to the question of work permits for asylum seekers. The refusal to allow asylum seekers to work is a form of double discrimination. It discriminates against them by preventing asylum seekers from playing a constructive role in society and by compelling them to remain on what is generally regarded as a subsistence level of income.</P>
    <P>Later this week the House will begin debating the Human Rights Commission Bill. It is worth recalling that Article 23 of the universal declaration on human rights says that everyone has the right to work, to free choice of employment, just and favourable conditions of work and protection against unemployment. The State is failing in its obligations under Article 23 in regard to those from outside the EU who find themselves in Ireland. With my colleagues in the Labour Party I have long urged that the law be changed to allow asylum seekers to work, as is the case in most other European countries. Reform in this area was vigorously opposed by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and his Department.</P>
    <P>When it was announced in July, following another prolonged dispute between the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, and the Progressive Democrats, that regulations were being changed to allow asylum seekers work after they had spent 12 months here, there were grounds for optimism and hope that a more humane and practical approach would finally be put in place. However, the scheme is so limited and restrictive as to be practically useless. Those who opposed the move in the first place have clearly been successful in frustrating any meaningful reform. An asylum seeker must first find a potential employer. The employer must then apply for a work permit to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. That process can take a month or more, and a fee is payable, ranging from £25 for a one month permit to £125 for a five to 12 months permit, a year being the maximum time for which a permit will be issued. Employers also have to show that they made reasonable efforts to have the job filled by an Irish national or an EU citizen. Is it any wonder, given these bureaucratic contingencies, that so few permits have been sought and issued? Blame for this ludicrous situation must be shared by the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, and the Tánaiste who has direct responsibility for employment matters.</P>
    <P>Of course, it has to be acknowledged that a considerable number of those who are seeking asylum will not qualify as refugees. They are economic migrants who fled the dire economic <Col N="536" /> conditions of their own country, just as hundreds of thousands of Irish people have done down through the years. It is a sobering thought for the Government and the House to think that just ten years ago there were well in excess of 100,000 Irish illegals in the United States. These were people who left this country and took the risk of entering the United States illegally, not because they were subject to religious, racial or political discrimination, but because this country could not at that time offer them a decent living. At that time there were pleas from Deputies in every party urging the US authorities to treat Irish illegals humanely and allow them to stay &ndash; in most cases, they were allowed stay. I am quite sure there were constituents from south Kerry among the Irish illegals in the United States at that time and I would be astonished if, as a backbencher or chairman of Kerry County Council, the current Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform did not make representations to the US authorities to give constituents the legal right to remain in the US.</P>
    <P>It is time to review our approach to asylum seekers and to devise a totally new immigration policy that takes account not just of the needs of our economy and labour force, but also of our obligations to the wider world, especially to those who are not as well fed or as comfortable as the majority of our citizens. We need to find a way to regularise the position of those already here. We need to urgently develop a new immigration policy which will help address the labour shortages that already exist and which will, according to virtually every economist in the land, increase in years to come. One forecast over the weekend suggested that we would need 160,000 immigrants over the next seven years if the targets set out in the national plan were to be met. It seems, based on newspaper reports over the past few days, that the Government is at last beginning to address that issue. The intensified debate and the tabling of this motion by the Opposition have no doubt concentrated the minds of Ministers, but it would be shameful if our immigration policy focused on cherry picking skilled or semi-skilled personnel from less developed countries to meet our economic needs. It must be a strong humanitarian-based policy.</P>
    <P>In my contribution I have concentrated on the Minister's record in one area for which he has responsibility, but as I said at the outset, his record has been a chapter of disasters. Other Members will deal in more detail with these issues. I will conclude by making a few remarks. New prisons have been opened but remain unoccupied and there has been a substantial rise in crime. All these would have been cause for the Minister to demand the resignation of his predecessor. At the end of the debate, Members opposite will either support this resolution of no confidence in the Minister &ndash; I believe the majority in the House does not have confidence in him &ndash; or they will share collective responsibility and stand over the policies. That remark <Col N="537" /> and call will lie heaviest on the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell. She has talked the talk and we will see at the end of the debate whether she will walk the walk.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Mayo)</i>
        <b>:</b> The timing of this motion is opportune. Seldom has the competence of a Minister to manage his brief been so seriously called into question. Seldom have so many different elements and sections of a Ministry been found wanting or malfunctioning simultaneously as the arrangements under the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue. Justice, Equality and Law Reform is one of the central planks of a stable, safe and organised society. Fine Gael supports this motion because, as Deputy Howlin said, the buck stops firmly with the Minister.</P>
      <P>This was the binding principle set down by the Minister when in Opposition. If something went wrong in the courts, as in the Judge Dominic Lynch case, the responsibility lay politically with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. If a bank raid occurred, even if the Minister was only a matter of days in office, as in the case of the Brinks-Allied raid, the Minister was answerable and culpable.</P>
      <P>It is this Minister, therefore, who must shoulder responsibility for a prison system that is in chaos, a courts system that undermines public confidence in itself by glaringly inconsistent sentencing policies, a Garda force where there are constant and major industrial relations problems and disgruntlement fuelled by the Minister because of the manner in which he heightened Garda expectations during his two and a half year rant in Opposition. Add to that the indecision on refugees and asylum seekers, delays and U-turns in dealing with the liquor licensing laws and the failure to introduce legislation to regulate the private security industry, the Fraud Offences Bill, the Prevention of Corruption Bill, the Sex Offenders Registration Bill, the Criminal Law Insanity Bill and the Prison Services Bill. One can see the reason public perception of the Minister's performance is of dismal failure.</P>
      <P>I do not say this off the top of my head. What we are doing by supporting the motion is giving political expression to a widespread perception that the Minister is simply not up to the job. Indeed, much of the media criticism and analysis of the Minister is delivered in far less charitable or restrained terms by political commentators than those of Deputy Howlin and myself. A large part of the public disillusionment at the Minister's performance derives from the fact that, for two and a half years in Opposition, he ranted and raved in his daily tirade against the rainbow Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No recognition was given for achievement. No credit was given for the drug trafficking legislation which has been responsible for putting so many drugs barons behind bars or forcing them into exile with their hitherto untouchable empires in tatters. No credit was given for establishing the <Col N="538" /> Criminal Assets Bureau which has seized almost £7 million in money and ill-gotten property and which has systematically tackled the problem of money laundering. No credit was given for the establishment of the Garda national drugs unit in July 1995 or the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigations, or for commencing, after ten years of stagnation, a prison building programme of 840 additional prison spaces in St. Patrick's institution, Castlerea special unit, The Curragh, Limerick, Portlaoise, Castlerea main prison and Wheatfield. No credit was given for amending the bail laws which the Minister has since failed to implement, introducing the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Persons Act, 1997, dealing with the new phenomenon of syringe attacks making additional judicial appointments and streamlining court procedures, where the delays for litigants in obtaining a court date in civil cases in the Dublin Circuit Court was reduced from two years to six weeks and in family law cases where the delay was reduced from 16 months to four months. No credit was given for the automated fingerprinting identification system which reduced the number of man hours required to identify fingerprints from 500 hours to ten minutes.</P>
    <P>As spokesman for his party in Opposition, the Minister could not get his seal of office quickly enough. Zero tolerance would be the order of the day. All crime, major and petty, would be punished and stamped out. In spite of the ridicule poured on his zero tolerance philosophy by the Garda Commissioner and the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors, this was going to be the Minister's credo in Government. This was the yardstick by which he would be judged and by which he wanted to be measured. Since then we have heard little if anything from the Minister about zero tolerance apart from his obsession with the prison incarceration binge to which he is totally committed. Thankfully, by and large, zero tolerance has been quietly abandoned and debunked.</P>
    <P>Nobody denies that justice, equality and law reform is a difficult portfolio. The Minister, however, has foundered badly among the myriad of challenges which are the lot of Ministers for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. He has failed to meet or cope with the challenges, to see many of the challenges as opportunities and to embrace the new enlightened thinking which urges penal reform instead of adding more prison spaces to an already failed and chaotic system. He refuses to take on board the recommendations of the Whitaker Committee, the Management of Offenders &ndash; A Five Year Plan, Tackling Crime &ndash; Discussion Paper, commissioned by his Department, or the research carried out by the Irish Penal Reform Trust, which urge a range of viable alternatives to the Minister's preoccupation with locking up people.</P>
    <P>Last December the Crime Forum report commissioned by the Minister produced the most damning denunciation of his prison policy. I will confine myself to four brief quotations: &ldquo;most <Col N="539" /> people accept that imprisonment should be a last resort&rdquo;; &ldquo;we imprison more people, especially young people, than most countries&rdquo;; &ldquo;sexual violence and exploitation in prison is a serious problem&rdquo;; and &ldquo;prison is an expensive and potentially damaging option to be used with care&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>How can any Parliament vote confidence in a Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform who presides over a prison system which is the most costly in the world, has more prison officers than prisoners, is infested with drugs, neither deters nor rehabilitates, where 2,500 of the 10,000 who pass through it each year are jailed for non-payment of fines, where 50 per cent of the prison population serve sentences of less than three months, where prison officers are paid up to £40,000 in overtime each year and where it costs £52,000 just to keep a prisoner in jail for one year? </P>
    <P>How can a Parliament vote confidence in a Minister who is responsible for a situation where only 20 out of 300 sex offenders in jail receive intensive therapy or treatment? How can the House have confidence in a Minister who officially opened a £26 million prison at Clover Hill on 1 July last and which, five and a half months later, is still empty because the security doors do not work, the fire alarm triggers off false alarms, the floors have to be relaid, the computer system is not working and the electric wiring is dangerous? Similarly, the women's prison officially opened by the Minister is still not functional.</P>

        <b>:</b> Perhaps the reason the Minister clings stubbornly to his failed prison policy is that he sees it as the last residue of his discredited zero tolerance philosophy. Perhaps he sees the &ldquo;lock them up&rdquo; policy as the hard man, macho Minister image. Is this the reason he is determined to carry on regardless and add 1,000 more prison spaces, at a cost of £100 million, and 1,000 more prison officers, at an annual cost of £25 million, to an already failed and chaotic system? Imagine the positive results that would accrue if the Minister invested a fraction of this cost in enhancing the probation and welfare service, developing more community service orders, restorative justice, more juvenile diversion programmes, training courses for vulnerable youngsters and sheltered accommodation for vulnerable females and vulnerable young males released from prison.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the problems with this Minister is his inability to come to terms with his lack of performance and to do something positive to address his deficiencies. From the outset of his term as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Minister has displayed an unenviable ability to get things wrong. In November 1997, five men were detained by gardaí in Tallaght for possession of £3 million worth of cannabis. The men <Col N="540" /> had to be released because the District Court judge who extended their period of detention had not been a nominated judge for the purpose of the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act. The matter was raised in the House by Opposition Deputies, including myself. The Minister strode in here, in his usual hands-in-pockets fashion, with no file, no proper information, no answers, no explanation and no apology. He got a hammering and took a well deserved battering. Three of the men were re-arrested but then had to be re-released because the judge on that occasion ruled that they could not be re-arrested for the same offence. Again, the Minister was brought before the House and delivered another less than impressive performance and again he refused to accept responsibility for the debacle.</P>
    <P>The most sensational judicial controversy in the history of the State saw a Supreme Court judge, a High Court judge and a county registrar resign from office. The Chief Justice's report on the Sheedy affair is a damning indictment of the involvement of both judges in the case. Instead of demanding a full explanation as to why two senior judicial figures did what they did, the Minister introduced a Judicial Pensions Bill which was forced through this House, against the will of the Opposition, and which awarded both former judges pensions of £40,000 and £30,000 respectively. The taxpayer, who is paying the piper, was left without answers or explanation.</P>
    <P>One of the features of the Minister's Opposition tactics was to meet, empathise with and heighten the expectations of various sectoral interests. We vividly recall the Garda march on the Dáil in support of pay demands during the period of office of the Fine Gael, Labour and Democratic Left coalition Government. Having been so eagerly greeted at the gates of Leinster House by Deputy O'Donoghue and his colleagues, the Garda must have had an expectation that it would receive a positive response once the Deputy became a Minister. The Deputy became Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and there followed the blue flu, an unprecedented two day withdrawal of Garda labour where the safety of the State and its citizens was left fully exposed.</P>
    <P>There is now another stand-off in which the Minister is at loggerheads with the Garda. This time, the multi-million pound PULSE IT system lies paralysed because a further productivity stalemate has arisen. Like the blue flu, one can only wonder why this issue was not addressed in time. Why was it allowed to go over the brink? Why was the looming difficulty not foreseen and forestalled? Why did the Minister not take the initiative and instruct his officials to get involved in meaningful negotiations instead of dilly-dallying about whether talks would be official or unofficial? All the indications now are that positions are becoming even more polarised as a result of the Minister's weekend utterances.</P>
    <P>During the past year, the Minister allowed the long-running dispute between his Department <Col N="541" /> and the Office of the Chief State Solicitor to go to the wire, with cases in Limerick being dismissed. An interim report of the expert group on the probation and welfare service, established by the Minister, recommended the immediate appointment of 43 additional welfare officers to underpin the hopelessly overwhelmed welfare service. Surprise, surprise, the Minister refused. Another crisis, another stand-off, another withdrawal of labour and, finally, the Minister again backed down at the eleventh hour, grudgingly accepting the proposals of the group he had established.</P>
    <P>On 25 January 1998, <i>The Sunday Business Post</i> carried an article entitled &ldquo;Crackdown on Security Criminals&rdquo;. A spokeswoman for the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform informed the paper that proposals for new legislation were to be published &ldquo;within the next two weeks&rdquo;. Almost two years later, in spite of a report from a working group established by Deputy Nora Owen when she served as Minister, pleas from the private security industry and repeated queries to the Taoiseach on the Order of the Business, there is still no sign of the Bill. It is another pathetic failure.</P>
    <P>An Action Programme for the Millennium promised to increase Garda numbers to 12,000. Two and a half years later, the Minister is 700 short of that figure. He promised a statutory independent prisons authority. Two and a half years later, there is no sign of the legislation aside from another <i>ad hoc</i> arrangement having been put in place. A fast-track system was to be introduced for certain categories of offences, whatever these were supposed to be. Again, that has been either forgotten or abandoned.</P>
    <P>A drug court system was to be set up, an excellent idea, but there is still no sign of it. The Minister guaranteed he would establish a custodial detention centre for convicted addicts and remand prisoners who are addicted, with all other prisons to be drug free. Not alone do we not have the specially designated drug treatment prison but there are drugs in most prisons and there is a fair guarantee that many of those who enter prison drug free will exit drug dependent.</P>
    <P>Once upon a time a murder would have automatically been a front page news item, but that is no longer the case. Gangland killings are the order of the day. Rape and other sexual offences have increased by 30 per cent. The number of women and children fleeing their homes has increased by 35 per cent to almost 5,000 this year. If one takes the past four weeks as a microcosm of the Minister's performance, it is a damning judgment of a man who promised so much but has delivered so little. There were three bank raids in Dublin alone at Dublin Airport, Finglas and Tallaght; three tragic prisons suicides, two in Mountjoy and one in Wheatfield; two officially opened but as yet unopened prisons; a rap on the knuckles from the Swedish authorities for failing to reply, after 18 months, to urgent inquiries about money laundering; the taxpayer was landed with a bill for unspecified compensation paid to <Col N="542" /> an honest and innocent individual from Sligo who was hauled before the court and wrongly accused of stealing a wallet which he had found; a high profile drugs case was thrown out of court because of inadequate Garda evidence; and pictures of &ldquo;Ireland of the welcomes&rdquo;, with the bolted doors of the one stop shop at Lower Mount Street flashed around the world and hundreds of applicants for asylum standing outside.</P>
    <P>Any self-respecting Minister would not have waited for tonight's motion. He would have looked at his performance, taken the honest and obvious course of action and left.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one prisoner in this country for whom we can have little sympathy. He is not imprisoned against his will but entirely voluntarily. He is not imprisoned in Mountjoy, Wheatfield or Portlaoise but in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. His jailers are departmental officials. The prisoner in question is the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, who has enthusiastically given up the freedom to act responsibly and has failed to stamp his authority on his Department. He has allowed his officials to totally dictate the way in which the Department is run. The consequences of this dereliction of duty have been described as &ldquo;a shambles&rdquo; by a member of the Government. The &ldquo;zero-tolerance Minister&rdquo; has become a Minister of zero ambition, zero innovation, zero imagination and zero ability. The sorrowful state of his tenure in office reached its lowest depths when he officially opened Clover Hill Prison and the women's prison in Mountjoy when neither was in a position to take in inmates. If the situation were not so serious, it would be farcical.</P>
      <P>The Minister has discovered that in Government, photo opportunities and soundbites are simply not sufficient. Nowhere has this been better exemplified than by the Government's treatment of asylum seekers who, in spite of what the Minister says, are treated like second class citizens and, in some cases, like animals herded on the street. Only seven of the 5,500 applicants for asylum this year have had their applications granted. A total of 1,000 people are seeking asylum each month. The Eastern Health Board is in chaos and simply cannot cope. It appears the Government's policy is to make this country as uncomfortable and unwelcoming as possible for immigrants in the vain hope that they will simply disappear. In addition, we had the cynical intervention of Deputy Callely, which apparently was tacitly supported by the Taoiseach. This is cheap politics. There are always votes to be gained by heightening racial tension. I do not believe Deputy Callely is a rabid racist, rather he is an opportunistic dimwit with an eye for a few extra votes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In spite of our history and that as far back as 1985 the Taoiseach called for an amnesty for 70,000 illegal Irish immigrants in the US, the Government's immigration policy simply sees immigration as a problem to be combated. We <Col N="543" /> see this in the Eurodac proposal, approved in this House in October, which provides for the fingerprinting of immigrants, and in the Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Bill currently before us. We see it in the obstacles placed in the path of those immigrants who wish to work. Only 30 of the 2,500 immigrants eligible to work have been issued with permits. We see it in the proposals to give immigrants vouchers instead of cash. This proposal represents a significant departure from the principle of equal treatment under social welfare regulations. Dr. Colin Harvey from Amnesty said that, in practice, vouchers stigmatise asylum seekers and do not permit engagement in activities central to community life.</P>
    <P>The Minister and, indeed, the Government should walk down any street in this city where they will see advertisements on windows looking for labour. There is a severe labour shortage in this town and country. According to economists, we require an additional 160,000 workers to deliver implementation of the national development plan. According to the Dublin Chamber of Commerce, work visa plans for non-nationals entering the workforce could be a key factor in solving labour needs and they say 50,000 jobs in the national economy are unfilled. That is what we are looking at. The Tánaiste realises this but is doing nothing about it. Instead she is putting obstacles in people's way.</P>
    <P>On the Minister's handling of the prison system, a number of points have been made by my colleagues from Fine Gael and the Labour Party. There is a number of issues which the Minister needs to address. Zero tolerance has been proved to be a futile policy.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>&ndash;mindful of the backlog of applications inherited by this Government, and the significant strain placed on the asylum process and services by the escalating number of applicants; acknowledging the need for a fair and streamlined process that will eliminate lengthy delays; and acknowl<Col N="544" /> edging the urgent need to promote tolerance and respect for diversity in our society; and recognising the need for a comprehensive and multifaceted strategy to deal with all of these issues, reaffirms its fullest confidence in the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and notes the positive measures taken by the Minister to put resources in place to ensure that all asylum applications are dealt with in an efficient and effective manner;</P>
    <P>&ndash;notes that this has included the provision of 144 additional staff, the establishment of the Refugee Applications Centre and the development of fair and effective procedures and notes also the Minister's plan to provide the further resources now required;</P>
    <P>&ndash;notes that the Minister has established the Refugee Legal Service to ensure that independent legal advice is available to asylum seekers at all stages of the asylum process and an independent monitoring committee to ensure that a quality legal service is provided to asylum seekers;</P>
    <P>&ndash;notes that the Minister brought forward amendments to the Refugee Act, 1996, to make that Act workable, thus providing for a refugee applications commissioner with power to delegate and the establishment of a refugee advisory board and is currently working on regulations to ensure that the Refugee Act, 1996, as amended by the Immigration Act, 1999, is implemented as soon as possible;</P>
    <P>&ndash;notes that the Minister is committed to ensuring that those who are found to be genuine refugees are fully integrated and enjoy all the rights that go with that status and that immigrants generally, irrespective of their status, also have their human rights fully respected;</P>
    <P>&ndash;notes the measures taken by the Minister and the Government in response to the current high level of asylum applications, including the establishment of a directorate to co-ordinate the dispersal of asylum seekers throughout the country to ensure that all asylum seekers are provided with accommodation;</P>
    <P>&ndash;notes that the Minister's Department, in conjunction with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment as appropriate, operates a system under which persons can immigrate legally to Ireland for employment and other purposes;</P>
    <P>&ndash;notes that the Minister has stated on a number of occasions his commitment to review immigration policy, in particular, to facilitate the entry of persons for the purpose of employment and that this matter <Col N="545" /> is the subject of consideration by his Department and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment;</P>
    <P>&ndash;notes the Minister's plans to bring forward a comprehensive modern code of immigration and residence law which will provide a solid framework for the development and implementation of fair and sensible immigration policies to meet the changing needs of Irish society, while at the same time respecting the rights of non-nationals in their dealings with the law;</P>
    <P>&ndash;commends and supports the Minister's ongoing regeneration of the prison system and the establishment of an independent prison's authority, which will contribute to a modernised penal system playing a pivotal role in protecting the community and reducing offending;</P>
    <P>&ndash;notes the progress made by him in finalising the construction of an unprecedented 1,000 new additional prison spaces as set out in the programme for Government to tackle overcrowding and other deficiencies in the prison system;</P>
    <P>&ndash;notes the Minister's efforts to reduce the incidence of suicide in Irish prisons while not compromising the human rights of all prisoners to a reasonable degree of privacy;</P>
    <P>&ndash;notes the Minister's success in establishing on a statutory basis an independent and integrated Courts Service;</P>
    <P>&ndash;notes the continuing unparalleled and unprecedented reduction of up to 20 per cent in all serious crime, including armed robberies and public order type offences since the Government came to office;</P>
    <P>&ndash;supports the Minister's commitment to maintaining the momentum of the fight against organised crime by providing the Garda Síochána with the legislative backing and the necessary resources required to deal with the issue; </P>

    <P>&ndash;acknowledges the Minister's commitment to reducing sexual offences by commissioning a significant piece of research into the reason there are such high attrition rates in bringing prosecutions in rape cases and by bringing forward legislation to provide for the establishment of a register of sex offenders and also for the separate legal representation of victims in rape cases;</P>
    <P>&ndash;recognises the Minister's determination to assist the Legal Aid Board in addressing the issue of waiting lists by substantially increasing the staff of the board in the period 1996 to 1999, and by increasing grant-in-aid by 84 per cent from £6.5 million to £11.953 million in the same period;</P>
    <P>&ndash;notes the comprehensive and unprecedented programme of legislation he continues to bring forward and his intention to bring forward new legislation to regulate the private security industry as soon as other priorities allow;</P>
    <P>&ndash;notes that the Minister has no function whatsoever in relation to the development of policy or the provision of resources to the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions or the office of the Chief State Solicitor, but is nevertheless concerned to ensure that appropriate procedures, properly resourced, are put in place to avoid a reoccurrence of the errors in the trial referred to, and</P>
    <P>&ndash;notes that since he took up office, the criminal justice system has never been better resourced and equipped to tackle the incidence of crime in society.</P>
    <P>I look forward to having a debate on the issues referred to in the motion. I welcome this opportunity to put on the record an account of my stewardship of matters for which I have responsibility since I was appointed Minister in June 1997 at the formation of this Government. It is only right and proper that this House gets an opportunity to ventilate its views on these matters and it is my earnest wish that it do so in a calm, reasonable and constructive fashion.</P>
    <P>I make this appeal not because I, no more than any other Member of this Government, expect anything less than a vigorous exchange of views with the Deputies opposite, but because we should avoid at all costs saying anything here that might give excuses to that small minority in the community to indulge in reprehensible and criminal behaviour towards non-nationals in our population be they refugees, asylum seekers, illegal immigrants or legal immigrants. Asylum seekers are people whose rights and dignity must be respected and we must not allow the issues arising <Col N="547" /> in this regard to descend to political game playing or opportunism.</P>
    <P>At the end of this debate, I am confident this House will renew its mandate to me to continue with my work in bringing forward and implementing the policy and measures set out in the Government's programme in the justice, equality and law reform areas.</P>
    <P>Much has been achieved in the two and a half or so years since I took up office and I know that even my sternest and partisan critics will acknowledge that considerable success has been achieved in many areas. I refer, for example, to the unprecedented turn around in the fight against crime where we are on course by the end of this year for a 25 per cent reduction in crime in real terms in the years since I came into office. Equally, over the same period, I have, at the behest of the Government, brought forward legislation covering my areas of responsibilities on a scale that was hitherto unknown. The strength of the Garda Síochána is at an all time high and will go higher in the coming period as we reach our target strength of 12,000. In fact, the Garda has never been better equipped or resourced as the force goes about its job of tackling crime.</P>
    <P>I will return to these matters and the other issues referred to for which I have ministerial responsibility at a later stage of my contribution. Turning first to the matter of immigration and asylum, it is important in the interest of a well informed debate, to outline the general guiding considerations which underpin the Government's policies and strategies on asylum and general immigration related matters. I will underline the following elements of policy in particular. Asylum and immigration law generally must he brought up to date with contemporary values and realities, and must be applied fairly, justly and humanely in the same way as all other laws are applied. We must have systems in place to ensure that all applications for asylum are dealt with in an efficient and effective manner, that the necessary resources are made available for this and those whose job it is to work within the immigration-asylum service are also treated fairly and justly. We must not allow legal distinctions between the various categories of immigrants to be blurred and more specifically, we must not allow the definition of &ldquo;refugee&rdquo;, which is defined and enshrined in the 1951 Geneva Convention to be devalued. Those who are found to be genuine refugees must be fully integrated and enjoy all the rights that go with that status, and immigrants generally, irrespective of their status or whether they happen to be here illegally, must also have their human rights fully respected and, in particular, we must ensure that our immigrants are not allowed to become the subject of criminal or racist attacks. We must not allow internationally organised criminal groups to perpetrate large scale fraud by means of illegal traffic and exploitation of human beings, and we must deal firmly <Col N="548" /> but fairly with those who are found to have entered the jurisdiction illegally.</P>
    <P>Before I discuss these general guiding considerations in more detail, there are two fundamental points that need to be made. The first is that there is what can only be described as a fog of confusion surrounding the various terms which are used in any discussions about immigration, asylum and related issues. At the heart of this confusion is the failure to distinguish between a refugee, an asylum seeker and an illegal immigrant. They are not interchangeable terms. I will dwell further on this significant point at a later stage of my contribution.</P>
    <P>The second matter which gives rise to confused debate is the idea that immigration laws should be such that economic disadvantage, of itself, would provide an automatic and unfettered right of passage across national boundaries. If it were thus, not only would our immigration code be something of a worldwide exception and absurd in its features, but if implemented would mean that, within a very short time, we would experience a level of uncontrolled inflow with which we simply could not cope. That would most certainly neither serve the interests of economically disadvantaged immigrants or the people of the State &ndash; it would amount to a form of irresponsibility which could not be justified on moral or on any other ground.</P>
    <P>In other words it is essential that there should be sensible balanced and defensible laws to control immigration and it is equally essential &ndash; if the law is not to be a nonsense &ndash; that the arrangements in place should be such that those who bypass the controls and enter illegally can, following the application of fair procedures, be obliged to leave. There is absolutely no point in having formal and lawful immigration laws and channels in place, which are broadly in line with those in other jurisdictions, if those who bypass the lawful channels are rewarded for doing so.</P>
    <P>Basic immigration law is laid down in the unfortunately entitled Aliens Act of 1935. Immigration law is not something which must remain settled and immutable for all time. Deputies will know I am in the process of fundamentally reviewing this very complex area of law, so as to produce an immigration code that is appropriate to the world in which we now live.</P>
    <P>In the area of asylum, which is a subset of general immigration law, there have already been significant and worthwhile amendments to the law, the leading example being the Refugee Act, 1996. While the latter Act has its flaws &ndash; mainly because the structures created were not adequate to deal with the very substantial increase in asylum applications which subsequently emerged &ndash; by and large, it is a fair and reasonable measure and that is why current practice in the area of asylum applications is substantially guided by it. As Deputies will recall, the House also amended this legislation last summer so as to further strengthen its provisions and to make it operable in the radically changed circumstances which <Col N="549" /> have evolved since it was enacted in 1996. I expect to be able to bring the amended Act into force early in the new year.</P>
    <P>One example of current practice which owes its origin to the Act is the system of appeals which exists in the case of refugee applicants who wish to challenge the decisions made on their applications. I mention this matter because in the course of my statement, I want to address matters which are the subject of ongoing confusion and misrepresentation, and this is one of them. All applications for refugee status are decided strictly in accordance with the guidelines laid down by the UNHCR. UNHCR personnel have access to all papers. There is, therefore, no question of arbitrary decision-making and anybody who suggests otherwise is quite simply wrong. The most important point and the one I want to stress is that appeals are decided independently of my Department by people who have been appointed specifically for that purpose. My reason for stressing this is that I have heard it repeated over and over again that there is no independent appeals mechanism. That suggestion is simply without foundation. When I became Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform I found the immigration and asylum service was totally under resourced, given the problems facing it. In reality, the situation facing me was one of utter chaos, as 22 staff were working on thousands of applications which had built up over previous years. They were doing their level best but in truth they could not cope, nor could they be expected to cope with the administrative burden placed on them.</P>
    <P>While the Government sponsored the Refugee Act in the Summer of 1996 &ndash; and I have acknowledged that this legislation had its merits &ndash; there was no follow-through from theoretical provision to actual delivery. No sooner was the ink on the new Act dry than the Government realised that its provisions for dealing with applications were hopelessly and woefully inadequate. Over the latter part of 1996 and into 1997, the level of applications continued to rise at an ever increasing rate. What was that Government's response? In a word, nothing. The Act lay on the shelf unimplemented and while the Government refused to acknowledge it publicly, it privately admitted that it was also unimplementable in the form in which it had been enacted. Meanwhile, the number of applications continued to grow and soon reached nearly 4,000. Interviews of applicants, as one would expect given the meagre staff resources dedicated to the task, were practically non-existent. In reality, applicants had no idea if, let alone when, they might get an interview. As for legal aid, research facilities, health care, independent appeals mechanisms and so forth, they were simply not put in place. I want to avoid turning this issue into a political football, but facts are facts, the truth is the truth and they need to be stated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>That Government simply refused to acknowledge that it had a major issue on its hands that required urgent attention. Literally on its way out the door on 25 June 1997, it eventually decided that it could safely take action and the Government agreed to impose immigration controls on visa nationals entering the State from the UK. This feeble response by that Government, coming as it did so late in the day, was the Rainbow Coalition's response to the unprecedented influx of asylum seekers to the country.</P>
      <P>In contrast, the Government of which I am a member immediately decided on taking office that this issue needed urgent attention. We immediately set about taking that action. We provided the staffing &ndash; more than 150, so that to date, nearly 6,500 interviews could be scheduled. We established the one stop shop concept in Mount Street with all the facilities and services required by asylum seekers located at one centrally located premises. We put independent appeals mechanisms in place. We provided legal aid, health care facilities and a documentation centre. In short, we provided a system of processing asylum applications with adequate resources which had at least a realistic prospect of meeting the demands we faced.</P>
      <P>I do not propose now to sit around bemoaning the fact that the inflow continues and pointing to the fact that, in terms of staff and resources, the situation has been totally transformed. I acknowledge that we need to do much more and that we need more staff and more resources. Not only do I acknowledge this, I am doing something about it.</P>

      <P>Also, any person who claims that the current rate of increase in applications was entirely predictable and that we should have planned for it displays a fundamental lack of understanding of the issues involved. The reality is that my Department has no way of knowing whether ten, 100 or 500 applicants will show up on any given day. That is completely outside our control but irrespective of the numbers involved, all have to be dealt with. This issue is being dealt with on a crossdepartmental basis, which is a matter of some confusion. The other Departments and agencies involved are and have been examining the adequacy of their existing resource commitments and will be putting in place the necessary measures to meet any shortfalls in areas for which they have prime responsibility. In particular, additional staff, accommodation and extended outreach clinics are being put in place by the Eastern Health Board to address the difficulties experienced by that agency and six clinics are already in operation. The health board aim is to more than double this number. Given that the principal cause of the difficulties in Mount Street in recent weeks was the volume of repeat callers seeking the services of the health board, these <Col N="551" /> new facilities will greatly ease those pressures on the system. I am determined to provide the necessary resources and I have the full support of the Government in this. None of us as responsible Ministers and Parliamentarians can take any satisfaction or pride in the fact that people have had to queue for long hours for services.</P>
      <P>I am sure Members will readily condemn the tendency to lay the blame for the difficulties experienced in meeting the needs of asylum seekers at the door of those who are on the front line endeavouring to provide a service under what are often extremely trying circumstances. The officials of my Department dealing and the staff of the Legal Aid Board dealing with applications remained at their desks and did their work. That situation has also been the subject of misleading commentary. The staff of the Eastern Health Board who are housed at the same one stop shop in Mount Street were quite simply overwhelmed and in fact became quite apprehensive because they simply could not meet the demands made on them by a large number of applicants, many of whom were tense and distressed. The officials concerned sought the necessary assistance and resources from their own agencies and, I am glad to say, quickly obtained that assistance.</P>
      <P>To give an indication of the volume of throughput in the Mount Street centre, the total number of persons dealt with in my Department's reception area in the Refugee Applications Centre during the seven week period from the week ending 1 October 1999 to 12 November 1999 was 4,579, which includes 1,676 new applicants and the balance, 2,903 having general queries. In addition, more than 426 persons attended the Centre for Appeal Hearings and Interviews.</P>
      <P>Many of the sinister suggestions about the motivation of officials have been directed at my Department. I emphasise that the issue of immigration and asylum is being dealt with on an interdepartmental basis, that interdepartmental structures have been in place for some time and that we have been building on and strengthening those structures with the central objective of providing a coherent Government response to these issues. The staff in the Mount Street office come from various Departments and Deputies will recall that many of those dealing directly with applicants were retired public servants, recruited on a contract basis specially for that purpose. Moreover, the Taoiseach has, as has been reported, called a special meeting of all Ministers who have a role in relation to asylum seekers. This meeting is scheduled to take place on Monday 29 November and will focus on identifying any measures needed to further improve co-ordination in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Interdepartmental Committee on Immigration, Asylum and Related Issues, has done excellent work in moving forward with its remit on a cross departmental basis. Moreover, the Government at its meeting of 9 November decided to further augment the work of this com<Col N="552" /> mittee and the system's capacity to deal with asylum seekers by establishing a central directorate headed up at assistant secretary level with staff drawn from the other relevant and appropriate agencies and Departments. That directorate is already in place and is headed by an assistant secretary of my Department with staff from the Eastern Health Board, Dublin Corporation and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs seconded to it. Its most immediate and urgent task is to ensure that the housing needs of asylum seekers are met and, in accordance with the decision of the Government, this will be achieved by dispersal of applicants on a nation-wide basis. There is no other option: quite simply, the supply of accommodation for asylum seekers in the Dublin area has been exhausted.</P>
    <P>On interdepartmental structures, the Secretaries General of a number of Departments, at my suggestion, have also been drawn into the task on hand to further underline the importance of dealing with this very complex issue on a cross departmental basis.</P>
    <P>The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has stated, in relation to the tendency to undermine the concept of &ldquo;refugee&rdquo;, that bogus applications for asylum clog up determination procedures, delay the identification of genuine applicants and in consequence should be discouraged to the greatest possible extent. I mention this, and have done so on many occasions before, because in a great many public discussions on the subject of refugees there is a persistent and discernible tendency to describe everybody who applies for refugee status as a &ldquo;refugee&rdquo;, despite the fact that a significant majority do not quality for refugee status and are actually economic migrants. To avoid any doubt, the fact that the law makes a legal distinction does not mean that we are at liberty, in dealing with one category of immigrant, i.e. a refugee, to apply the highest international standards but, in dealing with a different category of immigrant, i.e. an economic migrant, to apply an inferior standard. The point in maintaining the legal distinction is to produce clarity, to ensure that there is reasoned debate and, to ensure that there is justice.</P>
    <P>Its purpose is not to produce discrimination against any category of immigrant and let us be clear about that. I have consistently made the point and I repeat it now that my policy and that of the Government is that all classes of immigrants whether illegal or otherwise will be treated fairly, humanely and in accordance with principles which respects their human dignity. If Deputy Howlin understood the distinction between an illegal immigrant on one hand and a refugee on the other, he would recognise that his quotation from me is entirely consistent with what I have been saying in Government. I meant what I said then and would say the same this evening.</P>

      <P>It must be a basic concern of any Minister whose job it is to deal with the problem of public order to ensure that the evils of racism and the violence which have been associated with racism throughout the world are not allowed to take root. That there have been racist attacks here already is something which every Member and all right-thinking people must condemn without equivocation. We most certainly do not assist the process of integration or help to avoid the evils of racism by blurring the legal distinctions to which I have already referred. The general public is not impressed, and many are angered, when they hear comments, the general import of which is that a blurred application of the law is to be supported or at least tolerated when one is dealing with the problem of illegal immigration, but not when one is dealing with breaches of other laws. Suggestions to the effect that immigrants deserve preferential treatment when it comes to enforcement of the law, feeds into the hands of those whose basic tendencies are racist.</P>
      <P>On the question of immigrant rights, one suggestion has been made, with sincere and well meaning intent, that all those who have entered the jurisdiction, even if they have done so illegally, should have an automatic right to work pending the determination of their applications. The Government has responded to this suggestion in a measured and balanced way by applying the right to work to the people who entered the jurisdiction prior to 26 July 1999 but who still had not got to the stage of initial processing of their applications.</P>

      <P>Allowing a general right to work, however, in the case of persons who enter the jurisdiction illegally and without any basis which would warrant their being treated as refugees is a different matter and would, in practice, require that immigration controls be set aside. The rainbow Government acknowledged this when it included a provision in the Refugee Act, 1996, which specifically precluded asylum seekers from working while their applications were being processed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not the way to meet labour shortages. Apart from the fact that nobody has any idea, in the case of persons entering the jurisdiction illegally, whether they have the skills and capacities to meet these shortages, there is no doubt that if illegal immigrants secure an automatic right to work by claiming refugee status the incidence of bogus claims will increase. It is no answer to say that the right to work can be withdrawn if the <Col N="554" /> claim to be a refugee is subsequently found to be without substance. It is infinitely more difficult to deal with the consequences of illegal entry to the State at that stage. Unless we are prepared to deal with those consequences, in other words if we are not prepared to ask illegal immigrants to leave, we cannot expect that the requirements of immigration law will be respected in the first place.</P>
    <P>If, as appears to be the case, we need to supplement our pool of labour in this jurisdiction, I am strongly in favour of our doing so by means of properly controlled immigration quotas, in so far as this is permissible under EU law. I and the Department have made our position clear on this. For the avoidance of doubt in the matter, I am on record as saying that I see considerable merit in attempting to fill that immigration quota from poorer countries to the extent that this is permissible under European law. The important point is that we do this in a lawful and properly controlled way and not in a way that would, in practice, not only result in a chaotic policy framework but would definitely encourage trafficking and exploitation of human beings.</P>
    <P>Moreover, the Tánaiste and I have been working in close co-operation in finalising proposals to streamline the existing work permits system. Our objective is to ensure that both the work permits system and the immigration system are streamlined so that labour shortages in the economy can be addressed through legal immigration to the State.</P>
    <P>In this connection, it is important not to lose sight of the fact that many thousands of non-nationals arrive here lawfully every year to take up employment opportunities. Over the past few years, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment issued over 14,000 work permits to employers to facilitate the filling of vacancies by non-nationals from all parts of the world. My Department, as a matter of routine, issues visas to immigrants who wish to come here in these circumstances. Moreover, there are close to 20,000 non-EU nationals lawfully living, working, training or being educated here at any given time. Over 85 per cent of all visa applications made to my Department and the Department of Foreign Affairs are issued as a matter of course and without further ado.</P>
    <P>There is, in other words, no difficulty in principle about the idea that we should admit non-nationals to take up work opportunities or to study in this country, provided they do so through lawful channels. I make these points because some of the more ill informed comments by persons outside the House would leave one with the impression that it is more difficult to lawfully enter Ireland than it is to get through the eye of the proverbial needle.</P>
    <P>It is now recognised that the trafficking in human beings by internationally organised criminal entities is on a par, in terms of its profitability, with the international drugs trade. The unfortunate victims, often although not always from <Col N="555" /> Third World countries, are lured into parting with whatever resources they may have in return for an illegally organised passage to the jurisdiction of choice. The nature of criminal activity is that if this problem is not addressed, it will certainly continue.</P>
    <P>There are no easy answers. It is a fact of life, for example, that a sizeable number of illegal immigrants are trafficked across the border with Northern Ireland and from the UK generally. It is extremely difficult to deal with this because of the existence of the common travel area. Nevertheless, some preventative measures are clearly necessary if we are not to become the subject of largescale fraud at the hands of traffickers. This is where the trafficking Bill, now before the House, comes into the picture. I look forward to debating it on Second Stage shortly.</P>
    <P>I have taken some time to explain the context in which the Government's policies are being implemented and to deal with some of the fundamental elements of asylum policy. There is, of course, the view that we should set standards which are different from and superior to the international norm. In other words, we should &ldquo;go it alone&rdquo; in dealing with the complex issue of large migration flows.</P>
    <P>Attractive as this proposition might appear to be, it fails to take account of essential realities. One hard reality is that if we were to apply an immigration policy which is significantly more flexible and liberal in its features than those applying in the rest of the European Union, there is little doubt that over a relatively short period we would be left to deal with an immigration inflow with which we simply could not cope. It serves nobody's interests, apart perhaps from those of criminal organisations, to allow a situation to develop where there are no effective immigration controls in place which are broadly in line with those of our European partners. It is an extremely important and complex issue. It must be addressed in a well informed, comprehensive and humanitarian way. We must put resources into our asylum and immigration system and we must support those whose job it is to make the system work fairly and effectively.</P>
    <P>It is not a situation which is capable of simplistic solutions. There are times when difficult decisions are and will be called for. I am prepared to listen to and support sensible and realistic options and I will continue, with the full support of the Government, to do all I can to implement the law in a fair, reasonable and humanitarian way.</P>
    <P>Before I deal in detail with the ongoing prison building programme, it is only right that I put the matter into context. On taking office as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in July 1997, I inherited a prison system that was in dire need of major investment. Planned prison build<Col N="556" /> ing projects at Castlerea and the Women's Prison in Mountjoy had been cancelled in mid-term by the outgoing Government. On top of this, nothing had been done about refurbishment of Mountjoy Prison, by then in a deplorable state, as the main prison in the State.</P>

      <P>Along with the prisons building programme, I have taken important decisions to revitalise the prison system. I have already established the Prisons Authority on a transitional basis, pending the legislation to give it statutory effect, and the interim board and director general are already in place. I have also instigated important reviews of the Probation and Welfare Service and the psychology service and a wide-ranging independent review of the prison medical service has just commenced.</P>
      <P>It would not be right or fair to simply blame my predecessor, Deputy Owen, for the lamentable prisons situation I inherited. The former Minister was tied hand and foot by her colleagues and was prevented from moving forward in a substantial way with prison building and other reforms&mdash;</P>

      <P>The new Women's Prison at Mountjoy has been built to accommodate 80 prisoners. Again, when the building was handed over to the Office of Public Works by the contractor, John Paul Construction, there was a list of outstanding snag works to be attended to by the contractor and the prison had to be fitted with locks by the governor of works of the Prison Service. Some difficulties arose in relation to the fire safety system which has been designed to the highest possible specification. I have been informed that these difficulties have now been resolved. It is expected that all outstanding snag works will be finalised by Wednesday of this week.</P>

Perhaps it is time the Opposition parties treated the people to something a little more constructive than mere negativity.

      <P>The most telling of the many <Col N="560" /> indictments against the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, is the prisons without prisoners. We all know of the Irish folklore ballad, &ldquo;The pub with no beer&rdquo;, but new prisons with no prisoners is surely lamentable. The fact that prison officers are paid full wages for securing the prisons with no prisoners is surely ludicrous, but a suggestion that prison officers are being paid overtime to secure the prisons with no prisoners is surely a joke. In most countries a Minister presiding over such a prison regime would resign before being pushed, but there has been no such action on the part of the Minister for zero tolerance, Deputy O'Donoghue.</P>
      <P>I am in favour of decentralisation, but the August holiday stroke on the part of the Minister in removing the headquarters of the Legal Aid Board to Cahirciveen is another joke when set against the background of lengthening queues for civil legal aid. This move will add substantially to costs and can in no way contribute to increase the efficiency of that body or the citizens it serves.</P>
      <P>Far beyond a joke, however, is the Minister's feeble response to the victims of sexual abuse. I wish to address specifically the Statute of Limitations (Amendment) Bill currently before this House. Under the Minister's proposals, assuming the Bill is enacted by 31 January next year, any statement of complaint made by a sexually abused person to the Garda or to anyone before 31 January 1997 will render that complainant or victim ineligible to take a case for civil damages. Many of the victims of the State's most notorious abusers will be deprived of a remedy under the Minister's plan. In effect, it means that those who suffered at the hands of a deliberate criminal act, where persons were found guilty by the courts, will have absolutely no civil remedy under our law. This runs contrary to statements made by the Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, and the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Martin, to victims of abuse.</P>
      <P>It seems the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, is deliberately ignoring the pleas of his Government colleagues, both of whom appear to wish to allow victims of sexual abuse a civil remedy. The Government's apology to victims of sexual abuse appears to ring very hollow when set in the context of the facts. Of the roughly 1,400 abused while in our education system over the years, 30 per cent will be automatically statutorily barred under the Minister's new Bill and the remaining 70 per cent will be faced with a pre-trial trial on the matter of the statute and on the question of knowledge and capability, which will result in the majority of such cases not being proceeded with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In cases where the State is known to have covered up in the 1950s and again in the 1970s, the victims and those who suffered in an appalling manner will be left without a remedy in spite of the comments of the Taoiseach. It is difficult to have confidence in a Minister for Justice, Equality <Col N="561" /> and Law Reform who on the one hand sympathises with victims of sexual abuse and on the other ensures, by his proposals, that few of those victims will have an opportunity of redress. Under the Minister's proposal, offenders can make statements and be charged, convicted and jailed in the knowledge that they cannot be touched by the victims or that they will not be forced even to apologise, much less be answerable in the form of compensation. Victims who were gravely wronged and who continue to suffer lifelong behavioural and emotional trauma directly attributable to physical and sexual abuse will be denied a remedy in the courts by the Minister.</P>
    <P>This is the same Minister who presides over a prison system where sex offenders receive minimalist, if any, counselling or rehabilitation. It is totally unacceptable that there is no obligation on those convicted of violent sexual offences in our prison system to undergo any programme of treatment while in prison. The reality is that some prisoners are being released into the community without having availed of any treatment whatever. This is a sad indictment of the stewardship of the Minister who has clearly lost the confidence of the Progressive Democrats arm of Government and in whom this House cannot have confidence.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to support the Labour motion of no confidence in the Minister and the Government in terms of their abject failure to bring in legislation or measures that would streamline the processing of applications from asylum seekers and refugees who have come here. For how long more must we witness the scenes of long queues outside the applications office and the resulting chaos? In no circumstances can it be perceived that the Government has not had time to regulate the position and introduce the necessary regulations. There is an obvious lack of commitment and ability on its part to resolve the problem.</P>
      <P>When I read the phrases &ldquo;supports the commitment of this Government . and enhance the effectiveness of the justice system;&rdquo; and &ldquo;acknowledging the urgent need to promote tolerance and respect for the diversity in our society&rdquo; in the Government's amendment, I realise how out of touch the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, is with reality and the shambles the Government has made of the refugee issue and many other justice issues. Can we believe the Minister when he said tonight that &ldquo;asylum seekers are people whose rights and dignity we must respect&rdquo;? I have doubts about his commitment to that statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Can we find out from him whether the Government intends to introduce legislation to resolve the shambles of the Government policy on this matter? We have a spectacle on the one hand of the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, con<Col N="562" /> firming on 15 November that the Progressive Democrats would be launching its policy document on refugees within a fortnight and at the same time the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, and the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, have said legislation on the State's first work visa for people from non-EU states will be drawn up within a fortnight. From this, we recognise the continuation of the chaos presided over by the Government. Last week's Cabinet summit to streamline the policy on asylum seekers excludes any input from the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell. Where is the Government going on this issue other than into deeper disarray?</P>
    <P>For centuries we, as a nation, prided ourselves on the contributions our emigrants made to many other economies. When Irish dignitaries visited the UK, the USA and Australia they were told of the magnificent part played by Irish emigrants and refugees in the development of their economies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, and the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this important matter.</P>
      <P>This House, the public and the reputation of Ireland stand seriously indicted as a result of what happened with our telecommunications services last Friday. I cannot emphasise enough how unprecedented the systems failure was and how inadequate Eircom handled this matter. Not only did we not receive a proper apology, but we did not receive a proper explanation on why the backup systems did not operate when the computer software failed or why there is no emergency procedure to allow a group of licensed telecommunications operators to work together.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Public Enterprise, who is quick to be available for photo opportunities with shining new buses and for announcements about call centres, could not be found when this debacle occurred. It was left to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to issue a stern rebuke to Eircom. This issue relates to public policy. Just because we do not own shares in Eircom does not mean we can wash our hands of political responsibility and accountability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What infrastructural investment is required to ensure this cock-up does not happen again? The central spine of industrial policy is not to get engineering or food manufacturing jobs but to get information technology. The Minister has paraded around the world discussing e-commerce. E-commerce, faxes, telephones, e-mails and the Internet cannot function if we have systems failure. If there is any question about the reliability <Col N="563" /> of our telecommunications infrastructure, Ireland's reputation for the location of call centres will be put in jeopardy. IDA Ireland was the first to express its deep alarm at the consequences of this failure from an international perspective.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to include a provision in the new legislation relating to the Office of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation to deal with customer complaints and compensation. Eircom has not spoken about its obligations to people whose reservation systems collapsed at peak hours of business on Friday afternoon, the busiest day of the week. Their losses are verifiable and they must be compensated.</P>
    <P>A procedure must be put in place so that Esat, Ocean, Eircell and all licensed operators can work together to provide adequate backup so that this problem does not arise again. A public information system should be established so that people know there is a systems failure and a proper system of compensation must be put in place. Lessons about computerised technology and fibre optic cable must be learned from this debacle. We cannot afford this type of systems failure if we want our Celtic tiger economy to move forward.</P>
    <P>This was a black Friday for Eircom. It has still not accounted properly for what happened, apologised adequately to the public or made any attempt to compensate those who recorded losses. I look forward to the Minister's reply because we must ensure this debacle, shambles and disgrace does not happen again.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil leat féin agus leis an Ceann Comhairle as ucht seans a thabhairt dom labhairt faoin ábhar tábhachtach seo.</P>
      <P>The collapse of a major part of the Eircom telephone system in Dublin last Friday at the same time as the Eircom mobile network was one of the most serious technical failures this country has experienced for many years. Large parts of the city were effectively cut off from the outside world. Over 80,000 land lines, serving key business areas of the city, went down, leaving homes and offices not just without voice telephony but also without fax and e-mail communications. Most worrying of all was that 999 emergency calls were also unavailable for large parts of the afternoon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a land line is out of order, people will normally revert to a mobile telephone until it is repaired. However, the fact that people had no land line or mobile facilities was a worrying experience and a serious cause of concern for commercial enterprises which were unable to conduct their business in the crucial period before the weekend. The consequences for business were particularly severe. No one can accurately <Col N="564" /> put a figure on the losses, but they could run into millions of pounds.</P>
    <P>Many multinationals operating in Ireland use Friday afternoon to send sales figures and transaction details to their parent companies. Much of the business of banks and the International Financial Services Centre is conducted by telephone and e-mail. Customers abroad who tried to contact telesales offices based in Ireland could not get through. IDA Ireland, an organisation not given to exaggeration or rhetoric, stated that under no circumstances should there be a major collapse.</P>
    <P>This is a serious matter in terms of reliability for companies and it happened without warning. Eircom has a lot of questions to answer. This matter should also be raised with the Government. We do not know what damage has been done to Ireland's standing abroad. Companies which may have been considering coming to Ireland were put off by the inexplicable collapse of our telecommunications system in the capital city.</P>
    <P>People also faced inconvenience and worry. Parents were unable to contact their children and people were unable to telephone doctors or order taxis. The collapse has made people worry about the possible consequences of the Y2K bug on our telecommunications systems. People are concerned that we might face a total communications blackout on 1 January. Assurances that this cannot happen will not assuage many people's worry. The same people who tell us it cannot happen also told us the collapse on Friday could not happen.</P>
    <P>One of the most worrying aspects of Friday's event was that the 999 emergency calls were not available. We were lucky there were no major crimes or accidents during the collapse. What would have happened if there had been a major emergency and people could not contact the gardaí, the fire brigade and the ambulance service?</P>
    <P>Eircom has not been sufficiently forthcoming in its account of why this collapse happened. It appears the problem arose when Eircom was carrying out maintenance in the Priory Park exchange. A software problem developed which caused the facility to collapse. Calls were rerouted to another exchange at Fitzwilliam Square but it also collapsed because of the pressure. This, in turn, put pressure on the facility at Crown Alley. It had a domino effect. We were probably lucky it did not extend further. It is unacceptable that we should have to face a telecommunications collapse like this. It is ironic that we should have experienced such a blackout when we were assured that privatisation would lead to even greater efficiency and better service for the consumer.</P>
    <P>A number of questions arise which Eircom should answer. Why was the maintenance work being done at a time of such high usage? Why <Col N="565" /> was it done in the middle of Friday afternoon and not during the night when demand would be less and the consequences of a shut-down less severe? Why were no adequate backup systems in place? What steps are being taken by Eircom to undo the potential damage to our image abroad? What steps are being taken to ensure that emergency 999 calls are always available? What steps are being taken to ensure that such a communications disaster does not happen again? I hope that if she has not already done so, the Minister will call in the chief executive of Eircom and demand answers to these questions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Yates and Deputy O'Shea for raising this matter. It is a matter of grave concern to the Government and to me that a significant part of the Dublin telecommunications network, particularly the 999/112 emergency service suffered a major interruption last Friday. I count the disruption to the emergency services as the most serious part of what happened. In any society, recourse to emergency numbers is absolutely standard and that emergency numbers were not available for a period in such a huge area is extremely worrying. I take Deputy O'Shea's point regarding the possible consequences, had a major accident occurred during the disruption.</P>
      <P>The provision of telecommunications services has a major impact on economic development. We have been in touch with Eircom and we have received a preliminary outline from the company as to what happened. The breakdown of the fixed telecommunications network occurred because of a software fault in two major Dublin telephone exchanges, Priory Park and Merrion. The non-availability of these two exchanges had, apparently, a knock-on effect on a number of other city centre exchanges, most notably that in Crown Alley. The disruption to fixed line operations lasted from 2.15 p.m. until 5 p.m. &ndash; just a little short of three hours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a separate incident in which the Eircel mobile telephone exchange in Dame Street became flooded. I understand there was disruption to the Eircel mobile services of varying degrees from 4 p.m. until 11.15 p.m. &ndash; more than seven hours. There was also a temporary interruption to services yesterday afternoon at the Blanchardstown exchange for about 40 minutes. I understand and believe that Eircom is treating these issues very seriously and is currently engaged in a full review of its network resilience and backup, with the help of its suppliers. The objective of the review is to ensure that the company can take whatever actions are necessary to ensure that such widespread disruption does not happen again. I have written to the chairman of Eircom seeking details of the steps which the company is taking to prevent a recurrence and he has agreed to come in and see me, I think, tomor<Col N="566" /> row. I will consider what further steps are necessary when I have spoken to the chairman.</P>
    <P>I have written to the Director of Telecommunications Regulation seeking her views on whether there are measures which she considers necessary to avoid a similar occurrence. The director has responded indicating that she shares my and the Government's view as to the seriousness of the events of last Friday and in her own capacity she has sought a report from Eircom which she hopes to get in the coming days.</P>
    <P>I have been told that last Friday's difficulties have nothing to do with the Y2K issue. I have been told by the company that all critical systems have been fully assessed and tested and where necessary replaced by Y2K compliant equipment. In addition, the 999/112 emergency service has been the subject of extensive Y2K testing and extensive contingency planning. When I have got the report from the chairman I will consider what issues arise and how they can be best addressed.</P>
    <P>Deputy Yates raised the issue of compensation for losses. It would not be appropriate for me to comment on this as it is a matter between Eircom and the company's subscribers. I regard the way Eircom has responded as totally inadequate. I would have expected the company to place full-page advertisements in newspapers on Sunday and Monday, given an explanation of what had happened and expressed deep regret. To allow such an incident to occur and not to give a full explanation to shareholders and the wider public is totally inadequate. When I meet the chairman and get his report and when the DTR receives her report we will stipulate that there must not be a recurrence of what happened last Friday. Apart from the very important economic implications, the fact that ordinary people could not ring 999 for a considerable period constitutes a serious crisis. I hope to hear a very full and public explanation from Eircom and an assurance that such an situation will not recur.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Although I am glad to see the Minister of State, Deputy Dan Wallace, who is a colleague, in the House, I am disappointed that neither the Minister of State with responsibility for housing, Deputy Molloy, nor the Minister for Defence are here to hear what I have to say. However, I have no doubt that Deputy Wallace will pass on my comments to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While most commentators accept that the handling of the housing crisis by the Government during the past two and a half years is nothing short of scandalous, by far the most depressing feature of the crisis can be seen in the number of people sleeping rough in our capital city. As winter is now upon us we must, yet again, call upon the Government and the statutory agencies to accept their responsibility in relation to the prob<Col N="567" /> lem of homelesness. The Minister of State, Deputy Mollow, admitted on 15 October that more than 250 people are now sleeping rough on the streets of Dublin every night. Yet in the same speech the Minister of State said, &ldquo;We cannot ignore the plight of these people, especially at this time when our economy is growing so strongly&rdquo;. It is time Deputy Molloy and his colleagues took political reponsibility for this problem. Shifting responsibility from Dublin Corporation to the Eastern Health Board and on to the Government's cross departmental team will not provide one additional accommodation unit for a person who is homeless.</P>
    <P>This is the third time I have raised this matter on the Adjournment and I have tabled countless Opposition motions to place on the record of the House the persistent and increasing plight of the homeless in our capital city. I accept that the issue is complex but I will not accept that the Government cannot find, at the very least, suitable temporary accommodation particularly over the winter period, for people without a home.</P>
    <P>The scale of the homeless problem has multiplied in the recent past. According the national assessment of homeless people carried out by local authorities last March, the number of homeless people in the State has increased from 2,501 in 1996 to 5,234 in 1999. It is not an exaggeration to suggest that the Dublin figures are breathtaking, showing an increase over the same period from 1,447 to 3,640. This is at a time of unprecedented wealth, when the reputation of our capital city as the most lively city in Europe is gaining currency internationally.</P>
    <P>What I find most unacceptable about the number of homeless people is the fatalistic excuse from the Government that its agencies regularly provide, that it is almost inevitable. Homelessness is not inevitable. Solutions can be found for the immediate future and the longer term. It is a matter of organising our resources so that additional units of accommodation can be found. In essence, it requires the State, through the Department of the Environment and Local Government, to interact with all Departments and statutory agencies until a solution is found.</P>
    <P>There are many vacant buildings throughout this city which could be transformed into temporary accommodation for homeless people over the winter and beyond. The current provision of emergency accommodation is unable to meet the massive demand. Many publicly owned buildings, such as Army barracks, could provide a crucial temporary home for these people.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, said on 15 October last that the Government's cross departmental team on homelessness was expected to report in a matter of weeks. Six weeks later, we have still to see any concrete strategy being put in place. It is another example <Col N="568" /> of the shameful neglect by this Government of the plight of homeless people. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government must immediately conclude his discussions with all Departments in relation to the availability of surplus property and lands in the possession of the State.</P>
    <P>On Sunday, Focus Ireland produced a report showing that the homelessness problem could be resolved nationwide in five years for the small sum of £39 million. I call on the Minister to give a commitment tonight that, without further delay, the cross departmental team that has been working on this issue will publish its report and that he will provide adequate temporary facilities over Christmas and the winter for the homeless people of this city.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Dublin local authorities are responsible for the provision of accommodation for homeless people in their areas. Dublin Corporation provides funding to voluntary bodies towards the running costs of the accommodation they provide and towards the cost of settlement and hostel based care and support services. The Eastern Health Board arranges emergency accommodation, on behalf of the Dublin local authorities, for homeless people in the Dublin area. The cost is met by the Dublin local authorities and the Department of the Environment and Local Government recoups 90 per cent of their expenditure.</P>
      <P>Dublin Corporation has acquired or leased a number of premises which it operates for homeless people. The corporation is continually seeking further premises for homeless persons, with a view to operating them either directly or by using one of the voluntary bodies. The corporation, as a winter time measure, is funding a night-time drop-in service for rough sleepers operated by CROSSCARE and it is also seeking another premises to provide a similar service elsewhere in the city.</P>
      <P>It is a matter of concern that the recent assessment of homelessness last March found there were 275 homeless persons sleeping rough in Dublin. Many of these people have health problems, such as ongoing alcohol or drug addictions, and some have behavioural problems. An effective response to the needs of these people involves much more than just the provision of accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for a comprehensive response to homelessness was acknowledged in the establishment of the cross Department team on homelessness, whose remit includes health, education and employment, as well as accommodation. The team has received written submissions from statutory authorities and voluntary bodies providing accommodation and services for homeless <Col N="569" /> people. It is expected that the team will present its report in the near future with firm recommendations on how homelessness is to be tackled.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Corporation approach, of acquiring suitable premises and operating these itself to provide suitable accommodation and services for homeless people or making arrangements with voluntary bodies to do so, is the most effective approach in the long-term. The provision of more sheltered housing accommodation for people who are long-term homeless will take homeless persons out of what is essentially emergency hostel accommodation and leave much needed places for those who become homeless and need access to emergency accommodation.</P>
    <P>In addition, the local authority and social housing programmes will be maintained at a high level to meet housing demand, and this includes homeless people seeking local authority and social housing. The question of using former Army barracks to accommodate refugees from Kosovo was fully examined earlier this year when one barracks was used as a site to provide mobile home accommodation. The potential for the use of barracks or similar accommodation will be kept under review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I tried to table a parliamentary question to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. The question was:</P>
      <P>To ask the Minister for the Environment and Local Government the reason a person in Dublin 12 is paying her mortgage administered by his Department at 12.5 per cent; and the measures, if any, he is proposing in view of the commitment in An Action Programme for the Millennium issued in November 1999 to target support to home owners with high fixed interest rate local authority loans; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
      <P>That question was ruled out of order because the Minister, apparently, has no responsibility to the Dáil in relation to the targeted support to home owners with high fixed interest rate local authority loans. The other part of the question was allowed.</P>
      <P>It is becoming extremely difficult to get basic information here that we could get under the Freedom of Information Act. My question is very simple. Why is my elderly, widowed constituent, who lives alone, paying three times the current mortgage rate? She is paying 12.5 per cent on a mortgage she took out in 1984 with the local authority, which is now a Housing Finance Agency loan. Why is this widow paying 12.5 per cent when interest rates are 4 per cent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The banks were charging a little more than that until competition entered the market. I know the Government will say this was a long-term loan <Col N="570" /> taken out many years ago when the current low interest rates could not have been forecast. However, that is not exactly true. The Maastricht Treaty criteria for the single currency set out to bring about long-term low interest rates, which are being achieved at present. The Government has rescheduled its own debt to take advantage of that, thereby decreasing the debt to GNP ratio.</P>
    <P>Why is it that when there are low interest rates, which could have been forecast, and the national debt can be rescheduled, my widowed constituent is still paying 12.5 per cent, which is three times the current average mortgage interest rate? How much longer will the State persecute this widow in Dublin 12, who lives alone and is struggling to get by on her widow's pension, and people like her, by requiring them to pay the exorbitant rate of 12.5 per cent when the State has rescheduled its own debts and has brought its own finances under control? This woman should not be asked to carry this burden one day longer. If we are able to reschedule our debts internationally to the benefit of the State, surely, when interest rates have been cut by two thirds, my widowed constituent, and people like her, should be able to benefit by having their interest rates rescheduled at the same time.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will not say this is under review. I want a decision, to be given the date when it will happen and a commitment. That is the least that can be done in this case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter. The total amount outstanding in fixed interest rate loans ranging from 12.5 per cent to 6.5 per cent is approximately £258 million, approximately £180 million of which was financed by the local loans fund. The remaining £78 million was sourced from the Housing Finance Agency.</P>
      <P>The position regarding fixed interest rate local authority house purchase loans is that the interest rate is related to the cost of long-term funds prevailing at the time when the Exchequer or Housing Finance Agency advanced funds to a local authority. It has not been possible to reduce the interest rate on these loans as the cost involved would be substantial and would have to be borne by the Exchequer, the Housing Finance Agency and local authorities.</P>
      <P>Borrowers have been advised by the local authorities that any person with fixed rate local authority repayments is free to redeem without penalty and refinance, if necessary, in the private sector at current interest rates. The removal of penalties for early redemption in the case of local authority fixed rate loans is a unique and valuable concession to local authority borrowers. Persons with fixed rate loans from banks or building societies are, on the other hand, required to pay penalties of up to six months interest or more if they want to redeem their loans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware, however, that some local authority <Col N="571" /> borrowers are paying interest rates at twice the level of current fixed market rates, that is, 12.5 per cent compared with 6.5 per cent. I am also aware that while many local authority borrowers have availed of the concession to redeem without penalty, the remaining borrowers still paying the high interest rates are generally the less well off who cannot afford the refinancing costs in the private sector. In view of this the Government's recently published review of An Action Programme for the Millennium contains a commitment to &ldquo;target support to home owners with <Col N="572" /> high fixed interest rate local authority loans&rdquo;. The Minister will shortly put in place measures to implement this commitment.</P>

      <Quest>the number of psychiatrists available to prisoners at Mountjoy Prison; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[24191/99]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <P>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue): Psychiatric services are provided to prisons and places of detention by visiting psychiatrists employed by the health boards. The psychiatric service of the Eastern Health Board at the Central Mental Hospital, Dundrum provide regular weekly counselling and treatment sessions at the Dublin prisons.</P>
    <P>I am advised by the director general for the Prison Service that the service provided to Mountjoy Prison consists of eight sessions per week. This includes a daily clinic in the main prison and one weekly clinic each in the separation unit, the health care unit and the women's prison. For the last four months, there has been no waiting list of any significance for clinics.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding this, I accept that this level of provision is not satisfactory given current demands in the prison and I am advised that senior prisons officials have been working with the Eastern Health Board to address the situation.</P>
    <P>I am informed that, arising from these discussions, the health board is in the process of appointing a consultant forensic psychiatrist who will be allocated four sessions per week to prisons work in its region based at Mountjoy Prison initially. It is proposed that the consultant will have the support of three registrars assigned to the prisons, one to be associated with Mountjoy, and a social worker and clerical assistance.</P>
    <P>This consultant will also have sessional commitments to the Central Mental Hospital and to risk assessment evaluations in the general psychiatric services. In my view and the view of the Eastern Health Board, this post holder will be in a position to liaise between the health board and the Prison Service in assessing and determining what changes are needed in the level, pattern and operation of mental health services in prison and to identify ways of promoting such change.</P>
    <P>It has been agreed with the Eastern Health Board that a service agreement outlining the services to be provided &ndash; accountability, structures, funding requirements and so on &ndash; should be concluded. This is due to be discussed further with the health board next month. I have recently established a multidisciplinary group to review the structures and organisation of prison health care services. The review body will be under the chairmanship of Mr. John Olden, second vice-president of the Council of Europe Committee for the Prevention of Torture, Inhuman and <Col N="574" /> Degrading Treatment of Persons in Custody and former secretary of Roinn na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>The membership of the review group will consist of representatives of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform; Department of Health and Children; Department of Finance; director of prison medical services; a senior prison governor; a nominee of the Irish College of General Practitioners, representing GP interests; a nominee of the Irish division, the Royal College of Psychiatrists, representing the interests of psychiatry; a nominee of An Bord Altranais, representing professional nursing interests; a nominee of the Pharmaceutical Society, representing professional pharmacy interests; and a nominee of the Irish Dental Council, representing professional dental interests. Among other issues the group is being asked to consider and make recommendations regarding the provision of psychiatric services to prisoners, taking into account changes in service provision generally and the potential ramifications of possible new mental health legislation.</P>
    <P>I have asked the group to invite submissions from the general public as well as from special interest groups in relation to its review. This review will obviously take some time to complete. In the meantime, I have asked the director general of the Prison Service to deal expeditiously as possible with immediate current problems in the prison medical services area.</P>

      <P>A review of the Gaming and Lotteries Act, 1956, is being carried out by an interdepartmental review group. This review, which commenced last June, is expected be completed by the end of the year. Its terms of reference are as follows: to review the regulatory environment within which gaming and lottery activities are carried out with particular reference to the 1956 Gaming and Lotteries Act, any other relevant or proposed Irish legislation and international developments in the gaming and lotteries area; to identify the issues arising from such a review and to make recommendations designed to address these issues in the context of securing a modern regulatory environment while fulfilling necessary social policy objectives; and to furnish a report on the above for consideration by the Minister and by Government by the end of 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under section 9 of the 1956 Act, gaming is expressly prohibited in licensed premises. I am, <Col N="575" /> however, aware of reports that gaming machines are operating openly in some licensed premises and that tokens or credit systems are sometimes used in lieu of cash in the operation of these machines, thereby frustrating prosecutions under the Act. I have, in fact, recently referred one such report to the Garda who have undertaken to carry out a thorough investigation.</P>
    <P>It is in the light of such enforcement difficulties as well as the broader issues now emerging in this area that I have decided on a comprehensive review of this Act.</P>

      <P>The fact that firearms are held illegally precludes statistics being available on the number of such firearms.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that there are operational preventative measures in place that successfully limit the number of illegal firearms held. I do not propose to outline the nature of such measures as to do so would lessen their effectiveness. The Deputy may wish to note that substantial quantities of illegally held firearms and ammunition are seized by the Garda each year. Details of such seizures are contained in the Garda Síochána annual report, copies of which may be obtained in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the terms of the Firearms Acts, 1925 to 1998, the power to grant a firearm certificate to a resident of the State is vested in the local superintendent of the Garda district where the person resides and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform for non-residents. It is policy to only grant firearm certificates for crossbows, shotguns, certain categories of rifles and tranquillising guns for use in zoos and deer farms.</P>
      <P>A firearm certificate shall not be issued by a Garda superintendent unless he is satisfied that the applicant for the certificate has a good reason for having the firearm concerned; can be permitted to have in his/her possession, use and carry a firearm and ammunition without danger to public safety or to the peace and is not a person disentitled to hold a firearm certificate, for example, under the age of 16 years, of intemperate habits, of unsound mind or has been imprisoned for certain offences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In accordance with the provisions of the Firearms Act, 1998 the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform may grant a firearm certificate to a non-resident not less than 16 years of age provided he is of the opinion that the application <Col N="576" /> is bona fide and that there is no good reason to refuse to grant the certificate.</P>
    <P>Firearm certificates may be revoked by the issuing authority if it is considered that the holder can no longer hold such firearm without danger to the public safety or the peace.</P>

      <P>Such a review would, of course, take into account any lessons to be learned in the light of an incident of the kind referred to in the Deputy's question. The House will appreciate that it would be both inappropriate and counterproductive to disclose details of the Garda presence at the airport or any changes in security which have been made or are intended. While clearly the Garda has a role to play, the security arrangements at the bank in question are a matter in relation to which both the bank and the airport authorities would have responsibilities.</P>

      <P>Due to exceptional circumstances which arose this year in relation to the Vantastic service, which was established by the Centre for Independent Living, my Department made a once off payment to this organisation in August to ensure the continued operation of this service for people with disabilities for the remainder of this year. I am not aware of any request for funding having been made to my Department from Transport for All.</P>

      <Col N="577" /> The Taoiseach, in a determination made on 26 October under section 6(2) of the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1939 transferred responsibility for the provision of specific transport to people with a disability to my Department. In this regard Vantastic has made an application to my Department for funding and the matter is under consideration in my Department at present.</P>
    <P>The development of general transport policy to meet the needs of people with disabilities is the responsibility of the Minister for Public Enterprise and the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. They will be informed by the recommendations of the report of the commission on the status of people with disabilities &ldquo;A Strategy for Equality&rdquo;.

      <P>Section 2 of the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence) Act 1990 provides that certain bodily samples may be taken without the consent of a person in custody, for the purpose of forensic testing. These samples include hair other than pubic hair, a nail and any material found under a nail.</P>
      <P>The report of the expert group on criminal law, appointed to consider changes in the criminal law which were recommended in the report of the steering group on the efficiency and effectiveness of the Garda Síochána, recommended a number of changes to the law relating to forensic samples. In particular, it recommended that, as an aid to DNA testing, saliva be reclassified as a sample which can be taken without consent. These recommendations are being examined by my Department with a view to bringing forward proposals for inclusion in a criminal justice Bill. Work is at an advanced stage on the preparation of a general scheme, and I hope to be in a position to seek Government approval shortly to commence the drafting of the Bill.</P>
      <P>While the proposed criminal justice Bill is intended to deal primarily with the recommendations of the expert group, any necessary further measures to improve the law in this area, with particular regard to DNA testing, will be considered in consultation with the Forensic Science Laboratory and the Attorney General's Office with a view to their inclusion in the Bill.</P>

      <P>The financial support which my Department provides to victim support has gone from £180,000 in 1996 to £651,000 in the current year. These figures reflect the rapid growth and development of the organisation in recent years and are indicative of the fact that victim support is now providing a comprehensive range of support, counselling, practical and other services to crime victims throughout the country.</P>
      <P>The allocation to victim support for next year as published in last week's abridged Estimates is £655,000 and this continues to reflect the high priority which I attach to its activities. I accept the importance of the completion of their national network of operations and the financial implications involved have been the subject of ongoing discussions with my Department. The Deputy will be aware that there is enormous pressure for resources in all areas of my Department but I will keep the allocation under review to see if any further funding contributions can be made in this particular area.</P>

      <P>The provided sample is then forwarded to the Medical Bureau of Road Safety where an analysis is carried out.

      <P>The Garda National Drugs Unit as one of its chief functions, is tasked with responsibility for the conduct of intelligence driven operations against major drug traffickers who impact on the Irish drug scene.</P>
      <P>In this regard, I am informed by the Garda authorities that the unit has established close working links with other European law enforcement agencies.</P>
      <P>In 1996, the EU Council adopted the Oisin Programme, an Irish led initiative, to develop and enhance co-operation between police, customs and other law enforcement authorities of EU member states. This programme has, <i>inter alia</i>, the specific objectives of establishing networks of law enforcement authorities to further practical co-operation which would include such areas as joint targeting and exchange of intelligence; and organising joint operational projects of limited duration in areas where such projects enhance co-operation between law enforcement authorities of more than one member state.</P>
      <P>The GNDU is currently engaged in its third project under the Oisin programme. The Garda Síochána maintains drug liaison officers in both The Hague and Madrid who work very closely with the GNDU.</P>
      <P>Among the duties assigned to those officers is responsibility for liaising with host country agencies concerned with drug law enforcement and other foreign liaison officers; developing and expanding intelligence relative to drug trafficking between Ireland and host countries; and establishing mutually beneficial strategies for detecting and prosecuting drug traffickers; the rapid exchange of intelligence; and ensuring that investigations are carried out diligently and effectively.</P>
      <P>In addition, a member of the Garda Síochána of inspector rank is attached to the Europol Office in The Hague. The inspector's function is to act as a conduit for rapid exchange of intelligence between Ireland and the other EU member states.</P>
      <P>The GNDU also regularly avails of the services of Interpol, where these services are appropriate to any particular investigation.</P>
      <P>Ireland is a signatory to the UN Convention of 1988 which governs mutual assistance in criminal matters between the signatory states. The 1994 Criminal Justice Act provides the legal basis for mutual assistance in criminal matters. Mechanisms for processing requests for mutual assistance, as between the various states, are in place. The Garda have informed me that the GNDU makes frequent use of these mechanisms in the course of its drug trafficking investigations.</P>

    <P>I am also informed by the Garda authorities that the Criminal Assets Bureau maintains regular contact with European counterparts and intelligence into the movement of assets are ongoing between the gardaí and other international investigation agencies. Exchanges of information on a police to police basis are of great benefit in conducting inquiries and are carried on with all relevant organisations.</P>
    <P>The Criminal Assets Bureau last week hosted an international conference under the Falcone Programme on the &ldquo;identifying, tracing and seizing&rdquo; the proceeds of criminal activity. The conference focused on a comparison of existing structural and legal frameworks in the member states of the European Union. The conference had participants from all EU member states, from four applicant states, from the European Commission and the Council of Europe.</P>

      <P>The interdepartmental committee on child care was established in February 1999 and was chaired by Bernard McDonagh, Second Secretary at my Department. The membership comprised representatives at senior official level of 11 relevant Government Departments, that is the Departments of the Taoiseach, Finance, Social, Community and Family Affairs, Health and Children, Education and Science, Environment and Local Government, Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and my own Department.</P>

      <P>There are some 37 Garda stations in County Kerry, comprising one divisional headquarters, three district headquarters, one area headquarters and 32 other stations. Of those located in rural villages, the following is the case for stations, by Garda district, where refurbishments are planned or have recently been completed.</P>
      <P>Abbeydorney Garda station was recently painted externally and part internally, and Ardfert Garda station also received both internal and external painting this year. At Castlegregory Garda station, a new kitchen was recently provided, and approval has been granted for a complete internal painting.</P>
      <P>A new basic unit type Garda station is also planned for Ballinskelligs, and I signed a contract for this scheme on 4 November fast. On the same date, I officially opened the newly refurbished Garda station at Sneem. In the case of Valentia Garda station, major maintenance works are planned, and approval has been granted to the Office of Public Works to proceed to tender on the matter. In addition, a new basic unit type Garda station is planned for Waterville.</P>
      <P>With respect to Farranfore Garda station, approval has been given to proceed with improvements to the entrance of the premises. Ballybunion Garda station is to receive a major refurbishment shortly, at a cost of £52,000, and work on the scheme will commence shortly. Improvement works to the boundary wall at Ballyduff Garda station have also been approved, and Ballylongford Garda station and the associated official accommodation are to receive replacement windows. Moreover, Knocknagoshel Garda station was recently painted both internally and externally. In addition, a major refurbishment scheme has been approved for Tarbert Garda station, and the Office of Public Works is currently engaged in this project. I officially opened the newly refurbished Garda station at Kenmare in June last.</P>
      <P>The accommodation requirements of Garda stations, including the need for refurbishment work, are the subject of ongoing review and monitoring, to ensure that resources made available to enhance the stock of Garda accommodation are expended in the most efficient and cost-effective manner. Significant refurbishment and construction work has already occurred with respect to Garda stations in County Kerry, and many more similar developments are planned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="585" /> As with all items on the Garda maintenance programme, however, work must proceed according to overall priorities and the availability of financial and other resources.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my replies to Question No. 756 of 29 September 1999, Question No. 86 of 12 October 1999, Questions Nos. 321 and 322 of 19 October 1999 and Question No. 540 of 2 November 1999,</P>
      <P>As no doubt the Deputy will be aware, arising out of the buoyancy in the economy and the current high level of activity in the housing market the number of dealings being lodged with, and the level of business being transacted by, the Land Registry has been increasing steadily for some years now and has been subject to unprecedented increases in recent years.</P>
      <P>In this light I am pleased to be able to report that significant efficiencies have been generated by the registries. For example, overall output of applications for registration has increased by 20 per cent. This is a significant achievement and I want to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the staff of the Land Registry and Registry of Deeds for their efforts in this regard.</P>
      <P>I have indicated that my Department has written to the Department of Finance making a strong case for the allocation of additional staff to deal with the increase in the level of business in the Land Registry. Urgent discussions have been held between the two Departments in relation to this issue and we are awaiting the response of the Department of Finance in this regard.</P>
      <P>On the Deputy's query in relation to the time taken to complete a dealing, I am informed by the Registrar of Titles that this can depend on many different factors such as the accuracy of the documents lodged by the applicant-applicant's solicitor, the complexity of the case, the level and number of the queries raised in relation to the applicant's right to registration, the time taken by the applicant-applicant's solicitor to reply and the number of dealings lodged in the Land Registry.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 61 and 67 together.</P>
      <P>There were 784 prisoners in Mountjoy Prison on Wednesday 10 November. The design capacity of the prison is 547 while the bed capacity is 670. The average number held overnight in Mountjoy during the first ten months of 1999 was 750. The highest number held on any one night during this period was 779 on 22 June 1999 and the lowest was 693 on 4 January and 4 October.</P>
      <P>Of the 784 prisoners in Mountjoy on 10 November, 604 had to slop-out. The remainder were accommodated in cells containing integral sanitation. The planned refurbishment of Mountjoy Prison over the next four years will include the installation of integral sanitation and the practice of slopping out will end. The refurbishment of Mountjoy has been made possible as a consequence of additional prison accommodation being available under the prison building programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="588" /> I am hopeful that the levels of overcrowding experienced in the last number of years will diminish as the prison building programme advances. In this regard the first batches of prisoners moved into the new prison at Cloverhill last week. The population of Cloverhill will increase in a controlled way by transferring groups of prisoners from other prisons. This will play a significant role in reducing the number of prisoners accommodated in Mountjoy. All newly remanded prisoners will be committed to Cloverhill when it is fully operational early next year. The new women's prison at Mountjoy will take its first batch of prisoners next Monday. When fully operational shortly, this will free up a further 60 spaces which will revert to St Patrick's Institution. An additional 515 places will become available next spring with the opening of the new Midlands prison at Portlaoise. Planning for a further 800 spaces has commenced with a view to putting proposals to Government.</P>
    <P>In addition to the building of new prison places, a major programme of refurbishing, upgrading, modernising and, where necessary, extending facilities is also continuing at existing prisons.</P>

The Act is comprehensive and deals with all areas relevant to employment including access to employment, conditions of employment, remuneration, promotion and vocational training. The age provisions of the Act apply to persons between the ages of 18 years and 65 years, except in the case of vocational training, where the Act applies to persons over the minimum school leaving age.</P>

The individual referred to by the Deputy was detained at Dublin Airport, after being found in possession of a quantity of drugs with a notional street value of approximately £1 million. He was subsequently arrested and brought to Santry Garda Station, where he refused to answer any questions. A file was prepared and forwarded to the Director of Public Prosecutions and he was subsequently charged with the importation of illegal substances and with possession of illicit drugs with intent to supply. He was subsequently acquitted by the courts.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities have informed me that confidential guidelines have been issued by the Garda Commissioner in respect of intelligence gathering and reporting. The Garda Commissioner has appointed a chief superintendent to examine the circumstances surrounding this case. This examination is not, as yet, complete.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The positive discussions at Tampere have given a welcomed impetus to the development of a common EU asylum and migration policy. As well as discussing common standards for receiving asylum seekers, efforts were also focused on developing EU co-operation with countries which are the source of flows of asylum seekers. The need for national Governments and the European Commission to co-ordinate closely with NGOs, particularly the UNHCR, was highlighted.</P>
      <P>At Tampere, the European Council also reaffirmed the importance the Union and member states attach to absolute respect of the right to seek asylum. The European Council has agreed to work towards establishing a common European asylum system, based on the full and inclusive application of the Geneva Convention, maintaining the principle of non-refoulement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland supports the development of common policies and procedures for asylum, including the development of common criteria for defining a refugee, as well as improvements to enhance the effectiveness of the Dublin Convention. We also support the development of proposals to combat <Col N="593" /> trafficking in human beings and illegal immigrations.</P>
    <P>The Treaty of Amsterdam, which was agreed unanimously by the member states subject to the relevant national ratification procedures, contains a protocol on asylum for nationals of member states of the European Union. The preamble to the protocol states explicitly that the protocol respects the finality and the objectives of the Geneva Convention of 28 July 1951 relating to the status of refugees. The Government is fully satisfied that the new protocol is consistent with the obligations of member states under the 1951 convention and this was an important point for Ireland in the negotiations.</P>
    <P>Moreover, a Treaty declaration explicitly confirms that the protocol does not prejudice the right of each member state to take the organisational measures it deems necessary to fulfil its obligations under the Geneva Convention of 28 July 1951 relating to the status of refugees. Ireland will, of course, continue to fulfil its obligations under the Geneva Convention and to take the organisational measures necessary in that regard.</P>

      <Quest>the steps, if any, taken to establish whether there was misappropriation of public funds by the Irish Council of People with Disabilities; the reason the Comptroller and Auditor General was denied access to the draft report on this issue prepared by his Department's internal audit unit; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>In March 1997 the Interim Irish Council of People with Disabilities was established. This is a voluntary elective organisation of approximately 5,500 members, the majority of whom are people with disabilities. It operates in accordance with the provisions of an interim constitution which provides for 30 county networks and a national board tasked with management of the business of the organisation. One of the primary objectives of the board was the drafting of a constitution for a permanent council in consultation with the membership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The interim council is funded almost entirely by the Exchequer by way of a grant administered by my Department. Payments made to the council by my Department totalled £450,000 and £606,000 in 1997 and 1998, respectively. To date in 1999, payments totalling £600,000 have been made. These funds are used to support the work of the county networks and of the organisation's national office. The £450,000 paid in 1997 includes a final payment of £52,000 made to the <Col N="594" /> establishment group which facilitated the setting up of the interim council.</P>
    <P>During the second quarter of 1998 officials of my Department became increasingly concerned at developments within the council. Accordingly, on 11 June 1998, the Minister of State, Deputy Mary Wallace, accompanied by officials, made known to representatives of the council her concern and that of the Department at the situation. A number of immediate remedial actions were identified to the council's representatives which related primarily to staffing and financial controls. The situation continued to be monitored closely and early in September 1998 an inquiry by the Department's internal audit unit was commenced.</P>
    <P>Following receipt of a preliminary report on 6 October 1998 from the head of the unit and because of continuing concerns about financial control procedures, my Department appointed its finance officer as financial administrator of the council and directed that no further payments would be made by the management board or its staff without his specific authorisation. The financial administrator would also review existing financial procedures, advise as to their adequacy and what changes are required. These revised financial control arrangements have operated without interruption to date.</P>
    <P>When a draft report became available it was circulated in strict confidence on 25 November 1998 to those people who were identified in the draft or who otherwise had responsibility for the affairs of the council, seeking their comments. Some of the comments caused minor revisions to be made to the report. However, in January 1999 before the report could be finalised, the former chairperson of the council who resigned in June 1998, initiated judicial review proceedings and sought an order preventing the publication and/or dissemination of the information contained in the report or any drafts of same. In the circumstances and having regard to the legal advice in the matter furnished to the Department that the current proceedings constitute a barrier against further distribution of the audit unit's report, it is not open to the Department at this point in time to provide access to the draft report to the Comptroller and Auditor General or to any other person, office or organisation.</P>
    <P>In this regard, I assure the Deputy that at all times my Department is concerned that every assistance is accorded to the Comptroller and Auditor General and his staff in fulfilling their statutory obligations. I can also inform the Deputy that the Comptroller and Auditor General has received assurances from the accounting officer that the report will be released to him when the legal matter is resolved between the parties. I am satisfied that the report, when it is released to my Department and to other agencies, will be of considerable assistance in determining whether there was any misappropriation of public funds allocated to the Irish Council of People with Disabilities.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="595" /> I should add that in January 1999 I appointed a seven person steering group with specific terms of reference to manage the affairs of the council pending the establishment of a permanent elective council of people with disabilities. In effect, the steering group has replaced and is fulfilling the role of the National Board of the Irish Council of People with Disabilities whose mandate expired on 31 December 1998.</P>

      <Quest>the incidents of computer hacking which have come to the attention of the Garda authorities over the past three years; and his views on whether this hacking is on the increase.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities that the term 'computer hacking' is covered under the provision of section 5 of the Criminal Damage (Unauthorised Access) Act, 1991.</P>
      <P>I also understand that over the last three years, there has been a steady increase in the number of such complaints being made to the computer crime investigation unit. In 1997, there was one such incident which was prosecuted in the District Court but was dismissed by the judge. In 1998, there were five incidents, however there were no prosecutions due to insufficient evidence or the complainant being unwilling to proceed. In 1999, there have been nine incidents, prosecutions have been instigated in two cases and there are two further prosecutions imminent. The Garda authorities inform me that further prosecutions may arise from ongoing inquiries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the House can see there has been an increase in the number of such cases being reported to the Garda. However, the Garda authorities consider that successful prosecutions will heighten public awareness to this particular type <Col N="598" /> of crime and that they will serve as a warning to potential hackers that they can be identified and that they will be prosecuted.</P>

      <Quest>if the establishment at the Tampere Summit of Eurojust, an international network of prosecutors and magistrates to fight organised crime, presages the ultimate harmonisation of EU judicial systems.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposal to establish Eurojust is one of a number of key actions identified at Tampere to build in a practical way on successful mechanisms, such as Europol and the European Judicial Network, which are already in place in the fight against organised crime.</P>
      <P>The proposal envisages Eurojust being made up of national prosecutors, magistrates or police officers of equivalent competence, detached from each member state according to its legal system. While the details for the establishment and functioning of Eurojust are not yet known, the proposal is that it will facilitate the proper co-ordination of national prosecuting authorities and of supporting criminal investigations in organised crime cases notably based on Europol's analysis. It is also proposed that it will co-operate closely with the European Judicial Network, in particular to simplify the execution of letters rogatory. The special European summit has requested the council to adopt the necessary legal instrument by the end of 2001 and Ireland will actively participate in the negotiation of that instrument.</P>
      <P>It would not be feasible at this point to take on a global programme of harmonisation of EU judicial systems because of the very different constitutional and legal traditions across the Union. Ireland has, however, been to the forefront among member states within the EU in implementing measures in the fight against organised crime and I welcome this initiative on Eurojust as another important step in that campaign.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Garda authorities have informed me that statistics broken down on a divisional basis are not readily available, and could only be obtained by the use of a disproportionate amount of staff time and resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The distinction between arrests and persons being made amenable should be borne in mind. That is to say that not all arrests lead to a person being made amenable for an offence. However, <Col N="599" /> juvenile offenders, that is persons under 18 years of age, made amenable for offences are reported to the national juvenile office by means off a juvenile referral form. This includes persons who are arrested and also those who are detected without arrest, such as for example, persons who have no insurance or driving licence.</P>
    <P>From 1 January 1999 to 31 October 1999 some 11,498 referrals for juvenile offenders were received at the national juvenile office. This gives an average number of referrals per month of 1,150 for 1999.</P>

      <P>The Independent Commission on Policing in Northern Ireland was established pursuant to the Good Friday Agreement with a view to providing the opportunity for a new beginning to policing in Northern Ireland with a police service capable of attracting and sustaining support from the community as a whole. In its report the commission made 175 recommendations.</P>
      <P>My Department has been looking closely at all these recommendations and there have been a number of high level discussions with senior members of the Garda Síochána. Obviously the main interest in the report is in the context of the peace process but my Department's examination covers a broad range of issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recommendations of most immediate and direct interest for the Garda Síochána are set out in chapter 18 of the report entitled &ldquo;Cooperation with other Police Services&rdquo;. A joint Department/Garda implementation strategy group was established last month and they are looking primarily at the question of further enhanced co-operation between the Garda Síoch<Col N="600" /> ána and the police authorities in Northern Ireland and how it might be best pursued.</P>

    <P>As the Deputy will note the statistics indicate a strong and sustained decrease in armed crime over the period, with the level of armed crime for 1998 approximately 40% of the 1995 value. The statistics also show that the detection rate over these five years has also risen from 28% in 1995 to 40% in 1998. Naturally I am concerned about any armed robbery and while compared to the low levels of 1998, there is an upward trend in armed crime this year, the present level is still well below that of 1995 or 1996.</P>

      <P>My Department's equal opportunities child care programme provides supports for the development of child care facilities, including the establishment of creches. The programme is designed primarily to support local communities who are helping parents with child care responsibilities to access employment, education and training opportunities. It is targeted mainly at community based projects in disadvantaged areas but also has an equal opportunities dimension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The initial budget for the equal opportunities childcare programme, 1998-99, was just over £6 million. Earlier this year, my Department sought and received additional funding of £5 million from the European Social Fund and the Exchequer to expand the programme. To date the programme has assisted in providing capital infrastructure funding for over 100 projects, has provided support for salary costs in 25 community based child care facilities and has contributed towards the development of eight employer projects involving 21 employers. In addition, money <Col N="602" /> has been provided for the development of a national child care census and database.</P>
    <P>The additional funding received this year has allowed further investment in child care including: developing and expanding the services of the national voluntary child care organisations; providing training grants for community child care projects supported under the programme; providing grants to partnerships and local development community groups for child care training, development, project management and capacity building; researching the development of family friendly policies for small and medium enterprises; enhancing the national child care census and database.</P>
    <P>The question of future supports for the establishment of crèches and other child care facilities will be considered in the context of the Government's decisions on the report of the Interdepartmental Committee on Childcare, which is being considered at present by a ministerial group which I am chairing.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may be aware that funding of £250 million has been included for child care in the national development plan. This funding will be in the regional operational programmes of the national development plan and my Department is currently developing a child care measure which will incorporate the objectives and strategies of the national development plan and the decisions of the Government on child care supports.</P>

    <P>The majority of the overtime costs were incurred in the supervision of contractors engaged in addressing difficulties which arose during the commissioning period and in necessary follow-up security searches.</P>
    <P>The monthly staff costs of the new women's prison, Dóchas Centre, Mountjoy, since the official opening on 28 September 1999 are as follows: October, £4,185.28; November, £4,185.28.</P>
    <P>These figures are approximate and are based on the cost of two staff who were the only ones officially assigned specifically to the new women's prison during this period. In the coming weeks, the staff of the existing women's prison will transfer over the new prison.</P>
    <P>As the new women's prison is located adjacent to the existing Mountjoy complex, additional staff resources from the main Mountjoy Prison have been allocated there from time to time. It is not possible to extract the exact staff cost of this <i>ad hoc attendance.</i></P>

      <P>Surveys and censuses undertaken by the Central Statistics Office are covered by the provisions of the Statistics Act, 1993. In particular, the Act covers the right of the director general of the CSO to initiate such surveys, the statutory or voluntary nature of the inquiries, the appointment as officers of statistics of persons who may collect the information or have access to it, and the protection of the individual information obtained. The Act does not cover surveys undertaken by other organisations either in the public or private domains.</P>
      <P>There would appear to be no restriction on a private company using the name &ldquo;national research survey&rdquo;. There is also no obligation to indicate that the survey is not an official survey being undertaken by the CSO. However, it is an offence under the Statistics Act for persons to misrepresent themselves as &ldquo;officers of statistics&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>All persons engaged on official surveys undertaken by the CSO carry identification and members of the public are encouraged to contact the office if they have any doubts regarding the <i>bona fides</i> of any approach requesting participation in a CSO survey. This is vital since it is absolutely essential that the public have confidence in the professionalism and integrity of the CSO.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 98 to 100, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>These questions relate to the World Trade Organisation, WTO, and to the upcoming Third WTO Ministerial Conference in Seattle. The questions cover the areas of developing countries' interests and investment.</P>
      <P>It is expected that the Third WTO Ministerial Conference will take the necessary decisions to launch a millennium round of trade negotiations across a broad range of trade issues. It is likely that these negotiations would commence in 2000 and be completed within a specified timeframe. The position of developing countries and investment feature in the WTO preparatory run-up to Seattle along with other issues, including, for example, agriculture, services, tariffs, competition, environment, electronic commerce, intellectual property, trade facilitation, government procurement, technical barriers to trade and core labour standards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>WTO members are currently trying to finalise a ministerial declaration for adoption at Seattle which will cover the scope and modalities of the proposed negotiations. This process is proving to <Col N="609" /> be slow as many members are trying to influence the outcome of the negotiations before they start.</P>
    <P>Ireland's position on the new round has been developed in co-operation with our European Union partners, in keeping with our Treaty obligations, and EU submissions have been made to the WTO outlining the union's views on the new round. The EU approach has been to call for a comprehensive round of trade negotiations involving a broad range of issues. It is my belief that the best way to address the challenges resulting from rapid and far-reaching economic changes is to manage properly and effectively the globalisation process, to promote equitable growth and development and to respond in a balanced manner to the interests of all WTO members, in particular the developing countries.</P>
    <P>Addressing the concerns of developing countries is a key strategy in the EU approach to the new round. Special and differential treatment for developing countries is already a cornerstone of existing WTO agreements and in the new round there is a need to examine how these provisions can be implemented or changed so as to have a better impact for developing countries. The traditional approach has mainly been to base special and differential treatment for developing countries on extended implementation periods. Other methods, including human development indicators, can be examined during the future negotiations.</P>
    <P>In addition to special and differential treatment, Ireland, along with the EU, will sponsor a call for duty and tariff free market access for products from least developed countries to all markets by 2003. Capacity building, technical assistance and coherence between international bodies have also been identified by the EU as a contribution to the developing countries concerns.</P>
    <P>Developing countries themselves are actively involved in addressing their particular concerns for the new round and considerable time has been spent on implementation issues in the discussions on the draft ministerial declaration. Given that the WTO operates by consensus, the approval of developing countries to any final arrangements will be essential before the negotiations can be successfully concluded.</P>
    <P>Ireland, with the EU, has called for the new round negotiations to cover investment. We are seeking the establishment of a multilateral framework of rules governing international investment worldwide. A framework of multilateral rules for investment has to ensure the right conditions for international investment to be conducive to sustainable development. Such a framework should preserve the ability of host countries to regulate the activity of investors, whether foreign or domestic, on their territory, for the achievement of legitimate policy objectives. Given that the ability to open a country's domestic market to international investment differs greatly among WTO members, Ireland believes that a bottom-up approach to the question of admission, based on <Col N="610" /> commitments undertaken by each member, is the way to allow for the flexibility that many WTO members require.</P>

      <P>In so far as my Department is concerned, we have responsibility for the European Communities (Labelling, Presentations and Advertising of Foodstuffs) Regulations, 1982 (as amended), which implement Directive 79/112/EEC (as amended) on the labelling, advertising, and presentation of foodstuffs. The regulations provide,<i> inter alia,</i> that most prepackaged foods, including meat, whether imported or not, must include certain information, including the following, on the label: the name of the food; the name or business name and address of the manufacturer, packer or seller established within the EU, and the country of origin if its absence might mislead to a material degree.</P>
      <P>The regulations cover foodstuffs intended for sale to the end consumer and to the catering trade.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I expect the Deputy is referring to the consideration currently being given to banning the use of phthalates in certain child care articles and toys.</P>
      <P>Under the provisions of the General Product Safety Directive, the Commission, on 10 November 1999, put forward a proposal to ban the use of phthalates in child care articles and toys which are intended to be put in the mouth. This proposal was considered on 22 November by the emergencies committee set up under this directive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="612" /> At the meeting, at which Ireland was represented by the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs, there was wide consensus among the member states on the objective of eliminating immediately phthalates from toys which are intended to be put in the mouth. However, the committee had before it additional information which had been received the previous Friday. A letter was received by Commissioner David Byrne from the Association of European Toy Manufacturing Industries proposing to implement the full scope of the emergency ban on a voluntary basis. Certain members of the Scientific Committee for Toxicity, Ecotoxicity and Environment had expressed in a letter to the Commission disagreement on the proposal.</P>
    <P>The emergencies committee decided, therefore, to postpone a decision until further clarifications on these developments can be obtained. In this regard, it is necessary to establish whether a voluntary measure would be a practicable and effective alternative to an emergency ban. Member states also asked for further clarification on whether the emergency clauses in the General Product Safety Directive, which form the legal base for the Commission proposal, would be applicable.</P>
    <P> The European Commission has undertaken to provide these clarifications whilst making clear that a quick solution has to be found. I understand that the committee is expected to meet again very shortly, most probably within the next ten days.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 104 and 105 together.</P>
      <P>Within the World Trade Organisation, WTO, intellectual property issues are covered by the Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, TRIPs agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Patentable subject matter is already dealt with under Article 27 of the TRIPS agreement. Article 27 (3)(b) permits WTO members to exclude from <Col N="613" /> patentability plants and animals other than micro-organisms, and essential biological processes for the production of plants or animals other than non-biological and microbiological processes. This is subject to a requirement that members provide for the protection of plant varieties either by patents or by an effective <i>sui generis</i> system or by a combination of both. I assume that the Deputy is referring to these provisions when referring to biopatents.</P>
    <P>Article 27 (3)(b) contains a review clause and work on this review has already commenced within the WTO TRIPS Council.</P>
    <P>It is expected that the Third WTO Ministerial Conference in Seattle will take the necessary decisions to launch a millennium round of trade negotiations across a broad range of trade issues. These negotiations should commence in 2000 and be completed within a three year timeframe. Intellectual property issues will be addressed in the negotiations and it is likely that matters pertaining to Article 27 (3)(b) will also be addressed.</P>
    <P>Ireland, together with our European Union partners, is committed to high standards of intel<Col N="614" /> lectual property protection and would not wish to see any lowering of these standards as a result of the negotiations.</P>

      <P>The NOW programme, New Opportunities for Women, is a strand of the EMPLOYMENT Community Initiative which is funded by the European Social Fund  The total investment in 71 NOW projects since 1995 will amount to 20,291,395 ECUs, £15 million approximately, in European Social Funds and 2,102,178 ECUs, £1.6 million approximately, in European Regional Development Funds. Under the terms of the EU initiative, funds will cease to be committed at the end of 1999 and final payment will take place during 2000.</P>
      <P>The overall objective of EMPLOYMENT is to target groups that face specific difficulties in the employment market and, accordingly, to explore innovative and new ways of combating exclusion in the labour market with a view to identifying and extracting lessons from specific projects and incorporating them into national policies.</P>
      <P>Many of the issues arising are targeted for support under the National Development Plan, 2000 to 2006. Groups and projects which were funded under the NOW programme could seek funding under a number of measures in the plan.</P>
      <P>The new proposed human resources EU initiative, EQUAL, which will run from 2000 to 2006, will continue to promote new means of combating all forms of discrimination and inequalities in the labour market by way of specific projects involving local consortia and transnational partners. The total amount of European Social Funds available will be 32 million euro, over £25 million.</P>
      <P>The EQUAL operational programme for Ireland will be drafted in spring 2000 by my Department in consultation with the appropriate groups and organisations and submitted to the European Commission for negotiation. It is expected that the Commission decision finalising the details of the EQUAL programme for Ireland will subsequently issue in autumn 2000 and that a public call for project proposals will take place in Autumn 2000.</P>

      <P>It is expected that by the end of this year a total of about £860,000 will have been spent on the business awareness campaign being run by Enterprise Ireland relating to the year 2000 computer problem. Approximately £540,000 of this amount has come from the European Union with the balance from the Exchequer. These figures do not include staff costs, relating to officials in either Enterprise Ireland or the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>
      <P>I intend to ensure the Enterprise Ireland service will continue for the rest of this year and, early next year. I am not aware of any further campaign planned by any other State agencies on this issue.</P>

      <P>Officials from my Department have been in contact with the social economy unit in Tallaght on a number of occasions and have attended two seminars run by the unit on social economy issues. These were among a series of seminars designed to inform community groups about the nature of the social economy and issues relating to the introduction of the social economy programme by my Department.</P>
      <P>Funding for the social economy unit derives from a number of sources. These are principally the EU URBAN initiative and the Tallaght Partnership through ADM, Get Tallaght Working and FÁS community enterprise programme.</P>
      <P>I am not in a position to comment therefore on the general funding situation post 1999 as the main sources of funding for the unit come from the EU urban initiative and under the aegis of organisations supported by the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation.</P>
      <P>In relation to funding under the FÁS community enterprise programme any applications for funding may be made on a year to year basis.</P>

      <P>The job initiative programme, which was launched as a pilot initiative by the Government in 1996, is an active labour market intervention measure specifically targeted at persons 35 years of age or over and unemployed or in receipt of lone parents allowance for a minimum of five years.</P>
      <P>Deloitte and Touche, consultants, was commissioned by my Department in April 1999 to undertake a review of the effectiveness of job initiative against its objectives on reaching the end of the first phase of its operation. As already announced in the Adjournment debate on the job initiative programme in this House on 11 November 1999, I have, in accordance with one of the recommendations by the consultants, decided to provide a six months extension to participants in phase 1 of the programme who were due to complete their three year term on the programme on 31 December 1999. During the extra six months on the programme greater attention will be given to the training and educational needs of the participants than heretofore, and participants will be encouraged and given every assistance to seek alternative employment in the open labour market.</P>
      <P>The consultants have recommended that roll-overs on the job initiative programme should be limited to 10 per cent of participants and to a period of one year. They also recommend that such an extension will only be considered on the basis that it will facilitate the further development and progression of individuals. Consultation on this recommendation and others outlined in the report will take place with the social partners in coming weeks. Once this process has taken place I will take the final decisions on the future operation of the job initiative programme.</P>

      <P>3.Remedial works are being undertaken on the pier in Bray. The work involves the removal of obstructions on the seabed, driving of permanent steel piles and construction of a new concrete wall encasing the piles over a length of 100 metres. In addition, a concrete deck slab will be constructed over the entire 240 metres of the existing south pier. The cost of the works is estimated at £1 million.</P>

The licences are described in more detail in the six monthly report for the period to the end of June 1999, which I laid before the Oireachtas in August.</P>
    <P>I have authorised a request for tender for a consultancy study of acid rock drainage, ARD, from the area of the former mine workings into the Avoca river. The terms of reference for the study are being finalised by my Department. The intended study is required to quantify and identify sources of ARD and to identify feasible economic strategies for dealing with it. The study is expected to take up to a year in field work and measurement, and it is hoped that it can commence in early 2000.</P>

The port company is advancing a project which involves the development of port facilities at Tom Roe's Point, including the construction of a 160 metre quay and attendant onshore facilities and capital dredging of the shipping channel on the River Boyne.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 116 and 117 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For background to the issues raised, I refer the Deputy to the response I gave in this House to Deputy Gay Mitchell on 2 November. The British proposal for a capability target of 40,000, which is about the size of KFOR in Kosovo, is one of the ideas that has been put forward in the continuing debate on security and defence. It will have to be studied carefully. The emphasis in the EU debate is on how to ensure that the EU can play a more active role in both non-military crisis management and the Petersberg tasks. Participation in the Petersberg Tasks under the Treaty <Col N="624" /> of Amsterdam is voluntary. There is no question of a European army being set up.</P>
    <P>At the Cologne European Council of June 1999, it was agreed that arrangements should be put in place that allow involvement by non-EU member states in EU-led Petersberg tasks. The General Affairs Council on 15 November 1999, which was attended by Foreign and Defence Ministers, reviewed progress since the Cologne Summit. There was no agreement at the General Affairs Council, or since, on the issue raised by the Deputy. The Helsinki European Council next month will consider a progress report from the Finnish Presidency on developments since Cologne.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>The OSCE observer mission visited Ingushetia on 10 November and was denied permission to enter Chechnya on 11 November. The observer mission was led by Ambassador Kim Traavik, personal representative of the Norwegian Foreign Minister, Mr. Knut Vollebaek, who chairs the OSCE. The acting head of the OSCE assistance group to Chechnya, Ambassador Skagestad, also participated. The mission's mandate was to assess the humanitarian situation in the north Caucasus. There is as yet no published report from the OSCE observer mission.</P>
      <P>I understand the mission visited a number of Chechen refugee camps, including the camps at Sputnik and Karabulak, and the Kavkaz border control point, close to the Ingush-Chechen administrative border. Meetings were held with the Prime Minister of Ingushetia, Mr. Darsigov, the chairman of the Parliament of Ingushetia, Mr. Pliev, and with Mr. Koshman, Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian Federation responsible for the civil administration of Chechnya.</P>
      <P>Media reports on the mission's visit indicate that there is a serious humanitarian problem in Ingushetia and that there is a real risk of further deterioration unless the humanitarian relief effort is significantly stepped up. There are serious problems as regards basic requirements such as shelter, nutrition, sanitation and health. I am not aware of any references to war crimes in the context of the statements made by the members of the mission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is seriously concerned at the deteriorating situation in Chechnya and the plight of the civilian population. We condemn attacks on civilians, whoever the perpetrators. The Government has allocated IR£220,000 in humanitarian assistance to Chechen refugees in Ingush<Col N="625" /> etia. This allocation will augment Ireland's share of the European Union aid package of £1.2 million. The Government notes the agreement of Russia, at the OSCE summit in Istanbul, that a political solution in Chechnya is essential and that the assistance of the OSCE would contribute to achieving that goal. Ireland will continue to work for an early resolution of the conflict.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>In my response to the previous question to which the Deputy refers, I set out both the objectives of the EU sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and also their scope and impact. I made it clear that sanctions are intended to apply pressure on Belgrade to implement necessary reforms and contribute to the stability of the region. I also made it clear that our dispute is not with the Serbian people but with the Government of President Milosevic.</P>
      <P>As regards the sanctions on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia-Serbia, the position remains as indicated in my earlier reply. As regards Montenegro, which is an integral part of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the European Union decided on 15 October to exempt that republic from the main EU sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, notably the oil embargo and the flight ban. This decision reflects the support of the European Union for the democratically elected Government of Montenegro.</P>
      <P>The European Union is in consultation with the Montenegro authorities on a practical assistance programme for the economy. Over 40 million euro from the EU budget has been spent on aid for Montenegro since 1998. This is in addition to 15 million euro humanitarian assistance and bilateral aid by member states. At its meeting on 15 November the General Affairs Council asked the Commission to prepare a budgetary programme for reconstruction in Montenegro for the year 2000. The possibility of extending the activities of the EU reconstruction agency, currently active in Kosovo, to cover Montenegro is being studied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The economic situation in Montenegro, although better than that in Serbia, is difficult. Unemployment is 40 per cent and there was $500 million worth of indirect infrastructural damage as a result of NATO air strikes against military <Col N="626" /> targets in the republic. Inflation of the Yugoslav dinar, partly as a direct result of the sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, has threatened economic reforms which the Montenegro Government is carrying through. This has led to Montenegro's decision to introduce the deutschmark as a parallel currency. Financial police are on the border between Montenegro and Serbia to prevent smuggling of currency and in general the transition to the parallel currency seems to have proceeded calmly. EU currency experts established contact with the Montenegro Government shortly after the decision to adopt the deutschmark as a parallel currency was announced and have been assisting with the changeover.</P>

      <P>The person named applied on 49 animals under the 1999 cattle headage scheme. An examination of his application under this scheme showed that 40 of those animals were not registered with the national calf birth registration service in accordance with clause 13 of the terms and conditions governing the scheme. The person named was written to by my Department on 21 July 1999 requesting that the animals be registered and advising that any <Col N="632" /> animal not registered within 15 days of receipt of the letter would not be eligible for payment. A subsequent examination of his application showed that these animals remained unregistered and my Department wrote to him on 21 September 1999 advising that as he was in breach of clause 13 and clause 21(b) of the terms and conditions in relation to animal identification and registration requirements his application would be subject to a 100 per cent penalty as set out in clause 34(a).  He was given the opportunity to appeal this decision within 21 days by writing to my Department setting out any facts which he wished to put forward to support his case but he did not do so. The person named registered 11 of these animals at the beginning of this month while 29 animals remain unregistered. However, as these animals were not registered within the deadline specified they remain ineligible for payment.</P>

      <P>In the estate commonage referred to there are more than 40 herdowners claiming a variety of different commonages held in different share values. The commonages in question, as elsewhere, have been the source of serious difficulties in processing area aid applications this year, mainly because farmers have not provided adequate proof of entitlement to such commonages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department recently advertised in local newspapers in a number of counties, including <Col N="636" /> Mayo, urging farmers to supply the necessary proofs in order to advance the processing of the relevant area aid applications. My Department will continue to endeavour to resolve all commonage difficulties as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>A number of measures are in place to encourage young people to enter farming as a full-time career. The national scheme of installation aid, re-introduced in December 1998, provides a grant of £5,600 to young farmers under 35 years of age who meet certain conditions. In addition, a comprehensive range of tax incentives are in place aimed at reducing the cost of ownership transfer between relatives. The incentives include stock relief, stamp duty, capital acquisitions and probate tax.</P>
      <P>Special provision has been made for young farmers in the recent announcement on the distribution of the additional milk quota secured under Agenda 2000. Priority is given to young farmers in allocating ewe and suckler cow quota rights from the national reserve.</P>
      <P>The National Development Plan 2000-2006 launched last week has a range of measures which will benefit farmers generally including young people seeking a full time career in farming. My Department's agri-food strategy committee 2010 has been established to critically plan for the development of the agricultural industry. It is envisaged that all aspects will be examined, including the issue of land mobility. Also, a departmental task force is currently commencing a review of agricultural education and training having regard to the changing economic and social farming environment.</P>

    <P>The person named submitted his fifth year application for payment under REPS on 24 August 1999. His recording year ended on 30 April 1999. His application was due to be lodged no later than 30 June 1999. In the circumstances, my Department had no option but to impose a 50% penalty in this case.</P>

      <P>The European Commission made it clear in discussions that the contiguity criterion would not be satisfied by areas which barely touched the existing more severely handicapped boundary and/or extended away from the boundary in long &ldquo;fingers&rdquo; of land.</P>
      <P>Bannaghane, Bannaghroe and Drumlinney were rejected because the income of each townland exceeded the limit of 60 per cent of national average income. These townlands adjoined the existing more severely handicapped area.</P>

      <P>Stamp duty rates for all residential property were reduced significantly by the Government in the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1998, arising out of the first Bacon report on house prices.</P>
      <P>In addition, there is no stamp duty on the sale of new residential property where the purchaser is an owner occupier and the house is not greater than 125 square metres. If a new house is more</P>
      <P>than 125 square metres, stamp duty is charged only on the site cost or a quarter of the value of</P>
      <P>the house, whichever is the greater.</P>
      <P>The stamp duty yield in 1998 was £541 million. This is a significant contribution to the Exchequer and helps reduce the tax take on employment income. The stamp duty reductions in 1998 halved the rate of stamp duty at the lower end of the residential property. These reductions have been of benefit to all house buyers and this general reform of the rates was considered more beneficial to the housing market rather than the introduction of specific stamp duty exemptions/reliefs. As regards the release of asset value where the seller of the larger house is an older person, I should point out that such a seller will gain significantly from the capital gains tax exemption on the disposal of a principal private residence.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, I am reviewing the capital acquisitions tax code in detail for the forthcoming budget. It would be inappropriate to comment on any changes which may be made to the legislation in this regard, prior to budget day.</P>
      <P>I undertook to examine the capital acquisitions tax code earlier this year in the course of the Finance Bill debate. I appreciate the concerns which have been raised in relation to this tax, particularly on the inheritance of the family home. I am aware of the tax burden this could place on certain individuals, including co-habiting couples. This and other issues will be borne in mind in the context of the current review.</P>

      <P>VAT is charged on this product in all member states although the rate of VAT varies from country to country. The rate of VAT charged in Ireland is 21% for gas oil used as a propellant and 12.5% for gas oil used for other purposes.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="651" /> The office of the Revenue Commissioners, in which the person concerned is employed, operates a system whereby officers are required to serve for two years before a transfer application can be considered.

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 194 and No. 195 together.</P>
      <P>The innovation that the internet brings to financial services lies in the method of linking the &ndash; service provider and client rather than in the nature of the service itself Although the internet may raise specific issues with regard to the banking application and supervisory process, there is no fundamental difference between the process as it applies to institutions operating via the internet and those providing services by more traditional means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provisions of the second banking directive, (89/646/EEC), which was implemented in Ireland by S.I. No. 395 of 1992, European Communities (Licensing and Super-vision of Credit Institutions) Regulations, 1992, provide for the mutual recognition of banking services within the European Union. This means that any credit institution already licensed in another member state can undertake banking business in Ireland without the need for a licence from, or prudential supervision by, the Central Bank. Such institutions will be supervised by the home member state. The use of these &ldquo;passporting&rdquo; arrangements are likely to become increasingly advantageous to financial service providers with the advent of internet banking. Non-EU banks are required to obtain a licence from a member state <Col N="652" /> before they can provide services within the EU, whether via the internet or otherwise.</P>
    <P>The protection of the interests of clients of financial institutions, whether the service is provided via the internet or through more traditional channels, operates on two basic levels.</P>
    <P>The first addresses the protection of consumers' interests in the context of the solvency of the regulated entity and is part of the legislative remit of the Central Bank of Ireland in regard to Irish licensed banks and of the home supervisory authority in the case of internet-based banks that are licensed in another EU member state. The national banking supervisory authority regulates the activities of banks and investment firms with a view to the protection of clients' funds. In all cases, the institutions are subject to a stringent licensing/authorisation process and ongoing supervision that involves the use of both on-site and off-site mechanisms to determine compliance with the requirements imposed on those institutions, including detailed capital adequacy and liquidity requirements. This applies regardless of whether the institution provides the service over the internet or in a more traditional way.</P>
    <P>The second aspect relates to the protection afforded to clients in their role as consumers of financial services. At national level, financial service providers, whether Irish-based or offering services from abroad through the internet, are required to comply with the Consumer Credit Act, 1995. This Act covers, <i>inter alia</i>, the formal content of credit agreements, certain provisions relating to housing loans, bank charges, etc. Statutory responsibility for these issues lies with the Director of Consumer Affairs under the auspices of my colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade, and Employment, Deputy Harney, and her Department.</P>
    <P>In addition, at EU level, a draft directive on distance marketing of consumer financial services is currently under discussion. The proposal reflects the creation of the single market and anticipates the likely increase in cross border selling of financial services following the introduction of the euro. Against that background, the purpose of the draft directive is to establish a legal framework at EU level for the distance selling of financial services which takes into account the nature of these services. Consumers would be entitled to certain information in advance of entering into a contract, whether by fax, telephone or the internet, including the identity of the supplier, the total price to be paid for the financial service, the arrangements for payment and for performance, and the existence or absence of a right of withdrawal. The draft directive also contains provisions regarding the exercise of right of withdrawal, and exemptions from that right, and ancillary provisions such as payment by credit card, unsolicited services and unsolicited communications.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>farmers who are not registered for VAT in respect of the VAT charged to them on their pur<Col N="654" /> chases of goods and services. The scheme is optional and works through allowing the participating farmers to add the flat rate percentage to their prices when selling to VAT registered customers, for example, co-operatives, meat factories, etc. These customers in turn then treat the addition as a normal business input in their periodic VAT returns.</P>
    <P>Such returns are not compiled in a manner which would enable the amount of these indirect</P>
    <P>refunds to sheep farmers in respect of lamb to be identified. On the basis of aggregate economic</P>
    <P>data for the agricultural sector as a whole it's estimated that the amounts refunded to all participating farmers by their registered customers from the start of 1994 to end October 1999 are: 1994, £69.78 million; 1995, £73.24 million; 1996, £77.07 million; 1997, £85.82 million; 1998, £95.17 million; 1999, £87.28 million (to end October).</P>

    <P>Regional co-ordinating committees for physical and sensory disability services have been put in place in each of the health boards. These committees, which comprise representatives of the voluntary and statutory agencies and people with disabilities themselves, function in a consultative and advisory capacity to the chief executive officers of the boards in identifying and prioritising service developments and the allocation of funding available for this purpose. The allocation of additional resources for residential respite is considered by health boards in this context. This year £3 million, rising to £6 million full year cost in 2000, was allocated for the development of services and £4 million for capital projects.</P>
    <P>With regard to persons with an intellectual disability, the information sought in relation to respite care places is not available in the form requested by the Deputy. However, information from the national intellectual disability database indicated that as at September 1996, 7,572 persons with an intellectual disability and autism were in receipt of five or seven day residential services, 14,989 persons were in receipt of day services, of whom 1,875 also received residential support services. A further 243 persons were identified as receiving residential support services only. However, because of the fact that, for most people, respite services are provided as a second<Col N="656" /> ary service, in addition to their primary service, which would be either in educational or day placement, the level of reporting of this secondary service in 1996 did not fully reflect the level of respite services being provided. Data in respect of 1998, which I expect will be available shortly, will more fully reflect the level of respite service for people with an intellectual disability and autism and I will arrange for this information to be forwarded to the Deputy when it becomes available.</P>
    <P>In its budget 2000 submission, in relation to services for people with physical and sensory disability services, the Irish Wheelchair Association calls for additional revenue funding totalling £32 million to be made available for the provision of additional residential and respite places, day resource centres, personal assistance services and the introduction of a cost of disability payment scheme.</P>
    <P>Since this Government took office in 1997 a total of £38.162 million additional funding has been provided for services to people with physical and sensory disabilities. In line with the recommendations of the report of the Review Group on Health and Personal Social Services for People with Physical and Sensory Disabilities, Towards an Independent Future, this funding has mainly been allocated to address historical deficits in the voluntary sector, to address identified core underfunding of existing services and to develop a number of services such as respite, residential, home support, including personal assistance, day care, therapy services and sheltered employment. Once-off funding has also been provided for the provision of aids and appliances.</P>
    <P>Between 1997 and 1998, a total of £2.762 million has been provided for respite and residential services; £841,000 for day activity-day resource services and £902,000 for home support services, including personal assistance services. This year capital funding of £520,000 is being provided for respite and residential services and £1.477 million for day activity-day resource services. Since 1997, an additional 95 respite care places and 51 residential places have been put in place. It is my policy to continue to develop these services in accordance with the availability of funding.</P>
    <P>The costs of disability payment is one of the recommendations of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities. The implementation of the commission's recommendations has been under examination by an interdepartmental task force and a progress report is currently being drawn up by the task force.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, I am not yet in a position to comment on the level of additional funding which will be made available for the development of services to persons with an intellectual disability next year.</P>
      <P>Each health board area, including the North Eastern Health Board, has a regional intellectual disability co-ordinating committee which identifies priorities for service development and co-ordinates the provision of services, including additional services as resources become available. The co-ordinating committee is representative of the health board, voluntary agencies and families of persons with mental handicap.</P>
      <P>My Department will shortly be notifying the health boards of their allocations for 2000 and it is anticipated that decisions regarding the allocation of any additional funding will be taken by the regional co-ordinating committees early in the year 2000.</P>

      <P>The report, Towards a Standardised Framework for Inter-country Adoption Assessment Procedures to which I have referred previously in detail in the House examined the applications for assessment which were processed to completion in 1998. I would refer the Deputy to extracts of table 4.12, length of time between receipt of application and allocation to social worker and 4.13, length of time between allocation of social worker and commencement of assessment. The data demonstrates the waiting periods for assessment for inter-country adoption in 1998.</P>
      <P>I have previously outlined to the House details of the additional £500,000 which was allocated to inter-country adoption services in 1999. A sum of £213,000 of the total was allocated to the Eastern Health Board. In addition, I have recently outlined to the House the initiatives which that board has taken to improve the service for applicants for inter-country adoption which will assist in reducing both the waiting period for assessment to commence and the assessment itself, in addition to the recruitment of additional social workers. I would refer the Deputy to my previous reply in the House of 11 November 1999 in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="659" /> Based on the increase in staff assigned to assessment and the introduction of the standardised framework model, it is hoped that there will <Col N="660" /> be a significant improvement in the number of assessments being completed in the Eastern Health Board area during the year 2000.</P>

      <Quest>if, further to Parliamentary Question No. 71 on 11 November 1999, the EU Council Directive referred to requires the prescription classification of St. John's Wort.</Quest>
      <QRef>[24147/99]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>According to Council Directive 65/65/EEC, a medicinal product is defined as &ldquo;any substance or combination of substances presented for treating or preventing disease in human beings or animals.&rdquo;  This directive further states that &ldquo;any substance or combination of substances which may be administered to human beings or animals with a view to making a medical diagnosis or to restoring, correcting or modifying physiological functions in human beings or in animals is likewise considered a medicinal product.&rdquo;  Article 3 clarifies that no medicinal product may be marketed in a member state unless an authorisation has been issued by the competent authority of that member state.</P>
      <P>In general, herbal preparations are classified as medicinal products if they claim therapeutic or prophylactic indications. Thus, herbal preparations that are intended to be used as foods, cosmetics, etc., and are not intended or presented for treating, preventing or diagnosing diseases or restoring correcting or modifying physiological functions in humans would not be classified as medicinal products and therefore would not require product authorisations. The medical claims being made on behalf of products containing St John's Wort, hypericum perforatum, require that, in this country, in common with other countries in the European Union, they be regarded as a medicinal products. Such products therefore need product authorisations in order that they may be lawfully placed on the market.</P>
      <P>The Irish Medicines Board is the competent authority for the regulatory control of medicinal products in Ireland and under Directive 65/65/EEC it is required to establish proof of quality, safety and efficacy before granting access to the market for medicinal products. Following an application for product authorisation earlier this year, and having carried out a medical assessment, the Irish Medicines Board has recently formed the opinion that products containing St John's Wort should be subject to prescription only control and a recommendation in that regard was made to my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The criteria on which such decisions are based are included in EU Council Directive 92/26/EEC concerning the classifications for supply of medicinal products for human use and in forming its opinion, the board would have had regard to those criteria. A number of reasons has been given by the board for its recommendation. These include the fact that the products appear to act as monoamine oxidase inhibitors, MAOIs. These products must therefore be used with particular care because of risks of interactions, not just with other medicines, but also with certain foods. <Col N="662" /> Patients, therefore, may be at risk from hypertension, increased blood pressure, if these products were to be taken with certain other antidepressants, over-the-counter cough mixtures, sympathomimetics, and with foods rich in tyramine such as cheese, yeast extract and red wine. Side effects such as photosensitivity, gastrointestinal disturbances, fatigue and nervousness have also been reported. Furthermore, the board has expressed concern at the possible treatment of mild to moderate depression by use of an over the counter medicine. The board considers that the treatment of such a condition should be under medical supervision and that self diagnosis and self medication are inappropriate.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that the placing of any medicinal product under prescription only control is carried out in the interest of protecting public health and safety and where it is considered appropriate that such products should be used only under medical supervision and advice.</P>

      <P>The Southern Health Board understands that the sum of £63.70 mentioned by the Deputy was quoted by a private dentist who would carry out the work by private arrangement. However, the individual concerned chose not to have the work done privately.</P>

      <P>The provision of dental and orthodontic services and the maintenance of waiting lists are the statutory responsibility of the health boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="663" /> I understand from the South Eastern Health Board that their dental teams in the Kilkenny area are currently working on the 1998-99 school lists and there are 1,528 pupils awaiting screening and assessment for the provision of dental treatment as may be necessary. The health board dental service has had a high level of staff turnover which has impeded progress somewhat. However, the health board is continuing to endeavour to improve the service.</P>
    <P>The waiting list for orthodontic assessment in the Kilkenny area currently stands at eight months with a two year waiting time for treatment at Waterford Regional Hospital. In addition to the existing service, the board has recently arranged to have a dentist from Waterford Regional Hospital reassigned for two days per month to work in the Carlow-Kilkenny area and this should help to reduce the waiting list. The board is also considering making arrangements with a private practitioner to undertake additional sessions which would help to reduce the waiting list for treatments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Early)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 210 and 211 together.</P>
      <P>Adoption services in the South Eastern Health Board area are provided by SEEK Regional Adoption Services which forms part of the board's community care programme. This particular case is a matter for the South Eastern Health Board and I have referred it to the chief executive officer of the board for direct reply to Deputy McGuinness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have previously outlined to the House the waiting lists that exist for inter-country adoption assessment and the efforts being made to improve this situation following the publication of the report, Towards a Standardised Framework for Inter-country Adoption Assessment Procedures, in July 1999. Additional funding of £500,000 was provided to the health boards in 1999 for this purpose. Arising from the funding approved to the South Eastern Health Board an additional social <Col N="664" /> worker is being appointed to the Carlow-Kilkenny area.</P>
    <P>The report dealt specifically with the issue of second assessments. Good practice in this area is that the first child is placed with the couple and allowed to settle before the couple are assessed for a second child. The report recommends that such assessments should then be prioritised in the boards' lists. This is one of the many issues under consideration by the group charged with overseeing the implementation of the report's recommendations.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 215 and 216 together.</P>
      <P>Funding available for continuing post registration education of nurses is allocated to the relevant health agencies. In 1999 some £8.5 million will be spent on continuing nurse education. It is a matter for the agencies themselves to decide on the most effective use of these funds, having due regard to the educational needs of the nursing staff and the nature of the services in which they are involved. I do not have a separate fund at my disposal from which financial assistance could be given to supplement any sponsorship nurses might be in receipt of from the health agencies.</P>
      <P>A survey was conducted last year by my Department on the issue of sponsorship. All health boards, except for the Midland, sponsor students. The amount of sponsorship varies from health board to health board. My Department does not have any figures on the amount of nurses who have qualified. The following table sets out the total number of nurses who have received public health nurse sponsorship since 1995/96:</P>

    <P>Large numbers of health service personnel apply each year for third level courses, and as the Deputy will appreciate, it is simply not possible to provide financial support to every applicant. I understand, however, that students pursuing the Diploma in Public Health Nursing at the National University of Ireland, Cork and the National University of Ireland, Dublin, who are not in receipt of sponsorship from a health board may apply to their local authority for a means tested fees and maintenance grant under the terms of the higher education grants scheme.</P>
    <P>One of the recommendations in the report of Commission on Nursing is the setting up of nursing and midwifery planning and development units. In relation to continuing education, the commission recommended that these units would have responsibility for overseeing the detailed provision of continuing nursing and midwifery education within a health board area. Fees in respect of post-registration courses or bursaries to support students on post-registration courses, would be paid by the units according to the guidelines laid down by the National Council for the Professional Development in Nursing and Midwifery.</P>
    <P>I plan to establish the national council before the end of this month. Funding has already been provided to the health boards to allow for the establishment of the nursing and midwifery planning and development units.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may also wish to note that, as part of the recent settlement with nurses, agreement was reached on a structured programme for the <Col N="666" /> phased implementation of the Commission's report. One of the priority areas for attention under that programme is the &ldquo;Introduction of uniform criteria in relation to the provision of financial support to nurses or midwives undertaking post-registration education courses, in order to ensure equity.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The requirements laid down in section 13 of the Adoption Act, 1952, in regard to suitability of adopters are quite general: 13(i) The board shall not make an adoption order unless satisfied that the applicant is of good moral character, has sufficient means to support the child and is a suitable person to have parental rights and duties in respect of the child. 13(ii) Where the applicants are a married couple, the Board shall satisfy itself as to the moral character and suitability of each of them.</P>
      <P>There are no specific references to disability in existing adoption board guidance on assessment of couples for adoption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The assessment of prospective parents is carried out by health boards and adoption societies on behalf of the adoption board under our adop<Col N="667" /> tion legislation. Each case for assessment is dealt with on its own merits. It is likely that a decision to place a child, in domestic adoption, or to recommend approval of a couple to adopt abroad would have regard to the nature and severity of a person's disability and the support systems available to the prospective adopters. These factors would be considered in the context of the couples general suitability.</P>
    <P>I have spoken previously about the report Towards a Standardised Framework for Inter-Country Adoption Assessment Procedures. This report contains a detailed examination of the assessment process for inter-country adoption and makes recommendations for achieving a standardised process throughout the country. There are no recommendations in the report concerning applicants for adoption who have a physical disability.</P>

      <P>I am very much aware of the worthwhile work being done by a large number of very dedicated voluntary organisations, including the Adopted People's Association, in the complex area of adoption, tracing and reunion.</P>
      <P>As I have stated previously in the House, work is under way on the preparation of legislation in the area of adoption information, post-adoption contact and associated issues. The Office of the Attorney General is being consulted in the ongoing development of the content of the legislation and it is hoped to have the scheme of a Bill presented to Government as early as possible in the year 2000. As the Deputies will appreciate, I do not wish to grant aid individual voluntary groups at this point in time as it would be inappropriate of me to pre-empt the outcome of the legislative process.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the fact that the Adopted People's Association is anxious to see the establishment of a post-adoption services board or office as part of the planned legislation and this proposal is one of the many options which will be considered in due course, in the context of the administrative structures required to administer the provisions of the Act.</P>

    <P>Since coming into office, I have taken an integrated approach to the problem of waiting lists. As the Deputy will be aware, I commissioned a review of the waiting list initiative. I am now implementing a series of measures aimed at tackling the root causes of waiting lists. I allocated £20 million this year to agencies specifically to undertake waiting list work, with £3 million of this funding being allocated to the agencies which achieved the greatest improvements in their waiting lists in the first quarter of the year. This was in line with the recommendations of the review group report. I am confident that the measures I have taken in tackling waiting lists represents the best way of addressing the underlying causes of waiting lists and long waiting times.</P>
    <P>Waiting lists declined by 9 per cent in the first three quarters of this year. This was a significant improvement and demonstrated the progress made as a result of the integrated approach that I have taken in line with the review group's report.

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="671" /> The provision of medical services to eligible persons in County Mayo in this instance is the statutory responsibility of the Western Health Board. I understand that there are full facilities at Mayo General Hospital for the treatment of breast cancer including histology, radiology and chemotherapy and a joint programme is run with St Luke's clinic for the treatment of cancer patients. I also understand an oncology nurse has recently been appointed and the hospital is in the process of setting up an oncology unit. The board also states that there are three consultant surgeons with an interest in breast surgery at the hospital.</P>
    <P>I have asked the National Cancer Forum to advise me on the most appropriate way to develop diagnostic and treatment services for women with breast cancer. The forum is currently considering the issues involved and is expected to complete its report on the matter in the near future.</P>
    <P>The number of patients that attended the breast clinic during 1999 to date is set out in the following table.</P>

      <P>The report of the Commission on Nursing, A Blueprint for the Future, contains wide ranging recommendations for addressing the underlying problems within nursing. The Government has always been committed to implementing the commission's recommendations and good progress has been made to date in implementing some of the central recommendations of the commission.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that, as part of the recent settlement with nurses, the parties were able to reach agreement on a structured programme for the phased implementation of the commission's report. The agreed programme provides for the development of new roles and grading structures within nursing which will enhance the profession of nursing, improve service delivery, and help to address concerns among nurses about their relative lack of promotional outlets.</P>
      <P>The implementation programme also addresses other important issues affecting the nursing profession such as the empowerment of nurses and midwives, post-registration education and development, and the whole area of skill mix and effective use of the professional skills of nurses.</P>
      <P>At my meeting with the Nursing Alliance on 9 November, I invited the alliance to nominate representatives to a monitoring committee, as proposed by the commission, which would monitor progress in the implementation of the commission's report. This committee which will be composed of representatives of the Department of Health and Children, health service providers, the Nursing Alliance, and An Bord Altranais will ensure a partnership approach to the implementation of the commission's recommendations. The first meeting of the committee will take place early in December.</P>

      <Quest>the steps, if any, he has taken to respond to concerns regarding adverse side effects to the drug Roaccutane if he has met the RAGE group in this regard; the contact, if any, he has had with the Irish Medicines Board in this regard; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Irish Medicines Board is the competent authority for the regulatory control of medicinal products in Ireland.</P>
      <P>Roaccutane, isotretinoin, is a vitamin A derivative used in the treatment of acne. In Ireland, it is authorised by the Irish Medicines Board for the treatment of severe acne that is unresponsive to other treatments, and its availability is limited in that it must be prescribed and its use monitored by a consultant dermatologist. I am aware that there have been reports in Ireland in the past of possible adverse reactions to the drug, including two reports of suicide suspected in association with its use, one of which I understand refers to an Irish person who was resident in the UK and treated there.</P>
      <P>The Irish Medicines Board has in the past, and continues on an ongoing basis, to actively monitor all available data on roaccutane, including reports of adverse reactions, which it reviews both internally with its own experts and with the other European regulatory agencies. The board has also recently reviewed the terms of the authorisation for the product. As a result of this, revised wording for inclusion in the prescribing information for the product, outlining the current position regarding its use and warnings related to the possible development of psychiatric reactions, was agreed. The warnings refer to possible side effects including depression, psychotic symptoms and to rare reports of suicide associated with roaccutane. The revised warnings have been incorporated into the authorisation documents for the product and all physicians and pharmacists have been notified of the new warning regarding the use of roaccutane. Revised warnings have also been provided for in the package labelling and patient information leaflets. In addition, at the request of the IMB, the manufacturer has recently initiated a post-marketing surveillance programme to monitor all patient usage of roaccutane in Ireland. All data collected during this surveillance programme will be reviewed and analysed by the IMB and any further regulatory action required will be taken, as appropriate.</P>
      <P>While I have not met with the group referred to by the Deputy, I understand that the Irish Medicines Board has advised representatives of RAGE about the board's active involvement with this drug. I am satisfied the board continues to actively monitor the safety profile of the product concerned and I am assured the board will take any action that may be necessary having regard to the risk-benefit ratio relating to the product.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to concerns regarding illegal and inappropriate use of the drug rohypnol; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Flunitrazepam, which is the active ingredient in rohypnol, has been classified as a schedule three drug in this country since 1993. The drug was reclassified in 1993 in response to reports of misuse and its rescheduling makes it more difficult for drug misusers to get access to it. The regulations also require that doctors prescribing rohypnol abide by the special prescription writing requirements and rohypnol should be stored in a controlled drugs cabinet in accordance with the Safe Custody Regulations 1982. Under the terms of the Misuse of Drugs Acts 1977 and 1984 I may issue a special direction prohibiting prescribing by practitioners or pharmacists convicted of offences under these Acts.</P>
      <P>Since rohypnol may only be obtained on foot of a prescription from a medical practitioner there is a need for a greater awareness among medical practitioners of the problems which can arise when rohypnol or other controlled drugs are prescribed in an inappropriate fashion. My Department's chief medical officer has written various letters to general practitioners concerning the need to exercise caution when prescribing controlled drugs. The most recent letter was issued on 30 August and specifically referred to the prescribing of benzodiazepines, into which drug category rohypnol falls.</P>
      <P>My Department will continue to review the prescribing of rohypnol in consultation with the Irish College of General Practitioners and other specialist groups to determine whether action should be taken to curb the inappropriate use of rohypnol.</P>

      <P>The provision of orthodontic services and the maintenance of waiting lists for treatment are the statutory responsibility of the health boards. The orthodontic services continue to be developed in accordance with the dental health action plan. The action plan provides for the development by each health board of a consultant-led orthodontic service which ensures a service of high quality <Col N="675" /> and high service levels. My Department has made additional resources available to the health boards to assist with the development of their orthodontic services in accordance with the dental health action plan.</P>
      <P>The Eastern Health Board has made significant reductions in their waiting lists and waiting times for orthodontic assessment since the introduction of a consultant-led service in September 1996. The board is continuing its efforts to effect further improvements in the service and in this regard a second regional orthodontic unit will be developed in Dublin South East. I have approved a capital grant of £1.065 million for this purpose. I am also considering proposals from the board for the development of a further regional orthodontic unit to be sited on the campus of Beaumont Hospital. The development of these units will make a significant contribution to the orthodontic service in the Eastern Health Board area.</P>

      <P>Officials from my Department and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform are members of the management board of the European monitoring centre on drugs and drug addiction. At an operational level the Health Research Board is the focal point for providing Irish information on drug misuse to the centre.</P>
      <P>Projects initiated by the centre during 1999 include a network of modelling costs of drug use and cost-effectiveness of interventions. Through this project the EMCDDA has created an expert network for estimating costs of problem drug use and cost-effectiveness of interventions using dynamic models. The network on costs consist of three working groups, one on epidemiological and social aspects, one on dynamic modelling and one on economic aspects. The work initially concentrated on the health costs of hepatitis C, B and HIV, while the work will be extended to cover all social costs of all aspects of drug use. The centre, as well as using EU data will also link with US experts in the field. The timespan for the project is December 1998-December 2000. This specialist project is at the initial stages of developing methodologies to estimate the impact and costs of various aspects of the drug problem.</P>

A more comprehensive circular dealing with all the legal implications of consent to medical treatment for foster children is being finalised in the Department and will be issued shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the circular that has already been issued it was made clear that foster parents have the capacity to consent to emergency medical treatment the purpose of which is to preserve the life or health of the child. In any event, in an emergency situation, the doctor is entitled to intervene on his own authority, without the consent of a person in <i>loco parentis</i>. Such an emergency does not need to be so grave as to threaten the child's life before consent can be implied. A doctor is, at a minimum, entitled to give emergency treatment <Col N="678" /> for the purposes of preserving, not only the life, but also the health of a person who is incapable of consenting. In emergency cases, the law gives reasonable latitude to a doctor who takes such measures as his clinical judgment dictates in the interests of the patient's welfare.</P>
    <P>Foster parents are also entitled to administer, or consent to the administration of first aid to children in their care. This would include cleaning and dressing cuts and scrapes, bandaging sprains and any other similarly routine treatment.</P>
    <P>In relation to the issue of indemnifying foster parents for the purposes of consent given for medical treatment to children under their care, I would point out to the Deputy a working group on foster care is examining all aspects of foster care, including this issue. The group is due to report early in the New Year. I will therefore await the recommendations of the group on the matter.</P>

      <P>Under the Health Act 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board. Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer are unable, without undue hardship, to provide general practitioner, medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants.</P>
      <P>Income guidelines have been drawn up by the chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these guidelines are revised annually in line with the consumer price index. However, the guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that his-her medical needs would justify this. Medical cards may also be awarded to individual family members on this basis.</P>
      <P>In view of this special provision, I do not feel it justifiable, nor did previous Governments on health policy grounds, to extend an automatic entitlement to a medical card to any specific group without any reference to their means or, in the case of children, to their parents' means, as a general rule. It is, of course, open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board for health services if they are unable to provide these services for themselves or their dependants without hardship.</P>

      <P>I refer to my answer to Question No. 163 on Wednesday 10 November 1999 in relation to the issue of unfinished estates which may be of assistance to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The construction of new developments including housing estates must be carried out in accordance with a grant of planning permission including any conditions which may be imposed as part of a grant of permission. Failure to comply with a grant of permission is an offence. I have no function regarding how developments are advertised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Planning and Development Bill 1999 which is currently before the Seanad includes updated and strengthened provisions regarding the enforcement of planning law. The Bill when enacted will also enable a planning authority to refuse to grant permission to a developer based on past performance, subject to the consent of the High Court. These measures will be effective in <Col N="680" /> ensuring that planning law is respected and enforced where necessary.</P>

      <P>All of the 4,500 starts or acquisitions available under the local authority housing programme were allocated to local authorities on 15 January last. Figures for the actual number of starts achieved and houses completed or acquired in 1999 in each local authority will not be available in my Department until early next year.</P>
      <P>Based on current indications, however, I expect the total number of local authority houses to be commenced or acquired this year will be in the order of 4,000 and that authorities will complete or acquire about 3,700 houses. Most local authorities are in a position to reach their target of starts by the end of the year. Any authorised house starts not commenced by the end of the year will commence early in the new year and will not be lost to the programme. Due to the nature of an annual programme most of the starts authorised for a current year do not usually start until the last quarter of the year. Therefore, practically all local authority house starts are completed in the year following the allocation of the starts and few houses with the exception of acquisitions, are completed in the year in which the start is allocated. When the programme is in a period of expansion, as is currently the case, completions tend, therefore, to lag behind starts.</P>
      <P>My Department has agreed to requests, from a small number of authorities whose current programmes are well advanced, for additional houses to be started in the current year. The authorities concerned are Galway, Laois, Meath, Offaly and South Dublin County Councils.</P>

      <P>It is estimated that there are approximately 900 bed places available for homeless people in hostels in the Dublin city area. In addition bed and breakfast accommodation is also used to accommodate homeless people. In 1998, there were 819 instances where bed and breakfast accommodation was availed of by the Eastern Health Board on behalf of Dublin Corporation.</P>
      <P>Information on the quality and conditions of individual hostel and bed and breakfast accommodation is not available in my Department. However much of the hostel accommodation which is operated by voluntary bodies has been newly built or redeveloped over the past ten years or so with the assistance of funding under the voluntary housing capital assistance scheme while hostel accommodation operated directly by the corporation has been acquired and-or redeveloped with capital funding from my Department. It is understood that Dublin Corporation has initiated an examination of all bed and breakfast accommodation currently being utilised to ensure that it is of a satisfactory standard.</P>
      <P>As hostel accommodation is used as a combination of emergency and transitional or long-term accommodation separate figures are not available in my Department on occupancy rates by different category. I understand that hostels are generally full.</P>

Actual recoupment paid up to 31 October was £4.817 million in respect of homeless people and £8.020 million in respect of asylum seekers. I expect that the overall provision will be fully expended.</P>

      <P>An annual grant of £877,000 was paid by my Department to the National Safety Council in 1999 as a contribution towards the administration of the council and the provision of services in relation to fire, road and water safety. The allocation of funds to the promotion of fire safety is a matter for the council.</P>
      <P>From 1 June 1992 up to 1 July 1998, all new dwellings, including new local authority dwellings, were required to be fitted with battery operated smoke alarms. This was superseded on 1 July 1998 by a requirement that all new dwellings be fitted with mains operated smoke alarms. My Department has also suggested to local authorities that they should consider providing smoke alarms and taking the necessary steps through guidance etc. to ensure that these alarms are properly installed and maintained in the dwellings of their tenants generally. This is a matter primarily for each local authority as part of the management of its rented housing stock and it is not intended that my Department should exercise detailed supervision of this process.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 312 of 16 November 1999 in which I outlined significant improvements to the terms and conditions of the disabled persons grants scheme which I introduced in December last.</P>
      <P>As I indicated, in the case of local authority rented houses a disabled persons grant covers the full cost of the approved works subject to an effective maximum grant payable of £12,000. A grant totalling three-quarters of the approved cost of the works, compared to two-thirds previously, is now payable in respect of private houses, subject to the overall effective maximum grant.</P>
      <P>In cases where an applicant faces a difficulty in meeting their portion of the total cost of the works involved, local authorities may assist through the provision of a house improvement loan. If the applicant cannot afford to avail of the loan scheme due to the cost of servicing a loan, it would be open to the authority to provide the full cost of the works under the scheme of improvement works in lieu of local authority housing, subject to the applicant being approved for local authority housing.</P>
      <P>The full cost of urgently necessary house improvement works is also available to elderly persons under the task force on special housing aid for the elderly. The scheme is funded by my Department and operated by the health boards. I have allocated record funding of £7 million to the task force for 2000.</P>

      <P>I am not aware of the origin or accuracy of the reports referred to.</P>
      <P>Incineration has been widely employed as a waste treatment option for decades. Over that period, thermal treatment technologies have developed significantly and are capable of greatly improved environmental performance. Within the EU and further afield, a significant number of older incineration facilities, which could not comply with modern environmental standards, or could not economically be upgraded so to do, have been closed.</P>
      <P>EU Environment Ministers recently agreed a common position on a proposed Directive on the incineration of waste, which will consolidate and extend the scope of several existing Directives in this area. The proposed Directive provides for stringent operational conditions and emission standards including, for the first time, a specific emission limit value of 0.1 ng/Nm3 for dioxins and furans. The European Commission estimates that the implementation of this Directive will result in a 99 per cent reduction in emissions of dioxins and furans from waste incineration (relative to 1993/1995), and anticipates that the contribution of municipal and clinical waste incineration to overall emissions of dioxins and furans in Europe would be reduced to 0.3 per cent, assuming the output of other sources remains unchanged.</P>

      <P>The aim of the national fuel scheme (NFS) is to assist householders who are on long-term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs. A payment of £5 per week, £8 per week in smokeless fuel zones, is paid to eligible households for 26 weeks from mid October to mid April regardless of the temperature.</P>
      <P>The conditions that apply to the national fuel scheme require that a person must be in receipt of a qualifying payment, satisfy a means test and satisfy the living alone condition.</P>
      <P>To satisfy the living alone condition a person must be either living alone or with, a dependant spouse or partner, a dependant child, a carer for the applicant, a person in receipt of a qualifying payment from my Department or a person in receipt of short-term unemployment assistance.</P>
      <P>If the applicant has a combined household income of over £30 per week in excess of the relevant maximum contributory pension or savings of over £22,400 or is living in a household with a person in a category that is not provided for in the living alone conditions set out above, then the applicant is not eligible for a fuel allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any change to the qualifying conditions would have cost implications and could only be considered in a budgetary context. Improvements in <Col N="689" /> the national fuel scheme cannot be looked at in isolation from the improvements in the primary weekly payment rates. Substantial increases in all the social welfare primary payments of either £3 or £6 per week into effective in June 1999.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 266, 267, 273, 274 and 282 together.</P>
      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme provides for a weekly or monthly supplement to be paid in respect of rent or mortgage interest supplement to any person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs. The scheme is administered on behalf of my Department by the health boards and my Department has no function in deciding entitlement in individual cases.</P>
      <P>Rent and mortgage interest supplements are normally calculated to ensure that the person, after the payment of rent has an income equal to the SWA basic weekly payment rate, less £6. This £6 represents the minimum contribution which recipients are required to pay from their own resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>SWA is subject to a means test and is not ordinarily payable to people in full time employment. However, special arrangements were introduced some years ago to enable people making the transition from welfare to work to retain rent or <Col N="690" /> mortgage interest supplement, subject to certain conditions.</P>
    <P>Under the rules of the community employment scheme participants are paid a set weekly wage which is generally greater than the equivalent social welfare payment for a person in similar household circumstances. In the case of people who were previously unemployed, this weekly wage is paid instead of unemployment assistance. In the case of lone parents, the weekly wage is paid in addition to the one-parent family payment in recognition of the fact that lone parents need additional supports. These arrangements take into account the special needs and requirements of lone parents raising children and maintaining households on their own.</P>
    <P>In addition, CE participants may retain their entitlement to rent and mortgage interest supplements, subject to certain conditions. Participants must contribute a standard minimum contribution of £7.50 per week towards their accommodation costs, their gross household income must not exceed £250 per week and their rent or mortgage interest supplementation is subject to a maximum payment of £250 per month.</P>
    <P>Participants are also required to contribute any assessable means in excess of the appropriate basic supplementary welfare allowance rate towards their rent/mortgage interest supplement.</P>
    <P>My Department is aware that these arrangements are no longer fully adequate for some households, particularly for families with dependant children, given the large increases in housing costs in recent years.</P>
    <P>The conditions for retention of rent and mortgage interest supplements, including the income limits and the ceilings on the amounts payable, are currently being reviewed in consultation with the social partners under Partnership 2000.</P>
    <P>With regard to child care, the bringing forward of significant initiatives in budget 2000 and subsequent budgets to respond to the child care and child support needs of families are important priorities in the review of the action programme. The Ministerial Group on Child Care, of which I am a member, is considering the findings of the interdepartmental committee which recently reported to Government.</P>

      <P>As part of its research for the working group examining the treatment of married, cohabiting and one-parent families under the tax and social welfare codes, which was chaired by my Department, the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) undertook some work in relation to the cost of children in two adult households.</P>
      <P>This is published in &ldquo;Household Composition, Living Standards and Needs&rdquo; (1999), ESRI Working Paper No. 106. The Combat Poverty Agency has also published material on this subject, &ldquo;The Cost of a Child&rdquo;, (1994).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Child income support policy in recent years has sought to ensure that the supports provided by the State are more neutral <i>vis-à-vis</i> the employment status of the parents. Increases in child support in recent budgets have therefore been focused on child benefit which does not act as a disincentive to taking up employment or improving wages. Child benefit is also widely accepted as a very effective mechanism in tackling poverty as it channels resources directly to families with <Col N="692" /> children and is of particular importance to families on low incomes.</P>
    <P>The question of improving child support payments is being considered in the context of the forthcoming budget.</P>

In addition, they may retain their entitlement to rent/mortgage interest supplements, subject to certain conditions. Participants must contribute a standard minimum contribution of £7.50 per week towards their accommodation costs, their gross household income must not exceed £250 per week and their rent or mortgage interest supplementation is subject to a maximum payment of £250 per month. Participants are also required to contribute any assessable means in excess of the appropriate basic supplementary welfare allowance rate towards their rent/mortgage interest supplement.</P>
    <P>If the person in question were to take up a place on a CE scheme she would receive approximately £100 per week in addition to her one-parent family payment (OFP) of 103.90. However, her rent supplement would be reduced from £98.50 to £57.70 per week. She should retain her OFP in full and gain almost £60 per week. She may have to meet additional child care expenses, however.</P>
    <P>I recognise that the limit of £57.70 per week or £250 per month on the amount of rent supplement which is payable in these cases can act as a disincentive to people taking up offers of community employment.</P>
    <P>In that regard, the conditions for retention of rent and mortgage interest supplements, including the income limits and the ceilings on the amounts payable, are currently being reviewed in consultation with the social partners under Partnership 2000.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 275 to 278, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>My Department provides information on all aspects of social welfare in a variety of ways. Inquiries relating to specific social welfare schemes received in writing, by telephone or from personal callers may be handled at local level or by the relevant offices or sections responsible for administering the particular services in question. Information is also available from each of the Department's 57 local offices and 69 branch offices throughout the country. There are also two public offices in Dublin.</P>
      <P>In the main scheme areas and in local offices, staff are assigned by local management to meet local demand and it is therefore not possible to give a precise count of the total staff members engaged solely in information duties at any time.</P>
      <P>Statistics relating to the number of inquiries are not maintained on a Department-wide basis. It is estimated that more than 200,000 operator-assisted telephone calls are received each month but this does not include calls to local offices, inspectors or where the caller uses a direct number provided in connection with a specific application or published in reference to particular schemes. Many other information initiatives are taken every year for example, in the period immediately after the annual budget, between two and three thousand calls are received <i>via</i> a special central freephone service.</P>
      <P>An analysis of calls show that they span the full range of social welfare services. Issues of primary concern to callers include matters relating to sickness payments, pensions, one parent family payments and employment support programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The National Social Service Board, an agency under the aegis of my Department, has received increased funding in recent years, including additional amounts towards the cost of developing 35 key centres within it's network of more than 80 citizens information centres throughout the country and the development of a comprehensive computerised information database to support almost 400 information providers. The total allocation for 1999 was £4,375,000. Legislation is now at an advanced stage for the establishment of a new body, to be known as Comhairle, which is being formed through a merger of the NSSB and certain functions of the National Rehabilitation Board. This new mainstream body will support improved information, <Col N="695" /> advice and advocacy services for all people including those with disabilities.</P>
    <P>In addition, about £465,000 was directly provided in 1998 by my Department to assist other organisations engaged in the provision of information and advice on social services.</P>

      <P>The position is that child dependant allowances are payable in respect of all children up to the age of 18 years.  Where a claimant is in receipt of a long-term social welfare payment, child dependant allowances are payable where children are in full-time education up to the age of 22 years, or up to the end of the academic year after the 22nd birthday. This applies to long-term payments only; it does not apply to short-term payments such as disability benefit, unemployment benefit, short-term unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare allowance. Former community employment workers who qualify for unemployment benefit are accordingly not entitled to the continued payment of child dependant allowances for children aged over 18 and in full-time education.</P>
      <P>The more favourable treatment of people on long-term payments is in recognition of the fact that families with children on long-term payments face a higher risk of poverty.</P>
      <P>The question of extending entitlement to child dependant allowances to short-term welfare claimants on the same basis as applies to long-term welfare claimants, including claimants of unemployment benefit, is a matter for consideration in a budgetary context.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 280 and 281 together.</P>
      <P>Social insurance is a means of providing a social contract between employers, employees, the self-employed and the State. Contributions are made by people to the Social Insurance Fund according to their ability to pay, when they are economically active. These contributions not only fund the pensions of an earlier generation of contributors but also provide a range of benefits to current contributors who are unable to work due to various contingencies &ndash; such as illness or unemployment. Entitlement to additional benefits such as dental or optical treatments is also a feature of the social insurance system.</P>
      <P>As a person accumulates contributions these may ensure entitlement to a range of benefits one of which is a contributory pension. Therefore, the question of provision for retrospective entitlement through payment of a lump sum, as suggested by the Deputy, does not arise and I have no plans to change the current arrangements.</P>
      <P>Where a person enters social insurance after reaching 55 years in the case of retirement pension and 56 years in the case of the old age contributory pension then the person may, subject to certain conditions, be entitled to a refund of the pension element of their PRSI contributions &ndash; provided that they do not qualify for an Old Age (non-contributory) pension.</P>
      <P>I have highlighted my commitment to broadening contributory pensions coverage to as many categories as possible. With this in mind, and as the Deputy may be aware, the Department is, at present, finalising the first part of a review of the qualifying conditions for the old age contributory and retirement pensions, which is in line with this Government's commitment to address the issue of people who fail marginally to qualify for an old age contributory pension. The first phase of this review is, therefore, paying particular attention to the operation of the yearly average qualifying condition, as well as the commitment given in An Action Programme for the Millennium to provide a mechanism to allow women who take time out for family reasons to continue contributions for pension purposes. However, as the Deputy will appreciate, any changes to the fundamental basis of a scheme involves a cost factor and, as with all improvements to social welfare schemes, these have to be considered in a budgetary context and in the light of available resources.</P>

      <P>My Department is committed to improving the quality of service to its customers, particularly in relation to the timely processing and payment of claims.</P>
      <P>In this regard, targets for the processing of claims have been set. The targets take account of the requirements of speed, accuracy and effective customer service, economy and efficiency in the use of resources, and the application of effective controls to guard against abuse.</P>
      <P>The targets which have been set also take account of the fact that some claims take longer than others to process because, for example, necessary information may be difficult to obtain. Claims requiring a means test of their nature take longer to process. The present targets for unemployment payments are expressed in terms of the time elapsed between the registration of the claim at the local office and the authorisation of the claim for payment. The targets are: unemployment benefit &ndash; 85 per cent of claims to be authorised within two working weeks; unemployment assistance &ndash; 70 per cent of claims to be authorised within two working weeks.</P>
      <P>The performance for 1999 to date shows that 76 per cent of unemployment benefit claims and 62 per cent of unemployment assistance claims are being processed within their respective target times. Some 90 per cent of unemployment benefit claims are authorised within four weeks, while 90% of unemployment assistance claims are authorised within six weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department endeavours to use the resources available to it as effectively as possible in delivering the wide range of schemes and services for which it is responsible. Staff and other resources are redeployed to meet requirements arising from changing volumes of work in the different scheme areas. Staffing levels are kept under review and as the numbers of unemployed <Col N="698" /> customers decline, there will be an opportunity to enhance the level of service provided to customers generally.  </P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 285 to 287, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I have arranged for Dúchas, the Heritage Service of my Department to provide the Deputy with a copy of the scientific statement directly. The relevant dune expert together with the relevant administrative staff in Dúchas prepared this statement. The statement is a justification of the boundary adopted for the Carrowmore Dunes candidate SAC site. The site was proposed as a dune SAC. It also contains other interests, including <i>V. angustior</i>. The protection of the dune habitat in this area will also ensure the conservation of the mollusc. The statement was prepared in March 1999 and provided to An Bord Pleanála in April 1999. The position of <i>V. angustior</i> was dealt with in the environmental impact assessment and was the subject of special conditions relating to its protection imposed on the developer by An Bord Pleanála.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The criteria referred to by the Deputy set out that the literature be reviewed, that the sites be <Col N="699" /> visited and that, following site visits, all sites be proposed for SAC designation, other than where habitat deterioration has occurred to such an extent that the survival of the species cannot be ensured. In implementing those criteria, it has been practice to exclude land where the population numbers are unsustainable or where Annex 1 habitat is not present.</P>
    <P>The <i>V. angustior</i> report the Deputy refers to found that &ldquo;Any invertebrate known from &ldquo;5 or less&rdquo; 10km squares in the State would automatically be classified as threatened with extinction, so protection of these nine sites plus Doonbeg could not be regarded as providing any more than a minimal population resource.&rdquo;. The nine sites, together with the Carrowmore Dunes candidate SAC, provide evidence of the species in much more than the level suggested as appropriate to be classified as threatened with extinction, (i.e. &ldquo;five or less&rdquo; ten km squares).</P>
    <P>I understand that Dúchas management examined that report, its recommendations and the recommendations of its own invertebrate expert, and following discussion came to the following conclusions:</P>
    <P>1.The Whitestrand/Carrowmore Marsh candidate SAC was originally proposed as a dune habitat site; however only the Carrowmore Dunes candidate SAC had an intact dune system.</P>
    <P>2.The mollusc is present in the proposed NHA and the candidate SAC.</P>
    <P>3.All other candidate SAC sites proposed for the mollusc also contained habitats listed in the Habitats Directive.</P>
    <P>4.The report stated that properly managed golf course is preferable to the then current land usage from the perspective of the mollusc.</P>
    <P>5.A sufficient number of sites were already proposed for this species for inclusion in the Natura 2000 Network to meet the requirements of the Directive.</P>
    <P>6.The maintenance of the favourable conservation status of <i>V. angustior</i> at Doonbeg could be more readily guaranteed by entering into a management agreement with a single owner, with a substantial vested interest in ensuring its protection, rather than applying legal constraints to a larger number of landowners with no vested interest.</P>
    <P>Accordingly it was decided to retain the Carrowmore Dunes site as a candidate SAC, with the additional interest of <i>V. angustior</i> included in the Natura 2000 form, and to safeguard <i>V. angustior</i> in the area of the proposed development through a management agreement with the developers. The actual date of the decision is not recorded. The developers have agreed to enter into an appropriate management agreement with Dúchas to ensure the protection of <i>V. angustior</i> in the area proposed for development.</P>

      <P>I can confirm that I received the letter dated 12 November to which the Deputy refers. It concerns the staffing levels and resources within the State service which controls archaeological licensing and related planning matters.</P>
      <P>The workload relating to the archaeological functions performed by my Department has increased dramatically in recent years. This has been particularly acute in the areas of planning and development and in applications for archaeological licensing as building activity in the State has been continuously expanding.</P>
      <P>However, the Deputy may rest assured that I am fully aware of my responsibilities to preserve our archaeological heritage and I am committed to providing an efficient professional service to all our customers. My Department is currently examining, in the context of the proposed national heritage plan, means through which we would seek to make greater use of the resource available across all sectors of archaeology through, for example, using strategic partnerships with local authorities, who are already vested with primary responsibility for planning and development. I am confident that these measures alone will contribute significantly to the better management of the archaeological resource within the State.</P>
      <P>Finally, a question has been raised by the organisation referred to regarding persons engaged on temporary contracts for service. This matter and a number of other issues relating to staffing in Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department, are currently under discussion within the normal Civil Service industrial relations framework and I would not like to make any statement that might prejudice the outcome of these discussions. As an interim measure many contracts are being renewed on a three-monthly basis. The legal position is that those engaged on a contract for service are not employees.</P>

      <P>The issue raised by the Deputy is the day-to-day responsibility of the RTE authority and I have no statutory function in the matter.</P>
      <P>However, in accordance with long-standing custom, I am prepared to furnish to the House information supplied by RTE in response to questions relating specifically to improvements in reception of RTE's national broadcasting services.</P>
      <P>RTE states that the reception of Raidio na Gaeltachta in the Listowel area is marginal. RTE further states that as part of its network coverage improvement plan, it is currently negotiating with a third party to install a radio transmitter which will provide improved raidio coverage of Radio 1, 2FM, Raidio na Gaeltachta and Lyric FM in the Listowel area.        </P>

      <P>Under the law as it stands in the Data Protection Act, 1988, a person found guilty of an offence, including the offence of disclosing personal data obtained without authority, is liable, on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding £1,000, and on conviction on indictment, to a fine not exceeding £50,000. The report of the Data Protection Commissioner referred to by the Deputy makes no proposal for increasing the penalties provided for in the Act. However, my Department shall keep the penalties under review in consultation with the commissioner.</P>
      <P>In so far as codes of practice are concerned, the Act of 1988 already represents a code of practice generally for the processing of personal data. The Act in addition makes express provision for specific codes of practice to be drawn up on an administrative basis and in this connection requires the Data Protection Commissioner to encourage trade associations and other bodies representing data controllers or data processors to prepare those codes for the guidance of their members. I have no general function in the drawing up of such codes other than to arrange for copies of them when made to be laid before each House, but I shall arrange to bring to the attention of the Department of Public Enterprise the suggestion made by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the director general of the Irish Prisons Service that recruitment of prison officers has been ongoing since October 1997 and is expected to continue until mid-2000. The campaign, which is run by the Civil Service Commission, was initiated to cater for the new prisons coming on stream, to fill shortfalls which existed and to cater for future natural wastage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was decided in late 1997 to commission a firm of occupational psychologists to carry out a job analysis of the role of the prison officer. Such an analysis would identify the key competencies required for the role of the prison officer. The analysis was delivered in spring 1998. One of its objectives was to indicate a range of suitable techniques for use by the Civil Service Commission in open recruitment. A competition was advertised in April 1998 from which the Civil Service Commission is in the process of recruiting. So far approximately 430 prison officers have been recruited from this competition and a further intake of about 120 is planned. It is anticipated that this recruitment will continue until well into the year 2000. This recruitment programme will meet the staffing needs arising from the opening of the new prisons at Cloverhill, Mountjoy women's prison and the midlands prison &ndash; Portlaoise. At this stage, the Civil Service Com<Col N="716" /> mission plan to hold the next competition early in 2001.</P>

      <P>It would appear that the Deputy is referring to a decision which was reached in 1994, to make unsocial hours allowances payable to gardaí This was done as part of a restructuring agreement reached at the Garda conciliation council under the local bargaining clause of the Programme for Economic and Social Partnership &ndash; PESP &ndash; and was in return for agreement by the relevant Garda associations to contribute to flexibility and change within the force. The agreement did not provide for the extension of pensionability of unsocial hours allowances to Garda pensioners who retired before 1 January 1993.</P>
      <P>Garda pensioners who retired before 1 January 1993 however, benefited from a 1997 Government decision which set a floor increase of 3% to those pensioners who did not benefit from the local bargaining clause of the PESP and the Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Concerning the Garda pension scheme generally, the Deputy will be aware that the Commission on Public Service Pensions, was established in February 1996 to examine and report on the pension terms of public servants, including members of the Garda Síochána. I understand <Col N="717" /> that the commission hopes to finalise its report later this year or early next year.</P>

      <P>Bray is one of six locations that have been prioritised for the installation of Garda CCTV systems as an aid for policing by the CCTV advisory committee. The list of locations, in alphabetical order, is as follows: Bray, Cork, Dublin South Central, Dundalk, Finglas and Limerick.</P>
      <P>The extension of the Garda CCTV system in Dublin to include Grafton Street and its surrounding streets, Dublin South Central, and the provision of a CCTV system in Cork city are the CCTV projects currently being undertaken.</P>
      <P>A shortage of technicians in the telecommunications section of the Garda Síochána, who are responsible for the planning and implementation of town centre Garda CCTV systems, has impacted on the progress in implementing CCTV systems in each of the six prioritised locations, including Bray. I am having this problem addressed as a matter of urgency through the recruitment of 27 additional technicians. The recruitment process is now almost complete and 18 new technicians have been appointed. However, given training needs and so forth, it will be some months before the new technicians will be available to commence work on new projects in the telecommunications area, including CCTV.</P>
      <P>It is not, therefore, possible at this time to give an indication of exactly when a Garda CCTV system will be installed in Bray as this is dependant on a number of factors including the availability of technical personnel, financial resources, the tendering requirements and, of course, the need for such systems to be integrated into Garda operational procedures. I can, however, confirm that it is intended to commence the planning and implementation of Garda CCTV systems in each of the prioritised locations, including Bray, as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>The person referred to by the Deputy is serving seven years for possession of firearms and ammunition and is not due for release with remission until April 2001.</P>
      <P>Each application for temporary release is examined on its own merit. Although the person concerned has severed his subversive links and declared himself to be non-aligned, numerous other factors have to be taken into account when considering the issue of temporary release. Before granting temporary release careful consideration is given to a number of factors, including the nature and seriousness of the offence, previous record, behaviour in custody, length of sentence served, and any compassionate grounds which merit special consideration. The overriding concern when decisions are being made in individual cases is the safety of the public. While I am not in a position to authorise temporary release at present, his case is kept under constant review.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy knows, the divisional headquarters was recently moved from Fitzgibbon Street Garda station to the newly built Store Street. This relieved pressure at Fitzgibbon Street. I am aware, nevertheless, that Fitzgibbon Street is in need of refurbishment, but it will have to take its place on the Garda building and maintenance programmes in that regard.</P>

    <P>*The new female prison at Mountjoy, which will be operational shortly, will have a bed capacity of 80. This will free up 60 spaces which will revert to St. Patrick's Institution .</P>
    <P>**The first batch of work party prisoners moved in to Cloverhill last Wednesday. The population of the prison will be increased on a phased basis.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="722" /> It is policy to have single cell occupancy for sentenced prisoners. However, the rise in committals in recent years has necessitated multiple occupancy of single cells in some of the closed prisons, particularly Mountjoy, Cork, St. Patrick's, Limerick and the Curragh.</P>
    <P>Prisoners frequently actually seek to double-up to avoid being lonely. They do so especially if they are in prison for the first time. Prisoners often ask to share a cell with a friend or relative in custody and such requests are facilitated where possible. Doubling up may also occur from time to time if there is a concern about the physical-mental health of a prisoner.</P>
    <P>The total number serving a sentence on Friday, 19 November was 3,061. This is made up of 2,782 in custody and 279 on temporary release. Statistics are maintained in a manual format and consequently, the time required to collate the information sought by the Deputy in relation to whether these sentences are for criminal offences or not cannot be justified. However, this type of information should be readily available once the new prisoners record database which is part of a £6 million IT system currently being devised is introduced and becomes fully operational in the entire prison system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have outlined before in the House the three essential components to the Government's &ldquo;zero tolerance&rdquo; approach to crime. First, a clear and determined focus on tackling those who are engaged in crime. Second, a determination that the law enforcement agencies will be properly equipped and resourced to deal with crime. Third, a commitment to address, and where possible to ameliorate, the causes of crime.</P>
      <P>As regards the targeting of particular criminal activity, the Deputy will be aware of the Criminal Justice Act, 1999. This is a flagship measure in my extensive programme of criminal law reform, and further proof of the Government's zero tolerance approach to crime &ndash; an approach which all the available evidence vindicates, not least the unprecedented reductions which have been taking place in the crime area. An aggressive policy is being pursued by the Garda Síochána in obtaining evidence to bring drug traffickers before the courts. This has led to significant seizures of illegal drugs, the disruption of organised networks and the charging of major criminals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recently established the State's first ever national crime council to continue this open approach to crime policy development, and I will also be publishing a White Paper on crime and <Col N="723" /> the criminal justice system in 2000 to address the priority issues for the future.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that I recently launched the independent Courts Service, that I am pursuing a similar course of action in relation to the prisons service. As the Deputy may be aware the process of implementing the recommendations of an SMI review of the Garda Síochána is also under way. Never before have these components of the criminal justice system been the subject of such fundamental review.</P>
    <P>The estimates recently published by the Government for the year 2000 show that, for the first time ever, spending in the justice area, will exceed £1 billion pounds. As the Deputy will appreciate this level of investment is unprecedented and will pay dividends in the fight against crime.</P>

These year 2000-compliant systems are being rolled out to Garda stations throughout the country, 39 are ready at present and it is intended that they will be made available at 205 locations in the coming months.</P>

      <P>The Maternity Protection Act, 1994, makes provision for the grant of 14 weeks maternity leave; four weeks additional maternity leave; and, where warranted, health <Col N="724" /> and safety leave to expectant mothers and to mothers who have recently given birth. These statutory entitlements arise primarily from the necessity to protect working women around the time of the birth of a child. The leave gives indirectly an opportunity for the integration of a new baby into the household.</P>
      <P>The Adoptive Leave Act, 1995, extends leave arrangements to adopting mothers and sole male adopters in line with those which are available to a natural mother at the time of the birth and addresses a specific anomaly in our treatment of adoptive mothers as compared with natural mothers.</P>

      <P>The Operational Programme for Tourism, 1994-99, includes provision for 33 million ecu, approximately £26 million, in European Regional Development Fund grant aid for the construction of a conference centre in Dublin capable of handling up to 2,000 delegates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the failure of processes in 1995 and 1996 to secure an appropriate proposal, a new tender procedure, organised by Bord Fáilte, under the direction of the independent management board for product development, and conducted in accordance with EU Council Directive <Col N="725" /> 93/37/EEC, was launched in September 1997. This process culminated in June 1998 in the selection of the proposal submitted by Spencer Dock International Convention Centre Limited, to go forward for European Regional Development Fund grant-aid to develop the conference centre at a site in Dublin's docklands. The proposal was then subjected to an independent cost benefit analysis.</P>
    <P>In September 1998, the Government agreed to the making of a submission to the European Commission recommending formal approval for a 33 million ecu European Regional Development Fund grant towards the cost of developing the project. The Commission's approval, in principle, for the grant was notified in November 1998 subject to resolution of an outstanding procedural complaint and a decision on the compatibility of possible preferential tax regimes with state-aid rules.</P>
    <P>The Commission closed its file on the complaint in April 1999. Since then, and following consultations between the developer and Bord Fáilte, I have been in correspondence with the Commission about how the schedule for completion of the project can be accommodated within the various operational programmes and CSF deadlines. The Commission is aware of our planning framework including the appeals process.</P>
    <P>Agreement was finalised on contractual details between Bord Fáilte and the developers, and submitted to my Department on Monday 18 October last. The developers have undertaken to execute these contracts in the event of an appropriate extension of time being granted by the European Commission in relation to the draw down of the grant. The details were forwarded to the EU Commission to facilitate its consideration of the case for extension of the schedule for the project within the various deadlines.</P>
    <P>I am now just clarifying certain aspects of their response with the Commission. I expect these discussions to be concluded in the very near future, and then confirm the position to the developers.</P>
    <P>I have not been in contact with An Bord Pleanála with regard to this issue.</P>

      <P>Children with special needs in the Cork area are served by 11 special schools and a further 31 special classes which are attached to ordinary schools in the area.</P>
      <P>The range of special needs catered for by these facilities includes autism; hearing impairment; mild general learning disability; moderate general learning disability; multiple disability; physical disability; severe-profound general learning disability; severe emotional disturbance; specific learning disability; and specific speech and language disorder.</P>
      <P>In addition, a total of 41 resource teacher posts have been allocated to primary schools in the Cork area to assist pupils with special needs who are attending on a fully integrated basis.</P>
      <P>I am arranging to forward to the Deputy a detailed list of all the special schools and special classes operating in the Cork area.</P>
      <P>As a result of a Government decision in October 1998 all children with disabilities in the primary school system are now entitled to an automatic response to their needs. As a result of this development, my Department has already allocated an additional 183 resource teachers and 460 child care assistant posts to the primary school system.</P>
      <P>My Department will continue to make any necessary provision available to special needs children, including children in the Cork area, whenever an assessed level of need has been identified.</P>

      <P>I understand that the student in question was in receipt of a higher education grant from Sligo County Council in respect of his attendance at an undergraduate course from 1994 to 1997. He was out of college in 1997-98 and 1998-99. He applied to Sligo County Council for a higher education grant in 1999-2000 in respect of his attendance at a postgraduate course.</P>
      <P>The higher education grant schemes operate under the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992. These Acts define a mature student to mean a person &ldquo;of not less than 23 years of age, or such other age as may stand specified for the time being in regulations made by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance, who have secured places in approved institutions and have reached that age on January, or such other date as may be prescribed form time to time by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance, in the year of entry to such institutions&rdquo;. As the person to whom the Deputy refers was not 23 years on 1 January 1999 he could not be assessed as a mature student.</P>
      <P>When assessing the means of students other than mature students, the Acts specify that the students' means and those of their parents or guardians must be below a prescribed limit. This provision requires that parental income be taken into account irrespective of the individual circumstances in any case where the student is not a mature student.</P>
      <P>As the reckonable income in his case does not come within the current income limits for the award of a grant or fees, he is ineligible for assistance under the higher education grants scheme.</P>

      <P>Under the free fees initiative tuition fees are payable in respect of eligible EU nationals who have been ordinarily resident in an EU member state for at least three of the five years preceding entry to their third-level course. I would point out to the Deputy that this condition applies equally to all EU nationals, including Irish nationals, in accordance with the judgment of the European Court of Justice that access to <Col N="729" /> vocational training must apply equally to all EU nationals. I understand that similar residency requirements operate in the other EU member states.</P>
      <P>The removal of this residency condition for Irish nationals would have to apply to EU nationals generally and could have significant resource implications for the Exchequer. The matter has been raised by a number of Deputies and I have asked my officials to re-examine the issue and report to me in due course.</P>
      <P>Under the higher education grants scheme and the VEC scholarships scheme a candidate who is not eligible for free tuition under the free fees initiative may be awarded a full or part grant in respect of lecture fees provided s/he meets all other conditions of the schemes. In order to be eligible for an award under these schemes, a candidate must fulfil conditions as to residence, age, academic attainments, means and nationality. In order to fulfil the residency requirement a candidate's parents, or, in the case of an independent mature candidate, the candidate herself-himself, must have been resident in the administrative area of the local authority from the 1 October of the year prior to entry on an approved course. The local authority has discretion to waive this requirement in exceptional circumstances.</P>

      <P>When equipping a music room in a post-primary school, a piano is provided. Additionally, the following grants are available for instrumental music in schools: an orchestra or military band taking the special examination for choirs, orchestras and military bands for the first time attracts a grant not exceeding 60 per cent of the costs or £225 maximum; a grant for maintenance of instruments is available at £3 per instrument; a capital grant of £75, £150 and £225 depending on the type of orchestra is available for the purchase of instruments.</P>
      <P>In the vocational sector, a number of committees organise music classes, including piano lessons, for pupils in their areas. These include the City of Dublin VEC at Kylemore College, the County Cork VEC at centres throughout the county and the Limerick VEC at the Limerick School of Music. Third level colleges such as the Dublin Institute of Technology Conservatory of Music and Drama and the Cork Institute of Technology School of Music, provide tuition in piano for students, including some from first &ndash; and second level education. In these cases, a good to excellent range of pianos is made available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="730" /> Other private organisations and individuals provide for initiatives in piano teaching. Chief among these is the Royal Irish Academy of Music, funded by the State. Others include the Leinster School of Music, Dublin, the City College of Music, Cork, the Kerry School of Music, the Wexford School of Music and, most recently, the Sligo School of Music. In some of these schemes facilities are available for music practice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 367, 376 and 377 together.</P>
      <P>Subsequent to the report of Sir Ron Dearing on the future of higher education, the UK authorities introduced a number of changes in the financial support arrangements for students pursuing courses at further and higher education institutions. This included the introduction of an annual tuition fee for students entering further and higher education institutions for the first time from the 1998-99 academic year and the replacement of maintenance grants by student loans to be phased in from that year also.</P>
      <P>All EU students, including Irish students, are eligible for grant assistance towards the tuition fee subject to the same conditions as apply to UK students. This means that students from lower income families will receive full grant assistance towards the cost of their tuition fees.</P>
      <P>Data available on the number of Irish students studying in the UK, including Northern Ireland, indicate that in 1998-99 there were 13,250 full-time higher education students from the Republic attending colleges of further and higher education in the UK. Of these 2,896 were first time entrants. The figure for 1999-2000 shows a decrease to 2,368 first time entrants, a drop of almost 600 students. My Department does not have figures available on the numbers of full-time further education students from the Republic attending colleges of further and higher education in the UK.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="734" /> There are a range of factors that influence student choices as to study at home or elsewhere such as in the UK. In this regard, I would point out that this Government has provided for a substantial increase in the number of further and higher education places over recent years.</P>
    <P>I have previously outlined my position that I do not intend to reintroduce tuition fees at third level. Accordingly, I have no plans at present to initiate a harmonisation of student financial support between the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>With regard to the recognition of academic qualifications, the objects of the Qualifications (Education and Training) Act, 1999, enacted during the summer, include the promotion of recognition outside the State of awards made by bodies in the State and the recognition in the State of awards made by bodies outside the State. Once the Act is brought into operation, it will be a function of the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland to liaise with bodies outside the State which make education and training awards for the purposes of facilitating the recognition in the State of education and training awards made by those bodies and also facilitate recognition outside the State of education and training awards made in the State.</P>
    <P>There are also European Union directives on the general system for the recognition of higher education diplomas and professional education and training, which apply to all member states.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 370 and 380 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Considerable co-operation and collaboration exists across all aspects of third level education. These include initiatives funded under EU programmes such as INTERREG and the Special Support Programme for Peace and Reconciliation. Projects at Letterkenny, Dundalk and Sligo Institutes of Technology have benefited from co-funding arrangements under INTERREG. Two recent initiatives funded under the Special Support Programme for Peace and Reconciliation <Col N="735" /> and co-funded by both Governments North and South are the Queen's University-Dublin City University joint initiative &ndash; the Centre for Cross Border Studies. This is a university based project set up to research and develop ideas for practical cross-Border co-operation; the Letterkenny Institute of Technology-University of Ulster joint initiative &ndash; SME innovative growth which involves the development of business management skills with small-medium enterprises in the border area of the north-west of Ireland and Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The national development plan will build on the links, which have already been established as a basis for developing more closely integrated coherent approaches in the future with clearer policy objectives and outcomes. Activities to be promoted include interactive approaches at university and further education level in areas such as research and development and support for SME's.</P>
    <P>The continued development of the peace process, including the establishment of the North-South Ministerial Council will afford even further opportunities to both administrations to take forward and enhance co-operation in this and other agreed areas in the near future.</P>

      <P>Specifically in relation to the third level sector, my Department has provided grant aid to the Irish School of Ecumenics which offers courses at postgraduate level in ecumenical studies and peace studies, with the awards being made by Trinity College Dublin. I understand also that the ISE has a major project, Moving Beyond Sectarianism, which is in progress in Northern Ireland. The University of Limerick also offers a postgraduate programme in peace and development studies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The brief of the higher education equality unit focuses on issues of equality which includes equality issues relating to religious or political belief. The unit, which was established in 1992 to promote equality in higher education, works with <Col N="736" /> all third level institutions raising awareness of issues of educational equality and encouraging and assisting in the development of good policy and practice.</P>
    <P>In the context of the continued development of the peace process, there will be further opportunities to enhance co-operation between third level institutions on the island which will foster mutual understanding and respect.</P>

      <P>Under the free fees initiative, the State meets the tuition fees of eligible students who are attending full-time undergraduate courses, which must generally be of at least two years' duration, at approved colleges. Distance learning courses are regarded as part-time courses and do not come within the scope of the free fees initiative.</P>
      <P>Any proposal to extend the free fees initiative to part-time students would have to have regard to the availability of resources and other competing needs in the education sector.</P>
      <P>In the 1997-98 academic year, there were more than 25,000 part-time students at third level. The steering committee on the future development of higher education considered the profile of part-time students in 1996-97 and found that almost 90% of part-time students were in employment. In this context, I would point out that under section 475 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, tax relief is available at the standard rate for tuition fees paid by eligible students who are attending approved part-time undergraduate third level courses, including distance education courses.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 396 and 398 together.</P>
      <P>The Dublin Institute of Technology consists in physical resources of ten acres of land spread over seven major sites all of which are covered by buildings. These buildings together with premises which the Dublin Institute of Technology is currently renting are required for the delivery of the full range of courses on offer from the Dublin Institute of Technology.</P>
      <P>A site of sixty five acres at St. Brendan's psychiatric unit, Grangegorman, is no longer required by the Eastern Health Board and would meet the requirements of the Dublin Institute of Technology for additional space. This space would address the concerns of the Dublin Institute of Technology in respect of student accommodation, sports fields and other amenities. This matter is under active consideration.</P>

      <P>I can inform the Deputy that some 199 students, 81 male and 118 female, from County Mayo were pursuing courses in the Dublin Institute of Technology in 1998-99. My Department is currently gathering the data in respect of the 1999-2000 academic year.</P>

      <P>The Qualifications (Education and Training) Act, 1999 was enacted during the summer. An interdepartmental implementation group, comprising those Departments concerned with the operation of the Act, has been established to oversee its implementation. This group had its first meeting in September last and is to report to me in the near future on the necessary steps to bring the Act into operation.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the provisions of section 29(8) of the Act will enable me as Minister to give effect to the recommendations of the independent review group on Waterford Institute of Technology chaired by Professor Dervilla Donnelly. When the relevant sections of the Act are brought into operation it is my intention to direct the Higher Education and Training Awards Council and the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland to implement the recommendations of the report of the review group. Subject to the other provisions of the Qualifications (Education and Training) Act and the Regional Technical Colleges Acts, Waterford Institute of Technology would have authority delegated from the Higher Education and Training Awards Council to make awards in relation to existing and new programmes at certificate and diploma level currently awarded by the National Council for Educational Awards.</P>

      <P>The last general expansion of the disadvantaged areas scheme at primary level took place in 1994. The school referred to by the Deputy applied for inclusion in the scheme but <Col N="745" /> did not rank sufficiently high in terms of priority of need to secure inclusion on that occasion.</P>
      <P>A subsequent study of educational disadvantage conducted by the Combat Poverty Agency and the Education Research Centre in 1996 concluded that disadvantaged status should be confined to 16 per cent of the school-going population. This study noted that such status had already been granted to 17 per cent of pupils. As an alternative to extending the disadvantaged areas scheme to additional schools, the study recommended that available resources should be targeted at schools with the greatest concentration of children from disadvantaged backgrounds.</P>
      <P>In keeping with the study's recommendations, resources which subsequently became available were targeted on schools selected to participate in the breaking the cycle of disadvantage scheme which was introduced to deliver the sort of targeted support recommended in the study.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that the needs of the school to which he refers will be fully considered in the event of any additional initiatives being taken to address educational disadvantage.</P>

      <P>It is the policy of my Department to provide physical education halls as part of the schedule of accommodation for all new post-primary schools. A PE hall is also provided when a major extension to a school, which does not have such a facility is being built.</P>
      <P>An official in my Department has been appointed to design standard physical education halls. The templates will be ready shortly. When available, these templates will expedite the architectural design stages of PE halls, allowing them to progress quicker through tender and construction stages.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that students in many parts <Col N="746" /> of the country are experiencing particular difficulties in finding good affordable accommodation. An across-the-board major increase in grants is clearly not the appropriate response. Rather the core issue is a need to increase the availability of dedicated student housing and the resultant release of pressure from the rented sector.</P>
      <P>The provision of on-campus accommodation is on going in the third level sector. On-campus accommodation for seven hundred students is expected to be completed well in advance of the next academic year at the Galway campus of the Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology while approval for on-campus accommodation in respect of 450 bed spaces has been sanctioned by the University of Limerick. A number of developers have made initial inquiries or submitted applications to educational institutions in respect of developments which are within 8km of the eligible institutions and to date four such applications have received approval. With the advent of such developments additional student accommodation will become available over the next number of years.</P>

Is orthu siúd a thiteann an cúram ar an gcéad ásc féachaint chuige go nglacann a bpáistí páirt i ngníomhaíochtaí fisiciúla mar chuid dá gcaitheamh aimsire. Mar Aire Oideachais agus Eolaíochta, is é an cúram atá ormsa ina leith seo ná clár feiliúnach sa chorpoideachas a chur ar fáil do scoileanna agus cabhrú le scoileanna pé acmhainní atá ag teastáil lena mhúineadh a sholáthar.</P>

    <P>Mar chuid den churaclam bunscoile leasaithe, tá clár nua sa chorpoideachas curtha ar fáil agam do gach uile mhúinteoir bunscoile sa tír. Tá dhá leabhrán i gceist anseo, Ráiteas Curaclaim ina bhfuil aidhmeanna agus cuspóirí an chláir leagtha síos agus Treoirlínte do Mhúinteoirí. Tá sé molta go gcaithfí ar a laighead uair a chloig in aghaidh na seachtaine ag múineadh an ábhair. Ceann de phríomhaidhmeanna an chorpoideachais sa chlár leasaithe is ea: &ldquo;taitneamh agus dearcadh deimhneach i leith gníomhaíochta coirp, agus mar <Col N="747" /> a chuidíonn sí le corpacmhainn na sláinte ar bhonn saoil, a chothú mar ullmhú an pháiste do thráthanna scíthe a chaitheamh go gníomhach agus go fóinteach&rdquo;. Cuirfear cúrsaí oiliúna ar fáil <Col N="748" /> d'oidí ar theagasc an chláir leasaithe sna blianta atá romhainn.
