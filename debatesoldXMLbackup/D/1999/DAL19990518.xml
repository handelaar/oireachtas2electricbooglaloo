    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 3 together.</P>
      <P>I met with the President of the Palestinian National Authority, Mr. Yasser Arafat, in Dublin on Monday, 3 May. The visit was part of an extensive tour of capitals which President Arafat has undertaken. He was accompanied by the Palestinian National Authority's Minister for Planning and International Co-operation, Mr. Nabil Shaath, and the Minister for Information and Culture, Mr. Abdar Rabbo. I had a brief private meeting with President Arafat, followed by a working dinner where we were joined by the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Woods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We discussed the current state of the Middle-East Peace Process. President Arafat informed me that the Palestinian National Authority was awaiting the outcome of the then upcoming Israeli elections. Whatever the results of the election, President Arafat expected that international pressure, particularly from the US, would be put on Israel, to meet its obligations. President Arafat believes that President Clinton is personally com<Col N="1238" /> mitted to solving the impasse arising from the non-implementation of the Wye Agreement. I expressed the hope that the peace process would be revived as quickly as possible after the formation of the new Israeli Government. I reaffirmed to President Arafat that together with our partners in the European Union, Ireland fully supported the peace process and would continue to press for the immediate implementation of the Wye River agreement.</P>
    <P>We discussed the terms of the declaration made by the European Council in Berlin on 24-25 March. President Arafat indicated this was extremely important in the deliberations of the Central Committee of the Palestine Liberation Organisation which resulted in the deferral of the decision to declare an independent Palestinian State. I informed President Arafat that I had strongly supported the EU Declaration and welcomed this decision which was a tribute to his skilful leadership.</P>
    <P>President Arafat also outlined continuing Israeli practices in relation to, for instance, trade, free movement of individuals, access to water and the expansion of Israeli settlements.</P>
    <P>I informed President Arafat that the Irish Government is proposing to establish a Representative Office in Ramallah and that all necessary arrangements would be made to give effect to this. In the context of the Representative Office, we discussed Irish aid levels to Palestine. Ireland is currently operating an aid programme of about £2 million a year in the Occupied Territories. I also briefed President Arafat on Ireland's SECCO campaign. While the Palestinian National Authority has no vote in the elections, its support for our campaign would be very beneficial amongst its Arab neighbours.</P>
    <P>I was happy to accept President Arafat's invitation to become a member of the Bethlehem 2000 Committee. I intend that my membership will signal support for what will be a major world religious and cultural event.</P>
    <P>I also took the opportunity to brief President Arafat on the latest position in the Northern Ireland peace process.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, the Israeli electorate has given the leader of the One Israel Party, formerly Labour Party, Mr. Ehud Barak, a decisive victory in the election there. He is now in the process of forming a Government.</P>
    <P>I have written to Mr. Barak, congratulating him on his victory. I have wished him success in reviving and reinvigorating the Middle East peace process and have assured him of my support and that of my colleagues in the European Union in this regard.</P>
    <P>The tasks that face Mr. Barak and his Government are indeed formidable. They include the urgent implementation of the Wye River agreement and the launching and conclusion of the &ldquo;Final Status&rdquo; negotiations with the Palestinian Authority, I hope within a framework of one year. He has also given very firm commitments about reaching final settlements with Syria and <Col N="1239" /> Lebanon. I am confident the House joins me in wishing him well in all his tasks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Did Mr. Arafat ask the Taoiseach if the Irish Government recognised the Palestinian state? What discussions has the Taoiseach had with his European counterparts on this issue? What contacts has he had or is he planning to have with the Israeli Prime Minister elect, Mr. Barak? What effect will the election of Mr. Barak have on the peace process? In view of the missile attacks in Israel this morning, has he received any reports on the security implications for Irish UN personnel serving in the area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The election of Mr. Barak will be seen as a positive move. There has not been any movement over the past year or so. We have discussed this matter at Question Time on at least one or two occasions over the past year. The decisive victory for Mr. Barak will give him confidence to move to settle a number of issues, including the Wye River agreement and to reach a settlement with Mr. Yasser Arafat.</P>
      <P>The resolution of this issue will involve negotiation and the EU's position is set down in the statement made during the summit on 24 and 25 March. Palestine would not have received full support from EU countries if it had moved before the election. This tactical position, which it was urged to take in that statement and by the United States and others, means it will receive recognition and support internationally in the negotiations which will take place shortly. This is the Irish position.</P>
      <P>I did not receive any reports this morning about the situation in the Lebanon. However, there are ongoing and regular attacks and the Irish troops are in a difficult position because they are located in an area which divides the two sides. The situation was not overly difficult in the run up to the elections but I understand the soldiers are on constant alert because there have been several attacks since the beginning of this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the declaration of the Palestinian state, when it is made, be responded to in unison by European Union member states and not individually as was the disastrous experience with regard to Croatia? Has the Government any plans to increase the current £2 million in aid, to which the Taoiseach referred, in light of the probable movement forward by the successful Labour Party-led alliance in Israel? The removal of troops from south Lebanon and the reinvigoration of the Oslo peace accords will hopefully bring about a settlement, but this will require massive economic transfers above and beyond the amount Palestine is currently receiving.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that context, is the Taoiseach aware that students from Palestine who apply for visas so they can come to study in Ireland are discriminated against by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform in that they are told <Col N="1240" /> that if their wives seek to join them in Ireland, they will not be granted visas. I am not sure if the Taoiseach is aware that this is standard practice in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. A number of Palestinian people come to Ireland, particularly to pursue medical studies, but they are subsequently informed that their wives cannot join them. In light of the concrete support that can be given to the emerging state of Palestine following the Labour Party victory in Israel, are there any plans to increase the amount of tangible aid to it?</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In terms of future developments, it should be an EU decision. The member states should collectively support the new Palestinian state and I have made this point at EU meetings over recent years. The issue of Ireland's aid programmes is under review. I discussed the use and requirements of the operating aid programme with the Department of Foreign Affairs and it is following up those discussions.</P>
      <P>I am not aware of the difficulty regarding permits. There are a number of Palestinian students in Ireland but I do not know what distinctions are drawn. I suggest the Deputy raise the matter with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and I will also mention it to him.</P>
      <P>A great opportunity now exists. Mr. Barak received a strong mandate following the election campaign which lasted five and a half months. The campaign was based on the peace process and trying to resolve the difficulties Israel has with Syria, the Lebanon and President Arafat. Mr. Barak set out his intentions on these issues and campaigned on that basis. Young people in Israel in particular support the furthering of the peace process. This was clear over recent months, but people across Israel showed their support for the process. They want reconciliation and progress on this issue. For our part, we will do anything we can. President Arafat has travelled to Ireland over many years to visit supporters and successive Governments. I have had numerous contacts with him in the past two years and will support him in any way possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>One million people live in Gaza, which has an unemployment rate of about 80 per cent. Is the Taoiseach aware that half its population will not have access to adequate clean water supplies this summer because the infrastructure is run down and the area has been isolated by Israel?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of that. When I was in Israel and the Palestinian area in January, this was one of the many major issues of concern. A series of events has put people in an appalling position. In some cases the international community has already offered assistance, but those offers have not been accepted and blockages have been put in their way. In my view the people are treated in a deplorable way at borders and other facilities and when applying for homes and basic <Col N="1241" /> services. All these matters must be dealt with by the new Administration. The outgoing Prime Minister frustrated many good offers made by the West.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>While Prime Minister designate Barak's victory is welcome in that it gives him a mandate to take action under the peace process, he is committed to a policy of expanding the existing settlements on the occupied territories which has the same effect as creating new settlements. Does the Taoiseach agree this policy of the new Israeli Government is not conducive to the peace process?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a question of how the policy is interpreted. From my discussions in the EU, I think there is plenty of movement within his policy on where settlements can be achieved. On some issues he cannot be flexible but given what has happened during the outgoing Prime Minister's term, the international community and people in Israel believe adequate movement will be made. I hope this is the case and that people will not fall back on positions. Within Mr. Barak's stated campaign positions, there is every confidence that progress can be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach said the Government was considering establishing a representative office in Ramullah. Will he indicate the status of the diplomat posted there and when the office is likely to be opened?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be a representative office with responsibility for keeping in touch with the authorities and the aid programmes. We hope it will open later this year or early next year. Discussions have already started and we discussed it in detail at the meeting with President Arafat.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 to 14, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The British Prime Minister, Mr Tony Blair, and I met the leaders of the Ulster Unionist Party, the SDLP and Sinn Féin in London on Thursday, 6 May, and Northern Ireland was the only item on the agenda. We had a useful series of meetings and we made progress. The parties resumed their discussions on Monday, 12 May, and the Prime Minister and I held further talks with the parties in London last Friday.</P>
      <P>I have said before in this House that our objective is to bring forward proposals that would have the support of all the pro-Agreement parties. In the discussions last Friday, proposals emerged which it seemed, potentially, could achieve that objective. However, it remains to be seen if this is so. The two Governments are of the view that the time has arrived when it is necessary to bring these matters to a conclusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that the Taoiseach said it is necessary to bring these matters to a conclusion, is the proposed date of 30 June a deadline? Will the Taoiseach indicate what the parties in this House can do to support his efforts, as they supported the efforts of the previous Government, to bring about peace? In what way can we assist the Taoiseach to ensure the deadline is met and that the outcome is constructive and satisfactory?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1243" />
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a deadline. If by 30 June the parties to the Good Friday Agreement have made no progress, it will be for the two Governments to reflect on that situation and examine where they go from there. I acknowledge the support of all parties in the House for my work in trying to convince all the parties to continue to make movement in their various ways. It is clear where movement is required and all parties know what they must do, although some are more aware of it than others. Hopefully, they can make that movement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach still of the opinion he expressed on 14 February that it is not practical politics to envisage the establishment of an Executive without a start being made on decommissioning?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That has been my position since last autumn. It was tried but it did not work. Then we moved to the Hillsborough compromise, which I believe was a fair one and a collective act of reconciliation which effectively put at least some arms beyond use. The current proposed solution has a lot of benefit. The Ulster Unionist Party had what is called a &ldquo;positive&rdquo; meeting this morning. I am not fully briefed on its precise outcome so I am anxious to say only what will be helpful. I got a quote from David Trimble before I came to the House. He said: </P>
      <P>The Ulster Unionist Party needs more clarification of the Downing Street proposal. We met for over an hour this morning. It was a positive meeting. The Downing Street proposals are incomplete. I expect to have more talks with the British Prime Minister soon. The Ulster Unionist Party position remains no guns, no administration with Sinn Féin&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Clarification of some matters might be useful. Some of the spokespersons for the Ulster Unionist Party in their statements last night misinterpreted some aspects of what happened last week. It was not a situation where people were asked to set aside the decommissioning issue; that was not the outcome of the discussions.</P>
      <P>The position was taken in two stages. First, that the d'Hondt system would be moved on Thursday, that the Ministers designate would take up their positions. There would not be a formal meeting of the Executive so they would not take up their full positions until 30 June or before that, if it proved possible. Second, and separately, talks would continue and be intensified with the chairperson of the International Commission on Decommissioning, General de Chastelain. There would be an intensive session of talks over the next few weeks in an effort to find a resolution. In the discussions around that, the decommissioning issue or a means of trying to sort it out would still be on the agenda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My reading of the statements by UUP spokespersons yesterday is that they appeared to think they were being asked to forego the decom<Col N="1244" /> missioning issue. That is not what was agreed and if that is the clarification required, I am happy to make it absolutely clear.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the discussions go well and that the Government can bring about the necessary agreement. Does the Taoiseach see a need for putting a non-binding referendum or preferendum to the Northern Ireland electorate in the run-up to end June? That would help determine if there is a need for parties to act outside their normal constituencies and, if so, they may be able to refer to the greater good and recognise the wishes of the people of Northern Ireland. Does he consider such a measure would help to bring parties beyond their traditional positions in the talks?</P>
      <P>What is the Government's view on the status of the LVF and UDA ceasefires in light of Mr. Adam's belief that they are over?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>All acts of assistance are useful. The holding of referendums or preferendums and other measures are kept under review. I heard the statement of Archbishop Eames to the Church of Ireland Synod at lunchtime. In his lengthy statement on the matter he said the key to peace is contained in one word, &ldquo;trust&rdquo;. He is right. We have had five sessions of discussions lasting 43 hours in the past few weeks. The difficulty lies in getting people to trust each other and to appreciate that there is not something hidden in every line or every move. I understand why people hold that view. All the years of conflict, deaths, mayhem and murders have made people distrustful of others in Northern Ireland. We must continue to try to build trust in every possible way.</P>
      <P>I have continued to say during the talks that a referendum has been held and that the people have spoken. A referendum cannot be held every day. When the referendum was put, the people turned out in great numbers and gave their views. Eighty per cent of the people on this island voted for the Agreement less than a year ago. By doing so they gave the political leaders, North and South, who supported it, the signal to proceed to negotiate it. That is what we should be doing rather than thinking about what the people would say today or tomorrow about various solutions. We are still trying to implement the Good Friday Agreement, which was put to the people. Members of all parties in Northern Ireland have said no document was ever analysed as closely or understood and debated so well. That being the case, we should have the confidence to conclude it, and I hope we can do that. I have no problem with people seeking clarification and I hope such clarification will work. I am also conscious that the political situation is not easy for some of the party leaders.</P>

      <P>I do not have particular information on that, but it has been stated fairly widely in the North that there has been targeting by some of the groups. There has been some concern about that matter, but I would not over-read anything into that. I am more concerned about those responsible for the ongoing attacks on Nationalists which have intensified. There have been 158 attacks, which include bomb attacks, pipe bombs and shootings, on Nationalists in the past few weeks.</P>

      <P>During the ongoing discussions and those on Friday, I have been at pains to get agreement to state that all parties agree to the implementation of all aspects of the Agreement, including the objective of achieving total disarmament and complete withdrawal of all weapons from politics, to accept that the issue of arms must be fully and satisfactorily settled and that the parties will do what they can to achieve the decommissioning of all paramilitary arms within the timeframe set down in the Agreement in the context of implementing the overall settlement.

      <P>Is it difficult that the IRA is not party to the talks and any commitments given are not represented as binding on it? Is there any indication that the IRA might be willing to make a statement about its medium-term intentions on decommissioning, which, if made would obviously have considerable political effect?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two aspects to that question, one of which is so different to the position in which we were only a year ago. A year ago one could not have said &ldquo;Sinn Féin&rdquo; at any meeting without people correcting it and saying &ldquo;Sinn Féin-IRA&rdquo;. People took the view, as I have said over the years, that they were opposite sides of the same coin. Now if one says &ldquo;Sinn Féin&rdquo; people will correct it and say it is not the IRA. It has somersaulted in a year. The position which Sinn Féin used to adopt, that it was not answerable and could not say anything, is now being put by everyone. This creates confusion.</P>
      <P>Looked at closely, the Easter statement of the IRA &ndash; I said this publicly at the time, as I do not want to get into answering IRA statements &ndash; contained many signals and phrases which were new and did not rule out decommissioning in the future. If Deputy Bruton is asking me whether I believe it is likely the IRA will make a statement in the short-term, I have no reason to believe it will.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to ask two questions, one of which arises from the Taoiseach's last reply. First, does he still hold the view that Sinn Féin and the IRA are two sides of the same coin, no matter how they interact with each other, and that the Sinn Féin party, on occasion, speaks for the IRA? Second, in the course of the discussions which took place in Downing Street last Friday, was the role of General de Chastelain discussed in some detail with the various parties as to how he might measure progress in relation to the difficult issue of decommissioning? Have the British and Irish Governments been in contact with General de Chastelain or his office to confirm that the analysis of what might constitute progress in the eyes of both Governments would be the same from his point of view?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>From the detailed discussions we had with General de Chastelain before Easter, I know he would be in a position to try to make that a realistic opportunity and to build on it. The parties would go along with that. I do not think that will be a problem. There will be constructive dialogue to try to resolve this issue.</P>
      <P>The position of Sinn Féin and the IRA is more blurred now in terms of the perception in Northern Ireland as distinct from here. If Sinn Féin makes a statement now one is asked what is the view of the IRA. That was not the case a year ago. I have always had a difficulty with that because I do not have a clue what the view of the IRA is on anything because, as far as I know, I only deal with Sinn Féin. The position is not as clear as it used to be. Unionists and loyalists would now put it that Sinn Féin and the IRA speak from quite separate positions. One rarely hears people say &ldquo;Sinn Féin-IRA&rdquo;. I looked through press cuttings of interviews given in the past five or six weeks and no Unionist or loyalist said &ldquo;Sinn Féin-IRA&rdquo;.</P>

I sympathise with him in the frustration he must be feeling at the apparently never-ending discussions and differences. Does he agree that knocking one's head against a stone wall could be considered a positive experience in comparison to dealing with some people in Northern Ireland? However, I encourage him to keep going on the basis that the important difference between these and previous discussions is the verdict of the people in the North and the South. Will he clarify a reference in one of today's newspapers, which he repeated, if not directly, in his initial reply earlier, in which he appears to be offering to David Trimble that he would be a guarantor of the Unionist position as a result of agreements emerging from current discussions?</P>

I have continually said, and I do not believe that I have been found wanting &ndash; in many of these discussions I have sought fairness and a properly balanced discussion and I have supported lines put forward by Mr. Trimble &ndash; that where positions are put and agreed, we will stick by those. It is important in these matters that all of us understand what we negotiate and agree on and that we do not try to change from that position. Even though we have had many such discussions and agreements, I have stuck firmly to that line and I think that is helpful. I understand the problems of Mr. Trimble and Mr. Adams and the even more considerable problems of Mr. Mallon, who is a tower of positive strength throughout all these discussions.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach convey to all the parties engaged in these difficult negotiations in the North that they enjoy the goodwill and support of all the parties here, that equally they enjoy the goodwill of all elected representatives in Britain and Ireland? Will he further convey our concern that the huge potential of strands two and three must not be put aside and, while there may be a deadline of 30 June, the greater urgency is that the huge potential for partnership between ourselves and the North in whatever agreement is reached can only benefit all the people in the North together with our partners in Europe and throughout the world? Will he also convey to them that our only interest is to give support, goodwill and help, which must be encouraging to them in their negotiations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, at every opportunity I get I will certainly convey that. I am aware that the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body, at its recent meeting, outlined what the Deputy, who is its co-chairman, has stated. We have been saying to the parties &ndash; there is agreement on this &ndash; that the Good Friday Agreement is an unprecedented <Col N="1248" /> opportunity to put the past behind us and to begin again. The part of the Agreement based on partnership, equality and mutual respect has been overwhelmingly endorsed by the people, North and South, and one of the core features of the Agreement is respect for diversity and difference. Nobody is being asked to sacrifice fundamental aspirations and ideals. The Agreement requires only that their pursuit be by exclusively democratic and peaceful means.</P>
      <P>I sincerely hold the view that, within the negotiating positions, nobody is being asked to sign away any of those fundamental positions and I do not think they should. What they are all being asked to do &ndash; it is not fair for us to look only at one side &ndash; is to move to positions where there can be compromise and where some trust can be built up. If we get trust we can make the institutions work. Without it we will have considerable difficulties.</P>

        <b>:</b> Ordinary people want the politicians to get on with it and feel they are going about it very tortuously. Nevertheless, does the Taoiseach agree there is a danger in setting 30 June as a definite date in the sense that if agreement is not reached by then it could be seen as a watershed which would be grist to the mill of those sectarian elements who do not want an agreement. They would see it as some kind of signal to step up sectarian activities. In light of that, has the Taoiseach had any recent discussions on the Drumcree-Garvaghy Road problem? Does he agree that the continuing refusal of the Orange Order to enter into dialogue with the elected representatives of the Garvaghy Road is not just intransigent but highly irresponsible, in that it can heighten tensions leading up to 12 July? As we know, last year those tensions caused terrible injury and the atrocity that claimed the lives of the Quinn children.</P>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that, equally, it would be very unhelpful if the residents of the Garvaghy Road and their representatives took a positive decision at this time that a parade would not, under any circumstances, be countenanced on the Garvaghy Road in 1999? Despite the siege by elements of the Orange Order, will the Taoiseach urge the residents to keep all options open in the event of dialogue, in the hope that a compromise can be worked out which will involve give and take on both sides? Adopting intransigent positions can only create a sense of hopelessness that we will face the same horrific situation as last year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has posed two separate questions. The first one related to the deadline and my interpretation is that if the parties have not agreed by the end of June the two Governments will have to assess the situation. We have to bring this stage to some conclusion, however, and the British Prime Minister feels very strongly about that. We will assess the position at the end of June.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1249" /> We have had discussions about Drumcree. We had a lengthy round table session at the end of our meeting last Friday night. It included the British Prime Minister and myself, Mr. John Hume and Mr. Séamus Mallon, Mr. Trimble, Mr. Adams and Mr. McGuinness, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy O'Donnell, a number of senior UUP officials and other officials. We went into some considerable detail concerning the way forward on Drumcree. We looked at suggestions and options, based on the experiences of the past, as to what might usefully be done to make some progress and avert the difficulties of the last four years and what is known in the North as &ldquo;Drumcree Five&rdquo;, this year. There is much goodwill between the parties to do that.</P>
    <P>I had an extensive meeting with the Garvaghy Road residents association on Thursday night, which was attended by Mr. Breandán MacCionnaith and other residents' representatives. I would like to be able to say that all options are open, but I think some may have been closed off.</P>

However, the Orange Order and the elements that want to march say they will talk about compromise and dialogue providing the 1998 march can be completed. The Garvaghy Road residents say they will have compromise and dialogue provided the 1999 march does not commence. It is difficult but we will continue to try to find a compromise.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach said that if, by 30 June, progress has not been made the two Governments will have to assess the situation. Do I take it that one assessment might be that the Agreement has, in effect, lapsed? If that is the case, what steps does the Taoiseach feel the parties in this House can take to try to advance progress on this difficult issue? This Agreement does not belong to the Oireachtas but to the people, not just of this Republic, but of all the island. We are anxious that any help that can be given by the House is delivered in the spirit of bipartisanship.</P>

      <P>I do not want to go further on the 30 June date other than to say the issue will be reviewed. However, if a message is to go out from this House, it should be that all parties believe in the Agreement. The people voted for it and it is the people's Agreement. The reasonable movement that is being asked for, and which has been agreed to by the various leaders, as far as I am concerned, as well as the political system to be built around that will allow people to move ahead. If that happens we can make progress. It would be unfair if anyone was tied in unnecessarily by what is on the table. This is a fair position. I am not singling out any leader but I believe <Col N="1250" /> they all want to move forward on that basis and there should be an overwhelming political movement encouraging them to do so.</P>

      <P>The National Competitiveness Council published its second annual report on 5 May. The report assesses Ireland's competitive position based on measures of economic performance and through international benchmarking. The report confirms that Ireland continues to improve its competitive position, while it also identifies areas where further improvement is required.</P>
      <P>The report highlights key messages for Ireland's future competitiveness and makes recommendations across a broad range of policy areas.

This report's conclusions signal many areas in the economy which must be advanced. It is important that the Government notes where the report assigns credit as well as areas where it signals there may be future difficulties. We must try to get proper policy resolutions for those areas.</P>

Does he agree that this group also faces a particular problem with the cost of child care in addition to the cost of their mortgages? The combination of mortgage and child care costs is causing that group, which is essential to the workforce because their skills are so recent, to be extremely restive about their pay expectations. This will cause an increasing problem in the workplace and in industrial relations. The Government's efforts to increase the supply of housing are welcome but they are insufficient to deal with bringing house prices down. We must bring house prices down, not just stabilise them, if we are to avoid a potential pay explosion.</P>

This is an extraordinarily large number; fewer than half that number were being built a decade ago. All the Government's initiatives in this regard are necessary. These include measures to clear planning logjams, the allocation of resources to serviced land initiatives and the provision of infrastructural requirements such as water and sewerage schemes, drainage and roads. We also have 100 per cent mortgage tax relief and changes have been made in stamp duty regulations. Mortgage interest rates are low. All these measures are necessary but the most effective way to alleviate the housing difficulties is to increase the supply of houses. The Minister, Deputy Dempsey and the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy have repeatedly said this. Resources must be allocated to increasing the supply of houses and the Government is committed to doing that.</P>

      <P>Under procedures in operation in my Department at present, any allegations relating to abuse of children by any member of the staff of a school which is made to officers of my Department is reported to the principal and chairperson of the board of management of the school whose response to the allegation is closely monitored. If my Department is not satisfied with the response, the matter is referred to the director of community care of the relevant health board. In the case of allegations made directly to school authorities, present procedures also require all such allegations to be brought immediately to the attention of the principal or the chairperson of the board of management. Thereafter the procedures allow for an element of judgment on the part of the school authorities as to whether the allegation is based on reasonable grounds before the matter is referred to the health authorities. The introduction of mandatory reporting would alter that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department keeps the procedure relating to allegations of abuse under regular review. A working party, representative of the education partners, is already examining the existing guidelines on abuse to make sure that they represent a comprehensive and fully updated response to this issue. Representatives of the health boards have joined the working party. In addition, officials of my Department are participating in the working group established by the Minister for Health and <Col N="1252" /> Children to review procedures generally in this area. This working group is expected to report in the near future, following which my Department will adapt and reissue the guidelines to schools and Department staff.</P>
    <P>In announcing the range of measures relating to child abuse on 11 May, the Taoiseach reaffirmed the Government's commitment to producing a White Paper on mandatory reporting as soon as possible. My Department will make whatever adaptations are necessary to existing procedures both at Department and school level, in light of the structure established arising from the White Paper.</P>
    <P>There are approximately 46,000 files and records in my Department relating to the old industrial and reformatory schools. These files and records go back as far as the last century and their content varies very significantly in terms of detail. My Department also has a significant number of files dealing with policy issues relating to the operation of the industrial and reformatory school system. These files deal with a range of matters relating to the general operation of the facilities, including issues relating to funding, staffing and inspection.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional information.</i>The commission into childhood abuse will receive wholehearted support and co-operation from my Department and will have full access to any file it requires as part of its work. I have arranged to appoint a professional researcher to draw from the Department's archives all files which would assist the commission. This researcher will also assess the material on the files and will advise me on the contents.</P>
    <P>In addition, I have asked officials of my Department to review procedures for making files available to individuals concerning their time in industrial and reformatory schools with a view to making the files more accessible. In general, the approach of my Department regarding our records on industrial and reformatory schools is to co-operate as fully as possible with researchers and others who have a bona fide interest in them. In that context, the makers of the programme &ldquo;States of Fear&rdquo; received the complete co-operation of my Department. The only restriction placed upon access is that files which contain personal details of former residents of the school were not and are not made available in the interests of protecting the privacy to which these people are entitled, and neither are the files relating to current Garda investigations made available.</P>

Schools operate a <i>de facto </i>mandatory reporting system. However, the Department of Health and Children has established a working party to review procedures for dealing with allegations of child abuse in every sector of society and in every organisation which has reponsibility for children. It makes sense for the Department of Education and Science to tie in with the recommendations of the Department of Health and Children, which are due shortly.</P>

That said, the commission is to inquire into the overall question and it would be wise to await the recommendations of the commission. If the commission <Col N="1254" /> makes recommendations in that regard, they will be reported.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the files of the Kennedy committee into industrial and reformatory schools are reported as missing; the efforts, if any, he has made to locate and recover the files; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am fully aware of the reports to which the Deputy refers. As I indicated to the House on Thursday last, my Department is making every effort to establish whether additional files or records relating to the work of the Kennedy Committee still exist within my Department. In the event of any such files or records being located, I intend that their content will be placed in the public domain to the maximum extent possible.</P>
      <P>The House will appreciate that prior to the introduction of the National Archives Act, 1986, and during the period now under discussion, practices relating to keeping files and records were not as well developed as they are today. My Department retains approximately 46,000 files and records relating to the old industrial and reformatory schools. These files and records go back to the last century and their content varies very significantly in terms of detail. Some files relate to individual children. Others deal with a range of policy issues relating to the general operation of the facilities, including issues relating to funding, staffing and inspection.</P>
      <P>A number of files relate specifically to the establishment of the Kennedy committee, the outcome of the committee's work and the action taken to give effect to the committee's recommendations. Further files have been identified which deal with matters relating to child care and which would have been relevant to the work of the Kennedy committee.</P>
      <P>In recent years professional archivists have compiled a database of the files on behalf of the Department. The files in question are made available for inspection by researchers with the exception of files which involve personal details and names of children and files which relate to matters which are the subject of current Garda investigations.</P>
      <P>Also, as I advised the House on Thursday last, I have arranged for the appointment of a professional researcher to draw from the Department's archives all files which would assist the commission which is now being established to inquire into childhood abuse, to assess the material on those files and to advise me on their contents. As part of this process, the task of identifying all files and materials which relate to the work of the Kennedy committee and are still in existence, will continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1255" /> I also advised the House that I met the surviving members of the Kennedy committee to discuss its work. While the members of the committee believe the working files of the committee did not contain great detail relating to instances of abuse they will, if found, be made available in the same way as other files relating to these issues have been. Full access and assistance was given by my Department to RTE researchers in the preparation of the &ldquo;States of Fear&rdquo; programme and I would be glad to arrange similar access for Deputies if they so wish.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional information.</i>The policy of the Kennedy committee on visiting the schools was described to me as being based on familiarisation rather than inspection. The members collectively visited the bigger institutions and visited others in small groups. While they wrote reports on institutions, the reports did not comprise detailed observations, rather they included general impressions. The committee identified the use of corporal punishment in Daingean reformatory school. District Justice Kennedy wrote to the Department on this and other matters. The use of corporal punishment in Daingean was also the subject of correspondence between the then Secretary of the Department of Justice and the Department of Education, the details of which I placed on the record of the House on Thursday, 13 May last.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister confirm that the Department of Education and Science provided a secretary to the committee who was assisted by a person who also functioned as secretary to the subcommittees? Does he agree it would be extraordinary if files were not kept on those whom the committee met? Does he also agree that it would be in the public interest to know the matters on which files were prepared and are now missing? For example, are files available that support appendix E of the Kennedy report &ndash; the survey conducted by the Department? Is all the data available on the psychological survey conducted by Dr. O'Doherty, University College, Dublin?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>On the latter two points, the data is not available. The members of the Kennedy committee did not inspect the facilities, rather they formed general impressions upon which they compiled reports, which are not available either. It may be the case that other committees and bodies did work in the past and whose files are not available but I am retaining an open mind until I receive further details from the researcher appointed. Much of the material is not on file.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of steps are being taken to address the weaknesses identified in the delivery of remedial education at primary level revealed in the recent report, Study of Remedial Education in Irish Primary Schools. The summary report on the study has been issued to all schools. Principals, including those of schools in designated areas of educational disadvantage, have been requested to convene a meeting with their remedial teachers, staffs and board of management to discuss the content of the report and the steps they should take at school level to implement the recommendations. This whole school approach to planning will have particular significance in schools in designated areas of educational disadvantage. In recognition of this I have decided to allocate significant funding to assist school development planning in these schools. I will announce an initiative on school development planning shortly. An important focus of this planning will be to address the needs of pupils with serious literacy and other learning difficulties initially in schools in disadvantaged areas and in all schools eventually.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1257" /> I have acted on the recommendation in the report to have the guidelines on remedial education revised. A small representative committee has been established to do this work. I have asked the committee to have the revised guidelines prepared by the end of June 1999. The revised guidelines should ensure there is clarity about the aims of remedial education and the population of pupils for whom it is intended. Particular attention will be focused in the revised guidelines on the needs of schools in designated areas of educational disadvantage. This will help to ensure the remedial education services will be directed at those pupils who need them most.</P>
    <P>Innovations in best practice will also be incoporated in this revision of the remedial education guidelines. They will include advice on the approaches used in the Success for All programme referred to in the report which is a school wide restructuring programme designed specifically for schools with large numbers of disadvantaged pupils.</P>
    <P>The general improvements recently announced in the staffing of primary schools, coupled with the £6.5 million allocated to schools for the purchase of library books, will be of major benefit in raising reading standards. Under this scheme larger grants have been allocated to the schools in disadvantaged areas. A booklet entitled Book Choice was issued to every school recently with guidelines on selecting books for school and class libraries. I will soon announce a range of national reading initiatives which will take place later this year. The aim of the initiatives will be to increase reading standards and reduce the number of students who leave school with a poor level of literacy.</P>
    <P>The revised curriculum in English has a major emphasis on the development of literacy skills and focuses particularly on the prevention of reading difficulties, especially in areas of disadvantage. The implementation of the revised curriculum will be supported by a comprehensive programme of in-service education for teachers and is expected to have a major impact on raising literacy standards.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the scale of the problem the Minister's response is inadequate. Is he aware that the report shows that a massive 85 per cent of those identified by the principal in disadvantaged schools as in need of remedial support in mathematics are not receiving it? Is he further aware that there is no evidence that children participating in remedial education programmes in disadvantaged schools are advancing from their relative position? Will he agree, therefore, that there is a need to resource the remedial intervention in such schools and that the programme in terms of its organisation and delivery has grown without serious direction?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy's analysis of the report, which speaks for itself. Its recommendations highlight the deficiencies in terms of <Col N="1258" /> concentration on and allocation of resources to the remedial education service. In September, for the first time, every school will have a remedial resource. There is a need to ensure existing resources are used in a focused way and concentrated on those who most need remedial education. In this context the initiative on school development planning is of critical importance. It will ensure proper, effective and focused utilisation of existing resources.</P>

Does he agree that the Department does not provide ongoing in-service training for remedial teachers? The report is highly critical of its technical back-up for the programme. Does the Minister agree that none of the Department's announcements involves resourcing this technical back-up in which there is a need to invest?</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
      <Quest>if the assessment systems used in junior certificate schools programmes and leaving certificate applied programmes are capable of being applied in the traditional streams of these examinations.</Quest>
      <QRef>[13022/99]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The junior certificate school programme is an intervention which operates within the junior certificate and not as an alternative to it. It sets out to make the experience of school relevant and accessible to those young people who find it difficult to cope with the school system and who would benefit from special support in working to the aims of the junior certificate.</P>
      <P>All participants follow courses leading to the foundation level examinations at junior certificate in English and mathematics and other subjects on an optional basis which involves the conventional modes of assessment of the junior certificate.</P>
      <P>In addition, a student profiling system is used. This gives students credit for what they have learned and achieved, including skills and knowledge which are not currently part of the formal junior certificate examination.</P>
      <P>The leaving certificate applied is assessed in three modes: satisfactory completion of modules; performance of student tasks and performance in the terminal examinations. Essentially this approach gives weighting to a series of assessments prior to the terminal examination. These assessments are externally conducted in that they are performed by qualified teachers drawn from other schools. There is no doubt that the leaving certificate applied has contributed significantly to our key objective of providing an educational experience which meets the needs of a wide diversity of students.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the junior certificate and conventional leaving certificate remain heavily focused upon the terminal examination. This focus is at variance with much international practice where continuous assessment of students by their own teachers, suitably moderated, is very much the norm. In this country the issue of teacher assessment has proved to be a long-standing area of difficulty for teachers.</P>
      <P>When introducing the leaving certificate applied it was possible, because of the limited scale of this new programme, to accommodate these concerns by providing a model of continuous assessment which is essentially externally based. Such an approach could not be applied to the junior certificate and leaving certificate examinations at present because of the sheer scale of these examinations and the stark realities of both finite examiner supply and the enormous disruption for schools and students in withdrawing additional large numbers of examiners from their schools to examine in other schools.</P>
      <P>As Minister, I have no difficulty in acknowledging that the current situation is far from satisfactory and in need of both review and reform. I have asked my officials to examine the situation and bring forward proposals for discussion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the last sentence of the Minister's answer because it is quite clear the <Col N="1260" /> review commission will look for significant change in this area. Why does the Minister believe it would not be possible to extend profiling and some element of external modulation beyond the present scale? Surely, that would be one way to overcome the concerns about a teacher being judge in the case of his own pupil, which is the nub of this difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>To be frank, there are very significant logistical implications involved in endeavouring to move to a broad external assessment process for the leaving and junior certificates as they are constituted at present. In other words, we would have to remove hundreds more teachers from schools to go to other schools to externally examine students. The system at present could not accommodate that change. That is a significant factor and there is no point pretending we could do that overnight. We must engage with the partners in education to see if we can, collectively, improve the situation as regards the leaving and junior certificates.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the case that much of the profiling and the module completion is being done internally by teachers assessing pupils and it does not seem to create the difficulties further reform may create? Will the Minister consider sitting down immediately with the unions concerned and exploring this issue? It is a major block to broadening our base of examination to recognise multiple intelligence and so on. The Minister and virtually the entire House are anxious to see reform. If it is a priority, will the Minister face this issue head on and start the process of consultation as a matter of urgency?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am preparing a discussion paper on this subject which I will make available to the partners when it is completed. Nonetheless, it is important to point out that we have three types of examination at leaving certificate level and we do not want to return to a situation where everyone is examined in the same way because it is quite clear there is significant diversity of abilities, talents and strengths within the overall second level cohort. There will always be different methods of assessment of those different talents and abilities. We need a system which can accommodate and assess that diversity. We have made significant progress with the leaving certificate applied. We secured the agreement of the partners in that respect and we must move forward in that context.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
      <Quest>if he will introduce a legal entitlement to an assessment of need for any child with special needs; and if he will make a statement on educational supports necessary to meet the needs and on a commitment by the State to all reasonable efforts to provide the supports specified.</Quest>
      <QRef>[13024/99]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Over the past year and a half a series of moves have been taken by this Government which have reversed years of neglect in the area of special needs provision. We have introduced support schemes based on needs rather than resource constraints and a system of practically enabling assessments is well under way. The statutory entitlement to an assessment is an idea I am not opposed to but we need to avoid putting the cart before the horse. The crucial thing is to be in a position to provide the assessments and to provide the ensuing supports.</P>
      <P>Where the educational needs of a person with a disability are concerned, assessments can play an important role in identifying needs and contributing to the development of an appropriate response. It is for this reason the Government has decided to establish the National Psychological Service Agency. Funding for this new service will be provided through the social inclusion package announced by the Minister for Finance in his Budget Statement 1998.</P>
      <P>The Education Act, 1998, provides the statutory basis for this agency. The agency will have delegated authority to develop and provide an educational psychological service to all students who need such a service in the primary or post primary schools. As part of this development, the recruitment of an additional 25 psychologists is currently under way and it is intended to recruit a further 25 psychologists to the service in the year 2000. The agency will eventually employ up to 200 psychologists as well as the necessary administrative and support staff. It has been agreed to set a target for the provision of a comprehensive service over a five year development period.</P>
      <P>I point out also that the Education Act contains a number of provisions which support the position of the special needs pupil. For example, section 9 provides that each school will have to ensure that the educational needs of all students, including those with a disability or other special education needs, are identified and provided for. Furthermore, section 15 provides that each school board must publish the policy of the school concerning admission to and participation in the school by students with disabilities or other special educational needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recently announced a major new development in special education services under which all children with special educational needs within the primary system are now entitled to an automatic response to those needs. The response may take the form of an extra teacher or child care support, <Col N="1262" /> or both, depending on the needs of the child. As a result of this development, my Department has allocated an additional 46 full-time and 26 part-time resource teachers and an additional 247 special needs assistants to children with special needs.</P>
    <P>Following my announcement, my Department engaged in consultations with the education partners with a view to preparing a circular for issue to primary schools setting out the entitlement to automatic response for special needs pupils and outlining how applications can be made. This work has now been completed and the circular will issue to schools within days.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that I have decided to reduce the pupil teacher ratios in all special schools and special classes catering for children with mild learning disability, children with moderate learning disability, children with emotional disturbance and children with physical disability. These reductions will bring the pupil teacher ratios in all special schools and special classes down to the level recommended by the Special Education Review Committee.</P>
    <P>Combined, these measures are delivering long awaited improvements. They are a practical demonstration of our commitment to provide both assessment and support for children with special needs and they represent a dramatic move away from an approach which was willing to spend large sums on legal costs rather than take action.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not agree that, ultimately, the only way to drive this agenda consistently forward is to recognise the legal right of every child to have his needs assessed and the obligation of the State to deliver? Is it not the case that the State is effectively hiding behind the lack of an assessment to provide less than full support to these children? Does the Minister agree that it is lamentable that his Department has no data on the number of children with special needs or the service they are obtaining? This is something the Minister has frequently accepted. Is it the case that the current approach is not a matter of putting the cart before the horse but rather of live horse and get grass? The Minister must create the statutory obligation and the services will follow because of the legal obligation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I respectfully suggest to the Deputy that the live horse and get grass philosophy was adopted by the Government of which he was a member, which was prepared to allow parents of children with disabilities to go to the Supreme Court before action was taken. My view is that we must show our bona fides in terms of the allocation of resources, the making available of additional posts and, above all, in creating statutory entitlements to education, something provided for in the Education Act. Also, the Government must state that children are entitled to these resources as a matter of right, something we have done following a decision taken by the <Col N="1263" /> Government last November. I have direct experience of the establishment of the national education psychological service. One of the difficulties in recruiting 25 additional psychologists this year will be ensuring we have that number of sufficiently qualified people to take up the posts. Before introducing legislation which we cannot subsequently implement, it is wise and proper to invest money and resources and do everything we possibly can to provide the basic resources and needs to which the children are entitled.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the permanent monument will be in terms of the additional posts and resources allocated. The Deputy should acknowledge that the response of the Judiciary to the Government's initiative has been welcoming and most of the cases are being worked through the courts towards resolution. The courts are continuing to monitor the Government's response, which is a legitimate exercise. However, that does not mean everything has been achieved. We have some distance to travel, but today's announcement, for example, of reducing all teacher ratios in special education classes to those recommended by the special education review body is a further demonstration of our commitment to the issue. It is surprising that the special education review body reported at the beginning of the decade and that it is only today we are in a position to fulfil its recommendations in terms of staff ratios. One must ask why this was not done over the past five or six years.</P>

      <P>In the context of the Good Friday Agreement and its associated treaties and implementation bodies, it is important that as many obstacles as possible to the mobility of workers between the two parts of the island are removed. Reciprocal arrangements for the mutual recognition of the qualifications of teachers in both jurisdictions would constitute an important positive step in this direction. Discussions have been taking place between officers of my Department and representatives of the various education interests <Col N="1264" /> in Northern Ireland with a view to bringing this about.</P>
      <P>At primary level, with a view to agreeing on an all-Ireland approach to the recognition of qualifications in Irish for teachers, discussions have taken place between officers of my Department and the authorities of St. Mary's College of Education, Belfast. Arising from these discussions it has been agreed that graduates of St. Mary's who have Irish as a main subject in their B.Ed. degree will be recognised as being fully qualified to teach in national schools in the Republic without having to sit the scrúdú cáilíochta. It has also been agreed in principle that St. Mary's College would organise a course in professional Irish for those of its students who wish to qualify to teach in the Republic but do not have Irish as a main degree subject. This will be similar to the course in professional Irish taught in the Republic's colleges and will be designed in consultation with Mary Immaculate College of Education, Limerick. Students who successfully complete this course would also be fully recognised to teach in national schools in the Republic. St. Mary's College has also undertaken to examine the feasibility of organising a course designed to prepare teachers not otherwise qualified in Irish to sit the scrúdú cáilíochta. Under the terms of circular 19/96, teachers without qualifications in Irish from Northern Ireland and other parts of the EU may take up posts in national schools in a provisional capacity for up to two years, later extended by me to three years, during which time they must obtain a pass in the scrúdú cáilíochta sa Ghaeilge.</P>
      <P>At second level, teachers who are recognised as being fully qualified in Northern Ireland or elsewhere in the European Union may be granted provisional recognition in the State. This applies to teachers of all subjects taught in our second level schools, including Irish. To qualify for full recognition, such teachers must make up any substantial shortfalls identified in their qualifications by means of either passing an aptitude test or completing an adaptation period not exceeding three years and must satisfy the Irish language requirement. A second level teacher who does not satisfy the Irish language requirement at the time of appointment may be appointed provisionally to a teaching position, subject to obtaining the appropriate qualification within a period of three years.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister accept this is a time for bold steps rather than the painstaking and tortuous negotiations which are being undertaken by his Department? Why do teachers trained in Northern Ireland and teaching in secondary schools in this State need to obtain these special qualifications in Irish if they are not teaching in Irish? What is the point?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, last year I took the bold step in terms of abolishing the written céard teastas examination. I agree with the Deputy that it imposed an undue pressure, <Col N="1265" /> not only on teachers who qualified in Northern Ireland but also on teachers from the Republic, many of whom had to spend weekends away and considerable sums of money endeavouring to perfect knowledge of the examination paper, to learn things off by heart and then sit the examination. The oral Irish examination remains and I am considering that issue.</P>

      <P>The peace process has been ongoing for many months and the time has long passed when we should drag our feet on these issues and have them bogged down. The Minister is a great man for making announcements. I ask him to consider announcing some changes in this area tomorrow when he has a gap in his diary. I know changes would be broadly welcomed as I have had meetings with unions that represent some of the teachers concerned. The unions feel aggrieved at the slow progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I will certainly bear the Deputy's comments in mind, particularly in relation to the timing of announcements in this regard. We have made some progress in relation to the primary sector in terms of our dealings with St. Mary's College. I visited St. Mary's College last year. I was the first Minister from the Republic to do so, something which surprised me. We have had very good co-operation from the college in terms of having Irish as a core part of the college's B.Ed. and facilitating students in not having to sit the scrúdú cáilíochta if they sit the Irish exam in the college.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny)</i>
        <b>:</b> Does the Minister accept that the difficulty in terms of primary schools is very different from that experienced at second level, as Irish is supposed to be a core part of the primary school curriculum, and that while we have not succeeded in having Irish spoken fluently across the country, there is a difference in what is required?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Absolutely. The position regarding Irish is retained as it forms 20 per cent of the revised primary school curriculum. Therefore, proficiency in Irish for national school teachers is essential and cannot be fudged in terms of national objectives. However, Deputy Bruton was speaking about post-primary teachers in community and comprehensive schools who could be teaching woodwork or metal work and who may not have any proficiency in Irish but who still must pass a test in Irish to gain a post. I think Deputies across the House agree that we use common sense and have a reasonable response to such issues.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the continued widespread concern among dyslexic students and their parents regarding his proposed changes to the marking of the 1999 leaving certificate; the reason he considers the proposed marking system preferable to the old system; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>No change has been made this year in relation to how examiners mark the papers of candidates with a specific learning difficulty. The position is and always has been that the work of all candidates in any one subject is marked in accordance with a common marking scheme. This is to ensure uniform and objective criteria are applied to the work of all candidates. This will continue to be the case this year. Students with specific learning difficulties will again have the same marking scheme applied to their work as will apply to the work of all other candidates.</P>
      <P>Complex and inter-related issues arise in relation to assessment of the work of students with specific learning difficulties in our examination system. The heavy reliance on written terminal assessment can clearly create difficulties for those with reading and writing problems. I am aware for instance, from contact with the Association for Adults and Children with Learning Difficulties, of its concern that the examination system and its current modes of assessment is not responsive enough to the needs of students with specific learning difficulties.</P>
      <P>For some time I have been anxious to have a wide-ranging and comprehensive review of the special arrangements which are made at the examinations. Late last year I asked the expert advisory group on examinations &ndash; which I established to provide independent advice on the operation of examinations &ndash; to provide me with a discussion paper for publication and as a basis for a thorough review of our approach in this area. I received the group's report last month.</P>
      <P>I have arranged for the publication and circulation of the discussion paper and in yesterday's national press the expert advisory group invited submissions from interested parties and individuals on the issues identified in the discussion paper and on the operation of special arrangements in general. The discussion paper brings out very strongly the complexity of the issue. In particular, it highlights the tension within our examination system between the need for equal treatment and fairness, on the one hand, and the desire to take account of human circumstances, on the other. The discussion paper also deals expressly with issues which arise in the case of students with specific learning difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Previous reviews of the special arrangements schemes were conducted internally in my Department. I was particularly anxious that this review would be public and open to build a consensus on how best to respond to the needs of the individual student within the constraints imposed by the format of some examinations and the need to maintain full confidence and credibility in our systems of national certification. I was also concerned that <Col N="1267" /> international practice would be considered in the review.</P>
    <P>My aim is to have a further report in the autumn from the expert advisory group, after it has considered any submissions received, so that changes can be in place for the examinations in 2000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that there is a fundamental difference between a similar and an equal system of evaluation? The thrust of the Minister's reply to the parents of dyslexic children suggests it is important to put in place a similar system for all children. However, an equal system would ensure that a child's handwriting difficulties, for example, would be recognised before their examination papers are sent to the first examiner?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>We must have equality in terms of how the marking scheme is applied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, that is the flaw in the Department's logic. The Department is insisting on equality in the system, but we are talking about the equality of children. This would ensure that the child is entitled to indicate the handwriting difficulty, for example, before the marking system highlights it. The child might have to get over a certain set of difficulties to achieve an acceptable level of handwriting. At present, handwriting difficulties are passed from an inspector to a supervising inspector. It is bureaucratic equality rather than child equality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Where there is a difficulty in terms of legibility or readability of an examination paper, it is passed on to a supervising examiner to ensure that every effort is made to give due process to the candidate. There must be a proper review of this complex issue. I have had a number of exhaustive internal discussions to try to reform the system. The expert advisory group I established to look independently at the operation of our examination system has published a discussion paper. It has also referred to the experience in Britain, for example, where a different system is in place. While I have sympathy for many of the candidates involved, I am confident we can reform the system for the examinations in 2000.</P>

    <Col N="1268" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The examiners do not have specific training. Traditionally, where a concern was expressed about the readability of material, it was brought to the attention of the individual examiner. However, in the event of an examiner encountering difficulties in reading the script, the examiner was instructed to send the answer book to his or her supervising examiner. This was to ensure that, notwithstanding any presentation or readability difficulties, every effort was made by the examiner or supervising examiner to ensure the candidate was given full credit for all the work done in accordance with the marking scheme. This year the Department has moved to strengthen this arrangement by instructing all examiners who have a difficulty in accessing the information given by a candidate to refer the script to their supervising examiner.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department established a primary curriculum implementation group and a supporting technical working group some time ago to plan and put in place the training and support services required for successful implementation of the revised primary curriculum. These groups are representative of the partners in the primary education sector. They have done considerable work at this stage and their work is continuing. The revised curriculum is a development from the existing curriculum.</P>
      <P>Arising from the deliberations of these groups, a series of newsletters outlining the strategy proposed for the introduction and implementation of the revised curriculum will be issued to teachers. The first edition of the newsletter was prepared by my Department and was circulated to teachers in March. It was also decided that training would be provided for all primary teachers over a number of years through a primary curriculum support programme, which is currently being put in place. A national co-ordinator for the programme was appointed in 1998 and interviews among primary teachers have recently been completed for posts of assistant national co-ordinator and trainers. The teachers appointed to these posts will be seconded to the programme from 1 September 1999. They will be deployed on a regional basis to provide training during the coming school year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is planned to provide four days out of school training and two days in school training in 1999 and 2000. These will be structured as follows: an overview of the curriculum &ndash; two days out of school followed by one day in school; English for teachers who teach through English &ndash; two days out of school followed by one day in school; or <Col N="1269" /> Irish for teachers who teach through Irish &ndash; two days out of school followed by one day in school.</P>
    <P>As regards resource materials, my Department is considering a document in this area prepared by the NCCA with a view to establishing the requirements in each subject area. Arising from this, a mechanism for providing schools with resource materials will be put in place as appropriate. Teacher guidelines, which form a major part of the curriculum documentation, will provide a significant resource for teachers in implementing the revised curriculum. Each teacher will be provided with these early in the next school year.</P>

      <P>This is a mammoth task. The publication is enormous and has been advertised in the European journal. The teaching guidelines represent a significant additional resource for teachers in primary schools. Their content is better than anything we had before. It is important that the guidelines focus more on teaching rather than on the content of the subjects. I have had a number of briefings with the NCCA team who have been working on this for some time. One of the more significant factors of this revised programme is that the teaching guidelines focus on methodology, approach and attitude to teaching which will be of significant benefit to teachers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>There are guidelines in the new curriculum. We are moving away from the obsession that children must read books at four years of age. There will be a strong emphasis on oral communication as a prelude to the formal mechanics of reading. There will be clear guidelines for teachers on how they should approach the teaching of reading to young children. I have had discussions with the team involved and I am happy and impressed with the approach. People may have different views on this issue and I have no doubt we will have a robust debate when the guidelines are launched. I support the child centred approach, which allows the child to be creative, to develop and to have confidence, rather than pushing material at them and telling them to learn it.</P>

It is not as if everything has changed or the content of every single subject has changed overnight. There are more significant changes in some subjects as opposed to other subjects. The programme for in-service training is drawn up between Departments. The implementation group is made up of representatives of the teacher unions, management bodies and parents along with the Department working on a team approach to the in-service issue.</P>

      <P>In 1995 approval was given to a proposal to amalgamate two secondary schools in Tralee, Meanscoil Eoin Baiste, Balloonagh and St. Mary's secondary school, Moyderwell into a co-educational secondary school. the new school, to be named Mounthawk Mercy secondary school, will cater for a long-term projected enrolment of 1,000 pupils. As a consequence of this decision, it is necessary to provide modern purpose built accommodation in Tralee. Architectural planning of the proposed new project commenced in 1997 with the appointment of a design team.</P>
      <P>The stage 3, developed sketch scheme, of the architectural planning process has been fully completed and formally approved by staff in the building unit of my Department since October 1998. Currently, stage 4, detail design is awaited. It is anticipated that this submission shall be lodged with my Department before the end of June 1999.</P>
      <P>The capital provision for second level school building has been almost doubled since I took office and this means the project can proceed to completion as quickly as possible. At this stage, it is anticipated that the project shall have fully completed architectural planning and be ready to go for construction in May 200l with a target opening date of September 2001.</P>
      <P>This project will qualify for the new arrangements in regard to building grants which I announced last January. These arrangements will mean savings to the conductors of the school and the local community of well in excess of £500,000.</P>

      <P>I understand that each of the seven universities offer sports scholarships to third level students who are particularly talented in a sporting area. These scholarships are funded by the universities with assistance from sporting bodies and private sponsorship. In the current academic year there are 184 students in receipt of sports scholarships and bursaries from the universities. These scholarships provide assistance towards expenses incurred by the students while pursuing <Col N="1272" /> their sport, such as travel and accommodation costs for competitions and treatment of sport injuries.</P>

This scheme provides both financial and non-financial support, to assist Ireland's high performance players and athletes realise their potential to perform successfully at the highest levels of international sport. Players and athletes who are over 16 years of age are eligible to apply for assistance under the scheme. In 1998 support funding was allocated to more than 150 sportspersons under this scheme, 90 of whom were players and athletes under 23 years of age in the junior and developmental groups. The cost of funding the national governing bodies and the carding scheme in 1998 was in excess of £5 million.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the education sector alone, places in third <Col N="1278" /> level have increased by 8,000 in only two years and by 4,000 with regard to post-leaving certificate courses. These represent increases of 9 per cent and 22 per cent respectively. An unprecedented number of places and diversity of courses are now available throughout the country and represent the driving force behind our economic development. I am sure everyone in the House welcomes this expansion of opportunity and would wish to see it further built upon.</P>
    <P>The essential point for us to address is that it is not enough just to provide the resources for places. All international experience shows we must be vigilant to ensure that we are genuinely providing flexible and appropriate opportunities and are protecting the quality of qualifications. Based on this idea, and resting on the four pillars of access, transfer, progression and quality, the Bill before the House will make a major contribution to the future development of our country.</P>
    <P>The need for a more cohesive, coherent and effective system of certification for higher education and training and further education and training has been both recognised and endorsed by successive Governments and by the European Union, which also supports it as part of the current Operational Programme for Human Resources. Over the past seven years a series of reports has reiterated and endorsed this need. The 1992 Green Paper on Education, proposed that a new council for educational and vocational awards should be established. The National Economic and Social Council's report, &ldquo;Education and Training Policies for Economic and Social Development&rdquo;, published in 1993, welcomed this proposal to establish a national education and training certification body. The 1993 report on the National Education Convention recorded widespread approval for such a national awards framework.</P>
    <P>The EU funded Operational Programme for Human Resources Development, which is now in place, endorsed the policy for the setting up of an integrated certification board. The proposal that emerged at that time was for a national education and training certification board. It was envisaged that such a board would take over the certifying functions of vocational education and training institutions and provide a structure for the formal involvement of industry and the social partners in programme development and assessment of vocational training programmes, other than those provided in universities, in the education and training sectors. The Operational Programme only directly concerns the programmes that are funded under it and through the European Structural Funds.</P>
    <P>The White Paper on Education published in 1995 announced that the then Government had approved the establishment of Teastas, the Irish National Certification Authority. These concerns and considerations were supported in the White Paper on Human Resource Development, published in May 1997. The Green Paper on Adult <Col N="1279" /> Education, &ldquo;Adult Education in an Era of Lifelong Learning&rdquo;, published in November 1998, outlines further the Government's support for the development of a national framework of qualifications and the role it can play.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Bill, however, are reflective not just of national concerns in the area of education and training, but of a much wider concern about how the skill needs of industry, business and society at large can be met in the 21st century. This gives rise to another issue &ndash; how can our present resources and endeavours be more effectively harnessed in meeting these concerns? Such concerns are not merely national but truly international in terms of their dimension and resolution.</P>
    <P>The effects and impact of change are now global in character in the sense that their implications for education and training are similar in the developed world. Although education and training systems and structures may differ from country to country, the impact of global change will require similar responses. The seminal question is how existing systems and methods of education and training can be made to respond effectively to such global change. Part of the answer lies in having a sense of purpose and an appreciation of definite objectives. Never before has the world community experienced what is termed the &ldquo;massification&rdquo; and profusion of education and training now being demanded. The Bill must be seen in this context and has emerged against this background.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware of the work of the Dearing review in the UK which pointed to the extensive damage which can be caused by a <i>laissez-faire</i>, &ldquo;one size fits all&rdquo; approach to education. The review's essential point was that academic drift and official neglect had seriously damaged Britain's competitiveness. One of its most important recommendations referred to protecting the different levels of awards through a framework of quality control and progression between levels.</P>
    <P>The establishment of national bodies to set up and maintain qualification systems so as to ensure standards and meet the future skills needs of economies and societies has been a feature of education and training developments over the past decade. The National Skills Standards Board in the United States, the New Zealand Qualifications Authority and the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority in the United Kingdom are some examples of the endeavours of Governments and those involved in education and training to bring greater cohesion and openness to national systems of awards and qualifications.</P>
    <P>National qualification frameworks have been established in Australia and New Zealand in the past decade. A key aim of the introduction of a new framework is to promote international recognition of awards and international mobility. By putting in place a national framework, it will be possible to link with other countries where <Col N="1280" /> qualifications frameworks have been developed or are developing. This will in turn help to bring a new international dimension to our education and training system and may help to put us to the fore in the development of international policies in that regard.</P>
    <P>A further aim of the Bill is that standard setting for Irish awards is put in an international context and informed by internationally accepted standards. We must strive to ensure that the standards of our awards are at least equal to the highest international standards and the international liaison function of the authority will ensure this.</P>
    <P>Discussion on the Bill also builds on the work of Teastas, the Irish National Certification Authority, which was established as an interim authority in September 1995 and issued its first report in January 1997. Its second report, published in January 1998, recommended the development of an overarching qualifications authority to act as the ultimate guarantor of the quality of the higher and further education and training system outside the seven existing universities, as well as to ensure cohesiveness and flexibility throughout education and training through the development and promotion of ladders and linkages between the various strands of education and training.</P>
    <P>The report went on to recommend the establishment of two new awarding bodies &ndash; the national institute of technology for higher education and training, and the national certification council for further and continuing education and training outside the third-level sector. The report further recommended that the Dublin Institute of Technology be a third awarding body within the framework. I again express my appreciation and thanks for the major contribution made by the chairperson, board and staff of Teastas to this process. The task given to Teastas was arduous but it was fulfilled admirably. Following the publication of the second Teastas report I hosted, in February last year, a forum on the development of a national qualifications framework. The principal stakeholders in education and training attended the forum where the issues and proposals involved were discussed fully.</P>
    <P>As will be evident from what I have said, a considerable amount of time and energy has already been expended in addressing those issues and concerns dealt with by the Bill. As is evident from the reports cited above and the continuous commitment at Government and EU level, there was a general consensus over recent years that much can be gained from the establishment and development of a national framework of qualifications and the benefits which will accrue to both learners and providers, as well as industry, business and the wider community.</P>
    <P>The underlying support for such a development was evident from the debate in the Seanad. While varying approaches may be adopted reflecting different concerns and while interested parties may have particular reservations or requirements, there is an underlying consensus among those involved in education and training of the desir<Col N="1281" /> ability and efficacy of such a framework. I have no doubt but that members of this House will have much to say on these matters. For my part, I assure Deputies that I will listen to what they have to say with an open mind. My aim and concern, which I know is shared by all Members of this House, is to ensure a legislative underpinning for the establishment and development of a framework of qualifications which will enable all persons engaged in the activity of learning, wherever or whenever it takes place, to achieve their full potential, not only in terms of their education and career paths but also in the context of lifelong learning.</P>
    <P>The principal aims of the Qualifications (Education and Training) Bill are: first, to establish and develop standards of knowledge, skill or competence; second, to promote the quality of further education and training and higher education and training; third, to provide a system for co-ordinating and comparing education and training awards and, fourth, to promote and maintain procedures for access, transfer and progression. The individual student is central to the thrust and purpose of the Bill. The term &ldquo;learner&rdquo; is used in the Bill with a definite purpose. When we speak of learners in this context, we are not just speaking of learners in educational or training institutions or those involved in what might be described as formal learning situations, but rather of learners as defined in the Bill. In other words, a learner is a person who is acquiring or has acquired knowledge, skill or competence regardless of how, when or where that takes or took place. Learners may be students in educational institutions, workers in the workplace, participators in community activity or independent learners.</P>
    <P>As a corollary to this, students and workers accessing education and training are not dealt with in a separate manner in the Bill. Education and training institutions, providers and certifying bodies have a long and distinguished record of striving to meet the needs and aspirations of learners. Equally, learners have benefited enormously from the expertise and endeavour that resides in such institutions, providers and certification bodies. What has perhaps been lacking somewhat to date is a coherent and cohesive overall structure of education and training awards. It is this which this Bill, through the establishment and development of a national framework of qualifications and routes for access, transfer and progression, is seeking to achieve. I am convinced that there are great benefits in this for both learners and providers. A coherent and cohesive system of national awards will ensure security and clarity for both learners and providers, enabling both in their respective ways to make informed choices and to plan ahead.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill all providers of education and training will now have to inform learners of the transfer and progression routes available to them when they undertake a course. Such transfer and progression routes will form a comprehensive and <Col N="1282" /> transparent network that will greatly assist learners in determining and pursuing education, training and career paths.</P>
    <P>The new arrangements will also ensure that throughout the education and training sector, learners can have full confidence in the quality of the programmes they are undertaking. Guaranteeing the quality of programmes and the efficacy of access, transfer and progression is predicated on appropriate standards of knowledge, skill or competence being set and mechanisms being in place to ensure that these standards are met.</P>
    <P>It is not possible, nor do I consider it desirable, to set out in precise detail the components or parameters of a framework of qualifications in the Bill. Such an approach would have the effect of predetermining and petrifying the framework. The establishment and development of such a framework will be an onerous task, requiring expert knowledge and application, and it cannot be achieved within a short timeframe; it is also a task which is not appropriate to legislation. I am convinced that the most reasonable and feasible approach is to set out in legislation where responsibility lies for establishing and developing the framework and to put mechanisms in place to ensure that it can be continually revised and updated.</P>
    <P>The most important body for whose establishment the Bill provides is the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland. As will be apparent, the authority is the keystone of the structure set out in this Bill. It will have an overarching role and responsibility in ensuring that the various components of the system as outlined in the Bill &ndash; the framework of qualifications, the standards of awards, the quality of education and training provided and greater opportunities for all learners &ndash; are established and maintained in a consistent and open manner so as to meet not alone the needs but also the aspirations of the wider community.</P>
    <P>The authority will have three principal objects: the establishment and maintenance of a framework of qualifications for the development, recognition and award of qualifications based on standards of knowledge, skill or competence to be acquired by learners; the establishment, promotion and maintenance of the standards of awards of the further and higher education and training sector, other than in the existing universities; the promotion and facilitation of access, transfer and progression throughout the span of education and training provision.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides for the establishment of two new awarding bodies, the Further Education and Training Awards Council and the Higher Education and Training Awards Council. These will be the awarding councils which will make national certification available for all education and training in the State, other than that provided in the primary and post-primary sectors, the Dublin Institute of Technology and the universities. I wish to stress that any provider of education and training regardless of the source of that provision, <Col N="1283" /> whether it be in an educational institution, the workplace or the community, can apply to the further council or the higher council for validation of a programme.</P>
    <P>A provider of a programme of education and training is defined in the Bill as &ldquo;a person who, or body which, provides, organises or procures a programme of education and training&rdquo;. A programme of education and training is defined as &ldquo;any process by which learners may acquire knowledge, skill or competence and includes courses of study or instruction, apprenticeships, training and employment&rdquo;. The intent is to facilitate ready and flexible access for providers of education and training so as to enable them to have their programmes validated where the relevant awarding council is of the view that such programmes meet the necessary criteria for validation.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Bill will not predetermine who should provide education and training. It is my hope that the Bill will, and indeed should, bring providers closer together to ensure there are clear and developed linkages between the various levels and sources of provision. The nature and content of the provision will in all events change somewhat over time and nothing in this Bill will impede this. Instead, it will facilitate and give coherence to such developments.</P>
    <P>The framework of qualifications will ensure that access, progression and transfer arrangements for learners will be provided between and within levels of awards throughout the education and training sector. The providers of education and training encompassed by the Bill will be the implementers of these arrangements. Such arrangements will not alone promote access and opportunities for all learners but will also provide greater coherence for providers in planning and delivering education and training.</P>
    <P>The establishment and development of such a framework will not be an easy task and can only be achieved if the various stakeholders involved in education and training are fully committed to making it work. However, the development of such a framework has inherent advantages for both learners and providers in enabling both, in their respective ways, to achieve their full potential.</P>
    <P>It will also be open to learners to approach the new awarding councils to seek certification or recognition for their existing knowledge, skill or competence. This will effectively allow individual learners to approach the further council or the higher council directly with a view to having an award which they have achieved in whatever capacity recognised by the council. It will also allow for individual learners, perhaps with no formal qualifications but with considerable knowledge or experience gained in the workplace or in some other capacity, to approach the council with a view to receiving a relevant award.</P>
    <P>The intent of this section is to allow for the formal recognition of learning and experience by <Col N="1284" /> individuals which heretofore has not been adequately catered for in the education and training system. It will be a matter for the new awarding councils to determine how this prior learning and prior experiential learning can be assessed and they may seek the assistance of providers of education and training in this regard.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides strict criteria for the delegation of authority from the Higher Education and Training Awards Council to make higher education and training awards, within the framework of qualifications, to institutes of technology who may seek such powers. Similarly, provision is also made for delegation of authority from the Further Education and Training Awards Council to FÁS, CERT or Teagasc in respect of further education and training awards should they seek it.</P>
    <P>The concept of delegated authority derives from the fact that the institutions and bodies I mentioned have a long and much valued tradition in the provision of education and training and, to a certain extent, in making awards. The concept of allowing them certain autonomy, subject to the relevant provisions of the Bill, is an acknowledgement of the experience and expertise which they have garnered over the years and the State's and the wider community's recognition of this. As well as allowing for greater autonomy, it will also involve greater responsibility and a recognition that only through partnership and subsidiarity can the objects of the Bill be attained.</P>
    <P>The arrangement for delegation of authority in the technological sector of higher education and training also take cognisance of the fact that transitional arrangements will be necessary to provide for the necessary steps to be taken arising from the work of the interim review group chaired by Professor Dervilla Donnelly. As a result of provisions in the Bill I will give effect to the recommendation of the group that both Waterford and Cork Institutes of Technology have authority delegated from the Higher Education and Training Awards Council to make awards within the national framework of qualifications in relation to programmes at the levels of certificate and diploma. In addition they and other institutes will be able to seek further delegation and achieve same through an objective review process.</P>
    <P>I congratulate Waterford and Cork on their excellent work and the recognition which they have received through the review process and I look forward to being able to approve the charters which will confirm their delegated authority. The arrangements set out in the Bill for the development of the technological sector are directed at meeting two key objectives of the Government. These key objectives are to guarantee that the sector will continue to meet the needs of their existing students and future students as well as the needs of the economy and society as a whole and to facilitate and give scope for the future development of the sector.</P>
    <P>In essence, the Bill provides for a process, which will be both detailed and exacting, whereby <Col N="1285" /> institutes of technology have the opportunity for further development. The Bill also provides that an institute of technology may be established following a positive outcome to an independent review process and where the Higher Education Authority is in support of such a proposal.</P>
    <P>Part V of the Bill sets out the principal provisions in relation to the Dublin Institute of Technology. The role of the institute under the Bill will be to facilitate and assist the qualifications authority to implement procedures for access, transfer and progression as determined by the authority and to put in place new statutory arrangements for quality assurance.</P>
    <P>The power of the institute to make awards will in no way be affected by this Bill. The intent is to ensure that the institute is an integral component of the framework of qualifications as recommended by the second report of Teastas. Given its history, its breadth of provision and its status as one of the largest providers of higher and further education in the country, its inclusion in the framework of qualifications is both central and crucial to its development and success.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Institute of Technology is a unique third level institution in this State and the new statutory arrangements set out in the Bill will ensure the institute will continue to play a central and dynamic role in the technological sector of higher education.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, the institute has recently been reviewed under section 9 of the Universities Act, 1997 and the Higher Education Authority has issued its recommendations in that regard. I take this opportunity once again to thank the Higher Education Authority and the review group, chaired by Dermot Nally, for the sterling work done in assessing the application of the Dublin Institute of Technology for designation at a university. I also congratulate the institute on the quality of its courses, which is reflected in the comments of the bodies involved in the independent assessment procedure.</P>
    <P>With regard to the university sector, the Bill also sets out a number of provisions to ensure that the existing universities play a key role in the development of new arrangements and procedures. It was not envisaged when Teastas was set up in 1995 that it would have a strong role in the existing universities. Nevertheless, it is essential for the success of this endeavour that the universities are linked as much as possible into the new arrangements and procedures.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that universities will be advised by the Qualifications Authority on the implementation of access, transfer and progression arrangements. Furthermore, the Qualifications Authority will work with the Higher Education Authority in reviewing the implementation of those arrangements and will publish the outcomes of any such review.</P>
    <P>There is nothing in these provisions that would conflict with the principle of academic freedom. Furthermore, I stress that I consider that the Universities Act, 1997, is not amended in its application to the existing universities in this Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1286" /> The Bill also sets out a number of provisions for any new universities, which may be established in future under the provisions of section 9 of the Universities Act. Such a university shall facilitate and assist the Qualifications Authority in its work, implement procedures for access, transfer and progression set out by the Authority and provide it with appropriate information.</P>
    <P> The Bill also provides that in determining money to be allocated to such a university the Higher Education Authority shall ensure there is an appropriate range of education and training provision and may make binding directions with which the university shall comply. These provisions reflect the recommendations in the report of the review group on the application of the Dublin Institute of Technology for university status. In its report, the review group stressed the importance and distinctiveness of multi-level institutions and the need to protect the balance of provision in such institutions so as not to undermine provision for sub-degree level programmes in particular, which have such a crucial role in meeting the skills needs of the future.</P>
    <P>The intent is to introduce a greater dynamic and flexibility into the whole area of higher education. It will enable institutions to aspire to university status without impeding or downgrading the value of the work they have done to date. It will also widen and strengthen the role which the modern university has in contemporary society in meeting the growing needs of lifelong learning as well as the needs of industry, business and the wider community.</P>
    <P>As pointed out in the Nally review, to adopt a simplistic approach to multi-level institutions in the section 9 review process would be extremely damaging and would ignore the very basis for valuing the contribution of these institutions.</P>
    <P>In the context of this Bill, it is appropriate and timely that the issue of protection of learners should be addressed. This is a pressing matter for learners in the commercial education and training sector. The aim of the provisions in this part of the Bill is to put in place protection for learners who avail of education and training provided by bodies established on a commercial profit-making basis. In such instances, learners can be assured that where a programme of more than three months' duration of any such provider leads to an award of either of the two awarding councils, then protections are in place.</P>
    <P>There was much discussion in the Seanad on the nature of the protections that are needed. The Bill sets out that in cases where a programme of education and training cannot be completed, the learner must be refunded the most recent fees paid. In addition to this, the relevant awarding council must endeavour to find a place for the learner on another programme to enable him or her complete the programme concerned. It was agreed in the Seanad that this House would further examine the nature of the protections being proposed and I agreed to facilitate this. The key issue for me is not that the Bill sets out the <Col N="1287" /> detail of the arrangements to be put in place, but that it ensures that appropriate arrangements will be put in place and I look forward to the debate on this issue.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to inform the House that we have been able to agree an amendment to the Bill with the principal private college organisations, which will have the effect of achieving the objective of guaranteeing the right of learners to complete their courses or have their fees refunded. This will be introduced on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The essential point is that the right of every person considering a course, to key information on protection, will be achieved through this Bill and an effective system of bonding for all public awards made in private colleges will also be achieved.</P>
    <P>The Bill will replace effectively the existing National Council for Educational Awards Act. The National Council for Educational Awards has been in place since the early 1970s and has been on a statutory basis since 1979. It has played a vital role in the development of certification for higher education and particularly in the development of the technological sector.</P>
    <P>In this context, I am fully conscious of the tremendous work done over the years by the council and its staff in certification and in making awards. The figure for awards made &ndash; well over 150,000 &ndash; speak eloquently of these endeavours. The intent of this Bill is to ensure continuing good practice and to build upon it to ensure a more cohesive and all-inclusive system of certification and awards. In addition, the position of existing staff members will be protected; it will be enhanced by their being able to participate in a wider framework with the various opportunities which that will present.</P>
    <P>The National Council for Vocational Awards has played a crucial role, on a non-statutory basis, in recent years in developing the further education sector and, in particular, in the development of certification for the important post leaving certificate area and, more recently, in the certification of community education and of programmes for early school leavers. Working with the vocational education committees, the NCVA in this area has played a key role in ensuring the relevance of education and training to the economy and to the wider community.</P>
    <P>The work of the NCEA and the NCVA, as well as that of FÁS, NTCB and Teagasc, will provide a sound and secure base for the development work of the two new awards councils. I will work with these organisations in ensuring the effective implementation of this Bill. It is essential to maintain confidence in and acceptability of national education and training awards. Clearly, there needs to be a continuum between what is happening at present and what will happen under the provisions of this Bill. I am confident that this will be the case.</P>
    <P>One of the major concerns addressed in the Bill is the need for improved partnership, co-oper<Col N="1288" /> ation and cohesion between the education and training sector on the one hand and industry, business and the wider community on the other. One of my main priorities as Minister has been that education and training interests and business interests should work closely together for the mutual benefit of both and for the benefit of society as a whole. We all know that human capital is being continually identified as the key to our present prosperity.</P>
    <P>One of the most crucial tasks facing the Qualifications Authority and the two awarding councils will be the need not alone to inform themselves of the educational and training needs of industry but also to promote practices in education and training to meet those needs.</P>
    <P>This is in no way to suggest that contact and co-operation between the education and training sector and industry has not been a conspicuous feature of education and training for a long time. It would be impossible for bodies such as FÁS, CERT, Teagasc and the institutes of technology to fulfil their remits without continuous co-operation and interaction with the relevant industrial and business sectors. The establishment and development of a national framework of qualifications will act as a greater focus and nucleus around which co-operation between the education and training sector and industry can take on a new dimension where both parties are seen as partners with equal responsibility for guaranteeing the future skills needs of the economy and society at large.</P>
    <P>Co-operation between the education and training sector and industry is a vital component in guaranteeing our future economic and social well-being.</P>
    <P>The provisions of this Bill are enabling rather than prescriptive. In essence, it seeks to assure the quality and standards of education and training, to put in place a coherent and transparent framework for the co-ordination and comparison of awards and to ensure access, transfer and progression for all learners. Positive democratic values underpin the provisions of this Bill &ndash; openness, accountability, practicality, responsibility, equality and a sense of the value and integrity of the learner.</P>
    <P>This is an important Bill, which will provide the framework within which our education and training system can grow in the decades ahead. It is built on national and international learning and will promote access, transfer, progression and quality.</P>
    <P>The debate in the Seanad was very positive and represented a definite contribution to the improvement of this Bill. I hope the debate in this House can achieve the same. I look forward to listening to the contributions of Deputies and to our discussions subsequently in Committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am impressed with the Minister's speech, but the Bill falls short of the aspirations he had for it. There is absolutely no doubt about the importance of a comprehensive <Col N="1289" /> national assessment and certification system. It was singled out as an important gap which needed to be filled as far back as the Culliton Report. This Bill is important. It has three primary functions. The first is to raise standards so we equal and exceed international best practice and anticipate the future needs created by changing technologies and changing conditions in the marketplace. As I will discuss later, none of this foresight is included in the remit of the authority or its two subservient councils.</P>
      <P>The second is to allow seamless progression, especially for those coming from outside the system. The Bill again falls short in this area by excluding the examinations branch of the Minister's Department, which is the acknowledged system of certification and the university sector where the greatest obstacles to progression occur. The third is, rightly, to award qualifications based on skills, knowledge and competence rather than confining recognition to the traditional course-based approach. This is important in the context of the Green Paper on Adult Education which clearly states that community-based adult education is not receiving proper recognition.</P>
      <P>It is equally important to give recognition to employer-based activities. However, the Bill is extraordinarily weak on a mandate for expanding into these new areas of community-based adult education and employer-based training. It is very much cast in the traditional mould of providers and certifiers to which we have become accustomed over the years.</P>
      <P>Looking at this Bill, I am reminded of the quote by Brendan Behan where the first item on the agenda was the split. This concept was not long in train when the unified structure went out the window. In its place we have three bodies, not one. It is a somewhat classic Irish solution to a problem. When one is trying to achieve the unification of a framework and a single, coherent approach, one ends up with two bodies and someone trying to hold them together to stop them diverging in opposite directions, which is what this Bill has achieved. There is a proud history of this, as a similar case arose in the area of industrial development. The Culliton report recommended fewer bodies but instead we adopted the camel approach, so to speak, to industrial development. We are repeating the same mistakes in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will probably say we have to live in reality and provide for what we can get through. I have no doubt there was a strong defence of traditional positions which probably resulted in two bodies and someone trying to keep them together. However, if we lose the gains of the unified structure, what will we achieve? We have also lost the track record built up by the two main pre-existing structures. There is a risk that we will end up with the worst of all worlds. We do not have a unified structure and we are also trying to introduce entirely new bodies to supersede what was already there. The argument could <Col N="1290" /> be made that these bodies, the NCVA and the NCEA, had established a track record and a certain amount of international recognition. The new bodies will have to enter the same race to try to win the recognition their predecessors had achieved.</P>
    <P>I do not see the purpose of this divide and it was not rationalised in the Minister's contribution. There is not even a definition of the boundary line between further and higher education. It seems someone decides it and it is, as they say, like Alice in wonderland. There is not even a system of appeal if one is mistakenly designated in the wrong area. The traditional forces insisted on the division and there will be an uneasy development as a result.</P>
    <P>The idea of this Bill was to establish a unified structure. There was the well-established conventional route of the leaving certificate, the CAO and the universities. As I understood it, we were trying to achieve a single framework within which the non-conventional routes would evolve into a relationship with the established route. However, the two sectors with a strong track record and which are often the source of the barriers in our system, as universities refuse access because they have an established system through points and the CAO, are left out. Once this happens, we will immediately sell ourselves short. I know this problem predates the Minister. However, the decision to have two bodies instead of one has probably reinforced it. I have no doubt that the real barriers to a seamless progression are not in the institutes of technology but in universities which do not have the tradition of recognising anything other than the established points system of access.</P>
    <P>We are accepting this separation in the hope that some credible parallel with the leaving certificate and university system can be developed. This is very much a second best model. Others outside the House have made the point that at least the NCEA had a statutory comparator in the university structure, which has been removed in this Bill. We are creating a more difficult task for ourselves.</P>
    <P>The key to the success of the work of these bodies is the extent to which they see themselves as pushing out the frontiers. This is about, first, raising standards to achieve and exceed best international practice, second, innovation in the development of recognition for experience, which is just as valuable in the school of life as the skills acquired from book learning and courses and, third, the concept of lifelong learning which is at the heart of our educational development for the future.</P>
    <P>Apart from the token inclusion on the NQA of one person with international experience, there is scarcely any mention in the Bill of the rapidly changing environment of international best practice in which all of this is taking place. The objectives of the authority are framed in static terms. The tone is one of quality control rather than engaging in a process of total quality manage<Col N="1291" /> ment. We need more dynamic measures which pioneer best practice in both content and teaching methods.</P>
    <P>It surprised me that the approach to this very much validates the work already going on among providers. If someone is establishing a course, he or she applies to these new bodies for a stamp of approval. It would have been better to establish a national standard, for example, of what constitutes computer applications, to define best practice and the intended direction and then tell providers they must reach that standard. That is the approach which should have been enshrined in this Bill. Instead we have the old system of certifying what is already taking place. I remember when the White Paper on Human Resources was being formulated this was one of the fears in the then Department of Enterprise and Employment. I know the Minister will refer to other sections of the Bill which must provide for other responsibilities, but it must be mindful of the needs of industry etc. Rather than institutions putting programmes in place which are validated by the authority, Ireland should have a national standard, similar to that in Scotland, which must be attained by anyone who aspires to achieve a certain recognition. If one does not attain it, one should not receive certification. The difference in approach is fundamental because if the Minister sets a national standard, each year he will point out what is happening in Germany, Spain, Portugal or the USA and claim that Ireland must change. He will say to the providers that they are not cutting it if they are not doing certain things. I do not believe that is provided for in the Bill, but I may have misread it. We will debate it in greater detail on Committee Stage. This is a fundamental weakness which has as much to do with changing the legislation as the mandate the body will have later.</P>
    <P>Quality assurance is couched in the quality control arena and the Bill states that an individual programme which seeks certification must pass muster in terms of quality assurance, but even more important is the capacity of the entire institution to be responsive to the challenges it faces. It is not just a case of checking what is happening to the computer applications course in a particular institution but the way in which the institution develops education through its access polices, etc.. The concept of quality assurance should go further than that.</P>
    <P>It is strange that the council will not have the capacity to carry out its own assessment but will always work on second hand assessments produced by the college and delivered back to it. It will then comment on them and issue directives. Should the council not have the power to carry out its own assessment if it believes procedures are awry? There would be greater dynamism if the council developed methodologies of quality assurance and drove them in the system rather than sit back and wait to see what a college does, how it certifies its computer applications course <Col N="1292" /> and the international people it has on board to do that. The system would be much better if it contained a dynamic council capable of carrying out its own quality assurance assessment on its own initiative or, perhaps, in the event of third party complaints. I would prefer that difference in emphasis and approach.</P>
    <P>I am surprised employers or industry are not mentioned in the Bill. They have a huge relevance in terms of material and learning methods. There is a correct emphasis on the role of students who participate, and so on, but it is very important that the relevance to the subsequent user is part of a quality control assessment. I will consider tabling amendments in this regard on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I hope that access to life long learning is opened up for people who did not partake in the leaving certificate process, such as early school leavers, pre-1968 cohorts which did not have access to free education and those who for one reason or another did not receive book learning certification. The authority will have a role in determining procedures for access. &ldquo;Procedures&rdquo; is an extraordinarily dead word, which is not defined in the Bill. It brings to mind forms, replies and due process but not policies to enable access for students from different backgrounds, such as those which did not come through the leaving certificate system. It does not bring to mind how many places will be awarded from the limited number available to non-conventional and CAO applicants.</P>
    <P>The NQA seems to have a narrow remit whereby an institution must have a procedure in place and be able to say there are certain progression routes from this course to something else. It must not have forms which automatically exclude people who do not have the leaving certificate. The authority and the council should have much more proactive remits to inform institutions that their job is to facilitate life long learning and find ways in which the colleges and certification under its control embrace people who could benefit. The Minister stated that it was open to anyone to apply to the council. Can one imagine an individual who has worked as a carpenter for years wanting to get himself certified and applying to the council to have a stamp of approval on his experience so that it is recognised? That will not happen. The language in the Bill is partly to blame for this, but the mindset behind it must also change whereby the remit of the council and the authority should be proactive so that they seek out opportunities to do this. I am surprised the Bill did not include sections on how to recognise experiential learning and the community based adult education sector. I am aware the Minister rightly does not want to set down a framework that would become petrified after a number of years, but their task, which is to create a dynamic framework, must be explicitly included in the Bill. A mandate must be given to them to do this and it must be set out much more clearly in the Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1293" /> The position regarding employers is similar. All of us are aware that youngsters leave school early. The Minister announced recently that the level of early school leaving is rising because young people are attracted by good jobs. The ambition of 100 per cent retention in education is becoming less realistic. People are taking up employment and, therefore, we must examine how contact between the education system and those who enter the workplace early can be maintained. That involves approaching employers to promote and develop on the job training and the recognition process. The Bill does not explicitly refer to that area. The Minister will say it is included by inference because the authority and the council can do that, but this area is not being developed. The institutes of technology, universities and other providers are well able to look after themselves and they will feel their interests are catered for, whereas the authority and the council must have a proactive mandate to develop the interests of those who leave school and take up employment or, ultimately, return to community based adult education. It needs to be much more clearly spelt out in the Bill rather than confined to an also-ran category which will be tackled after these bodies have gone through the mammoth task of repackaging and stamping all the activities in this field at present.</P>
    <P>The authority needs to have an active mandate to identify the blockages and gaps in the system which prevent people from taking steps forward. It should pilot measures to deal with this, encourage colleges to be innovative in the way they address these problems and force flexible provision. All of us are aware of the inflexibility in the system. Third level institutions are only beginning to exploit technology to offer more distance learning and flexibility in the provision of courses at different times of the day to suit peoples' schedules. That agenda has not been pushed vigorously enough. As pupil numbers fall, the penny will suddenly drop and these institutions will realise they must be more innovative if they want to attract people. We should not wait for a number of years when a scarcity of students will drive them to be more proactive in this area. We should use this legislation to force more flexible provision of modules &ndash; which I know the NCEA was already doing to some degree &ndash; timing, and delivery. We are dealing with a structure within which a great deal of inertia is embedded. The Minister's aspirations are wholly laudable and I would subscribe to them, but the framing of the Bill is too static. It is too steeped in tradition to live up to the aspirations.</P>
    <P>I am pleased the Minister will table an amendment on Committee Stage concerning the bonding issue. There has been a good deal of discussion on this matter. Generally, one cannot insure against insolvency in any business. It is difficult to expect the same insurance against insolvency for companies that happen to be in the education sector. The critical issues are access to a prompt alternative and refunds.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1294" /> Last year a college, which I will not name, failed to deliver a course in the public sector to which it had committed itself, and students were left high and dry. No fees were paid and, therefore, no refunds were due, but nonetheless students were left out on a limb.</P>

      <P>What is good for the goose is good for the gander. If we claim that students should not be left high and dry by the private sector, they should not be left high and dry by the public sector either. I am pleased the Minister will table an amendment to that effect on Committee Stage because I was dreading the thought of having to frame such an amendment. It is a difficult area. I look forward to reading the Minister's amendment.</P>
      <P>The university sector is concerned about the issue of academic independence, which I understand was enshrined in the 1997 Bill. Although I was not directly concerned in that, if my memory serves me right, the Minister was one of the leading lights in defending this academic independence from invasion by public quality assurance. God forbid the thought.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is something uneasy about the Minister's statement that some universities will not have this independence, for which we will have our own special quality assurance with directive powers, while at the same time telling us that does not change anything concerning the 1997 Act. If the 1997 Act defined academic independence, and we now have within that rubric intervention for universities, albeit a class of university, that pillar is not as intact as everyone thought it was. There is a concern that effectively the Minister is sliding back from his commitment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said in the Upper House that it is not his intention. However, people would like to see a &ldquo;notwithstanding&rdquo; dimension built into the legislation. In other words, while one takes certain powers, it would be notwithstanding the independence recognised in this legislation as the <i>status quo</i> in the previous law. Otherwise, one will have an issue of interpretation as to which one takes precedence. We will return to that issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why is the Minister creating two classes of university? The possibility of more directive quality <Col N="1295" /> assurance is either good or it is not. The Minister, however, has a half and half idea, whereby some universities will have this power of direction, but the public sector will not have it in relation to the other class of premium universities. The Minister did not give a reason for this different approach in his speech.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">

      <P>Criminal offences are created in section 56 for matters that sound decidedly uncriminal. The Minister might have difficulty deciding on the precise nature of an offence, if he leaves the section as it is. It probably needs some tidying up on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>We are involved in important work, but we have sold it short. I would like to see a more dynamic body with a much clearer mandate for areas where we already recognise there have been shortcomings. We are at a disadvantage with the university sector and the leaving certificate being outside the framework. The mainstream area is flying along in the fast lane while we are trying to create a new lane to match it. While it does present problems, we can overcome them if we give these new authorities and councils a much clearer mandate as to where they are to be innovative, and what we expect of them when they begin their tasks</P>

      <P>I declare an interest which is at one remove, in the same way as I would have encouraged Members of the Seanad with an interest to do the same when this Bill was introduced in the Upper House. I am a statutory lecturer in the National University of Ireland, on leave, in the Department of Political Science and Sociology. I derive no income or pension contribution from such a position but, nevertheless, it has informed my thinking. Let me rush to say that some of my colleagues in such a position would probably disagree with what I have to say, so I do not speak for them. However, that position informs some of my thinking.</P>
      <P>I welcome some aspects of the Bill, which are overdue. We could begin at the end and welcome the assurance that will come on Committee Stage of bonding arrangements for students in private colleges. It would be churlish not to welcome any contribution to the international mobility of qualifications and the assurance of standards.</P>
      <P>I will concentrate on those matters on Committee Stage. I wish to use the opportunity of this Second Stage debate to deal with some of the assumptions that are behind the thinking on the Bill as well as those in the Minister's speech. In a welcome concession to philosophy, the Minister got carried away in his speech in a most unusual paragraph in which he stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effects and impact of change are now global in character in the sense that their impli<Col N="1296" /> cations for education and training are similar in the developed world. Although education and training systems and structures may differ from country to country, the impact of global change will require similar responses. The seminal question is how existing systems and methods of education and training can be made to respond effectively to such global change. Part of the answer lies in having a sense of purpose and an appreciation of definite objectives. Never before has the world community experienced what is termed the &ldquo;massification&rdquo; and profusion of education and training now being demanded. The Bill must be seen in this context and has emerged against this background.</P>
    <P>With respect to the Minister's full speech, I do not think this is a representative paragraph because what I have just quoted is an ideologically laden piece of rubbish. It is unclear what is meant by this concept of massification. I might begin by speculating whether it meant the features of mass society. There is an extensive literature on this matter which deals with alienation and loss of connection with the world. There is also popular trashy literature about being lonely in the crowd as well as an expanding body of self-healing literature which is doing a bomb in what the Minister would refer to as the developed world. People who cannot afford private psychiatry are spending their book budgets on everything from one form of healing to another. I had better be careful of instancing them lest I abuse my privilege.</P>
    <P>I said this paragraph is interesting because it seems to reveal so much and I want to tease it out as it is important to me. It states that the seminal question is how existing systems and methods of education and training can be made to respond effectively to such global change. This contains the suggestion that globalisation is going on worldwide and that there is a side to it that creates issues and problems for us but also challenges in how we are to respond to it.</P>
    <P>I have referred to this as the Minister's speech, although not insultingly, but I have a certain lack of respect for this concept because such globalisation is simply international capital in a new form. It is perfectly true and empirically attestable that the relationship between markets and international capital can be measured. It is true that the relationship between international capital and different locations is speeded up by new electronic technology in a way and at a rate of change that is qualitatively different from, for example, the mobility of labour. Those of us who have spent 25 years studying this can point to research that would prove this. I could easily offer another term for globalisation &ndash;&ldquo;McWorld&rdquo;. For example, the developed world must sit up and clap when a McDonald's opens in Beijing or when the minority with an income in Moscow cheers the arrival of hamburgers. Professor Benjamin Barber has written about this in <i>Jihad vs. McWorld: How the Planet Is Both Falling Apart and Coming Together and What This <Col N="1297" />Means for Democracy</i> and we try to tease out cultural constancies.</P>
    <P>We are speaking about a clear and manipulable homogenisation of consumer experience, which is driven by the features of globalisation and which could perhaps be empirically judged by looking at indicators on the mobility of capital. Otherwise it has no meaning. We are not in the grip of a great Darwinian evolution from a previous existence of cultural diversity, identity and ethnicity that had many strands of memory and different capacities and creativity. We are not moving towards some inevitable future where there is massification as a feature of globalisation and which is assisted by some kind of existence for which we must not know or be wise but be trained adequately.</P>
    <P>This raises a question about the meaning of &ldquo;learner&rdquo; in the Minister's speech. To be fair to him there is a wonderful flourish in the explanatory memorandum which almost excited me in the beginning. It states that the purpose of the Bill is to put a legislative framework in place which will establish and develop standards of knowledge, skill or competence. I underlined knowledge but I found that while training and awards were mentioned later, which I welcome, the knowledge part was lost in the text of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I have views on these matters and the Minister's speech encourages me to tease out some of them. I accept that there is a need for the practical measures the Bill proposes but there is also a need for consideration of the deep connection between science, technology and society. The Bill does not set out to do what I seek but there is a missing context. The Minister spoke about a context when referring to the nine reports that serve as a background to the Bill. The missing context relates to science, technology and society.</P>
    <P>In the third level institution in which I worked and in others I often asked myself how there could be such significant paradigm shifts in a subject like physics, for example. A module on the history of intellectual ideas was never offered to students of science. Was the history of physics a seamless story? Of course not. What happened was that there was a significant paradigm shift in which the very assumptions on which physics was based were turned around, rejected and moved on. I could point to other subjects beyond physics, like chemistry, as well as referring to some of the newer invasions in relation to some life sciences. In botany, Darwin's pioneering work was made possible by the classification system of von Humboldt but even when he referred to standing on the shoulders of giants there were always the discontinuities which are the definitive mark of his work. What is going on at any time in science is a considerable shift in fundamental ideas and it is from that, rather than any daft notions of elitism, that the right of academic freedom is properly sought. I do not have to go back to the period in history when Galileo Galilei had to suffer as he <Col N="1298" /> did to have his views even tolerated. That is the way it is and academic freedom is based on the right to differ and to develop a new paradigm.</P>
    <P>The next problem, which is far more difficult, is the unfortunately fashionable fallacy that the parameters of scientific practice are being defined by technological norms and those norms are being derived almost exclusively from the marketplace. There is thus an inversion of what might have been a totally different moral equation. We might want to feel more at home in the world by wondering how different life would be if we had a debate at the social level, as we are having about the safety of our food. Society is looking for certain assurances, which has scientific implications. From a model of science that is free but accountable within a social model come different levels of acceptable technology. That is the difference between a research scientist working in warfare and one working in advanced medical technology. We see the horror of the other equation when one does not question it &ndash; it becomes acceptable to find that 28 per cent of the United States' economy is involved in military production and a huge number of physicists are engaged in works of war. This also applies to the former Soviet Union and other countries which have lower income levels, where people's most wonderful intelligence is locked up in producing initiatives of destruction. There is a philosophical backdrop to this in addition to the nine reports cited, which is that it has been impossible in this country to debate the connection between society, science and technology.</P>
    <P>Fashions changed in the 1970s and 1980s and there are hints of that in many contributions. Speaking in the Seanad, the Minister asked what is wrong with the new universities. He said all universities do not have to be like those established in the 1840s. The same staff are not teaching in those established in the 1840s. One's thinking does not stand still, simply because one is teaching in a institution which was established in the 1840s and, furthermore, one inherits a great deal.</P>
    <P>As a university teacher, I have been appalled by the degree to which universities have made concessions to neo-utilitarianism while there is, at the same time, an absence of commitment to the work of universities at their very best internationally &ndash; critical scholarship. I think of those people who left Germany in the 1930s and 1940s and established, in the United States, new innovations in the structure of intellectual thought in the social sciences and of the contribution their legacy makes today.</P>
    <P>The Minister and others appear to refer to difficult universities populated by strange eccentric people who insist on talking about academic freedom. Universities have made the case badly for academic freedom and because of this they find it necessary to capitulate on poor terms. One will find more representatives of the corporate sector than Nobel prizewinners on the campus of any university here.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1299" /> The Minister made another flourish which is not of the same philosophical standard as his discourses in the explanatory memorandum or on massification. This one speaks of the glowing opportunities for partnership with the industrial sector in Ireland. This sector is notorious for its absence of investment in research and some sections of it make a pathetic contribution to training. The hotel industry, for example, contributes less than £250,000 to training compared to State assisted training schemes which cost about £2 million. Dr. James Collins, a brilliant Californian economist, taught that it was important for businesses to socialise their costs and privatise their profits. Irish business has been good at that. Among the costs that have been neatly socialised is training. Companies avoid the costs of training and further development of staff and, in a fit of partnership, allow the State to take them. The State then demands that the technological and university sectors listen to what the raucous voices of the corporate sector demand.</P>
    <P>I do not advocate a total abstraction and disconnection of universities from the world. I simply describe things as I have experienced them. I have listened long and hard to the demands of the corporate sector. There is a language to go with them. I once attended a meeting at which I listened to a speaker who had something &ldquo;in the pipeline&rdquo; which he would &ldquo;run past us&rdquo; and &ldquo;hop off us&rdquo;. I went home. These people speak a lingo of pseudo-prattle when they speak of wanting this, that or the other next.</P>
    <P>I welcome the good sections of the Bill. I welcome the provision that deals with quality and international recognition. It is time we had bonding arrangements for private colleges. One cannot have nine reports awaiting a response. On Committee Stage we will discuss the detail of the Bill, including the matters of representation on the two councils and the functions of the authority. However, these other issues must be raised.</P>
    <P>I listen to what graduates of my own tell me. I know many people who went into business having studied political science or sociology. I knew many more who were engineers. In the university in my time it was possible to know people in other faculties. One could even know students in other faculties. Obviously, I am very old. Those who worked abroad found that a basic training in mathematics was of great value in the application of their engineering skills. As a sociologist, I know that one is now likely to make four or five career shifts and choices in the course of one's working life. The capacity to make those adaptations is as valuable a skill as one's initial training. The Minister and I do not disagree about the importance of lifelong learning. I agree that people should be upskilled. I support the validation and recognition in one part of the economic and social system of initiatives taken in another part. I merely wish to present a comprehensible version of what is happening.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1300" /> A subject called &ldquo;administration&rdquo; is taken by many excellent people in the public service. That subject could consist of ethical governance, be informed by philosophy, politics and sociology and relate to development studies, but it does not. Instead, the subject is assumed to be descriptive of an institutional map of how we do things, as if the disposal of power was neutral. The disposal of power is not neutral. If we proceed in this descriptive, smart aleck way, as much Irish writing does, we will never understand how other people on this planet view us. I cannot accept the modernisation model of inexorable movement towards globalisation. It is a clapped out piece of rubbish which started with the five Princeton studies between 1963 and 1968 and is now rejected by most literate social scientists and economists.</P>
    <P>In the Reagan-Thatcher period, a particularly horrific view of economics moved into a hegemony. It did not invade intellectual ideas but it found people in policy institutes willing to provide a cheap little rationalisation for it. It was suggested that the economy was separate from our lives. In the past, Marxists were accused of reifying the economy and of arguing excessively the predominant influence of the economic on other forms of life, but it was accepted totally in the Reagan-Thatcher era. I was a member of a Cabinet and took part in discussions in this House where I found the same lingo catching on. People did not ask the effect of a measure on our citizens. Instead, they wondered how would the markets respond. This disembodied view of economics became accepted as a principle. When this disembodied view of the international economy is accepted, another set of terms must be invented to describe its features. One such term is globalisation. What does globalisaton mean, beyond the interconnectedness of markets? I do not wish to speak again about massification which is somewhere between mastitis and &ldquo;The Lonely Crowd&rdquo;. This reveals much.</P>
    <P>The universities, whose capacity and potential I have been defending but not their performance, are correctly identified as the source of many blocks in the way of those who wish to make the transitions that the Bill sets out to address. It is unconscionable and unacceptable that blocks are placed in the way of those seeking mobility of learning experience throughout their lives. This is dealt with in some of the dynamics suggested in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I vindicate the right to offer experiences other than those certified and attested in formal education. This is a wise move. There is an assumption that education is about volume rather than vision, management rather than principles, and has little to do with philosophy and reflective or critical ability. The most radical thing in the world at present is to be reflective, to ask what are the options for the different forms of existence.</P>
    <P>Nothing has happened by chance. None of the advances in women's and working rights has been conceded automatically. They have not evolved, <Col N="1301" /> they were all fought for. One now has to fight for the right to be philosophically reflective about the world in which we live. I was a university teacher for 23 years and experienced sheer joy when occasionally somebody was curious and interested in the connections between one of the social sciences and literature and economics and history and cultural studies. It was wonderful as it was rare.</P>
    <P>I taught in the United States where the course system is in place. I voted against its introduction here. Longer courses on an subject that could contribute to the formation of somebody as a young intellectual were replaced by short modules of 12 lectures of forced feeding leading to an examination or paper. I rejected that narrowness.</P>
    <P>I have pondered on the issue of the section 9 universities and the 1840s institutions to which the Minister referred in the Seanad. It would be a pity if an enormous division opened up between the futures and intentions of these institutions. I have limited knowledge of the Dublin Institute of Technology but when I was Minister with responsibility for film some of the most advanced work was being done in that institution.</P>
    <P>The strand two universities need to have the burden of utility lifted from them. In a curious way, what we are dealing with is a double distortion. The universities are losing their nerve and have found it necessary to turn their staff rooms into a canteen for IBEC&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is colourful. Perhaps I was there on the wrong day. On Second Stage it is necessary to offer, in addition to the reports correctly referred to, a further reflection that the excesses of neo-utilitarianism and the absence of the capacity for critical thought are leaning on both sides of further education which I hope in the future will have much more to say to each other in a gentle and reflective way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith" hpid="Mr. B. Smith Mr. B. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak in support of the Bill which is far-sighted, progressive and long-awaited. It is a continuation of the Minister's excellent work for education.</P>
      <P>Education is important to the country. The pursuit of intelligent education policies is as important as &ndash; if not more so &ndash; the management of the finances and the economy. Our greatest asset has to be our people. Education policies give us the opportunity to harness and utilise our collective abilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Education thinking has been needlessly broken down into sectors &ndash; primary, post-primary and third level which, in turn, has been divided between the university sector and technical-vocational courses. At times, the latter has been viewed as the poor relation. There was a view that the technical area was often inhabited by those who did not get the points. The fact that <Col N="1302" /> many of the students might never have wanted the points in the first place because they did not desire a traditional university based education was overlooked. Consequently the vital contribution that the non-university third level sector makes has been undervalued. Fortunately, that view is changing. Its potential has been weakened by lack of co-ordination of standards. Students, parents and career guidance teachers have often been faced with a minefield, a confusing array of courses validated by different bodies earning certificates and diplomas but at times leading nowhere.</P>
    <P>The need to address this highly unsatisfactory situation has been felt for a long time. It has often formed part of recommendations by those reviewing the education and training sectors from the point of view of education as well as the needs of industry, business and employment. The Bill overcomes these problems by establishing the National Qualifications Authority with two additional bodies, the Higher Education and Training Awards Council and the Further Education and Training Awards Council, both of which will have the ability to grant education awards. This power will be delegated to institutions working in the area which have built up a great reservoir of expertise such as the institutes of technology, the post-leaving certificate colleges and other bodies engaged in training and instruction such as FÁS and Teagasc.</P>
    <P>The National Qualifications Authority will remain at the centre of the new approach, its functions being threefold. The first, which is long overdue, is to establish clear co-ordination between qualifications. We have an education system which places great pressure on young people of 17 or 18 years of age to make decisions about the careers they wish to pursue. In many cases, they have not yet gained sufficient self-knowledge to allow them make worthwhile choices. It is now possible to at least ensure they know the consequences of the decisions they make. A school leaver anxious to pursue a certain career path, will know what courses are available for them to reach their goal. They will also have confidence in the validity and usefulness of the award they receive as a result of their work. School leavers, potential learners, parents and career guidance professionals will, in the future, be able to gauge the value and utility of courses and awards and, most important, compare them. Until now such comparisons of awards could only be based on anecdotal evidence or students' own accounts of their value or, indeed, lack of it. Holders of qualifications in the future will have greater confidence in their achievements and skills.</P>
    <P>A second and very closely related role of the qualifications authority is to guarantee the standards of courses and qualifications, and this can only be done through the two associated councils and a close working relationship between them and the assorted education and training bodies. Any form of standardisation of qualifications has <Col N="1303" /> to be based on an in-depth knowledge of all aspects of individual programmes and courses and the pursuit of high standards of quality in terms of instruction and course content. In this regard, the qualifications authority and the associated education and training awards councils will be able to validate not only awards, but the courses leading to them. They will also have a role in ensuring that a course once validated retains its quality and utility.</P>
    <P>The two awards councils will be in a position to validate awards from various bodies but will also be able to recognise the abilities and skills of individuals which have been acquired through their own initiative but outside formal education or training structures. The implications of this for many people wishing to re-enter education and training will be enormous. It could be particularly useful for crafts people and those involved in electronic repairs and computer technology &ndash; in other words, those with vast amounts of practical know-how but no formal qualifications.</P>
    <P>A third aspect of the new authority's activities will be to oversee the areas of access, transfer procedures and future progression to other courses. School leavers have to know what is expected of them before they can enter a course. This must be standardised, but not too rigidly. It is unjust that a school leaver may be denied entry to a course in one institute or training body although he or she may find it easier to gain entrance to practically the same course elsewhere. Access to higher education and training is not only an issue for school leavers. It is often difficult, although not impossible, for people who are older than school leaving age to gain re-entry to education and training, so the question of access must also take into account less quantifiable elements such as work experience.</P>
    <P>A fundamental issue of access concerns access to courses for those with disabilities. There may be some training courses which would be difficult for disabled people but access criteria should be based on reasonable and informed opinions and should not contain hidden forms of discrimination.</P>
    <P>Transfer between courses will be much easier as a result of the new qualifications authority. If this is from one training body to another, the learner will be able to gain credit for what they have already studied. This was not impossible in the past but there were few guidelines for the learner or teaching staff and too much may have been left to individual discretion. The commitment to facilitate and clarify progression is an important element of the new authority. A learner must know whether there are further options available when one course has been successfully completed. No impediments should be placed in the learner's path and a clear and comprehensive map of further courses and options with their implications and requirements should be available. The qualifications authority will see to it that the providers of validated courses fur<Col N="1304" /> nish potential learners with all information regarding access, transfer and future progress thereby making life easier for all involved.</P>
    <P>An important part of the legislation and the bodies being put in place as a result is their flexibility and responsiveness. The aim is to provide a broad framework within which goals can be achieved and pursued. Education is a highly dynamic area and this is especially true in the light of the march of technology. Technological progress touches nearly every activity and skill and can make life simpler allowing tasks to be overcome with less effort. As a result the content and direction of courses may change very frequently and some courses may be rendered completely redundant while changing circumstance dictate the provision of new ones.</P>
    <P>An example of this is provided by the growth of the Internet. Up to five or six years ago, the Internet was used by a rather small community of scientists, while now the growth of its popularity as a promotional tool means that many courses are being provided for teaching the Internet programming language. Internet awareness is valuable not only for computer courses, but for many business and media oriented programmes.</P>
    <P>Another important detail of the Bill, although some may scoff at it, is the replacement of the term &ldquo;student&rdquo; with &ldquo;learner&rdquo;. This term should be, if anything, applied even more widely as all students are learners no matter what age they are or level of the educational ladder they occupy. This should not be a foreign concept to us as the Irish word for student is after all &ldquo;mac leínn&rdquo; or son of learning. I do not believe the Irish language or the vernacular is being deliberately sexist. The word &ldquo;student&rdquo; has long associations with formal academic learning and so its replacement may also help to attract many people, who feel uncomfortable in school, back into education and training and dispel barriers between the worlds of skill acquisition and training and society as a whole.</P>
    <P>Often when legislation is mooted, the learner is relegated to an insignificant position. This legislation, however, gives the learner new safeguards and protection. A number of private colleges run courses on a commercial basis, and the vast majority do a good and worthwhile job. There have been instances, however, where participants have enrolled on courses and paid huge fees only to be told half way through the course that it was being wound up. The unfortunate participants not only cannot get their money back but have nothing to show for the time or money they have expended. This will not happen in future as private colleges will have to establish reserve funds from which participants can be compensated in the event of a course falling through and the relevant awards council will endeavour to provide suitable places on an alternative course elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Education is an extremely important part of Irish society and life. It should not be confined to one place or age group. Education is a life long <Col N="1305" /> process &ndash; we should never stop learning. Education is too important to be confined to the traditional arena of the classroom or the lecture hall. The Government and the Minister are actively involved in the process of expanding educational opportunities at all levels of the education sector, and this Bill is proof of that. It is a suitable recognition of the role played by the non-university third level sector. Let us look at some of the contributions they make. The institutes of technology provide very valuable courses, including computer programming, applied languages, laboratory science, construction engineering and environmental science. These are but a fraction of the courses covered but they and countless others are vital for the preservation and smooth running of our society and economy.</P>
    <P>A similar picture emerges when we examine the many post-leaving certificate colleges and colleges of further studies, including an excellent one in my county. These institutions have the added advantage of being more numerous, making it possible for learners and students from the surrounding areas to attend on a daily basis and, therefore, avoid the expenses of accommodation and travel. The need to travel long distances for education and training is being reduced. What might have seemed like science fiction 20 years ago is becoming more of a reality as advances in fibre optic and computer technology are bringing the day ever closer when people in counties Cavan or Monaghan, for example, can attend, through a video link, a demonstration or class being given in Dublin and participate as if they were in the same room.</P>
    <P>Technology and learning are fine, but they must be made available to as many people as possible. Many primary schools have computers, thanks to the Minister's IT 2000 scheme, and a growing number have joined the information age as a result of Internet access. Some even have their own websites, including Butlersbridge national school in my county. The Minister also launched the schools integration programme to increase contact between schools and to promote the use of computers in studies of local history and the environment. The implications of these developments are revolutionary. The latest computer technology is not only accessible to but is understood by nine and ten year-olds, the majority of whom are more technically literate than their parents. They take for granted what we have had to learn, or perhaps have failed to learn. Far from being frightened by these developments, we should be delighted that our place at the cutting edge of knowledge in the world seems assured.</P>
    <P>It is important that we never forget that education has a practical aspect. This is not to say that knowledge which does not have a short-term vocational application should be discarded, but we should never stop looking for ways of improving all aspects of society and using education and training to bring this about. This is best done through a partnership approach. For some time <Col N="1306" /> there have been strong links between business, industry and education. The former have come to recognise the value of the latter in providing the specialists and technicians upon which so much of their future prosperity depends. The Government has a commitment to take on board the specific needs of particular areas of business and industry. A more comprehensive and inclusive system of qualifications has long been sought as in this way business, industry and employers in all sections of the economy have a greater insight into the nature of the skills held by job applicants and how the skills needs of business and industry can be achieved, and thereby provide worthwhile employment.</P>
    <P>The need for and benefits of a streamlining of qualifications and awards has been recognised in other countries, including the US, Australia and New Zealand. Yet we are not merely copying what has been done elsewhere, but are creating mechanisms which reflect and deal effectively with our unique educational background as a nation. The national qualifications authority will not only enhance the standing of awards in Ireland, but will do so in an international context as each award will be backed by the <i>imprimatur</i> of the qualifications authority and the two awards councils.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I wish to re-iterate that the Bill addresses issues at the heart of maintaining and improving standards in the non-university tertiary sector. It is plausible that it will succeed in attracting more people into education and training. A more coherent and standardised approach to courses and qualifications may help attract more learners, both those who might have decided not to pursue further education and those who might have thought that a traditional university based course offered better job prospects and a more widely recognised qualification. The Bill recognises the importance of a vital part of the educational landscape. It lays firm foundations for education in the next millennium and I congratulate the Minister on his progressive approach.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill. While much of it is good some provisions need clarification and amendments will be necessary to improve it. Perhaps the Minister will answer some of the questions I will pose during my contribution, or perhaps he has already addressed them in his speech on Second Stage &ndash; I did not have an opportunity to read it.</P>
      <P>The Bill deals with access to courses, their quality and the means of progression after graduating from each stage to enable citizens move through a system of further and higher education in a transparent way. If its overall objective is met, it will prove to be one of the most effective pieces of social and industrial legislation of our time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to acknowledge the role played by my party in starting the dialogue in earnest under the last Government through the establishment of <Col N="1307" /> Teastas as an interim body. However, I am concerned that the Minister seems to have written both himself and the House out of the process. The process will not be smooth and most probably there will be turf wars between the different interests. Indeed, I think the future will be marked with difficulties, tensions, etc. Both the Minister and the House must ultimately decide if the system is working and the Minister, through the House, will have to retain his input and supervisory role. It is also important that the House be aware of what is happening at all times through regular reports.</P>
    <P>I will be suggesting to our spokesperson on education, Deputy Richard Bruton, that he table an amendment on Committee Stage to provide for the presentation of regular reports to the House, the Minister and the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Science on how the provisions of the Bill are being implemented. Democratic accountability demands this and it is important that we are kept abreast of what is happening in terms of the success of the procedure being put in place.</P>
    <P>One concern I have is that the Bill does not seem to be enabling as was the Vocational Education Act, 1930, or the Regional Technical Colleges Act, 1992. There is a need for more consultation between the appraising agencies and the providers. Nobody should underestimate the task of putting many bodies within one working and learner friendly structure when to date they have enjoyed autonomy for up to eight decades. Co-operation, shared vision and goals come through talking. As I said, a potential for conflict exists but must be avoided.</P>
    <P>I wish to deal with a number of specific issues which the Minister may have referred to in his speech. The first is the issue of further education. It is not clear what the dividing line between further and higher education will be under the Bill. A date, 3 March 1999, is set as a defining date in section 10(3). However, I would like the Minister to clarify the additional phrase &ldquo;unless otherwise determined by the Authority&rdquo;. Are we building in possible areas of conflict if we do not have a full consultative process?</P>
    <P>I realise the difficulty of setting up a further education and training awards council covering a wide-range of PLCs, which respond to local needs, FÁS apprenticeships, CERT courses for tourism and the tried and trusted Teagasc courses within one framework. People, and certainly some educationalists, may ask whether we are too ambitious. Will development of PLCs be inhibited because they may offer locally based education and training packages as an alternative to national packages? Where will the balance be struck? Rural areas need Teagasc programmes. The institutes of technology and the universities are co-operating with Teagasc in rural development course structures which I established as Minister of State in the Department of Agriculture and Food. Trust and a co-operative <Col N="1308" /> atmosphere were required in this regard. At one time CERT had most of its courses based strictly on a national plan, but now it is more flexible in meeting local needs. Flexibility and the ability to adapt to local needs will be the most important attribute required by the further education and training awards council.</P>
    <P>I have a personal interest in sport and leisure. Most sports bodies have coaching schemes and training for various levels of coaching competence. These will be more necessary after the swimming scandals. Students attending the physical education course at the University of Limerick and the health and leisure course at the Institute of Technology, Tralee, study for certificates which are awarded by these bodies. The bronze medallion in life saving is one example. We want this type of programme to continue and flourish. What is the meaning and effect of the phrase &ldquo;other than those programmes which are provided as a leisure or recreational activity&rdquo;? Can the Minister assure us that courses, such as those in life saving or coaching football, hurling, boxing, judo and other sports will not be excluded from this new framework? Should this clause be tightened?</P>
    <P>I now turn to courses such as European computer driving licence courses and Microsoft courses organised through the VEC adult education programmes and the institutes of technology. Must these be validated before they can be offered to students? At a time when we are looking for an increase in the IT skills pool, will we make it impossible for statutory bodies and private colleges to offer highly prized qualifications? While section 43, which deals with protection for learners, is laudable, it may destroy programmes which are badly needed in our tiger economy. Should the three months in section 43 be changed to four months, which is the internationally recognised length of a semester? </P>
    <P>Some 90 to 95 per cent of the work of the higher education and training awards council will apply to the new institutes of technology. The Minister referred to the Dublin Institute of Technology in his Second Stage speech, but why is it not included? It was reported in the media that it is a battle the Minister cannot win. The treatment of Regional Technical Colleges, the Dublin Institute of Technology and old and new universities in this framework is astonishing. Is this legislation sanctifying the turf patches already carved out? Will the Minister explain why he did not provide a more unified system?</P>
    <P>The council of directors has played an important part in unifying the aims and procedures of the old Regional Technical College system. The people of Kerry are delighted the council is located in Tralee. The Minister should avail of the opportunity to put it on a statutory basis. Perhaps he would also consider calling the <Col N="1309" /> directors the presidents of institutes of technology.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>It might matter in the future. The Institute of Technology, Tralee, has embarked on an ambitious campus development plan, which I advocated for some time and which was successful in Plassey. Tralee is replicating the Plassey example. The Institute of Technology, Tralee, is co-operating with Shannon Development in developing a technology park beside its buildings. The Minister's support for the project is welcome because it gives people confidence.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that industry and education must move forward together. If our education system is not adapted to the needs of industry, we could lose our competitive edge. When I attended Thomond College in Limerick in the early 1970s, the courses in the NIHE were geared towards industry and computerisation. Unlike the universities, students worked in industry as part of their studies. Our current economic buoyancy stems from that development at the NIHE which was spearheaded by Dr. Walsh. The new technology park in Tralee will be an integral part of the new campus at the Institute of Technology, Tralee. This means education and research and development will be intertwined.</P>
      <P>If the higher education and training awards council is not flexible and does not engage in dialogue with institutes of technology, many new, innovative programmes could be lost. I am sure that is not the Minister's intention. Perhaps the Minister will outline how the council will ensure continuous dialogue with the institutes of technology.</P>
      <P>The new structures should listen to the needs of the regions and support new ideas. Section 31(2)(a) refers to the &ldquo;region served by that institution&rdquo;. That is a welcome reaffirmation of the regional mandate of the institutes of technology and the need for a rapid response to regional needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the virtual college, the Internet has allowed Motorola to establish in Phoenix, Ari<Col N="1310" /> zona, a college of approximately half a million students who do not have to physically go to college. This Bill ignores these developments. Unless the national qualifications authority acts swiftly, this State might be in trouble with the European Union or the WTO. Perhaps the Minister will refer to the new phenomenon where people will not have to physically go to college. In the Motorola experience in Arizona about 500,000 students are connected with the college but are not at the college. Has provision been made in the Bill for this new growing phenomenon?</P>
    <P>My home town of Listowel is twinned with Los Gatos in the Silicon Valley and we have good links with San Jose. In February 1998 I led a delegation to San Jose and Mayor Susan Hammer led a return delegation to Listowel in July 1998. It was clear from those visits that education and training in the field of information technology is undertaken internationally and knows no boundaries. We were able to have a conference link directly from San Jose to Listowel. This shows Ireland is not peripheral and that there are no boundaries to the global technology village. I am concerned that the structures and procedures under this Bill have not taken this new phenomenon into account. Perhaps the Minister will respond to the new trends in technology in the context of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that section 32 amends the functions of the colleges in the Regional Technical Colleges Act, 1992. In the future there will be an overlap between bodies and colleges which provide courses of education and training. Section 5(1)(b) of that Act enabled the Tralee Institute of Technology to form a co-operative course structure on business studies with the University of Limerick and applied social care with the Cork Institute of Technology. There is a danger, if the amending clause 32(c)( b) (i) is not amended to allow for links between the universities and institutes of technology, that there will be unnecessary and expensive duplication. Joint courses using video conferencing must be allowed for. It is not the Minister's intention to be restrictive.</P>
    <P>The issue of courses for accounting and other professional bodies has been raised. Is the Minister satisfied that this Bill will not restrict the availability of these courses by making the paperwork for approval so onerous that it will not be worthwhile for providers to offer it. The protection of the titles, certificate, diploma and degree is not addressed nor is the inevitable designation, under section 9 of the Universities Act, 1997, of the institute of technology sector. The Bill should ensure that certificate and diploma work, as a structure of total work, is not diminished through such designation. Equally institutes of technology must be allowed develop a range of degrees including <i>ab initio </i>degrees.</P>
    <P>While I welcome the Bill, I have put my concerns to the Minister. The role of the Minister and the House in evaluating and monitoring the <Col N="1311" /> effectiveness of the council must not be diminished by this Bill. Perhaps the Minister will explain this further when addressing the various points raised on Second Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill. I congratulate the Minister on bringing it forward and on phrases such as ladders and linkages. It is apt to speak in those terms. Many people have benefited from the various courses accredited by the NCEA and the NCVA. People who did not have the opportunity to go to university were able to get awards through the establishment of those bodies. In his introductory speech the Minister said the number of third level places had increased by 8,000 in two years and by 4,000 in post leaving certificate courses. This represents increases of 9 per cent and 22 per cent respectively. This is an indication of the trend in third level education.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's comments on the international context of the Bill. In recent days we have heard the announcement by FÁS of the need to recruit skilled workers from outside the State. This is relevant to the needs of industry, business and society as we approach the end of this millennium. One of the benefits of the awards by the NCEA and NCVA has been the great variety of courses on offer.</P>
      <P>In discussing the Bill it would be remiss not to comment on the work of Teastas, the Irish National Certification Authority. When Teastas reported in January 1998 it recommended the development of an overarching qualifications authority to act as the ultimate guarantor of the higher and further education and training system. The Minister referred to the development and promotion of ladders and linkages between the various strands of education and training. I pay tribute to those who compiled the report and their comments therein.</P>
      <P>The report recommended the establishment of two new awarding bodies, the National Institute of Technology for higher education and training and the National Certification Council for further and continuing education and training outside the third level sector. That report has led to the present situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Qualifications (Education and Training) Bill is excellent legislation. Concerns have been expressed by people in education about the actual changing of names. People in the NCEA and some Deputies have mentioned they would be anxious to retain the name National Council for Education Awards. It reminds me of some debates here in the past when we talked about suitable names for committees, agencies or authorities. One very suitable name was Dúchas, for the heritage service of the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands. The Taoiseach was responsible for the title FÁS which took over from AnCO. People in education say the title NCEA is similar to Kerrygold or Baileys <Col N="1312" /> Cream in that it has stood the test of time. Some bodies have been unfortunate in regard to names. In this regard I have in mind Teagasc. It is a name that people find difficult to pronounce. Sometimes in the agriculture sector when people intend to blame Teagasc they actually blame the Taoiseach. That is one of the matters mentioned by people in the education sphere. Under the provisions of the Bill the NCEA and the NCVA will be dissolved and parts of FÁS, CERT and BIM will be abolished. Teagasc is also mentioned in the Bill. I welcome the Bill and the Minister's efforts to remove blockages.</P>
    <P>The NCEA was set up in 1972 as the awarding body for the Regional Technical Colleges which existed at that time. I understand there was some controversy in 1974 when there was a move to take away the power to award degrees. Following the appointment of the former Minister, John Wilson, in 1979, the NCEA was put on a statutory basis. He established the structure of certificates, diplomas and degrees. A welcome aspect of that decision was that if a student did not get enough points to go to university, he or she had the choice to go through the NCEA to get a certificate or a diploma which led to a degree. This was available to people who would not otherwise have been able to get to third level. People in education referred to the prior experiential learning involved in bringing aspects of education together. People could gain entry to Regional Technical Colleges through post-leaving certificate courses.</P>
    <P>In paying tribute to the NCEA, reference should be made to the fact that there is only 25 people on the staff &ndash; exactly the same number of staff the body had in 1977. The NCEA has catered for students from the North and overseas and it has provided external examiners. It reviews its programmes every five years. Some of the new courses set up include the forestry management course in Galway Regional Technical College and the furniture design course in Letterfrack. I pay tribute to the Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology for its great development work in providing new playing fields and the new library facilities in Cluan Mhuire, which is now part of the Galway-Mayo institute. The agricultural college in Mountbellew, which is the largest town near my area, is now linked to the Galway-Mayo institute in a course on agriculture. These indicate the huge range of new courses now available in the institutes. Athlone Institute of Technology also caters for many students from the west because of its location.</P>
    <P>I reiterate my point about the Irish terms for some of the new bodies. I understand them, but some of the translations are difficult to pronounce. The Further Education and Training Awards Council is to be known as Comhairle na nDámhachtainí Breisoideachais agus Oiliúna while the Higher Education and Training Awards <Col N="1313" /> Council will be known as Comhairle na nDámhachtainí Ardoideachais agus Oiliúna. The conferral of awards is done in Irish and English. This is already difficult for people, but they will now have to pronounce those mouthfuls.</P>

      <P>It will be difficult to pronounce such long phrases as HETAC, FETAC, dúlra, dúchas and Teagasc. Perhaps the Minister could come up with shortened versions of the councils' descriptions using whatever devices he wishes.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to private colleges. The Bill deals with a total of 40 colleges including the institutes of technology, the Garda, military and NCO colleges, the IMI, the IPA, the College of Industrial Relations, seven seminaries and the American College in Dublin. An issue raised with me as a public representative is that given the large variety of courses available, perhaps a review could be carried out by the education authorities of their location. Students in Galway must go to Letterkenny in County Donegal or to Waterford for particular courses. The same problem arises for students in the South who must travel to the North and <i>vice versa</i>. The forestry management course is only available in Galway, although there is a forestry course in Waterford. These are important issues for students who must travel long distances to particular institutes of technology. I hope the Minister will take this issue on board.</P>
      <P>The role of music in education was discussed today by the Oireachtas Committee on Education and Science. This aspect should be considered in the context of the new councils. There has been concern for many years about the role of music at primary level, where there is little assessment except as part of the overall curriculum. At second level only a small number of students take examinations at junior and leaving certificate levels. There should be greater emphasis on this subject. There has been talk for years about making proper facilities available in Galway city in a college of music and to promote music. The important role of music should be considered in the context of higher and further education in the institutes and third level colleges.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on the Bill. It is a major boost for the higher and further education sectors. I ask him to take on board my points in relation to names which could be used instead of the difficult terms for bodies used in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>The legislation is most welcome. It will give recognition to the national qualifications authority, which will have responsibility as the overall guarantor of the quality of higher and further education. It will also be responsible for <Col N="1314" /> promoting access, transfer and progression into and within the education and training sector. The authority will be a crucial element in helping students to move between courses and colleges and in developing the national framework of qualifications.</P>
      <P>Regarding Deputy Michael Kitt's comments, I received a telephone call today from the Sligo institute regarding the names. The NCEA served very well for 25 years and perhaps it could be incorporated in the new names. In excess of 300,000 students in the past 25 years received accreditation and qualifications from the NCEA. It is an acceptable brand name and has a logo. The major change is that it will replace the higher education and training awards. The new body will incorporate the current and future education and training certification functions of FÁS, the national tourism certification agency, Teagasc, and the National Council for Vocational Awards.</P>
      <P>The Minister indicated that it would be a link to business and industry. A major concern addressed in the Bill is the need for improved partnership, co-operation and cohesion between industry on one hand and education and training on the other. Sligo Institute of Technology is developing a business park for which it received considerable funding from the Minister's Department and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. This is welcome, particularly for the development of computer and technological skills which are crucial to jobs at present.</P>
      <P>The Higher Education and Training Award Council will incorporate the higher education and training certification functions of the National Council for Education Awards and other relevant bodies. The Bill also provides for institutes of technology to have, for the first time, delegated authority to make awards. This provides a mechanism for implementing the recommendations of the reviews currently being carried out under the chairmanship of Professor Donnelly. It is good that the institutes will have such autonomy, under the eye of the Department. It recognises that they are doing the right thing.</P>
      <P>There has been much talk over many years about the introduction of a framework for qualifications. This Bill provides for co-operation between the Department of Education and Science and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, and that is also the hallmark of the success of the institutes of technology. Last week the Minister opened a new engineering building at Sligo IT and further funding is coming on stream. It is good to see how much development is happening there, with great support from the Government. I welcome the allocation from the Government. All the teaching staff are taking great pride in their work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill has a provision to protect students enrolled in private colleges on courses of more than three months' duration. It is proposed that <Col N="1315" /> where a private college offers a course certified by either of the new councils it must have a bond. There were difficulties in this last year. A bond provision is an important part of building and planning regulations. It should not be possible to set up a private college, charge students £2,000 per year in fees and go out of business in six months. A bond is a guarantee which will take pressure off the institutes. Private colleges should sign a legally binding form stating that students taking their courses &ndash; and the parents paying the fees &ndash; will have guarantees and are not taking a risk.</P>
    <P>I was delighted to see how the Bill will benefit students, who are described in the legislation as &ldquo;learners&rdquo;. Central to the Bill is the idea that learning is now a lifelong activity and the avenues for learning are wide and inexhaustible. The aim of the Bill is to address the needs of the learning society. People can go back to education at any point in their lives, which is important. The main purposes of the Bill are to establish and develop standards of knowledge, skill or competence, to promote the quality of further education and training, and higher education and training, to provide a system for co-ordinating and comparing education and training awards and to promote and maintain procedures for access, transfer and progression. These are welcome aims and this is major legislation. Deputy Deenihan said the Minister should bear in mind certain points, as I am sure he will.</P>
    <P>Certification will now be nationally awarded. CERT, FÁS, etc., will be brought under one umbrella, should the organisation so wish. If a body decides to operate on its own that is well and good, because its certification is recognised already. The Bill gives great opportunities for people who want to go into the business sector. The huge growth in tourism will offer great chances to many students. We should provide qualifications for people who want to go into that sector and provide them with skills and trades. Parents should feel their families can avail of qualifications and awards.</P>
    <P>The Bill also allows for further development of the technological sector of higher education. Its principal objective is to develop a framework for the structural development of institutions in the technological sector to address changing local and national demands. Diversity of institutions is being maintained to ensure maximum flexibility with regard to the needs of students and the wide variety of social and economic requirements. There is great change even as we speak. Life long learning is the norm and, as Deputy Deenihan said, people have access to colleges like the Open University which provides great opportunities to people who want to take on additional courses. If people want to obtain extra degrees at age 35 or 45 they will be able to do so.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1316" /> There are institutes of technology on the periphery. In the north-west there are two fine ITs in Sligo and Letterkenny. Industrialists can see the courses and range of skills being taught in the area, which has been important in the past and will be important in the future. The ITs have expanded enormously in the past ten years, both in student numbers and in the development of education, training and research activities. Sligo IT has great research facilities in injection moulding and new product development. Companies can see the ITs have invested in new equipment. It is wonderful that there is such partnership because it is good for employment.</P>
    <P>The institutes will be delegated authority to make awards and will have a charter. Such charters recognise that ITs have a greater level of autonomy and allow them to devise a mission statement as to their role and function. Every business now has a mission statement concerning its future aims. Education is now a big business and universities and ITs have a sense of pride. Sligo IT has 3,000 students. It is like a small town. The administrator of an IT looks on it as a business and it is important for a business to have a mission statement.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides for a more open and inclusive procedures for establishing new institutes of technology. There will be demands from other areas of the country in the future. We have successful colleges but future needs may be different. ITs may be upgraded to universities. That might happen to Sligo IT but it would have to meet certain criteria. At least ITs have the opportunity to work towards that aim. The ITs who perform well and develop in a manner which merits an upgrade should receive it.</P>

I am seeking to avoid the same situation or another<i> fait accompli</i> arising in this case. The Minister will throw her hands up into the air despite all the consultations. They will be worth nothing and will be thrown to the four winds in a garage sale in which the group will be split up and each hotel sold individually.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring to a report to the Minister for Public Enterprise.</P>
      <P>The report deals with the future of the airports but its references to the Great Southern Hotel group are in the context of the group being non-core business. I will quote the relevant sections which will give a flavour of the experts' views. In section 3 the report states:</P>
      <P>The group has a wholly owned domestic hotel chain &ndash; Great Southern Hotels &ndash; which, while operating successfully, is non-core to the group's airport management operations.</P>
      <P>Section 5 states:</P>
      <P>. . . establish an appropriate financing strategy (centred around borrowings in the first two to three years; exiting from non-core activities i.e. Great Southern Hotels; and no dividend payments over the period to 2002 . . .)</P>
      <P>Page 8 states:</P>
      <P>The authority to exit from Great Southern Hotels (in a manner determined through a consultative process with relevant stakeholders) and to use the proceeds from the sale to part finance the airports capital expenditure programme.</P>
      <P>There is a further telling phrase in the appendix which discusses the advantages and disadvantages of the group:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The exit from Great Southern Hotels (&ldquo;GSH&rdquo;) would raise additional capital for Aer Rianta but will be insufficient by itself to <Col N="1319" /> enable the company to fund its strategy and develop the potential of its existing airport related assets. GSH does not provide any return to Aer Rianta on the capital &ldquo;tied up&rdquo; in its operations. ... GSH is currently planning capital expenditure on its own account of c.£33m over the next 5 years. Exiting from GSH will also allow Aer Rianta to focus its management resources on its core areas of expertise.</P>
    <P>The advantages of the group as quoted in the report include: &ldquo;Is a non core activity&rdquo;, &ldquo;Likely to realise maximum value&rdquo;, &ldquo;Potentially a long list of interested parties&rdquo;, &ldquo;Relatively straightforward transaction&rdquo;, &ldquo;Low costs&rdquo;, &ldquo;A new owner may bring marketing clout, high quality customer referrals, capital and new ideas to GSH&rdquo;. The only disadvantage with the group is: &ldquo;Poor portfolio spread (concentrated in resorts) may reduce value&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There is not a word about employment security or retaining the group as a single entity. There is nothing about the group's role in the tourism industry or its training brief.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>In this report, there is no reference to the optimum future for the Great Southern Hotel group. There is no reference to issues such as the national tourism interest, local regional economies and employment security, pay and <Col N="1320" /> conditions. They are not even mentioned. The only references are to &ldquo;exit&rdquo; and &ldquo;disposal&rdquo;, as if the group was a piece of garbage which had to be removed. If that is to be the basis of the hotel group's future, it does not inspire confidence.</P>
      <P>A major tourism marketing fair was held recently in the RDS. I was advised by experts in tourism that there is a nine month time lag between a company presenting its prices and marketing promotions to the trade and actually selling its product. The uncertainty generated by this report and the Minister's unclear stance on it has led to huge uncertainty which will undermine the business and security of the Great Southern Hotel group.</P>
      <P>Management has asked that I convey one message to the Minister in this debate &ndash; that she should introduce certainty and establish a definite timetable to determine the group's future, whatever that will be, rapidly. However, the Government amendment to the motion contains the usual formulae which are the hallmark of this Minister. It states &ldquo;. . . that such decisions will only be taken after the fullest consultation, in particular with the staff of the hotels, and with the overriding objective of maintaining and maximising employment; and that the Minister for Public Enterprise will continue to make herself available to meet with the staff of the hotels and their union representatives in that regard.&rdquo; It refers to everything except a commitment as to its future and the direction the Minister intends to proceed. I am not against consultation, but I am against the Minister endlessly keeping the ball in the air so that she can tell her backbenchers a decision has not been taken on this and using that as a substitute for decision-making. We want a decision taken on the group that would provide that it would be kept as a single commercial entity and, if necessary, a State shareholding in it would be retained and that it would maintain its role in terms of CERT training and its benefit to the local economies and not end up like Mulrany. I am not criticising Minister about a lack of consultation, I was never in doubt about that but we cannot use the fig leaf of consultation as a refuge for not setting out policy and making decisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>SIPTU provided me with figures on training in the hotel industry for 1997 and 1998, which indicate its fears. Low pay and a shortage of skilled staff are common. A total of £13.7 million was spent on training in 1997 and £15.4 million was spent on it in 1998, making a total of £29.1 million over the two years. The industry's contribution to that was approximately £600,000 or 2 per cent. There is concern that the Great Southern Hotel Group might be taken out of the hotel training equation. That group plays a pivotal role in Rosslare in the winter months. I know Deputy Daly is concerned about this. Shannon interests are alarmed that they may be butchered, dissected and thrown to the four winds. A meeting <Col N="1321" /> was held last Wednesday, which the Minister did not attend.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's misrepresentation of the facts do not add heat or light to the debate. If flagship groups, such as the Great Southern Hotel Group, are taken out of the equation, she should not be surprised if standards in the industry and in the level of staff training from commi chef to manager are seriously undermined.</P>
      <P>One of the few facilities Opposition parties have is their ability to focus the minds of Deputies on a vote on a matter on Wednesdays at 8.30 p.m. I appeal to the Independents, particularly the Independent from Kerry South to support this motion. Three hotels in this group, the Torc in Killarney, Parknasilla and the other Great Southern Hotel in Killarney are vital to the economy of south Kerry. Public meetings and deputations have met on this matter in response to which Deputies from Kerry South gave categoric assurances that they will deliver not only their own votes but those of other Independents to ensure they play their parts to secure the group's future. They will have the opportunity to do that tomorrow at 8.30 p.m. The consultation referred to in the Government amendment could mean anything, the phrase &ldquo;no Government decisions&rdquo; could be any decision in the future. Therefore, the Government amendment does not best represent the group's future. While I accept a Deputy or party might produce a better motion than mine and propose a 100 per cent State ownership of the group or other guarantees of employment and conditions, I appeal to all Opposition Deputies to vote against the Government amendment and to see it for what it is. The Government's approach to the matter is to get over the local and European elections just as it had to get over the Dublin North by-election before it decided what to do about TEAM. Its strategy is to wait until after 11 June before deciding what it will do about this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Great Southern Hotel Group's annual report and accounts will be published next week. They will show its profits increased to £2.9 million <Col N="1322" /> in 1997 and will increase to approximately £3.5&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>£3.6 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;£3.6 million in 1998 based on a turnover of £26 million. That has been achieved with an owner who has been very reluctant to invest. There is the new Dublin hotel, but the owner has been a reluctant investor in terms of refurbishment and what needs to be done in the group's hotels around the country. In spite of that the group has yielded a 13 per cent net profit on turnover, which augurs well for its future success.</P>
      <P>The uncertainty about the group's future has created dread and fear among its staff. They believe Aer Rianta has its problems. Despite all the clack and cackle about duty free sales, it is in dire jeopardy. The Minister launched a major campaign to maintain duty free sales, but it has run into the sand. There is the prospect Aer Rianta will face the abolition of duty free sales, high borrowings and a Government induced IPO, which is the way the Minister wants to proceed with Aer Lingus and, seemingly, with Aer Rianta. In those circumstances, the Great Southern Hotel Group cannot be considered as an &ldquo;any other business&rdquo; item at the tailend of Aer Rianta's problems. We must deal with it on the basis of its intrinsic merit and intrinsic problems.</P>
      <P>At a major conference yesterday, entitled, I understand, &ldquo;Sink or Swim&rdquo;&ndash; I do not know if that reflects the Minister's political position &ndash; she said she treats every State enterprise on its merits. I put it to her that if she studied the terms put forward by her experts about the future of Aer Rianta, she would note it refers to an ESOP. There is an ESOP of almost 15 per in Telecom Eireann. There is talk of an ESOP for the employees of Aer Rianta but one is not mentioned for the employees of its subsidiary, the Great Southern Hotel Group. It is not fair to the employees to make fish of one and flesh of another. In the interests of fair play, the principle of an ESOP &ndash; which is not referred to in the Government's amendment &ndash; must be given the same consideration in regard to the 800 full-time employees of the Great Southern Hotel Group as in the case the employees of Aer Rianta.</P>
      <P>A critical point put forward at the last Wednesday's meeting, about which the Minister appears to be so ill informed, was that the people are the hotel. A friendly ambience in a hotel and the staffs commitment to give a cead mile failte are critical.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The approach of dumping on the Great Southern Hotel Group because it does not fit into Aer Rianta's plans is not an acceptable way to proceed. In 1991 Aer Rianta bought the Great Southern Hotel Group for the princely sum of £10 million &ndash; a steal at that time. The group is not Aer Rianta's to dispose of or exist from as it <Col N="1323" /> sees fit. It is a matter for those who gave Aer Rianta the Great Southern Hotel for £10 million to decide what is in the best interests in terms of employment, the tourism product, the hotel sector and regional economies, particularly in south Kerry, where the group is one of its largest employers.</P>
    <P>I am not saying I have set out what should be the ultimate solution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I set reasonable parameters within which one could proceed logically in the best interests of the Exchequer, the group's employees and the industry. I regret the Minister may have done a back street deal with Deputy Healy-Rae &ndash; who will have an opportunity to speak during this debate &ndash; which will get the Government over the local elections, but this issue will not go away. This issue cannot be tossed into the future and deferred indefinitely because that would only create more marketing uncertainty for the group. It will not be able to recruit the best people. The staff asked me how could they get the best chefs if, when recruited, they do not know whether they will have a job in 12 months' time I look forward to the Minister's contribution but I hope we will get more assurances than this fig leaf of an amendment which lacks any substance and only seeks to defer consideration of these major issues.</P>

      <P>He has a very good overview of what is about to happen. Agreements are being entered into and promises made that a lucrative opportunity to acquire hotels will be available to certain people if and when the Government allows Aer Rianta to sell the Great Southern Hotel group. We all hear information through the grapevine and perhaps the Minister is not directly involved. However, predators are looking greedily at this great national asset. They are waiting to pounce and no doubt this Government will not be found wanting in giving the direction to Aer Rianta to put these hotels up for sale&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is inviting comment. Tourism has taken over from agriculture as the principle source of income for the Kerry economy and, therefore, it is very important to the county. Given the failure of the IDA to attract a sufficient number of jobs to the county it relies increasingly on tourism to provide them. The Great Southern Hotel group employs over 300 full-time staff which, after Kerry Ingredients and Fexco, is more than any other single enterprise in the county. It provides about 160,000 bed nights all year round which is significant. Some counties would boast if they had that number of bed nights available to them.</P>
      <P>The group provides 264 rooms all year round. The Killarney Great Southern provides 180 all year round, the Parknasilla Great Southern 84 all year round and the Torc Great Southern 94 rooms six months of the year. The group also provides the very important CERT courses to which Deputy Yates referred and which are needed so much in the industry. The removal of the Great Southern Hotel Group from public ownership will result in a significant loss for Kerry. I am convinced that if a private operator takes over and arrangements differ substantially from the present, it will not benefit the employees or the economy of Kerry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although the Great Southern hotels are located in the southern part of the county, nevertheless those who stay there use facilities in north Kerry such as Ballybunion golf club, attend the <Col N="1325" /> Listowel races, visit Tralee and also stay in Parknasilla. The hotels impact on the entire county. They have built up a standard which is unequalled not only in this country but in the world. Tourism started in Killarney when the first Great Southern hotel was built around 1860. Tourism growth in Killarney was synonymous with the growth of the Great Southern hotel there. For that reason, there is a close affinity between the Killarney, Torc and Parknasilla Great Southern hotels and the people of south Kerry, Killarney, Kenmare, Sneem and the surrounding areas.</P>
    <P>This matter involves concerns greater than staffing. People are concerned that a community institution may be taken away from them. I take the Minister's word that she has made no decision or given any direction in this regard. However, in the event that a decision was made, I would like the concerns of the staff to be dealt with as well as consideration of what the Great Southern emblem means to Kerry. This is important. Tourism is part of the psyche of south Kerry. That is why I ask the Minister not to take this motion lightly, but to consider it carefully, to accept it if possible and to give clear answers when she replies to the questions raised by Deputy Yates. We need to know where she stands in order to reassure the workers and greater population of Kerry about what she intends to do with the Great Southern Hotel group.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister is good in defence and she has told me on several occasions that she performs better when attacked.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>However, there is no point in the Minister giving a list of all the decisions made by coalition Governments in the past. That will not allay the fears of workers or the tourism industry. I would like the Minister to outline clearly her intentions. What is her vision? This may differ from the report to which Deputy Yates referred and the approach of Aer Rianta, which will make a major killing having acquired the Great Southern Hotel group, the Shannon hotel, hotel sites at Dublin and Cork Airports for £10 million and a loan of £4 million in 1990. It got a very good deal and has now decided, for its own expediency, to sell out, which is no doubt what it wants to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Aer Rianta is accountable to the Minister and she must stop it. She must intervene on behalf of the workers and the tourism industry. There is concern about this in south Kerry. There is pressure on Deputy Healy-Rae who has made commitments in this regard. If the Minister gives a half-baked reply to Deputy Yates, I would hate to see the effect of that on Deputy Healy-Rae in south Kerry as he is a very good friend of mine. It will affect him and he will be under considerably <Col N="1326" /> more pressure. The more pressure he is under the greater the affect on the lifespan of the Government. The Minister should bear this in mind.</P>

      <P>I am delighted to speak in support of this motion put down by Deputy Yates. There must be many people in the employ of Aer Rianta who are concerned about the Minister's track record. For example, she has failed those involved in duty free sales which is a core operation of Aer Rianta. To all intents and purposes, duty free is finished.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>It is welcome but we have heard that on several occasions in the past when the Minister visited Europe. Her record in regard to Aer Rianta is two down and one to go.</P>
      <P>Aer Rianta's proposal to dispose of the Great Southern Hotels group is in response to the Government's prevailing policy to withdraw from commercial involvement in semi-State companies. In its strategy for the next ten years Aer Rianta's vision for the future is to be a premier international airport management group meeting the needs of its customers. The Great Southern Hotels group no longer has a place in this vision.</P>
      <P>One of its recognised core activities in the past was the management and operation of its wholly owned hotel chain; the others were airport management and duty free. We are now told that this element of the company is non-essential and its management wants to offload the hotels in order to use the proceeds from the sales to part finance the airport's capital expenditure programme. The hotel chain is operating successfully, with a profit of £3.5 million last year, a 20 per cent increase on the previous year's profits, and this reflects the buoyancy of the tourist industry.</P>
      <P>If Aer Rianta is to withdraw from this non-core activity and use the finance for investment in its core activity of airport management, will the Minister ensure that part of the proceeds will be spent on regional airports as well as the management of the three major airports? If the two hotels in Galway, the Great Southern, Eyre Square, and the Corrib Great Southern, are sold will part of the proceeds of these sales be put into the development of Galway Regional Airport?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is great uncertainty within the board of Aer Rianta about the future of the hotels. The chairman, Mr. Noel O'Hanlon, stated last year that he categorically denied that the group was being sold. He said: &ldquo;Great Southern Hotels is <Col N="1327" /> not up for sale, has not been offered for sale and we have not talked to anybody about selling it.&rdquo;  The Minister seems to indicate that there is support for the disposal of the hotel group within the Cabinet. The chief executive of the group, Mr. Eamonn MacKeon, has professed no problem with the idea of the group leaving the State sector. The hotels are ideally located in airports or high density tourist areas, such as Galway and Kerry, and are obviously an attractive proposition for a major hotel operator to purchase individually or otherwise. It would be a serious mistake if there were to be a break up of the group because it has acted at all times as the flagship of Irish tourism.</P>
    <P>There is no mention in the Minister's report of the Shannon College of Hotel Management at Shannon Airport. This institution has provided the State with core personnel and managers for the tourism industry but its future has not been discussed. There must be serious concern within the management of the school about its future and also among people who want to enter it. There is serious concern about the Government's and Aer Rianta's attitude towards the provision of adequately trained managers for our many hotels. People who have attended the college are at the forefront of Irish tourism and hotels throughout the world. A serious mistake has been made by not including it in any vision for the future of Great Southern Hotels. The Government has failed to recognise it even as part of the higher education grants scheme. It is the last straw when it cannot even be mentioned in the Minister's report. There is great concern among the staff regarding their future employment. They have no future within the hotel group because of the Government's inaction in this area. This issue must be addressed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate Deputy Yates on bringing this motion before the House and I hope it focuses the Minister's attention. I am concerned that there seems to be a rush to sell off the Great Southern Hotels group and make as much money as possible for Aer Rianta, then wash our hands of responsibility for all eight hotels. The hotels are located at Dublin Airport, Parknasilla, Rosslare, Shannon, Killarney and Galway.</P>
      <P>I am not necessarily against the idea of reducing the State's role in the running of the hotel group and I understand the arguments for selling it and raising much needed funds for Aer Rianta. However, the dangers of selling off such a large group, hotel by hotel, to raise cash through the disposal of assets must be stressed. The aim seems to be to make a quick buck regardless of the consequences and this worries the Opposition. The group is worth more to Ireland than merely the accumulation of its assets in monetary value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1328" /> Three primary values must be considered before selling off or partially selling off the group. The first is its influence on tourism. Tourism is our largest industry and is set to continue to grow at a phenomenal rate, as it has done in recent times. The standard of hotel accommodation has contributed to this growth in a major way. The Great Southern Hotels group sets the standard for the hotel industry, which serves tourists who visit Ireland. I agree with Deputy Yates that this hotel group is the flagship of the hotel industry. The State currently has a direct involvement in setting the standard for the hotel industry and that has its advantages in ensuring a quality service for tourists when they reach our shores.</P>
    <P>My second concern is the group has a more direct impact on the hotel industry than setting high standards. If a hotel manager is asked what is his or her biggest problem with regard to the running of an establishment, he or she will say that it is staffing, specifically the difficulty in acquiring quality trained Irish staff. While canvassing in Cork recently a hotel manager told me that his biggest worry regarding the hotel industry was not that tourists would stop coming to Ireland but that we would not have the staff to deal with them in our hotels. The Great Southern Hotels group plays a crucial role in training hotel staff for the industry through CERT programmes. If one thinks that a private hotel investor will be concerned about the greater good of providing staff, training facilities and places, one is very much mistaken. His or her mind will understandably be on profits. A good example of the group's contribution towards hotel staff training is in Killarney where one of the hotels there closes for six months each year and provides much needed training facilities for staff within the group. If the Great Southern Hotel group is broken up into eight different units, its wider role will disappear. The hotel group provides 880 jobs; it is a massive employer. If the group breaks up I would be concerned about the security of those jobs. I hope the Minister will address that matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann notes that the Ministers for Public Enterprise and Finance are examining the future options for the Great Southern Hotel group in the context of the report on the future strategic direction of Aer Rianta; that no Government decisions in relation to the future of the hotel group have been taken; that such decisions will only be taken after the fullest consultation, in particular with the staff of the hotels, and with the overriding objective of maintaining and maximising employment; and that the Minister <Col N="1329" /> for Public Enterprise will continue to make herself available to meet with the staff of the hotels and their union representatives in that regard.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It must be very comforting for Deputy Yates to have an admiring chorus each time he stands up, saying that he is such a wonderful person. I hope it makes him feel good.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish the Minister had a chorus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I was just going to say that I will have to have a chorus. Of all the contributions, I found Deputy Coveney's the most clear-cut. He had a fair idea of what he wanted to say. He had no disagreement with selling the hotels but said they should be sold as a unit. That is a clear-cut point of view.</P>
      <P>No Government decision in relation to this hotel group has been taken, despite what Deputy Deenihan said. Despite the jibes that Deputy Yates made about consultation, I have been committed to it all my life. As an ASTI negotiator, I used to be a shop steward in my school and the idea of consultation is a proper one. It is interesting that Deputy Yates never mentioned employment in his motion, although it is mentioned in my amendment.</P>
      <P>As regards consultation, I offered to meet the union representatives last Friday, but on Thursday evening the unions rang to say they could not meet me formally until the following week. The meeting has been fixed for this Thursday. I have already been to the Corrib, Eyre Square and Shannon Great Southern hotels and met with groups of staff representatives. I intend to visit all the hotels in the group to meet with the other staff representatives. I also met with many GSH staff outside the gates of Leinster House last week. Contrary to what Deputy Yates said, the GSH staff said he was extremely &ndash; perhaps rude is too strong a word &ndash; blunt and had an open mind. However, he then said he did not have an open mind, so they did not quite know where he stood.</P>
      <P>The motion is all over the place and I do not understand what the Deputy means. It calls on the Government &ldquo;to review the Aer Rianta proposal to dispose of the Great Southern Hotel group so as to ensure that it is retained as a single commercial entity&rdquo;. However, it is a single commercial entity at the moment. The motion goes on to state that &ldquo;if it is necessary to achieve these objectives, a State shareholding is preserved in the company&rdquo;. That is interesting, but I do not quite know what the Deputy is getting at. The motion also states that &ldquo;full consideration be given to an ESOP as part of any review&rdquo;, but ESOP betokens just one thing. Therefore, I do not know what the Deputy means. It seems that he set out to write a motion, but then changed his mind half way through it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1330" /> Deputy Deenihan said I was not to refer to previous times, but I am my own person and will do so. Mr. Peter Barry was Minister for Transport in November 1976 when a decision was taken to sell five hotels in the Great Southern Hotel group, in Kenmare, Mulranny, Sligo, Bundoran and the Russell Court in Belfast.</P>
    <P>Interestingly enough, on 20 January 1987, when the Labour Party had left the coalition Government, a decision was taken, among others, which read as follows: &ldquo;To approve the disposal by the State of 100 per cent of its holdings in Óstanna Iompair Éireann hotels so as to achieve the maximum capital savings for the Exchequer&rdquo;. The Government decision on 20 January 1987 was to dispose of it. Deputy John Bruton, whose name is on today's motion, was then Minister for Finance and Deputy Jim Mitchell was Minister for Transport.</P>
    <P>It is as well to put these matters on the record so that it is quite clear that the decisions to sell these hotels were made by Fine Gael Ministers. On 20 January 1987 Labour had left the Government when the decision was taken &ldquo;so as to achieve the maximum capital savings for the Exchequer&rdquo;. There was no such thing as training, it was just a case of &ldquo;Get the money and run, boys and girls&rdquo;. That is in the past but I quite agree that we should not dwell upon it. We should deal with the future.</P>
    <P>The report which was waved about in a frenzied way by Deputy Yates was not mine. I asked Aer Rianta to commission a report which was delivered to me. I commend the group on how it went about its business, but rather than take any report at face value we are having it analysed. When it has been analysed I will go to Cabinet and a collective decision will be taken on it.</P>
    <P>The idea that I should not speak to anybody or that I should run around and make up my mind on the floor of the House on what is a very important issue, while not having time for consultation, is anathema to me. I will not do so and neither would any of my colleagues.</P>
    <P>It is easy for Deputy Yates to sneer about TEAM, but when his party was in Government it did nothing about it for a long time. It took some courage to battle into TEAM. I ensured that the workers in TEAM could meet me at any time. I must have met 1,000 of them individually before the matter was all over. It was a long process. They had every right to be met and talked to. That is the way I will do my business. I will not do it in a helter-skelter or daft way which would leave no one satisfied. One would end up with a hasty, ill-conceived decision. I make no apology for wanting to talk to people and I am determined to do so.</P>
    <P>I recognise the hugely significant role within the local and national economy that the Great Southern Hotel group occupies. Over the years, my husband and I have been devotees of the <Col N="1331" /> Great Southern Hotel in Killarney. I might add, before Deputies run off to a tribunal, that we paid our full whack. For almost 20 years we have gone to Valencia on our holidays and en route, both there and back, we take a break in Killarney and experience a bit of civilisation before we go. There is nothing wrong with Valencia but it is spartan enough. I am sorry that Deputy Deenihan has left the Chamber because we could have shared reminiscences about Kerry.</P>
    <P>I know the two Great Southern Hotels in Galway, having travelled there from Athlone. I have been in all the Great Southern Hotels. We spent four holidays in Rosslare. I have been in the one at Shannon, the Torc and the others over the years. They are good examples of where very fine people work to a public remit and are determined to give good service, although not in a servile way. If one provides a product with good service, there is nothing servile in it. It is good work.</P>
    <P>In developing its response to my request, the board of Aer Rianta established a sub-committee to work with management. That is the report the Opposition Deputies have all been waving about. Deputy Ulick Burke said the Cabinet had a mind to sell the hotels but I do not know where he got that idea. The Deputy mentioned what Mr. Eamon McKeown had said. However, Mr. McKeown, as chief executive of the Great Southern Hotels group, is entitled to express his view.</P>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister ignored it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>He is entitled to his view. I commend Aer Rianta on taking its duties seriously. I took the idea of writing to a board from Deputy Dukes and it will be interesting to see how he votes tomorrow. When I took over from him he had already written to Aer Lingus asking that body to prepare a strategic report. I borrowed the same formula when I wrote to Aer Rianta as I felt it was a competent formula.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance and I are analysing the Aer Rianta proposals and when we are finished I will bring our findings to the Cabinet. I want to make it clear to the staff of the Great Southern Hotels group and their unions, that I am available to meet with them and to discuss their concerns. I arranged a meeting for next Thursday but it had to be cancelled, perhaps because some people could not attend. The professional analysis of Aer Rianta's proposals which I am having carried out is focused primarily on the future direction of the company. The chairman of Aer Rianta has advised me that the board has retained Arthur Andersen to focus on the options for the Great Southern Hotels.</P>
      <P>I want to find the right future for Great Southern Hotels that will also be right for the staff in terms of their employment and other rights. as well as for the Irish tourism industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1332" /> This Aer Rianta review process should not be regarded as a threat to the Great Southern Hotels group. The Great Southern Hotels group has a proud history and I know it will have a vibrant future. The review process is an opportunity for the group. It is my intention that any changes that might be considered by the Government in the course of its review of the future strategic direction of its parent company, Aer Rianta, will be to the benefit of the Great Southern Hotels group and its staff. It would be wrong to assume that one company needs to be placed at a disadvantage for the benefit of the other.</P>
    <P>There are great opportunities ahead for the future development of the Great Southern Hotels, just as there are great opportunities for the future development of Aer Rianta. The development of one does not preclude the development of the other. The issue is how best to ensure that both companies are set on the right track and that is what I am having examined.</P>
    <P>The Galway Great Southern dates from 1845 and the Killarney Great Southern from 1854. This was the heyday of rail travel and the hotels were designed to take in weary passengers at journey's end to refresh and delight them. They were resort hotels to be supplied with customers by the new railway and that era marked the first beginnings of the tourism industry as we know it today.</P>
    <P>The railway company put together a package, not only building the railway track, but also developing top quality hotel accommodation in the towns at the end of the lines. The idea was that these quality hotels would provide a tourist attraction and this would, in turn, promote greater use of railway that served the location.</P>
    <P>The State acquired the hotels as part and parcel of its acquisition of the various private railway companies and their amalgamation to form CIE. By the 1960's, with the decline of railway traffic and the growth in use of the motor car, the hotel group developed several motor-inn type facilities such as the Rosslare Hotel, the Torc in Killarney and the Corrib in Galway. The Russell Court in Belfast was also developed in this period.</P>
    <P>After the oil crises of the 1970's and the downturn in tourism, in 1977 the Government sold the Kenmare, Mulrany, Sligo and Bundoran hotels and the Russell Court was disposed of in 1983. Those five were sold so that capital could be invested in the others. It was different from the decision to sell taken in January 1987, which was taken in order to get the maximum capital available. Lest I wrong the person who took the decision to sell in 1976, capital was raised for essential refurbishment of the remaining hotels.</P>
    <P>Deputy Yates said that the Mulranny hotel had become almost a ruin but I am sure he regrets that his Government decided to sell it. When my husband and I were a young married couple we spent a weekend there with another couple and I will never forget the beauty of the place. It was a <Col N="1333" /> short-sighted decision to sell it but it was done to raise capital for the others.</P>
    <P>Trading conditions remained very poor. By the early 1980s the Great Southern Hotels group had accumulated losses of £10 million. The group was then transferred to CERT, the national body responsible for the co-ordination of education, recruitment and training for the tourism industry. The Government provided for a re-financing package of £14 million to cover accrued losses, rationalisation of the group and a programme of capital development. A further £2.7 million was made available in 1986, bringing the total amount to £16.7 million. By early 1987 the company was trading profitably and it was then decided to sell the hotels.</P>
    <P>The then board of Great Southern Hotels recognised that further significant investment in the group was needed to realise its potential. The board recognised that the company was incapable of financing the required development programme from its own internal resources. The Government decision of January 1987 was never implemented. In 1990 the Government decided to accept an offer from Aer Rianta to acquire the six hotels of the Great Southern Hotels group in return for a cash payment of £10 million to the Exchequer and a commitment to invest in further development. Aer Rianta agreed to contribute £4 million immediately to a further refurbishment programme. Aer Rianta also transferred its hotel at Shannon airport to the Great Southern group bringing the number of hotels in the chain to seven.</P>
    <P>Today the group consists of eight hotels and five are located in prime tourist destinations. These are the Killarney Great Southern, the Torc Great Southern and the Parknasilla Great Southern in County Kerry and the Galway Great Southern and the Corrib Great Southern in Galway city. The remaining three hotels are located at the principal tourist and business gateways to the country; one at Shannon airport, one in Rosslare and a new hotel at Dublin airport. Cork Deputies will be interested in the plans for a further hotel adjacent to Cork airport which is due to commence construction before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>The hotel group has progressed well over the years since its acquisition by Aer Rianta. Turnover in 1997 increased by 4.4 per cent to £22 million while the net profit grew by 12 per cent to £2.9 million. The 1998 figure is in the area of £3.4 to £3.6 million. Aer Rianta has not taken any dividends from the hotel group and has invested significantly since its acquisition. Between 1990 and 1998 a total of £32 million has been invested, including the construction of the newest addition at Dublin airport, which cost £10 million. The Great Southern Hotels group has made profits of £18.4 million in that period. Aer Rianta has definitely fulfilled the remit it was given in 1990.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1334" /> The Great Southern in Killarney now remains open all year round and produced record results in 1998. Parknasilla will remain open for all of 1999 for the first time in its 104 year history and Rosslare has extended its season to 11 months. The company's marketing plan is geared to developing more off-season business in the winter at these locations. The Great Southern Hotel at Dublin airport is a state of the art development. It has created employment for 87 new staff with particular emphasis placed on recruitment from local communities. The addition of this property substantially enhances the geographic spread of the group and will help to reduce its exposure to seasonal locations. There have already been huge additions to it as another 80 bedrooms and six new conference rooms are to be added. The development of a hotel at Cork airport will fulfil the objective of having a Great Southern Hotel at each of the main tourist gateways. This hotel will have 75 bedrooms and should be completed by the end of next year.</P>
    <P>It is a good time to examine the options for the future development of Great Southern Hotels, as business has never been better for the Irish hotels industry. The current performance of the sector tells the story. The last five years have seen continuous and significant growth. Fifty new hotels were built in 1997, 37 last year and a further 30 are expected this year. The number of hotel rooms has risen by approximately 50 per cent. Dublin has witnessed the highest growth rate. We are all aware of being constantly surprised at the unexpected appearance of yet another new hotel in the city. I want the hotels that belong to the Great Southern Hotel group to be able to participate fully in, and benefit from these positive developments in this important sector of the economy.</P>
    <P>The expansion of the hotels sector is underpinned by the continuous growth in tourist and business traffic to Ireland as well as buoyant Irish origin tourism growth. While growth in tourism was expected, the rate of that growth has exceeded all expectations.</P>
    <P>Irish tourism continues to grow. Last year there was an increase of 9 per cent over 1997. The US and UK markets continued to flourish and the strong Irish economy ensured the further growth of the domestic sector. Continental traffic was disappointing. The domestic economies of Germany and France are performing sluggishly and the number of visitors from those countries has been disappointing. Overall, the message remains one of growth in visitors and in demand for hotel accommodation.</P>
    <P>The Opposition motion mentioned employee share ownership schemes. As I have stated in the past and continue to say, the issue of ESOPs in commercial State companies can be dealt with only on a case by case basis in accordance with <Col N="1335" /> the particular circumstances of the company in question. Deputy Yates told me on a previous occasion that his party had changed its mind from the ESOP policy as enunciated by the previous incumbant of my office. I am glad this is so. I spent two and a half glorious years in Opposition and I loved the freedom of it.</P>

      <P>I have not yet met the group of unions. I have not even had a full collective meeting although I have met individual groups of unions in the hotels I have mentioned, and I will meet the others. How can I make a decision before I talk to the workers? That would be extraordinary and it is not how I do business.</P>
      <P>I am amazed at the suggestion that any set of workers could have faith in Deputy Yates's party. I do not bracket the Labour Party with Fine Gael in this matter. Deputy Spring, on the evening of the famous Telecom Éireann conference in Tralee, sought to change his Cabinet colleagues' minds on the ESOP issue but he did not succeed. Fine Gael had hardly left Government when they espoused the concept of ESOPs. The suggestion that employees might have confidence in Fine Gael's Machiavellian change of heart is amazing.</P>
      <P>This Government, more than any other, has shown that the staff and their long-term interests are to the fore at all times when future options for the development of State companies are being considered. Great Southern Hotels has a loyal, professional group of employees who are, and will continue to be, a key factor in the continued success of the group.</P>
      <P>The retention and recruitment of staff in the hotel business is becoming increasingly difficult. An Opposition speaker remarked that managers trained at great expense by the Great Southern Hotels group leave the group to work in other hotels throughout the country. I recognise that staff will be very concerned whenever the possibility of major change is mooted. I have been advised by the chairman of the board of Aer Rianta that they have extended the appointment of Andersen Consulting to examine further the range of options in respect of the hotel group and to engage closely with the staff in the course of this process.</P>

      <P>When, at the request of SIPTU, Deputy Moynihan-Cronin and I arranged a meeting to discuss the future of the Great Southern Hotels and invited Deputies and Senators, about 11 of whom attended, I felt a sense of <i>déjà vu. </i>I grappled with the question of the future of the Great Southern Hotels group in the 1970s and 1980s and now here we are again, in 1999, discussing the future of the Great Southern Hotels group. I had hoped the Minister would have remained in earshot so that I could confirm for her the position of my party. My party supports the three clear SIPTU demands &ndash; that the hotel group remain a single entity and that there be security of employment, within a State structure. I have no difficulty in acknowledging the position taken by Deputy Yates which is a considerable advance towards the position I have enunciated. It would be wrong of me not to welcome that but it needs to take a further step forward and place the hotel group where it should be &ndash; within a State structure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the Minister spoke with great sincerity about her pleasant days in the various hotels in the hotel group and enjoyed the ambience and philosophically informed service that she received from the staff, the last thing that they want at this stage is a further debate about uncertainty. I recall the decision in 1987 to offer the hotels for <Col N="1338" /> sale. I was a Member of the other House at the time. The election literature that I printed that year contained a large section about the hotels. It was proposed to retain the downstairs section of the wonderful Great Southern Hotel in Eyre Square, Galway and turn the upstairs bedrooms into offices. When I discussed this recently with the chief executive of the group he said that that was history and that they were just local businessmen. The sale of previous Great Southern hotels was a disaster and the price at which they were sold was close enough to an immoral scandal.</P>
    <P>The case that has frequently been made is bogus. This discussion is not assisted in any way by the crude statements of the chairman of Aer Rianta on television in which he reduced the argument to what is the State doing making beds and serving meals at the end of the 1990s. Nobody but an anti-State ideologue could make such a remark. The reality is simple.</P>
    <P>The expansion of the hotel industry in terms of employment creation through an advance in the tourism industry has been referred to. There is another figure that has not been mentioned. Approximately 46 per cent of those involved in the industry undergo training in their own time and at their own expense. The comparative figures for the contribution of the State and private sector to training were given. They make interesting reading.</P>
    <P>The issue is simple. The Great Southern hotels have an increased asset value and a trading profit. Not only do they provide training they also provide quality management, including quality chefs who have been in kitchens at all grades. Where is the evidence that the quality training necessary not just for the group but for the future of the hotel industry is provided elsewhere? When I put this question to the chief executive, Mr. McKeown, with whom I had an informative meeting, he replied that things have changed in the hotel industry. They have not in relation to the facilities available for training across the sector. Improvements have been made but there is nothing that can match the training now provided. Other than for ideological reasons, why would one want to wreck the flagship of the industry?</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that this has to be done in the name of inevitable change. This is an untruth. There is nothing in any EU directive or treaty which requires the breakup of the group because the State has an interest in it. One can find models across the European Union of state and semi-state groups involved in the hotel industry. Some of the better ones provide training. It is nonsense to suggest, therefore, that this has to happen.</P>
    <P>Far be it from me, as a member, to stand in the Minister's way in consulting SIPTU but as the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, Deputy de Valera, Deputy Daly or any <Col N="1339" /> of the other Government Deputies present at the meeting last Wednesday could tell her, its members are clear on what they want &ndash; security of employment and conditions, the hotel group to continue its success story within a State structure to ensure quality training is available in the industry.</P>
    <P>There is no need for confusion. To assist the conversation which will take place on Thursday, there is a difference between going into talks at which everything is on the table and having talks which are based on the assumption that the hotel group is to be separated from Aer Rianta and at which one will be asked how one feels about the various options. That is what is on offer from the Minister. If she had said that she was taking the proposal in relation to exiting or being thrown out of Aer Rianta off the table and would start from scratch about the future of the group, the position would be different.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that she was discussing with the Minister for Finance the Government's response to the consultancy report on Aer Rianta. One would not need a PhD to deconstruct that remark. The report which was presented in considerable detail by the Minister did not acknowledge the importance of the contribution of the Great Southern Hotels Group to training.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil goes through phases where it states that all it is doing is listening. In Opposition it states that the Government is not listening and everybody is whispering but when all the listening and whispering is over one has to listen to those with something to say. They were people like, for example, the senior chef who was perhaps one of the strongest people who spoke about the staff who came through the kitchen. He spoke about where they are now and how standards in other places have depended on the standard to which the young person was exposed, the scale of the operation which was able to carry the level of training and the fact it was willing to lend itself to the State training structure through CERT. If people want to tell me this is all available elsewhere, I will certainly be open to hearing that.</P>
    <P>I do not want to talk about groups, but I suppose I am required to do so. If one talks about Ryan's, Jury's or Doyle's, one cannot compare their training capacity with the Great Southern Hotel Group's capacity. Here is what is at stake. We have something which has international acclamation. The Minister, her partner and others speak lovingly of their experience on their way to primitive villages and of coming back feeling resuscitated after calling in. That is all right, but the fact is that the Great Southern Hotel Group is working. Why break it up for the narrowest and daftest ideological reasons?</P>
    <P>One comes then to the other issue in the report on Aer Rianta which I am as well able to read as <Col N="1340" /> anybody else. If Aer Rianta wants to buy, let us say, Rome Airport, building the hotel in Cork, which the Great Southern Hotel Group wants to do, as well as refurbishing its hotels, as it needs to do, as a set of capital requirements, has to go into competition with Rome Airport. One can see the argument for taking the hotel group from one State setting to another. What one cannot say, however, is that because the airport facilities group wishes to borrow for mainstream core airport expansion activity, it automatically means it can shed other parts it has acquired below capital cost and simply say it will use the yield from this as a drop in the ocean towards what it really wants when its borrowing requirement is lifted for its other activities. That is just callous in relation to the question of the hotel group.</P>
    <P>The hotel group in its own State structure has asset value, trade and human capital sufficient to be able to justify borrowings of a considerable level which would enable it to carry out refurbishment work and to build a hotel in Cork. If it is the case that it is an anti-State thing, people should be up front about it. If people want to say, as the chairman of Aer Rianta did, that they want to take the State out of the hotel industry, it is better if it is said openly rather than being said in a covert fashion. I want to say bluntly, however, may God help us in relation to what would have been the Irish tourism and hotel industry yesterday, today and tomorrow had we not had the Great Southern Hotel Group, the standards it made possible and if we had had to rely on the many people who paid slave wages in appalling unorganised conditions in one venue after another across the country. It is not to anybody's credit that of those who go on day release to do training courses, 46 per cent have to go in their own time and pay for it themselves. It is to that wonderful chaos of the marketplace that the Great Southern Hotel Group would go.</P>
    <P>The motion stops short of the step I would take. It asks something the Minister will not even concede. She will not concede the group can hold together, that the State should ever have a stake or share or concede in relation to employee participation. She justifies it all on the basis that the meeting with SIPTU did not take place last week and is taking place this week. Frankly, I find that rather unconvincing. We really need to know where we stand in this matter.</P>
    <P>It will be for the stuff of novels to write about the rather Boucicault commitments of Deputy Healy-Rae in Kerry who said that not only was he delivering his own vote, but the vote of several other Independents in order to keep the hotels. I am sure he was carried shoulder high for a brief moment. I wonder what will happen when we come to the end of the debate at 8.30 p.m. tomorrow. Far from leaving the hotel group in the State structure, he is not even willing to vote for the <Col N="1341" /> hotel group staying together or for employee involvement in the future of the hotel.</P>
    <P>It is time all that old guff was stopped. It is time we stopped interfering with something which is working very well. It is time for the people who say they have had wonderful experiences, as I and my family have had in different Great Southern Hotels, to respect the rights of these workers. I heard the young woman, who is the shop steward at the Dublin hotel, explain, as the personnel management might, how pleased she was that they are booked out every day and that they are continually busy, yet her colleagues can simply say all that is put at risk by this cloud of uncertainty that is regularly delivered over the future of the group. This is unnecessary.</P>
    <P>There is a type of bootboy privatisation element in that one has to kick something into the private sector every month or so to be in Government. There is something people should know. We should look at the history of the hotel industry and this group, the amount of money which has been drawn down from Europe and from the Exchequer and invested in something which was clearly an investment in the sector and industry and which had good results. People were not investing in an asset which could be held for a while by Aer Rianta and then floated off into the private sector. That was not the intention behind that money which was spent on improving standards and training.</P>
    <P>I said very clearly where my party stands in this matter &ndash; it is not a new position. I find it rather sad that we have to go back to this position again and again. I deplore a type of attrition I detect in the talks which are on offer in the amendment to the motion. The suggestion is that one can defeat everything by saying one's door is always open. The door is always open and the talks are always next week as long as one talks on certain terms. That is what the amendment says and why it is such an evasive disaster.</P>
    <P>In all the circumstances, therefore, I have no hesitation saying that nobody in their right mind who is serious about any worker at any level in any Great Southern Hotel could possibly vote for the amendment. For those of us who believe a significant step is being taken, all I say is that I hope between now and the end of this debate we will see the hotel group securely where it belongs, with investment, security of employment, together and performing well and also within the State structure. We will have taken a very significant step away from the position which regards the State as being somehow inimical to anything which is successful. The State gave us the training which gave us the industry and the quality which has defined the Irish tourism industry. It seems criminal to yet again put it at risk.</P>

        <i>(Mayo)</i>
        <b>:</b> TJT Manufacturing Limited, Kiltimagh, County Mayo, has announced it is closing with the loss of 98 jobs. I spoke with the director of the company, Mr. Tony Meehan, who informed me that the withdrawal of a UK contract is the main and immediate reason for the closure. This is a devastating blow to an area already punch drunk from job losses. TJT Manufacturing Limited was by far the biggest employer in Kiltimagh. The town lost its spinning and yarn factory 12 years ago: it was a crushing blow to the local economy and local morale when Irish Spinners Limited, which once employed 150 workers, finally closed. Kiltimagh lost its railway line. The track still exists and the station has been tastefully converted into a museum and park with the ever lingering expectation that it might one day re-open. The town was left out of the national plan when the new national roads category was being introduced, resulting in it being on neither a national primary nor national secondary route.</P>
      <P>Yet the town refused to die. It galvanised and mobilised its resources. It got an unprecedented response by way of weekly contributions from the community. It built up its own development fund, set up IRD Limited and has transformed the town which now looks much better. It is a bilingual town. New houses have been built and its annual St. Patrick's Day celebration continues for one week with bands and visitors from Germany, the United Kingdom and the US. It has generated small cluster industries, each providing weekly wage packets. However, to lose 98 jobs in one fell swoop is a huge body blow to an already fragile economy. The morale of the region is already reeling from a spate of factory closures.</P>
      <P>No region in the country has seen less of the so-called Celtic tiger and such a spate of job losses and factory closures as east Mayo. Two years ago Asahi in Killala closed with the loss of 200 jobs. Farah closed in Ballyhaunis with the loss of 120 jobs. Recently, All Fresh closed in Charlestown with the loss of 100 jobs. Betatherm Limited closed in Ballinrobe with the loss of 30 jobs. It now looks as if the 350 jobs at Irish Country Meats or Glan Bia in Ballyhaunis and Ballaghaderreen could be under threat as a result of the threatened takeover.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This region has some of the finest post-primary schools in the country &ndash; the results speak for themselves. There is a huge participation rate in third level education. However, for some reason there is a jobs blight in the region which must be addressed as a matter of urgency. While people might get excited about a new factory in Claremorris or Coca Cola Limited in Ballina, the real story is that for the odd new industry which is <Col N="1343" /> opened, three others close; for every job created three other jobs are lost and the decline and imbalance continues. Of the 102 job projects announced in 1998, only 12 came to the western region. The last two disastrous years in farming, with stock dying of starvation and cattle prices returning to those of the early 1980s, means that the next few years will see the small farming community driven in large numbers from the land by economic necessity and with no available jobs in their immediate locality.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Government to tilt the balance towards the west and the Border regions and to provide incentives in these areas as the most attractive location for industry, not simply from the point of view of the welfare of the region, but equally in the context of the need for greater regional balance. I appeal to the Government to devolve meaningful powers and adequate resources to the new Western Development Commission. This, coupled with Objective One status, represents the west's last hope.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Deputy's concerns at the recent announcement by TJT Manufacturing Limited that it intends to close its manufacturing operation on 9 July 1999 with the loss of 85 jobs. Naturally, this decision is a matter of great disappointment for the workers, their families and the local community.</P>
      <P>TJT Manufacturing was established in July 1997 as a management buy-out of Farah Exports Ireland Limited, manufacturer of men's trousers. The company took over the Farah operation as a going concern and received substantial assistance from Forbairt. The decision was forced upon the directors following the withdrawal of a major export contract to the UK. From the start TJT's main contract was with Farah UK, but it also planned to broaden its customer base. However, in autumn 1998, the Farah Group was taken over by Tropical Sports International. Subsequent rationalisation of the group's operations led to the loss of the UK order. The loss of such a large contract posed major difficulties for TJT.</P>
      <P>Consequently, the company was forced to implement a two day week while it was endeavouring to find new market outlets for its products. This was further reduced to a one day week in January 1999. Despite the strenuous efforts made to source alternative customers which achieved some success, the volumes attained were insufficient to permit the continued operation of the manufacturing facility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The company has been examining the business to establish the best way forward and has concluded that it should cease manufacturing altogether. However, TJT will continue to run a warehousing and distribution operation from its outlet in Galway, employing about ten people. <Col N="1344" /> The company retains the licence to distribute the Farah brand.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste is satisfied that Enterprise Ireland has done everything possible within its remit to assist TJT, including an equity injection on start-up and, more recently, grant approvals. She is anxious that every effort be made to assist the workers at TJT who wish to find alternative employment or retraining. The inter-agency taskforce, which she established earlier this year in response to the closure of Betatherm Ireland Ltd., Ballinrobe, has successfully co-ordinated actions to assist the displaced workers there. The Tánaiste has decided, therefore, to extend the remit of the taskforce, under the chairmanship of the Mayo county manager, to formulate a response to the closure of TJT.</P>
    <P>Among the various issues which the group will address are: the undertaking by FÁS of an assessment of the skills of the workers and the provision of appropriate retraining where required and exploring the prospects for attracting alternative enterprises and industries to Kiltimagh which would open up new job opportunities for the town and the surrounding area, including Knock Airport.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has been lobbied by county councillors and local groups to assist in job creation in the area. I am very hopeful, therefore, that the efforts of the taskforce will provide positive results in the coming months which will help mitigate the effects of the closure.</P>

      <P>I thank the Chair for giving me the opportunity to raise this very important matter, namely, the ramming of the Skull based fishing vessel, <i>Oileánn Cléire</i>, by the French registered fishing vessel, <i>Rohellan</i>, and the sinking of the <i>Oileánn Cléire</i> following the collision last Saturday, 15 May, at approximately 7.00 p.m. I demand from the Minister an explanation of the attitude of the Government in not enforcing international maritime laws resulting in owners of Irish fishing vessels involved in collisions or other serious incidents being prohibited from seeking compensation. I demand a full inquiry into this serious incident which threatened the lives of the five crew members, two of whom are from my own parish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been six similar incidents within the past two years since the Minister took office. Why has the Minister sat idly by? Why has the Government failed to take court action against the British, French and Spanish fishing vessels involved in such acts of piracy on the high seas against our fishing fleet? The Minister's approach seems to be very feeble. His statement that lessons can be learned from such incidents is incredible. Is the reason legal action cannot be taken against the cowboys of the high seas that the Government <Col N="1345" /> and the Minister have failed to ratify the 1982 law of the sea convention? If the Government ratified that convention, it would clear the way for our Irish trawler owners to seek compensation from careless foreign trawler owners.</P>
    <P>Pious statements are of little satisfaction to Irish trawler owners who are deprived of making a living by irresponsible and reckless foreign trawler skippers who put their fishing vessels on automatic pilot. They do not care whether they crash into our trawlers which are legally fishing in the area. How much longer will the Minister sit idly by without taking action to ensure the livelihoods of our fishermen are safeguarded? We have had enough of this irresponsible action. The time is long overdue to call a halt to these acts of piracy.</P>
    <P>The lives of our fishermen are at stake. I implore the Minister to deal with this crisis before it is too late. Lives are in danger on the high seas day and night. Our fishermen are threatened by these foreign cowboys. When will the Minister put a stop to this carnage? The Government's attitude smacks of political cowardice. I urge the Minister to take immediate steps to implement the international maritime laws by signing the 1982 law of the sea convention and thereby safeguarding the lives of our hardworking fishermen.</P>
    <P>There is an air of gloom and doom among our trawler owners. The Minister is dilly-dallying with the matter. How many more times must I draw the Minister's attention to this long overdue matter? He should act before it is too late. In the interests of those who are trying to make a living from the sea, I urge the Minister to ensure they are protected by the law of the sea and have the right to fish and that foreign trawlers are not allowed to put their fishing crafts on automatic pilot. They do not care what happens to Irish fishing boats. The lives of our fishermen are in danger and the solution lies in the Minister's hands.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter. I was not standing idly by because I was busy on Saturday night and Sunday morning. I am delighted the emergency services worked so effectively and immediately to ensure no lives were lost in this incident.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that I share his concerns about such incidents. As soon as I was aware of this incident, I made contact with the French Ambassador to express my extreme concern, as it could have resulted in loss of life, and to seek the fullest assistance and co-operation in investigating the collision. I am relieved no lives were lost and that the rapid alerting procedures, which I put in place last year, worked to ensure the resources of the Irish Marine Emergency Service were on hand quickly. Nevertheless, this incident should not have happened and I can give an <Col N="1346" /> assurance that it will be fully investigated so that any lessons learned can ensure against this type of dangerous incident recurring.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, the collision occurred at approximately 7.15 p.m. on Saturday, 15 May 1999 between the French registered fishing vessel, <i>Rohellan</i>, and the Schull based fishing vessel, <i>Oileánn Cléire</i>, 67 miles off the Clare coast. The <i>Oileánn Cléire</i> sank as a result of the collision. Its crew of five abandoned the vessel and took to the liferaft wearing their lifejackets. They were rescued by the <i>Rohellan</i> and were subsequently airlifted by the Irish Marine Emergency Service rescue helicopter and landed at Shannon. None of the crew was injured.</P>
    <P>The <i>Rohellan</i>, which had been disabled in the collision due to a fouled propeller, was watched closely by the Irish Marine Emergency Service to ensure the safety of her crew. The Irish Naval vessel, <i>LE Aisling</i>, was requested to proceed to the scene and arrange to take the stricken French vessel under tow. The Naval Service vessel established that a possible fisheries offence may have been involved and proceeded to tow the French vessel to Cork harbour. While under tow to Cork on the afternoon of Sunday, 16 May, the <i>Rohellan</i> called for assistance again from the Irish Marine Emergency Service to airlift one of its crew who had suffered a heart attack approximately 40 miles south-west of Valencia Island. The IMES helicopter brought the crewman directly to Cork University Hospital.</P>
    <P>I understand that the case against the vessel for the fishery offences was heard by the District Court earlier today and that a fine was imposed. However, I have been informed that the vessel has been further detained under a High Court order obtained by the owner of the <i>Oileánn Cléire</i> and that the gardaí are examining statements taken from some of the crew of the <i>Oileánn Cléire</i> in the matter with a view to ascertaining whether a possible further offence has been committed. It will then be a matter for the Garda to submit a file to the Director of Public Prosecutions for a decision on whether a further prosecution will be brought.</P>
    <P>In addition, the question of the powers of intervention available to the Irish authorities in respect of incidents occurring outside Irish territorial waters is being examined by the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources, in conjunction with the Attorney General's office. The need for legislation is being considered in that context and the Deputy can be assured that if legislation is needed, it will be dealt with as a priority.</P>
    <P>I have appointed a surveyor from the marine survey office of my Department to carry out a full investigation into the causes of this collision and I have secured an undertaking from the French Ambassador that the French authorities will fully co-operate with this investigation. I am informed <Col N="1347" /> that the investigator has already interviewed the crew of both vessels and has inspected the French vessel as part of his investigation. I have asked that a report of this investigation be made available to me at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>
    <P>Since I became Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, I have become aware of the recurring problems between fishermen in the fishing grounds off the Irish coast and I quickly set about tackling and solving these problems and their causes. As a result, the headings of a code of practice for peaceful co-existence and co-operation between Irish and French fishermen in shared fisheries was agreed at a meeting in Dublin on 9 October last.</P>

      <P>The meeting, which was hosted by my Department, was attended by representatives of the Irish and French fishermen as well as the French Fisheries Ministry. This was a continuation of an initiative taken earlier in 1998 at my request to promote dialogue and mutual understanding between Irish and French fishermen. Representatives of Irish and French fishermen have been working together in the meantime to develop the operational and technical details of the code of practice. The difficulties in agreeing the code of practice are more on the French side than on the Irish side. Once the technical details are agreed, it will be put into operation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, Sir, and your staff for allowing me the opportunity to raise this issue. This case concerns a constituent who applied for one-parent family payment in autumn 1998. As is usual in such cases, the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs advised her to take steps to obtain maintenance from her husband. Later in the year she took the case to the District Court which found in favour of the husband on the basis that he had insufficient resources to meet the demands. The lady and her <Col N="1348" /> children continue to survive on supplementary welfare.</P>
      <P>I intervened in the case some months ago and was of the opinion that the payment would be made. Payment has not been made. At this moment the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs want the unfortunate lady to go back to the District Court because it has discovered the husband may have got a job in the meantime. I am not sure about that. I have no evidence to support that theory. However, I am alarmed that the procedures in the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs should be operated in this fashion. The law as passed several years ago is to the effect that in such cases the lady takes reasonable steps to obtain maintenance from her husband. The law also understands that a person in that situation is very vulnerable and does not have the resources to chase indefinitely a partner to ensure she gets her entitlements. The law never intended that the family would be disadvantaged in the way this family has been disadvantaged.</P>
      <P>This lady has been on supplementary welfare for the past six months and has taken her case to the District Court. By virtue of the intransigence of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs she has failed to receive any payment. I do not know what exactly is happening, although I have a fairly good idea. I ask the Minister of State to take it upon himself to ensure an investigation is carried out as to why this person is being treated in this fashion. The person in these circumstances is dependent on whether a payment is made, whether the husband pays maintenance and, to a certain extent, on charity. That should not be. The law is there to protect people.</P>
      <P>I hope I do not anticipate the reply. If it is the reply with which we are familiar, I hope the Minister of State opposite will have the gumption to telephone the Department and say this is not acceptable, this is not the way the system is supposed to operate and that he wants something done about it.</P>
      <P>Some of us on this side have been in that situation, carrying someone else's portfolio, and had to telephone the relevant Department and say &ldquo;you stood me up with something last evening, I am not happy about it, I need you to investigate it&rdquo;. I give notice that I will raise this matter again in the House and at every opportunity. No applicant for a social welfare payment should be treated in this fashion. It is cynical. At a time when we are supposed to be part and parcel of the Celtic tiger, it is sad we should descend to this level to punish an individual for something over which she has no control.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Durkan for raising this issue. The determination of entitlement under the statutory one-parent family payment <Col N="1349" /> scheme &ndash; or for that matter entitlement under any other statutory social welfare scheme &ndash; is not a function of the Minister. Under the relevant legislation, these are matters for deciding officers and, in the event of an appeal, for appeals officers appointed in accordance with the provisions of the Social Welfare Acts.</P>
      <P>There is an obligation on all claimants for one-parent family payment to make, and continue to make, appropriate efforts in the particular circumstances to obtain maintenance in respect of themselves and/or their children from their former spouse or partner. This well established obligation reflects the general policy of the scheme that, in so far as possible, one-parent families should be maintained by their former spouses or partners rather than have to rely on social welfare support. In determining entitlement, the deciding officer or appeals officer, as the case may be, must be satisfied that all the conditions are satisfied &ndash; including the requirement to make efforts to seek maintenance.</P>
      <P>The position in the case in question is that the person concerned made an application for one-parent family payment on 5 October 1988. She was interviewed by a local officer of the Department on 23 October 1998 and was then informed of her obligations to seek maintenance from her spouse. Efforts were also made by the Department to interview her spouse but he failed to make himself available for interview.</P>
      <P>While these inquiries were under way, the person concerned applied to the courts for a maintenance order. The result of this application, which was heard on 10 November 1998, was not reported by her to the Department until much later, even though the Department had been in correspondence with her on matters relating to the separation in the meantime.</P>
      <P>Information that her maintenance order application had been refused, as her spouse was not in employment then and therefore not in a position to make maintenance payments, was not received by the Department until the end of March 1999. This information was sent to the Department by the Deputy on her behalf following his representations in the case.</P>
      <P>By then the Department had been aware that the spouse of the person concerned had resumed employment in January 1999. For this reason she was asked by the Department in April to make renewed efforts to obtain maintenance from her spouse as there was a reasonable prospect that he would be able to maintain her and her child. When she did not respond to this request, her application was refused on 29 April 1999. She was informed of this decision and of her right to appeal to the independent social welfare appeals office. The person concerned is in receipt of supplementary welfare allowance at the rate of £94.80 per week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1350" /> It would be in the best interests of the person concerned to again apply for a court maintenance order against her spouse as soon as possible. In the event that she does so, she should notify the Department of the outcome of her maintenance application. On receipt of this information, her entitlement to one-parent family payment will be reviewed and she will be notified of the result as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I know the Deputy has experience of this side of the House.</P>

      <P>I thank you, Sir, for allowing me to raise this important issue. Loreto College, Mullingar, is an all girls' voluntary secondary school, situated in Mullingar town and has a current enrolment of 824 pupils. This school, originally established as a girls' boarding school by the Loreto sisters, has evolved into a very large and progressive girls' day school. Thousands of women from Mullingar and its hinterland can attribute their development and achievements to the excellence of this school, the quality of teaching and the dedication of the Loreto sisters.</P>
      <P>The original school is dwarfed by numerous extensions. The dedication and excellence of the principal and staff in providing the best possible education for their students is overshadowed by the failure of the Department of Education and Science to provide funding for the necessary improvements needed at the school.</P>
      <P>This school is renowned for its excellence in the faculty of music. The playing fields of Ireland have played host to many champion Mullingar teams. Hockey, basketball, camogie, volleyball, tennis, swimming and Gaelic football are played in the school. The school's equestrian team has not only been national champions but has competed and won at international events.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This girls' school has answered the numerous call to ensure girls had the opportunity and the desire to study science subjects. Some 87 per cent of students at the school take science subjects but with a decided impediment to progress. Approval has been sought and obtained for the provision of two new science laboratories and the refurbishment of the existing two laboratories. The provision of an additional classroom and refurbishment of five other rooms has also been approved. A sports hall, changing facilities, showers and toilets, a new school entrance and the provision of lift facilities to accommodate students with disabilities have also been approved by the Department of Education and Science. However, this approval has not been matched with financial approval. It is relatively easy and cost-free for the Department to approve school projects but without the finance being made available, such paper approvals mean nothing. It is wrong for the Department to leave schools for <Col N="1351" /> protracted periods with all the paperwork complete but no commitment to an allocation of funds.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister of State to bring to the attention of the Minister the need to proceed to tender stage with this badly needed project. If approval for the complete project is not forthcoming during this year, at least approval for a phased development at this school must be made immediately. Taxpayers money expended at this school will be money well spent. The school has been starved of capital investment by the Department in recent years and it is now incumbent on the Minister of State to bring this to the attention of the Minister to ensure this omission is rectified immediately.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy McGrath for raising this matter because it gives me an opportunity to outline to the House the current position regarding the refurbishment project at the Loreto College, Mullingar. First, I wish to give some details of the background to the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The school authority originally applied for grant aid for the refurbishment of the science facilities at Loreto College in March 1996. In July 1996, a form ST1, which is the Department of Education and Science's official application form, was forwarded to the school's managerial authorities for completion. It was returned in August of that year and was considered by officials in the Department's planning and building unit . They advised that the short to medium term projected enrolments were 775 pupils with a long-term projection of 750 pupils. Based on these figures, the <Col N="1352" /> school was asked to complete an educational worksheet, which is a form used to determine the educational requirements of the school. This form was returned to the Department in December 1996.</P>
    <P>Thereafter, officials of the Department entered into consultations with the school's managerial authorities concerning the precise level of accommodation required at the school. These consultations ended in May 1998 when it was decided that in addition to the school being provided with two new science laboratories, preparation area and physical education ancillary, the school would also be provided with a new physical education hall.</P>
    <P>In April 1998, the Department approved the design team chosen by the school and advised that the design team be instructed to prepare a stage one submission &ndash; site suitability, briefing and site report stage of the Department's design team procedures. In January 1999, a stage one submission was duly received. In the evaluation of this submission and in the light of some additional information provided by the school's managerial authorities, it has been decided that it is necessary for members of the professional/technical staff to visit the site in the near future.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may be assured that it is the Minister for Education and Science's intention that this project will proceed through the remaining stages of architectural planning as quickly as possible. When architectural planning has been completed, the question of proceeding to construction will be considered in the light of available resources and competing priorities.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.05 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 19 May 1999.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 34 and 45 together.</P>
      <P>I am very happy with the progress being made by schools in relation to the implementation of relationships and sexuality education. I believe, however, that we need to continue our efforts to ensure that all children have access to an RSE programme which enables them learn about their own development and about their friendships and relationships with others.</P>
      <P>I attach such importance to RSE that I asked late last year that information be collected on the level of implementation of RSE in schools. To this end the final figures of a national survey on the implementation of relationships and sexuality education are now available. The figures are based on a 66 per cent response rate in respect of primary schools and a 64 per cent response rate at post-primary level. These indicate that 24 per cent of respondent primary schools are already implementing an RSE programme and 57 per cent intend to teach RSE in some or all classes during the current school year. Sixty seven per cent of respondent post-primary schools are implementing RSE in some or all classes and 78 per cent intend to teach RSE in some or all classes during the current school year.</P>
      <P>It must be borne in mind that the first step for schools in introducing RSE is to develop a school policy, which involves school management, parents and teachers in a collaborative process. Information seminars have been held for parents at school level and for boards of management/management authorities. Policy development seminars and whole school staff seminars have also been held. In this regard 67 per cent of primary schools and 68 per cent of post-primary schools have established RSE policy committees. The implementation of an RSE programme in schools follows from this process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The process of policy formulation through partnership is a relatively new experience for many school communities. Many schools have found this process to be a valuable and rewarding experience in so far as it gave them an opportunity to discuss a vision for their children's edu<Col N="1354" /> cation, enunciate a school ethos and debate the issues involved.</P>
    <P>I recognise that schools are at different stages in implementing a programme. The information on progress collected from the survey will enable effective targeting of supports. In this regard the RSE training support service, with whom I myself meet regularly, continues to monitor the implementation of RSE in schools and acts as a support to schools in this work.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that many students are rationed in the number of psychological assessments which they can have carried out; and if he will make funds available to permit these assessments to be obtained privately if the public service cannot cope.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department provides a psychological service at present to all second level schools and to approximately 725 primary schools. Each psychologist is assigned a number of schools and endeavours to divide available time equitably between them. In the primary sector, particularly, psychologists indicate to school principals the likely number of visits to the school that may be undertaken during the current school year. It can happen, therefore, in some schools, that the number of children being presented for assessment may be too great to be dealt with during the allocated time.</P>
      <P>However, an important part of the psychologists work is to assist principals and teachers to develop procedures for screening, identifying and prioritising those students who are most in need of help. In this way, the psychologist is able to estimate the numbers of students in each school who may need psychological intervention. This may lead to adjustments in the amount of time that is allocated to each.</P>
      <P>It should also be noted that the assessment of children is only one part of the psychologist's work. Some schools may consider that other needs are more urgent and may prefer to use the psychologist's time in a different way for example, by their assistance in the development of remedial programmes, or anti-bullying programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation in relation to psychological assessments is kept under review by the management of the psychological service so that appropriate action may be taken if there is a serious difficulty about meeting the needs. A review of demand this year led to the conclusion that there would not be sufficient time available before the summer break to assess certain students whose needs were urgent. My Department therefore has invited tenders from qualified psychologists to carry out a number of psychological assessments. A number of contract psychologists have begun <Col N="1355" /> carrying out assessments in all areas of the country. It is expected that nearly 200 additional psychological assessments of students already referred to the psychological service will have been completed by the end of June.</P>
    <P>My Department will continue to monitor demand for and the availability of psychologists to carry out assessments. I do not consider it appropriate at this time to make additional funds available for assessment. However the Government has decided to make a major commitment to the development of psychological services for Irish schools. One of my key priorities as Minister has been the establishment of a national educational psychological service agency, to be available to all schools at both levels. On Thursday, 11 February, I announced Government approval for the establishment of the agency within my Department. It will be solely dedicated to providing an accessible and readily available psychological service to schools at both levels. Financial provision has now been made for the first two years of a five-year implementation phase. At the end of the five-year period, it is envisaged that every school in the country will have access to a school's psychological service.</P>
    <P>The Civil Service Commission has begun the process of recruiting 25 additional psychologists, who should take up their appointments in the agency during the school year 1999-2000. It is intended that further recruitment will take place in the year 2000. These new appointments will make a significant improvement in the availability of psychological support to schoolchildren.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The key pilot programmes currently in place include the early start pre-school pilot programme; the support teacher pilot programme; the breaking the cycle of disadvantage pilot pro<Col N="1356" /> gramme; and the 8-15 year old early school leavers pilot programme.</P>
    <P>My Department is currently engaged in the preparation of a white paper on early childhood education which will set out my proposals for future development of services in this area. The future operation of the early start pre-school programme will be considered in this context.</P>
    <P>The support teacher pilot programme, which was formerly known as the teacher counsellor programme, was introduced in 1995. This programme is being monitored by my Department on an ongoing basis. I am currently considering an interim evaluation report on the operation of this project.</P>
    <P>The breaking the cycle pilot project was introduced in the autumn of 1996 and is scheduled to operate in the participating schools over a planned five year period. The operation of the scheme is being closely monitored by my Department. The scheme is being evaluated by the education research centre. The future of the scheme as a model for addressing educational disadvantage in urban and rural settings will be considered in the light of the findings in the evaluation report which is due in the year 2001.</P>
    <P>The eight-15 year old early school leavers initiative was introduced in September 1998. The current pilot phase of this initiative is testing models of response to the problems of early school leaving. The question of mainstreaming the initiative will be considered in the light of experience gained with the models now being tested under the pilot phase.</P>
    <P>In the area of adult education a number of new initiatives have been introduced recently to test models of good practice in the delivery of further education services to address educational disadvantage. These include: child care provision of £2.7 million in 1998 and 1999 to support access of early schools and adults to VTOS, youthreach and traveller training centre programmes; a new guidance, counselling and psychological service for youthreach and traveller early school leavers; a sum of £600,000 in 1998 and 1999 for a women's education initiative aimed at addressing gaps in provision of adult education for educationally disadvantaged women; additional funds of £2 million in 1998 and a further £3.2 million in 1999 and 2000 towards the development for a national adult literacy development fund.</P>
    <P>It is intended that the lessons learned from these projects will be examined with a view to mainstreaming in the context of ongoing developments in adult education generally arising from the consultation process currently under way in relation to the Green Paper: Adult Education in an Era of Lifelong Learning.</P>
    <P>I recently announced a £57 million package of initiatives to address the problem of educational disadvantage across all levels of the education system. This package represents the largest programme of its type ever undertaken. It complements the measures already in place to combat <Col N="1357" /> educational disadvantage and will make a major contribution to our efforts in this area.</P>

      <P>I recently announced a major new initiative in the special education area under which all children in the primary system who have been assessed as having special educational needs arising from a disability will be entitled to an automatic response to those needs.</P>
      <P>The level and nature of the response in each case will depend on the assessed needs of the child or group of children involved. The response may take the form of full-time or part-time resource teacher support or child care support, or both, depending on the children involved and the nature of their needs.</P>
      <P>Following my announcement my Department engaged in consultations with the education partners with a view to preparing a circular for issue to primary schools setting out the entitlement to automatic response for special needs pupils and outlining how applications can be made. This work has now been completed and the circular will issue to schools within days.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that the necessary resources to support this important new initiative are being made available and indeed are already being deployed. For example, since my announcement of the new initiative on special needs, an additional 46 full-time and 26 part-time resource teachers have been allocated. Also, over the same period, an additional 247 special needs assistants have been allocated to cater for children with special needs.</P>
      <P>I am also pleased to inform the Deputy of my decision to reduce the pupil teacher ratios in all special schools and special classes catering for children with mild learning disabilities; children with moderate learning disabilities; children with emotional disturbance; and children with physical handicap.</P>
      <P>These reductions will bring the pupil teacher ratios in all special schools and special classes down to the level recommended by the special education review committee and represent the full implementation of one of the key recommendations of that committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, I have allocated £3.4 million over the next two years to facilitate the introduction of escorts on all special school transport services and the provision of safety harnesses on such ser<Col N="1358" /> vices where required. This measure will come into effect from September next. I have also allocated an additional £800,000 over the next two years for the purchase of special equipment for children with disabilities.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the measures which I have outlined and the resources which have already been deployed to support these measures, provide concrete evidence of the commitment of this Government to ensuring that all children with special needs receive the support they require to enable them to gain maximum benefit from the education system.</P>
    <P>The approach which we have adopted on funding is that the teaching and childcare resources will be provided on the basis of professional assessment and not constrained by allocations.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Education and Science, it is my intention to continue to build on the very significant progress which has already been achieved in this area.</P>

      <P>My Department has been made aware by teachers and schools of concerns about the gradual accumulation, over a period of years, of unwanted chemicals which are no longer required for school work, and also of chemicals in containers on which the labels are no longer present, and which cannot be identified. Responsibility for the management of their own chemical stocks and for ensuring the safety of students, staff and property rests with individual schools. My Department is co-operating with school management authorities in planning, developing and implementing a strategy to assist individual schools and teachers in dealing with the issue.</P>
      <P>In October, 1996, my Department published a manual Safety in School Science: A Code of Practice and issued it to all schools. It contains general guidelines for best practice in school science, including a section on laboratory organisation and management which deals with matters such as storage, stock control and waste disposal.</P>
      <P>At the same time, my Department published a manual which it commissioned from Forbairt titled Safety in the School Laboratory: Disposal of Chemicals. This was also issued to all schools. This manual gives clear guidelines on the disposal of individual chemicals which are commonly found in school science laboratories. The manual explains how most of these chemicals may be safely disposed of in schools in accordance with the instructions given. My Department also contracted Forbairt to operate a helpline to further assist schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A questionnaire was issued to all second level schools asking them to identify and report on the <Col N="1359" /> amount of certain chemicals which are no longer required for school purposes and which could not be disposed of by the school in accordance with the guidelines given. The completed returns were collated and analysed by the curriculum development unit of City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee. A Report by CDU of this analysis was issued to all schools in February 1998.  </P>
    <P>Having regard to the results of the survey my Department, in conjunction with CDU and the Health and Safety Authority, arranged for a training programme to further assist and advise all second level schools on disposal and storage issues. The programme was conducted in April and June 1998 for Science teachers from all second level schools. It is considered that this training programme will have enabled schools to further review their chemical stocks, to arrange safe storage of chemicals which will be required for future use, and to arrange for the disposal of unwanted chemicals which can be safely disposed in accordance with the guidelines already given. The curriculum development unit will update its data base of unwanted chemicals held by schools in the context of this further work.</P>
    <P>My Department has now established a pilot project in conjunction with the school management authorities and the Health and Safety Authority on the collection of unwanted chemicals which cannot be disposed of by schools themselves. A working group, including representatives of my Department, the Health and Safety Authority and the school authorities, has been established to oversee this pilot project. This pilot project is being carried out in a number of community and comprehensive schools in the Dublin area. A request for tenders has issued to chemical disposal contractors and these proposals are currently being assessed.</P>
    <P>Further elements of this strategy to assist schools in dealing with the issue will be developed based on the results of the pilot project and the development of the CDU data base.</P>

      <P>The junior certificate school programme is an intervention within the junior certificate. It provides a curriculum framework which assists schools and individual teachers in adopting a student-centred approach to the junior certificate specifically aimed at a small but important minority of students whose particular needs are not adequately catered for in the present broadly based junior certificate programme. It provides an opportunity for each of those students to obtain a junior certificate recording his/her level of attainment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1360" /> The junior certificate school programme was introduced in the school year 1996-97 in 44 centres. It was expanded in 1997-98 to 60 centres. It is being offered at present in 85 centres. A special support unit was established to provide information on the programme and to assist schools with the implementation of the programme. The support service is located in the curriculum development unit of the City of Dublin VEC.</P>
    <P>The first cohort of students will have completed the programme this summer. The NCCA junior cycle review report of March 1999 recommended that the NCCA undertake an evaluation of the junior certificate school programme with a view to it being made more widely available. This issue is currently being examined in my Department and I expect to have considered and detailed recommendations shortly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>While there is reason to be broadly satisfied with the overall numbers who continue to study a continental language in Irish post-primary schools up to leaving certificate level, I am endeavouring in a number of ways to improve the language capacity and diversity of our second-level pupils.</P>
      <P>At present, about two thirds of the leaving certificate cohort in any given year takes a continental language. Taking the 1996 junior certificate cohort as a point of reference, the retention-rates to leaving certificate level are c. 78 per cent in French, 65 per cent in German, 73 per cent in Spanish and 56 per cent in Italian. At present, a feasibility study is being carried out at my request to help the Department to explore ways of increasing the uptake of Spanish and Italian and to look at the possibility of introducing other languages. Four people have been appointed to carry out this study. They are currently analysing the results of a questionnaire which has been circulated to all second-level schools to ascertain the current position regarding the teaching of these languages and to discover if there is some latent capacity in the system for the teaching of the languages. A report will be presented to me in the summer of this year and I will then consider the possible ways of extending the uptake of these languages even further.</P>
      <P>The numbers taking languages in the leaving certificate applied are increasing each year. This is a particularly welcome development. The language modules designed for the leaving certificate applied are geared to the needs of the workplace and will increase the prospects for employment of the students who opt for this programme. It should also be noted that students taking the leaving certificate vocational programme are obliged to study a modern continental language.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The modern languages (primary) project includes 267 schools at present. In this project, an effort has been made to encourage the uptake of Spanish and Italian. French is currently taught in 120 of the project schools, German in 80, Spanish in 50 and Italian in 17. My Department has recently invited further applications from primary <Col N="1362" /> schools, especially those wishing to offer Spanish or Italian. It is hoped that this project will influence the uptake of the lesser-taught languages at post-primary level when these pupils move on. I am encouraged by the enthusiastic reports I have had from this project to date.</P>

      <P>My Department currently collects statistical data on the number of children with special needs who are enrolled in special schools and in special classes attached to mainstream primary schools. The data relate to the position as of the 30 September in each school year.</P>
      <P>The information collected includes details of pupil numbers; their category of special need; their age profile; and the number of classes and teachers involved. Details are also sought of new entrants to and departures from special schools and special classes and the origin and destination of such pupils.</P>
      <P>The lack of adequate statistical data relating to special needs children within the education system, particularly integrated special needs children, is an issue with which I have been concerned for some time. I have, therefore, established a special steering group to develop mechanisms to address this deficit as part of an overall review of provision in the special needs area. In addressing this issue, the group will have regard to the findings of a recent survey of special needs within the second level system.</P>
      <P>I recently announced a major development in special education services under which all special needs children in the primary system are now entitled to an automatic response to those needs. The response in question may take the form of additional teacher or child care support, or both, depending on the needs of the particular child.</P>
      <P>My Department is currently finalising a series of circulars and information notes to advise schools on the procedures to be followed, including the supporting data required, in seeking support for special needs children.

      <P>Part-time courses are an essential part of our third level system, offering educational opportunities for those students who are unable to pursue full-time study for a variety of reasons and offer routes for those who wish to update their skills and qualifications. Our third level institutions offer a wild range of part-time options and there were almost 23,000 part-time students enrolled in 1996-97, which is the last year for which complete statistics are available. The numbers of part-time students has remained relatively constant, at around 22,000 to 23,000 over the past few years. While, I concur with the view of the steering committee on the future development of higher education that facilitating students in attending part-time is both highly desirable and cost effective and would encourage third level colleges in this regard, I have no plans to require third level colleges to take any specific steps. Indeed, I believe that the colleges are providing more flexible course options with the increased use of modular courses and distance education options. I would expect that these developments will continue and become more widespread, particularly in the context of the strength of the Irish labour market.</P>

      <P>The decision in relation to the curriculum to be provided in an individual second level school is a matter in the first instance for the authorities of the school concerned. Where a fillable vacancy arises, it is a matter for the managerial authority to determine the subject area in which they wish to make the appointment. In this regard, the school authorities must take cognisance of the existing and future curriculum requirements of the school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the policy of my Department that, as far as is practicable, teachers in second level schools should be qualified in the subjects which they are teaching. My Department proposes to issue to all second level schools in the near future details of the approved qualifications in art together with details of the colleges at which the courses leading to the award of these qualifications can be <Col N="1364" /> pursued. This will enable the managerial authorities to determine if applicants for the post of teacher of art are qualified for permanent appointment.</P>
    <P>My Department has received representations on behalf of teachers of art who currently are not deemed fully qualified. I am pleased to advise the Deputy that, arising from these representations, a questionnaire was forwarded to vocational education committees recently requesting details of the qualifications and the status of unqualified teachers of art, if any, employed by them. The details, when submitted to my Department by the vocational education committees, will be examined to determine whether it is possible to address the shortfalls in the qualifications of any unqualified teachers employed so as to enable them to become qualified to compete for permanent whole-time posts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 49 and 60 together.</P>
      <P>To qualify for assistance under the third level student support schemes, a student must generally be pursuing a full-time undergraduate course of at least two years' duration or a postgraduate course of at least one year's duration. Similarly, under the free fees initiative, tuition fees are payable in respect of eligible students who are attending full-time undergraduate courses, other than European Social Fund aided courses, which must generally be of at least two years' duration, at approved third level institutions.</P>
      <P>Being a one year course, this course is not covered by the arrangements which have been in existence for many years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that even if this course were to be approved for the purposes of the third level <Col N="1366" /> student support schemes and the free fees initiative, the majority of students participating on the course would be ineligible for assistance as they are required to hold an NCEA recognised diploma or a higher level qualification in any discipline. Under the terms of the third level student support schemes, candidates who have previously pursued an undergraduate course approved for the purposes of the schemes are not eligible for grant assistance until they have completed an equivalent period of study at undergraduate level, irrespective of whether or not a grant was paid previously. These provisions are designed to avoid the payment of grants to students who repeat year levels on different courses. In this regard, there is provision within the schemes for students who hold a national certificate or diploma to progress to degree level courses. Second chance students, who having attended but not successfully completed approved courses and who are returning to pursue approved courses at the same level following a break of at least five years, are also eligible.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would mention to the Deputies that, as an exceptional matter in the 1997-98 year, grant aid was provided to and fees paid on behalf of students attending this course as the students concerned had been advised by the college authorities that the course was eligible for assistance. My Department notified the college authorities and the vocational education committees that the exceptional arrangement applied only to students pursuing the course in the 1997-98 academic year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The standard annual capitation grant payable to primary schools is £60 per pupil. This payment is made in respect of all children enrolled in ordinary classes in a school and would include any special needs children who are enrolled on a fully integrated basis.</P>
      <P>Special enhanced capitation rates are paid in respect of children with special needs who attend special schools or special classes dedicated to children with particular special needs. These special rates can range from £263 to £436 per pupil depending on the particular level of need involved. Children attending special schools or special classes attached to ordinary schools would generally have a level of special need which renders them unable to attend ordinary national schools on a fully integrated basis.</P>
      <P>The difference in the level of capitation funding attracted by pupils attending special schools or special classes and those attending ordinary classes on a fully integrated basis arises from the reduced number of pupils involved in each special classroom situation.</P>
      <P>The number of children per classroom in special schools and special classes will be significantly lower than the number in an ordinary national school classroom. However, the general operating costs arising in both situations, in terms of light, heating etc., will not be reduced because of the lesser number of pupils in attendance.</P>
      <P>As a consequence, the level of funding attracted by each child attending a special class needs to be correspondingly greater than the norm in order to meet the standard operating costs which will continue to be incurred.</P>
      <P>For example, a special class for children with a mild general learning disability will cater for a maximum of 13 children. Such a classroom would give rise to the same ongoing operating costs as an ordinary classroom in a national school that would cater for a significantly higher number of pupils. It is necessary, therefore, that the special class children attract a correspondingly higher rate of capitation funding in order to meet the costs involved.</P>
      <P>It is important to distinguish between arrangements relating to the funding of schools' ongoing operating costs and funding requirements which might arise where, for example, a child with a disability requires a special piece of equipment. Special separate funding arrangements are in place to deal with special equipment needs and any school can make application to my Department for funding towards the purchase of such equipment.</P>
      <P>I can also assure the Deputy that my Department will consider applications from mainstream national schools for the provision of specialised equipment for pupils with special needs who have been fully integrated into the mainstream system.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 54 and 96 together.</P>
      <P>The objective in making special arrangements at the certificate examinations for students, who have specific learning difficulties including dyslexia, is to ensure as far as possible that such candidates are enabled to demonstrate at the examination their level of ability. The range of special arrangements in place includes use of readers, scribes, tape recorders and the use of computer technology in certain cases. Each case is considered on an individual basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the marking process I am sure the Deputy will agree that, in the interests of equity and fairness across the entire body of candidates and indeed to ensure the credibility of the examination system, the work of students must ultimately be assessed according to the same strictly objective criteria. This is achieved by having a common marking scheme applied to the work of all candidates in a subject and at the <Col N="1369" /> same time by ensuring that every effort is made to give full credit in accordance with that marking scheme for that work.</P>
    <P>I have initiated a comprehensive public review of the special arrangement scheme based on a discussion paper prepared by the expert advisory group on examinations. It will be open to all interested parties to make submissions to the expert group on the nature and extent of arrangements that might be made for students with specific learning difficulties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department's records confirm that two officials of my Department attended a meeting with the director of the Finglas children's centre at the centre on 21 March 1988.</P>
      <P>The centre, which is owned by the State, was operated by the De La Salle order from the time of its commencement in 1972 until 1994 when the order relinquished all involvement with the centre. The post of director of the centre was held by a member of the De La Salle order throughout this period. The centre is comprised of St. Michael's remand and assessment centre and St. Laurence's industrial school.</P>
      <P>The Department's records indicate that the meeting in question had been convened at the request of the Department to pursue complaints made to the Department by a then serving member of staff of the centre. The complaints related chiefly to matters of financial management and control aspects of the centre's operations.</P>
      <P>However, the records also indicate that one of the issues complained of by the staff member was that there had been rumours circulating in the centre about boys being interfered with sexually. It was complained that this matter had been reported to the then director and had not been investigated.</P>
      <P>The Department's record indicates that the Department officials advised the director that all such complaints should be brought to the Department's attention immediately and should be investigated thoroughly. The director was also informed by my Department's officials that fear of scandal should not inhibit proper investigation of such allegations and, that neither fear of embarrassment to the administration nor compassion for the perpetrators should inhibit prosecution, where there was evidence to warrant this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsequent to the meeting in question, my Department wrote in August 1988 to the director <Col N="1370" /> of the centre seeking a full response to the matters which had been discussed at the meeting. The director responded to the Department by letter in December 1988 stating that the allegations relating to sexual abuse were unfounded. There is no record of any further action at that time. In 1994, following fresh allegations of abuse at the centre, a Garda investigation was carried out. No prosecution was brought as a result of that investigation.</P>
    <P>More recently, arising from further allegations of ill-treatment and abuse at the centre, the gardaí in conjunction with the Eastern Health Board, my Department and the present management of the Finglas centre, have been engaged in a look-back investigation into all reports of abuse which have come to light in relation to the centre. My Department and the present management of the centre have provided every possible assistance to this investigation and have made available all relevant Departmental records, including records relating to the meeting to which the Deputy refers.</P>
    <P>Arising from this investigation, the Garda has recently sent files to the Director of Public Prosecutions in relation to allegations of abuse at the centre.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 56, 69 and 90 together.</P>
      <P>The reasons for drop out are complex, and there is no one simple initiative that will address the issue. Factors such as motivation, capabilities and suitability are all involved. There must also, of course, be a balance between completion rates on programmes and maintaining the necessary, objective standards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the university sector, the higher education authority carried out a study in 1994, which indicated a completion rate of 81 per cent, which is high by international standards, for those entering in 1989-90. The authority has commissioned the educational research centre, St. <Col N="1371" /> Patrick's College, Drumcondra to undertake a further detailed study in this area and a report should be available by the end of 1999.</P>
    <P>A number of initiatives have been taken in the technological sector to assist the compilation of a data base on attrition-drop out rates and to develop appropriate strategies to address the issues. The council of directors of the institutes of technology has established a national committee on retention with representatives from each institute to focus on maximising success rates for institutes' students. The committee is currently assembling a profile of current good practice in relation to retention across the sector. The profile will be made available to all institutes of technology.</P>
    <P>Institutes of technology have introduced a range of initiatives and support services seeking to improve completion rates. These include induction-orientation programmes, course information services, tutor services and systems designed for the early identification of &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; first year students.</P>
    <P>At the request of my Department, the council of directors has commissioned the educational research centre, Drumcondra, to undertake a comprehensive study on the issue of non-completion in the institutes, which will consist of a quantitative analysis to track a cohort of students over a four year period; and a qualitative study of students who leave without graduating.</P>
    <P>The research project team has visited each of the institutes of technology and is developing a standard format to which institutes of technology can respond to the variables that influence progression-retention for each course.</P>
    <P>As part of a two year funding initiative to tackle educational disadvantaged at third level, I have announced that I am providing £1.5 million over the period 1999-2000 to address the issue of non-completion of courses in the technological sector. This funding will support and complement the programmes already in place and will have regard to the recommendations being prepared by the committee in relation to the funding of action projects-programmes both short and long term, based on best practice. I am also actively addressing the provision of science and technology in second level schools, a provision of particular importance in preparing persons for successful participation in technical courses at third level.</P>
    <P>A computerised management information systems project is currently in progress as part of the ongoing work to establish modern financial and administrative systems for the institutes of technology. The project has the aim of supporting the efficient and effective administration of the institutions and providing both the institutions and my Department with timely and accurate management information for a variety of purposes. This new system will provide enhanced information on attrition and the results from the initiatives above will be fed into this project.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 57 and 58 together.</P>
      <P>As Deputies will be aware, the operation of the Youth Work Act, 1997 was predicated largely upon the establishment of the regional education boards. It was subsequently decided that the education boards were not going to be established and that the most appropriate local structures through which to support the provision of youth work services were the vocational education committees. The need to make this fundamental change provided the opportunity for a broad re-assessment of the existing Act.</P>
      <P>As part of this re-assessment, detailed consultations with all interested parties took place. Following that process, the draft general scheme of the Bill, together with a draft memorandum for Government, was circulated to all Government Departments last year. In line with normal practice in the preparation of legislation, a further consultative process, on the basis of the observations submitted by the various Departments, was undertaken. The draft heads of the Bill are now with the parliamentary draftsman's office.</P>
      <P>It is anticipated that, having regard to the Government's legislative priorities and programme, publication is not expected before late 1999.</P>

      <P>Many pupils with disabilities now attend mainstream schools as well as special schools. Provision for pupils with disabilities is now made in special schools, in special classes in mainstream schools and in ordinary classes in mainstream schools with the support of resource teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The pre-service training of teachers equips them to deal with a range of pupil diversity, including learning difficulties arising from disabilities in pupils. Students at the two larger colleges of education follow a module in special education as part of their basic teacher training. The two expert groups which I have appointed on <Col N="1374" /> teachers' pre-service education are reviewing the need for training in this particular area.</P>
    <P>A range of induction courses and summer courses is organised for teachers who are new to working with pupils who have learning difficulties arising from disabilities. All teachers in special schools, in special classes and those who function as resource teachers for pupils with disabilities may apply to do the diploma in special education course run by St. Patrick's college of education.</P>

      <P>The junior certificate school programme is an intervention which operates within the junior certificate and not an alternative to it. It sets out to make the experience of school relevant and accessible to those young people who find it difficult to cope with the school system and would benefit from special support in working to the aims of the junior certificate. All participants follow courses leading to the foundation level examinations at junior certificate in English and mathematics and possibly other subjects.</P>
      <P>The student profiling system which forms part of the junior certificate school programme assists teachers in diagnosing student needs, monitoring and recording student progress and thus provides a basis for focused curriculum planning.</P>
      <P>It enables all participants to be provided with a standardised document &ndash; the student profile &ndash; which gives students credit for what they have learned and achieved, including skills and knowledge which are not currently recognised under the examination system. However it does not constitute part of the formal junior certificate examination assessment. Participating schools have reported that the programme addresses the specific needs of the student cohort for which it was designed and have indicated improved retention rates of the target population.</P>
      <P>Candidates in the leaving certificate applied are graded out of a total of 100 credits. Student achievement and performance are recorded in three modes: satisfactory completion of modules &ndash; 40 credits; performance of student tasks &ndash; 27 credits; performance in a terminal examination &ndash; 33 credits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To be awarded credit for satisfactory completion of modules, students must attend classes and out-of-school activities and complete key assignments related to the modules. No ranking or assessment of performance is involved. A minimum attendance of 90 per cent is expected. A record of evidence of completion of key assignments relating to all modules is maintained by each student. It is a requirement that this be retained in the school and be available for inspec<Col N="1375" /> tion until the end of the appeals period following each session.</P>
    <P>The student tasks and the terminal examination are marked by external examiners under the direction of inspectors.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the principles underpinning the revised primary curriculum is that schools must make provision for individual differences among pupils. These differences could include differences in style and pace of learning, as well as developmental differences and differences in ability, including reading ability. The curriculum documents are written to take account of these differences. Class teaching, group teaching and individual teaching are all advocated. The availability of supplementary teaching from support teachers such as remedial and resource teachers for those who need it is envisaged. Chapters devoted to school planning take particular account of differences in ability. Assessment and evaluation of progress is strongly advocated as an essential link in the cycle of planning, teaching, learning and evaluating. Particular emphasis is placed on diagnostic assessment, whereby the difficulties being experienced by individual pupils can be clearly identified and appropriate measures taken to address them.</P>
      <P>The teacher guidelines will contain a special section dealing with difficulties in language learning. This will advocate early identification of problems, even at the senior infant stage, by means of teacher observation, teacher-designed tasks and tests, portfolios, curriculum profiles and the use of standardised assessment instruments where appropriate. When a child's difficulties have been identified, remedial measures specifically designed to overcome those difficulties are advocated either for the class teacher or remedial teacher or both. Close co-operation between class teacher and remedial teacher is recommended and the importance of parental involvement is emphasised.</P>
      <P>Regarding the age at which reading is introduced in the revised curriculum, the governing principle is that a child is introduced to reading when the child is ready for reading. This can vary quite widely, with minorities at either end of the ability spectrum reaching the stage of readiness at significant intervals apart. For the great majority of children, however, the revised curriculum sets down specific objectives in reading even for the infant classes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Ireland, while six years is the age of the beginning of compulsory schooling, the majority <Col N="1376" /> of children begin school at four years of age and, almost without exception, all children of five years of age attend school. Therefore, the starting age for reading envisaged in the revised curriculum for the majority of children lies between four and five years of age, depending on the child's state of development and readiness. In schools where Irish is the medium of instruction, pre-reading and early reading skills on a par with those outlined for English in the English-medium schools, are introduced to children in infant classes. In schools where English is the medium of instruction, Irish reading will not be introduced until children are in second class.</P>

      <P>The provision of services such as hot water is a matter for the local school authorities in the first instance. In the case of primary schools, the devolved grants scheme for minor works is designed to assist schools financially in undertaking the necessary work involved. The annual allocation is £2,000 per school plus £9 per pupil. Under the terms of Circular 3 of 1996, the boards of management of primary schools have full responsibility for the proper execution of these works. It is also open to individual school management boards to apply to my Department for grant assistance towards capital works not covered by the scheme.</P>

      <P>The science initiative which I announced recently was designed as a response to the continuing decline in the uptake of physics and chemistry at leaving certificate level. While the uptake rates for these subjects have been declining for a number of years the uptake rate for biology has remained relatively constant. In addressing the problem of the declining interest in the physical sciences it was clear that intervention should take place as early as possible in the second-level curriculum. Accordingly, it was decided that a major element of the in-career development component of the initiative should be devoted to teachers of junior certificate science, the majority of whom are, in fact, biology teachers. While the subject content of the courses being provided will concentrate on the physical sciences the courses will also have a strong emphasis on pedagogical issues and, as such, will be of considerable benefit to biology teachers, not only in their teaching of junior certificate science but also of leaving certificate biology.</P>
      <P>A revision of the current leaving certificate biology syllabus is currently being undertaken by a course committee of the NCCA. When the revised syllabus has been ratified and circulated to schools a comprehensive in-career development programme for biology teachers will be implemented. While this programme will give attention to all aspects of the new syllabus it will have a particular emphasis on the new elements of the course and on pedagogical issues of specific relevance to the teaching of biology.</P>

      <P>Out of the 759 post-primary schools in the country, 736 currently offer French, 559 offer German, 220 offer Spanish and 69 offer Italian. The numbers of students who took the languages in the leaving certificate examination, 1998, were: French: 37,081, German: 11,373, Spanish: 1,674 and Italian: 160. The numbers of students who took the languages at junior certificate level in 1998 were: French: 45,811, German: 12,586, Spanish: 1,580 and Italian: 150. One student took Japanese at leaving certificate level in 1998 and five students are taking it in 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a number of schools, pupils are given the option of taking a language they have not studied before as part of their transition year programme. The number of students taking foreign languages in the leaving certificate applied is increasing <Col N="1378" /> each year. Students who take the leaving certificate vocational programme are obliged to study a modern continental language.</P>
    <P>I have initiated a number of plans to extend the teaching of languages in our schools. A feasibility study is currently being undertaken at the request of my Department by Marino Institute of Education to look into possibilities for the extension of the teaching of Spanish and Italian and the introduction of Japanese to the curriculum. Four people are working on this study. They have issued a comprehensive questionnaire to all post-primary schools to ascertain the current level of activity in the teaching of these languages and to discover any latent capacity which may exist in the system to teach these languages. Some 60 per cent of schools have responded to this questionnaire. The group engaged in the study will report to me in summer, 1999, on their findings and will advise my Department on the best approach to introducing/extending the teaching of a language.</P>
    <P>The modern languages (primary) project has been taken up by 267 schools. Of these 120 offer French, 80 German, 50 Spanish and 17 Italian. My Department is in the process of inviting further schools to join the project, especially those which could offer Spanish or Italian. It is hoped that this project will further enhance the teaching of modern languages at post-primary level, especially of the lesser-taught languages.</P>

      <P>The Schools IT 2000 programme has been in place approximately 18 months. My Department, in consultation with the national centre for technology in education, is actively formulating plans to evaluate all aspects of the implementation of Schools IT 2000. This is a timely development given that the national programme has now reached its mid-point.</P>
      <P>The national policy advisory and development committee for Schools IT 2000 is currently developing a research proposal to carry out an autumn 1999 study on the progress of Schools IT 2000 from the perspective of all education partner groups. This study will undoubtedly be very helpful in identifying future policy requirements in many areas including ICT technical support and curriculum development.</P>
      <P>As was the case in summer 1998, my inspectorate will once again carry out a comprehensive nationwide review of ICT inservice courses which will be delivered to teachers in July and August 1999. This review will further inform policy on the application of teacher ICT skills to pedagogical development at the classroom and whole-school level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Arrangements have already been made by the NCTE in consultation with my Department to involve the universities and colleges of education in the evaluation of all 48 projects involving 228 schools under the schools integration programme. Additionally, a SIP academic advisory board has been established recently to advise on the evaluation of these projects and on the design, development and delivery of curriculum based courses for schools. Ten of the SIP projects will focus on technical/internet issues and a number of other pilot projects will be initiated in autumn <Col N="1380" /> 1999 to test various models of ICT technical support for schools.</P>
    <P>It is also planned to carry out a second database survey in spring 1999, in order to ascertain ICT infrastructural levels in first and second level schools. This survey will parallel the first such database survey carried out by Telecom Éireann prior to the establishment of the Schools IT 2000 programme and will therefore provide a clear record of ICT infrastructural and curricular development over time.</P>
    <P>Finally, my Department and the NCTE are formulating plans to commission an expert study in the coming months, to develop guidelines for schools on optimising their ICT infrastructural development plans.</P>

      <P>My Department's involvement in pre-school provision is largely confined to the early start pre-school pilot programme which is focused on areas of particular disadvantage. The 55 pre-school classes which currently operate within this programme cater for up to 15 pupils in the morning class and a further 15 in the afternoon class.</P>
      <P>There is no specific pupil-teacher ratio applicable to infant classes generally in the primary system. The overall pupil teacher ratio in primary schools currently stands at 21.2. This will be further reduced in the next school year arising from the substantial improvements in staffing levels which I recently announced.</P>
      <P>A special reduced pupil-teacher ratio of 15:1 is applicable to the junior classes of schools participating in the urban element of the breaking the cycle pilot scheme. Where necessary, additional staffing resources are made available to the schools in question to enable them to operate within this 15:1 ratio. Schools included in the urban element of the breaking the cycle pilot scheme, in common with all schools which have disadvantaged status, are also entitled to operate a maximum class size of 29:1 for classes generally.</P>

      <P>At primary level my Department provides funding towards the cost of caretaking and secretarial services under two separate schemes. One scheme is the 1978-79 scheme for the employment of caretakers and clerical officers under which my Department meets the full cost of salary and employer's PRSI. However, this scheme is being phased out as posts become vacant.</P>
      <P>The second scheme is the provision by my Department of additional per-capita grants for primary schools as agreed under the Programme for Economic and Social Progress and has been in operation since 1 September 1992. The PESP provided for the introduction of a phased scheme of additional per-capita grants with a view to expanding the provision of caretaking and secretarial services to all primary schools with 100 pupils or more. Currently, all schools of 195 pupils or more &ndash; not including schools in the 1978 scheme outlined above &ndash; qualify for a grant of £30 per pupil, to a maximum of £15,000 per annum, towards the cost of caretaking and secretarial services.</P>

There are also a number of secondary schools in the 1978 scheme for the employment <Col N="1382" /> of clerical officers under which my Department meets the full cost of salary.</P>
    <P>In the case of vocational schools and colleges, caretaking and clerical staff are allocated to vocational education committees on a scheme wide basis.

      <P>As I have indicated to the Deputy in my reply of 20 April reports of the interim review group have been completed and published. The group operated entirely independently of my Department and it would be highly inappropriate for me to seek to interfere by seeking to have final reports withdrawn and changed, especially on the basis of a difference between the reports which has no significance.</P>
      <P>The crucial point is that each institute will have, under the Qualifications (Education and Training) Bill, 1999, delegated authority to make awards in relation to existing and new programmes at the level of certificate and diploma. Additionally, each institute will be free to seek further delegation in respect of degree qualifications.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions No. 78 and 82 together.</P>
      <P>My Department regards all allegations of abuse of children with the utmost seriousness and adopts procedures which have as their primary focus the protection of children.</P>
      <P>Under procedures in operation in my Department at present, any allegation relating to abuse of children by any member of the staff of a school which is made to officers of my Department is reported to the principal and chairperson of the board of management of the school whose response to the allegation is closely monitored. If my Department is not satisfied with the response, the matter is referred to the director of community care of the relevant health board. In the case of allegations made directly to school authorities, present procedures also require all such allegations to be brought immediately to the attention of the principal or the chairperson of the board of management. Thereafter the procedures allow for an element of judgment on the part of the school authorities as to whether or not the allegation is based on reasonable grounds before the matter is referred to the health authorities.</P>
      <P>My Department keeps the procedures relating to allegations of abuse under regular review. A working party, representative of the education partners. is already examining the existing guidelines on abuse in order to make sure that they represent a comprehensive and fully updated response to this issue. Representatives of the health boards have joined the working party. In addition, officials of my Department are participating in the working group established by the Minister for Health and Children to review procedures generally in this area. This working group is expected to report in the near future, following which my Department will adapt and reissue the procedures for schools and Department staff.</P>
      <P>My Department is also involved in the consultation process leading to the publication of the White Paper on mandatory reporting. Until proposals are finalised it is, of course, not possible to say precisely what changes will be required in procedures either at school or Department level, but suffice it to say that my Department will make whatever adaptations are necessary and assist schools in implementing any new procedures.</P>

      <P>The steering committee on the future development of higher education concluded that an upgrading and expansion of the Waterford Regional Technical College &ndash; now Waterford Institute of Technology &ndash; represented the most appropriate response to the higher education needs of the south-east region. The committee considered that it would be appropriate that a major element of the expansion of the institute would be at degree level, while maintaining the thrust of its activities at technician level. It, accordingly, concluded and recommended that provision be made in the medium term for an increase in the total number of places and that the major focus of expansion be at degree level. The committee considered that such provision would place the institute at the top end of the spectrum by comparison with other institutes of technology in terms of provision of degree places and would enable the region to reach the national average participation in degree programmes.</P>
      <P>The Government has significantly increased provision in both the total number of places and in degree level courses in the institute. The Deputy will also be aware that this Government has made unprecedented levels of investment available to develop the institute's facilities.</P>
      <P>These measures, combined with the change of title of the college to institute of technology provide the necessary status and capacity for the institute to meet the identified higher education needs of the region over the coming years.</P>

      <P>In accordance with the Children Act, 1908, responsibility for the inspection of industrial and reformatory schools rests with the Minister for Education and Science and with the chiefinspector of schools. Under their direction, inspection of these residential centres is carried out by a designated inspector of industrial and reformatory schools. At present, there are two industrial schools and three reformatory schools. The inspector, and a child care adviser under his direction, have responsibility for monitoring and for reporting and advising on standards of management and on the protection, care, safety and well-being of the children. Reports and findings are not published by the inspectorate. The Children Bill (1996), which will replace the Children Act (1908), will make provision for the inspection of all aspects of residential care in these centres. Special national schools, attached to these centres, are inspected by the primary inspectorate of my Department.</P>
      <P>Because of these developments, I do not believe it is necessary to establish the inspectorate as an independent agency. The inspectorate functions very well as an essential and integral part of the Department and it is my view that, operating in this way, it can make the most worthwhile and effective contribution to the work of the Department and to the development and evaluation of the education system.</P>

      <P>Second level schools are free to address the issue of road safety as part of the programme in civic, social and political education. This subject is part of the required junior certificate curriculum for second level schools. It is a course in citizenship based on human rights and social responsibilities. The syllabus specifies a number of concepts which must be addressed, but schools have a good deal of flexibility with regard to how this is done. A number of these concepts can accommodate the study of issues relating to road <Col N="1386" /> safety, for example, rights and responsibilities and law.</P>
      <P>In civic, social and political education, emphasis is placed on active learning, methodologies with a view to the development by pupils of knowledge, skills, attitudes and values which will enable them to act responsibility as citizens.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Over the last year and a half a series of moves have been taken by this Government which have reversed years of neglect in the area of special needs provision. We have introduced support schemes based on needs rather than resource constraints and a system of practically enabling assessments is well under way. The statutory entitlement to an assessment is an idea that I am not opposed to but we need to avoid putting the cart before the horse. The crucial thing is to be in a position to provide the assessments and to provide the ensuing supports.</P>
      <P>Where the educational needs of a person with a disability are concerned, assessments can play an important role in identifying needs and contributing to the development of an appropriate response. It is for this reason that the Government has decided to establish the national psychological service agency. Funding for this new service will be provided through the social inclusion package announced by the Minister for Finance in his Budget Statement 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Education Act, 1998, provides the statutory basis for this agency. The agency will have delegated authority to develop and provide an educational psychological service to all students who need such a service in the primary or post primary system and in certain other centres supported by the Department. As part of this development, the recruitment of an additional 25 psychologists is currently under way and it is intended to recruit a further 25 psychologists to the service in the year 2000. The agency will <Col N="1387" /> eventually employ up to 200 psychologists as well as the necessary administrative and support staff. It has been agreed to set a target for the provision of a comprehensive service over a five-year development period. The pace of development will be determined by available resources and in particular the availability of suitably qualified psychologists to undertake the work in question.</P>
    <P>I recently announced a major new development in special education services under which all children with special educational needs within the primary system are now entitled to an automatic response to those needs. The response may take the form of extra teacher or child care support, or both, depending on the needs of the individual child. Already, as a result of this development, my Department has allocated an additional 46 full-time and 26 part-time resource teachers and an additional 247 special needs assistants to children with special needs.</P>
    <P>I am also pleased to inform the Deputy that I have decided to reduce the pupil-teacher ratios in all special schools and special classes catering for children with mild learning disability, children with moderate learning disability, children with emotional disturbance, and children with physical disability. These reductions will bring the pupil-teacher ratios in all special schools and special classes down to the level recommended by the special education review committee.</P>
    <P>Combined, these measures are delivering long-awaited improvements. They are a practical demonstration of our commitment to provide both assessment and support for children with special needs and they represent a dramatic move away from an approach which was willing to spend large sums on legal costs rather than take action.</P>

      <P>I recently announced a major initiative to enhance the uptake of physics and chemistry in the leaving certificate curriculum. This initiative includes the provision of additional funding &ndash; for laboratory resources, a special per capita grant for each pupil studying physics and chemistry at leaving certificate, the production of revised syllabi at both junior and senior level, and the establishment of an extensive in-career development programme for teachers of the physical sciences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A review of science facilities in all second-level schools has been undertaken and when data from this review have been analysed, schools will receive direct grants to address identified needs. The special per capita grant will be paid from <Col N="1388" /> next September. It is intended that the initiative will be implemented over a three year period and funding for the initiative is estimated to amount to some £15 million.</P>
    <P>New syllabi in leaving certificate physics and leaving certificate chemistry have been finalised and will be sent to schools in September and will be introduced in September 2000 for first examination in June 2002. The revision of the junior certificate science syllabus is currently under way and it intended that it will be completed this summer. Work on revising the format of the ordinary level papers for both junior certificate and leaving certificate, based on the current syllabi, is also under way and samples of these papers will be sent to schools early in the new school year. The revised format papers will be introduced in the certificate examinations in June 2000.</P>
    <P>The in-career development programme will be introduced early in the next school year. Currently, a training of trainers course is being drawn up and this course will take place in June. Subsequently, a team of trainers will be established on a regional basis to assist teachers in the introduction of the new syllabi.</P>
    <P>I am very conscious of the important contribution of the physical sciences to the development of our increasingly high-skills economy and I am confident that the wide range of measures being implemented in this initiative will make a significant contribution to increasing the numbers of pupils studying physics and chemistry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the discussions that took place on this subject at the various teacher conferences and I welcome any constructive proposals which increase the ability of schools to deal effectively with this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1389" /> My Department has issued guidelines to boards of management to assist them in discharging their obligations in the area of school discipline. These guidelines were drawn up following consultation with representatives of management, teachers and parents, and are sufficiently flexible to allow each school authority to adapt them to suit the particular needs of the school.</P>
    <P>Each board of management is responsible for formulating, in consultation with parents, a fair and efficient code of behaviour. This code should ensure that the individuality of each child is accommodated while acknowledging the right of each child to education in a relatively disruption-free environment. The code should also include provision for dealing with serious breaches of discipline and continuously disruptive pupils.</P>
    <P>Social attitudes and parental approaches to discipline vary from one school community to another, and it would be impractical and even undesirable for the Department to set out a formal and detailed code of behaviour for all schools.</P>
    <P>The report on discipline that was commissioned by my Department and completed by Dr. Maeve Martin deals comprehensively with the issue of discipline in schools, and sets out models of best practice in this area. A copy of the report has been made available to all schools and will, I am sure, be a very valuable resource for school authorities.</P>
    <P>I also draw the Deputy's attention to the support teachers scheme, which is currently in place on a pilot basis. The functions of the support teachers are to coordinate a whole-school approach to devising and implementing good practice and strategies which will help to prevent the occurrence of disruptive behaviour and to teach and counsel small groups and individuals who exhibit persistent behaviour difficulties in the classroom.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that potentially disruptive pupils frequently are in need of psychological evaluation as a first step to appropriate assistance. In this regard I will shortly be making an order establishing a national educational psychological service agency, NEPS. When this has been done, provision in this area will be gradually expanded on a phased basis over a five year period. At the end of this five year period it is envisaged that 200 psychologists will be in place and that every school in the country will have access to a schools psychological service. I would add that 50 psychologists are already in place and my Department will shortly be recruiting 25 additional psychologists, who should take up their appointments during the school year 1999-2000.</P>
    <P>One of the priorities of the NEPS psychologists will be to work with schools and families in order to deal with disruptive behaviour before it becomes a problem. There will be a national advisory board as well as regional committees, on which the partners in education will be represented. These committees will provide a representative forum for the development of pre<Col N="1390" /> ventative strategies in relation to disruptive behaviour.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 88 and 92 together.</P>
      <P>The European Social Fund aided third level courses maintenance grants scheme for trainees provides maintenance grants for eligible students who are pursuing middle level technician and higher technical-business skills programmes at the institutes of technology.</P>
      <P>The objective of the middle level technician and higher technical-business skills programme is to enhance industrial competitiveness and growth by providing initial third level education and training to meet the technical and higher level manpower needs of the economy. The training conditions of the programme are intended to reflect the reality of the work environment, thereby preparing trainees for the workplace.</P>
      <P>The regulations governing the middle level technician and higher technical-business skills programme state that:</P>
      <P>Trainees on the programmes will be subject to normal industrial disciplines during training regarding time-keeping, absenteeism etc., and the institute authorities will be required to reflect these factors in the payment of maintenance grants. Trainees may be allowed sick leave without reduction in the level of grant for a maximum of 15 days per academic year. All such absences must be notified to the institute authorities in writing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1391" /> Normal industrial discipline refers to the normal conditions which exist in the workplace, for example notifying absences due to illness in writing to the college authorities. Candidates applying for a maintenance grant for an ESF-aided course receives a copy of the scheme in which the payment procedures are set out and they are, accordingly, familiar with these provisions from the commencement of their courses.</P>
    <P>The higher education grants scheme and the vocational education committees' scholarship scheme allow for the payments of grants in three equal installments. These grants are paid on the basis of the student continuing to be a registered student at college rather than a roll call taken on a daily basis which is the system which operates on ESF-aided courses in the institutes of technology.</P>
    <P>My Department does not have any details in relation to the amount of maintenance grant payments students are losing under this provision of the ESF maintenance grants scheme.</P>
    <P>I have not yet seen the findings of the survey compiled by the students' union at Dun Laoghaire Institute of Art, Design and Technology and the Union of Students in Ireland referred to by the Deputies. My officials have been in contact with the students' union at the institute to obtain a copy of the survey and I understand that the survey, which was intended to highlight local difficulties, was confined to students at the institute. I further understand that the union and the institute have since reached agreement on guidelines for the operation of the relevant provisions of the scheme.</P>

      <P>There are a number of opportunities open to students to enter third level education other than by the leaving certificate and standard CAO entry procedures.</P>
      <P>For the first time in 1999, results under the leaving certificate vocational programme link modules will count for points for entry purposes into the universities. Under the new arrangements, students will be able to use points allocated in the link modules as one of their six subjects for the purpose of points for entry into courses in the universities and Dublin Institute of Technology &ndash; 30 points for a pass, 40 for a merit and 50 for a distinction. The Council of Heads of Irish Universities, CHIU, has indicated that the level of points may be adjusted in the future in the light of developments arising from the commission on the points system and from a review of student performance of entrants gaining credits under the link modules.</P>
      <P>Recognition of results under leaving certificate vocational programme link modules has been available for some years in the Institutes of Technology. The points level awarded by the institutes is 30 for pass, 50 for merit and 70 for distinction.</P>
      <P>Youthreach and a network of senior traveller training centres operate programmes for young people who have left school early with no qualifications. National certification is available at foundation level and level one from the National Council for Vocational Awards, and leaving cert applied options can also be pursued. Trainees can progress from there to plc courses, which are certified at level two by the NCVA, with a limited number of awards at level three. Plc courses are also open to those who have completed the established leaving certificate, the leaving certificate vocational programme and the leaving certificate applied.</P>
      <P>Unemployed adults may return to education under the vocational training opportunity scheme or the back to education allowance schemes, and depending on prior educational levels, can pursue options at junior certificate, leaving certificate, or NCVA foundation level, level one, level two or equivalent. VTOS has supports in place to facilitate students who wish to progress to third level colleges, and those who do so may retain an allowance in lieu of social welfare entitlements under the back to education allowance scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A higher education links scheme has been agreed by the NCVA with the institutes of technology under which holders of level two full awards can progress to designated third level courses. Details of the scheme are circulated annually to school principals and guidance coun<Col N="1393" /> sellors. In addition, students may progress from the institutes of technology to degree programmes.</P>
    <P>In the university sector, the Higher Education Authority provides funding for initiatives specifically relating to disadvantaged students. One aspect of these initiatives involves special entry arrangements, through which more flexible entry criteria are applied and various supports put in place, for students entering through non-standard CAO entry procedures.</P>
    <P>Third level colleges also have a range of measures in place to support access of mature students as non-standard applicants. For example, in the primary teacher training area, separate entry procedures, involving a competitive interview and oral Irish test, operate for mature students and university graduates who wish to train as primary teachers. The NCEA, in line with its commitment to lifelong learning and the facilitation of access to and progress within the higher education system, launched a foundation certificate in 1998. This course is aimed at adult learners who wish to return to study after a break in their educational experience and who may not have benefited from, or had access to, previous educational opportunities. An annual guide for mature students on entry to full time third level courses is published by the Department of Education and Science.</P>
    <P>Under the terms of the Qualifications (Education and Training) Bill, 1999 currently being debated by this House, it is proposed to establish the national qualifications authority of Ireland and two new awarding councils &ndash; the further education and training awards council and the higher education and training awards council. The qualifications authority will have as a key function the role of setting out procedures for access transfer and progression to be implemented by providers of education and training. All providers of education and training with programmes validated by either of the two new awarding councils or which have delegated authority from either of the two councils to make awards, as well as the Dublin Institute of Technology and any new university that may be established, will be required to implement the procedures for access, transfer and progression that the qualifications authority is to set out. In relation to the existing universities, they will be required to co-operate with the qualifications authority and their implementation of the procedures for access, transfer and progression will be reviewed by the qualifications authority, in consultation with the Higher Education Authority. The outcomes of such reviews will be published by the qualifications authority.</P>
    <P>It is also of note that I set up the commission on the points system on 15 October, 1997. The setting up of the commission met a commitment in the Government's An Action Programme for the Millennium, which included as a key priority the appointment of a high-powered group to examine the points system.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1394" /> The commission issued a consultative process &ndash; background document in September 1998, which analyses the submissions made and outlines the research undertaken on behalf of the commission as well as examining international experience. The commission subsequently has issued two research papers and intends to issue further research papers in the near future. The commission is aiming to report in late summer-early Autumn 1999.</P>

      <P>Parenting does not constitute a formal element in the primary school curriculum. However, children are constantly made aware of the importance of parenthood, of the respect due to parents and of the obligation there is to care for the needs of dependent younger children. Such matters are generally addressed on a cross-curricular basis, being given particular emphasis in the programmes on religious education and civics. In the revised primary curriculum soon to be implemented, a new subject area will be introduced called social, personal and health education or SPHE. It is intended that the objectives of the SPHE programme would be attained in a combination of three ways &ndash; through dedicated teaching periods, through a cross-curricular approach and through the influence of the overall school climate and atmosphere. One of the objectives of the SPHE programme for pupils in fifth and sixth classes will be to develop in the pupils an understanding of the responsibilities involved in being a parent and the emotional and physical maturity required to be one.</P>
      <P>Parenting forms an important part of the curriculum at second level. At junior certificate level parenting is part of the subject matter within the social and health studies sector of the home economics syllabus which deals with the study of the family and the relationship between adolescents and parents. Parenting is also treated within the optional childcare section of this syllabus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It also features within the leaving certificate home economics social and scientific syllabus as part of a sociological study of the family. Within the leaving certificate applied, the vocational specialism &ndash; community care &ndash; has two modules dealing with child development and child care. Consideration is being given to the inclusion of a module which will include parenting in the context of the revision of this vocational specialism which is under way at present. Parenting will also form an important part of the social, personal and health programme which will be introduced <Col N="1395" /> shortly at both junior and leaving certificate levels.</P>

      <Quest>the number of students from disadvantaged backgrounds who obtain non-CAO access to university; and the way in which this compares with the target set in the White Paper on Education.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Through targeted funding provided by the Higher Education Authority since 1996, all the universities have developed initiatives to tackle the problem of access for the disadvantaged to third level education. These initiatives involve links with second level schools and local communities. Examples of these activities include the pathways through education project, supervised study programmes, summer schools, study skills programmes and mentoring. There are two aspects to these programmes, one involving assistance to students to meet the points requirements for courses, enabling them to obtain a third level place through the standard CAO entry procedure. The other aspect of the programmes is the special entry arrangements through which more flexible entry criteria are applied and various supports are put in place for students entering by this method.</P>
      <P>For the first time in 1999, results under the LCVP link modules will count for points for entry purposes into the universities. Under the new arrangements, students will be able to use points allocated in the link modules as one of their six subjects for the purpose of points for entry into courses in the universities and Dublin Institute of Technology  &ndash; 30 points for a pass, 40 for a merit and 50 for a distinction. The Council of Heads of Irish Universities has indicated that the level of points may be adjusted in the future in the light of developments arising from the commission on the points system and from a review of student performance of entrants gaining credits under the link modules.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whereas all the universities have targets for the number of disadvantaged students they hope will proceed to third level education it will take some time for the effect of these initiatives to be reflected in the actual numbers going on to higher education. Consequently, my Department does not have detailed statistics in relation to student numbers assisted under these initiatives at present. However, the Higher Education Authority is undertaking an evaluation of the initiatives in all the universities and it is hoped that the results of this evaluation will be available before the end of the year. In addition, Professor Patrick Clancy is undertaking his fourth national survey of entrants to higher education on behalf of the Higher Education Authority where the social backgrounds of new entrants to higher education <Col N="1396" /> are examined. From a comparison of the results of previous surveys it is evident that a significant reduction in inequality of participation of the various socioeconomic groups has occurred.</P>
    <P>I am sure that the Deputy will appreciate the multifaceted nature of the initiatives under way which are indicative, of my commitment to tackle educational disadvantage. These initiatives span the first and second level systems as the need for a holistic approach to promote equality rather than policies focused only on the third-level sector and on the transition from second to third level, is well established. In this regard, fuller participation in third level depends on measures to ensure access to and retention of students in full-time education at first and second levels.</P>
    <P>I have recently announced details of a £6.9 million two-year funding initiative to tackle educational disadvantage in the third level sector. Of this funding, £3 million is being specifically allocated to promote access to third level amongst students from disadvantaged backgrounds, including people with disabilities. A further £1.5 million is being provided to address the issue of non-completion of courses in institutes of technology. Details of the allocation of these additional resources will be announced in due course when I have fully considered how best to proceed in these areas.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware of my recent announcement concerning a £1 5 million programme for the development of science in second level schools. In making this announcement, I said that it is critical for Ireland's development as a world leader in high-skills employment that we improve our performance in physics and chemistry. Over the last year, my officials and I have been examining the current state of these subjects in our schools.</P>
      <P>A major programme of investment in modernising school science laboratories will be implemented. Details of this will be finalised following the completion of a detailed analysis of a survey of science facilities undertaken in recent months.</P>
      <P>In March of this year, details of a new payment to schools for each student undertaking physics or chemistry were circulated to all second level schools. This initiative; which will be introduced from September, 1999 and which will cost over £300,000 in a full year; involves providing schools with £10 for each student to aid in the purchase of materials for these classes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am confident that this initiative will encourage an increased uptake of the physical sciences <Col N="1397" /> in our schools, opening up increased opportunities for students, and in the process, enhancing Ireland's highly deserved reputation for a well-educated and scientifically literate workforce.</P>

      <P>There will be a greater emphasis on practical work when the new physics and chemistry syllabi are introduced in September 2000 and when the new biology and agricultural science syllabi are introduced thereafter. My Department is considering the possibility of assessment of this practical work as part of the examination of those subjects.</P>
      <P>Many elements of the recent initiative on physical sciences &ndash; resourcing of laboratories, upskilling of the teachers and indeed the revised syllabi &ndash; will contribute greatly to the possible introduction of this assessment. There have been demands for the provision of laboratory assistants/technicians from teachers in the context of this greater emphasis on practical work. Many schools have availed of opportunities provided by community employment schemes or used their own resources to provide this technical support. My Department will give this matter further analysis as part of its consideration for support for schools across a number of areas. I believe that the full series of initiatives have to be implemented and the extent of the need for laboratory assistance for teachers ascertained before any firm decision on this matter can be made.</P>

      <P>Educational provision for newly arrived refugees is related to age, knowledge of English and other areas of need. Education may be provided for children and young people in the nearest convenient school.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year 14 additional teachers were sanctioned for primary schools to assist them in responding to the additional tuition needs of refugee students in the area of language particularly. At post primary level additional teaching hours may be sanctioned for individual schools or VEC schemes where such are required to meet the additional tuition needs of refugees attending the schools. My Department also meets the costs of English language support for adults.</P>
      <P>Recently a refugee language support unit has been established in Trinity College with funding support from my Department. This unit will co-operate with the refugee agency, with my Department and with refugee groups themselves in identifying the language support needs of refugees and in developing effective and targeted ways of meeting these needs. Other provision includes intensive summer English language courses for young refugee students who may need such provision in order to help them benefit from the educational opportunities available.</P>
      <P>In order to begin the process of identifying the educational needs of the Kosovar refugees arriving at present local inspectors of my Department are being nominated to liaise with each centre where accommodation is being provided. The refugee language support unit will, in liaison with the inspectors, identify the language status and needs of the Kosovar people as they settle in each centre. It is anticipated that some initial language tuition will be required to assist them to avail subsequently of the educational provision made in schools and other centres.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the criticism from the ASTI that while the number of students in second level education has tripled, the expenditure per student remains amongst the lowest in the EU; and his views on whether this criticism is justified; and his proposals, if any, he has in this regard.</Quest>

      <P>I am fully aware of the demands for increased funding by second level schools. International comparisons are a valuable input to the debate on the optimum allocation of our national resources to the greatest benefit of our people. However, the ASTI survey, which dates from 1997, does not reflect the real improvements made during the last two year.-, both in respect of current and capital allocations for second-level schools. Since 1997, the funding provided for second level was increased by 8 per cent and 9 per cent in 1998 and 1999, respectively. It is my intention to improve further the funding of second-level schools to the extent that the availability of resources permits.</P>

      <P>A Bill to replace the school attendance Acts has been drafted by the parliamentary draftsman's office and was published recently. As is the normal procedure in these cases, the Minister for Finance and his Department were consulted on the proposals in the Bill, including their financial implications, prior to Government approval for publication of the Bill.</P>
      <P>Overall the Bill, when enacted, although incorporating existing school attendance services of local authorities, will involve the allocation of additional resources, as a result mainly of the establishment of the national educational welfare board and the extension of the school-leaving age to 16. It is difficult to predict with accuracy the likely costs involved. However, the total costs are unlikely to exceed IR£4.5 million (5.74 million euros) over the period to 2001.</P>

      <P>My Department will play a central and constructive role in all aspects of the measures relating to abuse of children announced by the Taoiseach on 11 May.</P>
      <P>In the first instance, as the Department with statutory responsibility for aspects of the industrial school and reformatory school system, my Department will be closely involved in assisting the work of the commission. My officials have already proceeded with work of providing for various elements of the commission's establishment. It is the Government's intention, as stated in the terms of reference of the commission that it will establish as complete a picture as possible of the causes, nature and extent of physical and sexual abuse of children in institutions and in other places during the period from 1940, or such earlier date as the commission considers appropriate, to the present, including the antecedents, circumstances, factors and context of such abuse, the perspectives of the victims and the motives and perspectives of the persons responsible for committing abuse. The commission will receive wholehearted support and co-operation from my Department, including complete access to the officials and records of my Department and the provision of necessary resources.</P>
      <P>On a more general level, the Government's measures relating to abuse of children arose out of proposals made to Government by a Cabinet sub-committee of which I am chairperson. That sub-committee will continue to have a close involvement in monitoring the implementation and effectiveness of the measures and accordingly I and my Department will have a continuing close interest and involvement in the implementation of all the measures.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The millennium committee advertised in the national press in January this year inviting the public to submit proposals for consideration as millennium projects. There were no application <Col N="1402" /> forms required. The millennium committee is currently considering the very large number of projects received as a result of the advertisement and continues to accept proposals.</P>
    <P>In order to ensure the millennium funding is also available for locally based projects, the Government on the recommendation of the millennium committee, has approved a millennium recognition awards initiative. This initiative is to be administered by Area Development Management Limited, on behalf of the national millennium committee. The £1.9 million of millennium funding is to be made available for awards under this initiative. Details of the awards and availability of application forms will be announced shortly.</P>

    <P>The cost of the tribunal to my Department to date amounts to £2,416,967. Details are set out below. The main costs relate to legal fees of the counsel for the tribunal. All other payments relate to the direct administration of the tribunal office in Dublin Castle (types of expenditure detailed below). In relation to the indirect administration costs, the Office of Public Works provides the office accommodation for the tribunal in Dublin Castle. Other than legal fees and administration costs, no other payments have been made by my Department from funding for the tribunal. It would be inappropriate to provide full details of all payments made in respect of the tribunal as this information could compromise the workings of the tribunal.</P>

      <P>In July 1997, our Department developed a year 2000 plan which identified all of the IT hardware and software in operation within our Department and identified the action necessary to ensure that they are year 2000 compliant. An internal monitoring committee was set up with the remit of overseeing progress on the implementation of the year 2000 compliance plan for the Department and for the agencies that come within our Departments remit. This committee meets fortnightly to ensure continuous and scheduled progress on the project.</P>
      <P>I wish to assure the Deputy that I am satisfied with the progress being made in our Department towards achieving full year 2000 compliance. The Government has set 31 July 1999 as the deadline for achieving compliance on all fatal and critical systems across all Government Departments and our Department is on schedule to meet this deadline.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that IDA Ireland, which operates under the remit of my Department, sold a portion of its land for the development of this waste <Col N="1407" /> recycling depot at Ballaghaderreen. Sale of property for industrial purposes is a statutory function of the agency under section 16(1) of the Industrial Development Act, 1986 and is not one in which I have a direct function.</P>
    <P>The sale of this property to the promoter was subject to planning permission plus all other requisite licences and approvals being obtained. Planning permission was granted by Roscommon County Council. Following an appeal by local resident groups, this permission was upheld by An Bord Pleanála.</P>
    <P>I understand that due to the concerns expressed by local interest groups when this sale was entered into, IDA Ireland agreed to assist the promoter in identifying an acceptable alternative site for the proposed recycling facility. However, despite the agency's best efforts it did not prove possible to locate a viable alternative site.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, the promoter sought to complete the sale on foot of binding agreements and IDA Ireland was bound to proceed with the sale as all the contractual conditions has been satisfied. This property is no longer the responsibility of the agency and the current owner now has discretion to complete the provision of the waste recycling facility for which he has been granted planning permission.</P>

      <P>My primary responsibility in the area of unemployment is to <Col N="1408" /> ensure that unemployed and long-term unemployed persons have access to quality employment services and to training and employment programmes which will enhance the prospects of getting a job. Within the range of programmes there is targeting but this is generally by category of person, e.g. persons who are very long-term unemployed and over 35, rather than by geographical area. However there are 25 local employment service networks in operation, 23 of them in partnership areas. Their brief is to concentrate on persons at greatest remove from the labour market. Currently we are bringing the FÁS employment service and the local employment service networks more closely together so they can deliver an optimal range of services to Jobseekers. Since September 1998 we have complemented our programmes for long-term unemployed persons by a policy of systematic activation to prevent unemployed persons drifting into long-term unemployment.</P>
      <P>FÁS is organised on a regional basis and the training and bridging programmes they provide reflect regional needs. Since 1998 FÁS has been implementing an action plan for the long-term unemployed which seeks to increase their participation in mainstream training. In so far as employment measures are concerned the thrust of the 1999 budget is to shift resources from employment programmes to training programmes with better employment outcomes.</P>
      <P>Partnerships have been established in 38 areas of recognised disadvantage to pursue local development issues, including employment. The Minister for Tourism, Recreation and Sport, has policy responsibility for the partnerships. His Department has also developed an integrated services project in four particular employment blackspots.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance has primary policy responsibility for the national development plan 2000-2006 (NDP). This will out development priorities, funding and expenditure for the period in question, including plans for investment in human resources. The NDP will also make proposals for the utilisation of Structural Funds and will serve as the basis for agreement of the Community Support Framework and agreement and elaboration of operational programmes.</P>

      <P>There has been a modest reduction in the number of places on the community employment programme, from 40,000 in 1998 to 37,500 in 1999. However new active labour market initiatives have been introduced which will provide over 10,000 new places in 1999. This is in the context of dynamic jobs growth and dramatic falls in the level of unemployment and means that the ration of active labour market programme places for long-term unemployed persons has been substantially improved. The most recent quarterly national household survey shows year on year jobs growth of 72,000 and a corresponding decline in unemployment of 65,000.</P>
      <P>Within the parameters of the overall places available, the number of places on a project by project basis is an operational matter for FÁS. The criterion being applied is a qualitative analysis of projects, having regard for example to how well a project is achieving the objective of progressing CE participants into further education-training or employment. Priority is also given to projects that fit in with local development plans, drug task force projects and rate-for-job projects.</P>
      <P>The dedicated social economy programme, which becomes operational later this year, will also be a means of delivering jobs and job supports to disadvantaged communities.</P>

      <P>If a person whose money is stolen wishes, the embassy advances funds on the basis of an equivalent amount being lodged, through the Garda Síochána if necessary, with the Department of Foreign Affairs in Dublin; there is a statutory fee of £25 for that service.

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>From the time that open conflict broke out in Kosovo in March 1998, extensive diplomatic efforts were made by the international community to bring about a peaceful solution. However, use by the Belgrade authorities of excessive and indiscriminate force against the civilian ethnic Albanian population led to the displacement of several hundred thousand persons, living in the most precarious conditions and without shelter, as last winter approached. To stave off a humanitarian crisis, diplomatic efforts were intensified, leading to the adoption of Security Council resolutions 1199, 23 September 1999, and 1203, 24 October 1998. The latter resolution provided the basis and outline of steps to be taken towards an overall solution. It also provided for the establishment by the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe of their Kosovo Verification Mission (KVM), and allowed a certain amount of urgent humanitarian aid and reconstruction assistance to be delivered.</P>
      <P>Intensive efforts by US and EU special envoys, through shuttle diplomacy, to start political dialogue were unfortunately unsuccessful. Consequently the full mandate and programme of work of the KVM could not evolve. Instead that mission had to concentrate on crisis management.</P>
      <P>The degree of non-compliance by the Belgrade authorities with the requirements of the Security Council Resolutions was considerable, and was highlighted by the Racak massacre in mid-January as well as by their subsequent refusal to co-operate with the international criminal tribunal in investigating it.</P>
      <P>With the expectation that the end of winter would lead to a full-scale resumption of violence between the parties, the Rambouillet talks were convened by the contact group, US, Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Russia. As a non-member Ireland did not participate directly in these talks although we were briefed on the main developments by the German EU Presidency. On the basis of this information, I have no reason to believe that a reasonable solution was not in prospect.</P>
      <P>During the break between the conclusion of these talks on 23 February and their resumption in Paris on 15 March, the ethnic Albanian side were persuaded to accept what was on offer including the disarming and disbandment of the KLA and their renunciation of independence for Kosovo &ndash; while the Serb position hardened considerably. The interval was also used by Belgrade to build up further their forces in Kosovo.</P>
      <P>In the days leading up to 24 March, there was a further round of intense diplomatic activity, including efforts by the EU Presidency to persuade Belgrade to change course and to avoid a final breakdown of diplomatic efforts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1417" /> On 24 March, the European Council meeting in Berlin concluded that the international community had done its utmost to find a peaceful solution to the Kosovo conflict. In New York, on the same day, the UN Secretary General deeply regretted that, in spite of all the efforts made by the international community, the Yugoslav authorities had persisted in their rejection of a political settlement, which would have halted the bloodshed in Kosovo and secured an equitable peace for the population there.</P>
    <P>The decision by NATO to commence bombing was taken on the basis of earlier Security Council resolutions, notably resolutions 1199 and 1203, but without recourse to the Security Council for a more specific mandate. In reply to other questions in the House, I have set out the Governments views of subsequent events. In my most recent reply, on 11 May, I expressed my hope that the principles agreed in Bonn on 6 May by the G8 countries would provide the basis for a Security Council resolution which could be used to bring about a solution to the crisis.</P>

      <P>Passports are valuable documents and it is in the interests of the State and of all Irish citizens that they have a good international reputation and be readily accepted by the authorities of other states. The passport office makes every effort to ensure that appropriate security features are incorporated into the passport booklets and these standards must be matched by adequate care in checking the identities of applicants for passports.</P>
      <P>Certification of applicants identities was in the past done by people of some standing in the community as well as by gardaí. Unfortunately this system was shown to be inadequate when a number of applicants whose identities were certified by people other than gardaí were found not to be genuine. In order to limit the possibility of a recurrence of such fraud it was decided in 1984 to confine certification to members of the Garda Síochána.</P>
      <P>I believe that the gardaí are best placed to scrutinise passport applications from persons residing in the State so as to ensure that only those entitled to hold Irish passports receive them. The procedure, which is relatively straight-forward, is working well and therefore I have no plans to change it.</P>

      <P>In consultation with the centre for management and organisation development of the Department of Finance, my Department completed a year 2000 preliminary assessment report <Col N="1422" /> in 1997. In August 1997, a year 2000 project board was set up, chaired by an assistant secretary, to oversee the work on year 2000 compliance. As part of the preliminary impact assessment both hardware and software were examined and approximately 50 departmental systems, were identified as being non-compliant. Resulting from this, a year 2000 compliance plan was drafted in October 1997. The year 2000 project board meets on a monthly basis to review and monitor progress towards compliance and reports regularly to the Department's management committee and IT steering committee. In addition, every two months a status report is forwarded to the interdepartmental year 2000 monitoring committee, which briefs the Government on this matter.</P>
      <P>Specifically with regard to the Department's computer hardware, a considerable amount of year 2000 upgrading work on mainframe operating systems, PC hardware, PC support software and networks has been completed at this stage. In parallel, remedial work is being carried out on all of the non-compliant software applications.</P>
      <P>The Government's target date for year 2000 compliance is end July 1999. I am satisfied the Department is well positioned to meet the compliance deadline.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are at present 26 feedmills and home compounders licensed under the provisions of the Diseases of Animals (Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy) (No. 2) Order, 1996 (S.I. No. 278 of 1996), to manufacture pig rations into which mammalian meat and bone meal is incorporated. The purpose of this Order is to enforce the ban on the sale or supply for feeding to ruminant animals (namely, cattle, sheep, goats and deer) and on the feeding to such animals, of feedstuffs containing animal protein derived from ruminant animals. The controls are also in place to minimise the possibility of accidental cross-contamination of ruminant feedstuffs</P>
      <P>It is not the practice to release the names and addresses of the parties to whom licences have been issued. The information sought in regard to the number of pigs produced each year by the parties involved or premises is not available to my Department.</P>
      <P>All mammalian meat and bone meal, MBM, in this country is produced, stored and moved under the control of my Department. Sales or supply of MBM can be made only on foot of the production of a valid licence to purchase MBM issued to the purchaser by the Department. Production, movement and sales records are subject to routine inspection and audit, in particular for the purpose of manufacturing licence renewal eligibility.</P>
      <P>Each user of MBM must in addition hold a second licence which subjects the use of the MBM to further controls including the keeping of records of the quantities and of the end use of all MBM purchased or supplied. These records are monitored by my Department on a regular basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Ireland pig rations containing MBM are produced in two ways, by a commercial feedmill dedicated to the production of non ruminant <Col N="1424" /> feedstuffs; and by persons who manufacture feedingstuffs intended for feeding to their own animals, Home Compounders.</P>
    <P>At present only one commercial feed mill is licensed to purchase and use MBM in the production of non ruminant animal feedingstuffs. This feed mill is dedicated to the production of non ruminant feedingstuffs. In practice MBM is only incorporated into pig ration in this feedmill.</P>
    <P>All pig holdings in receipt of ration from this company are visited by my Department and must be approved prior to initial supply. Such farms are also subject to ongoing checking following approval. Approval to use feedstuffs may be refused/withdrawn where my Department is not satisfied that the conditions of the Diseases of Animals (BSE) No. 2 Order, 1996, are being/will be observed. All ruminants, e.g. cattle, sheep, goats and deer must be effectively excluded from any site where mammalian meat and bone or feedstuffs containing MBM are stored, fed or otherwise used. Each unit must be a discrete entity within its own permanent, secure, durable and robust boundary with a second barrier to the feed storage within the unit. Access to internal farm roadways, e.g. for slurry spreading purposes must be secured with a locked gate open only when in actual use or cattle grids. Main entrance(s) must have cattle grids or a gate locked outside operating hours.</P>
    <P>The feedmills records of quantities of MBM purchases, incorporation rates and feed production incorporating MBM are checked on a regular basis by my Department. The feedmill must supply my Department on a regular basis with lists of the customers to whom rations containing MBM are supplied. The production of all rations in this feedmill and in all other feedmills licensed to sell compound feedingstuffs under EU legislation are monitored by Officials of my Department. The renewal of licences in respect of feedmills may be refused or existing licences may be withdrawn where my Department is not satisfied that the conditions of the Diseases of Animals (BSE) No. 2 Order, 1996, are being observed.</P>
    <P>Licences to purchase and to incorporate MBM are issued on an annual basis to home compounders to manufacture pig rations containing such mammalian meat and bone meal. Such rations are then fed to the compounders own pigs on the named pig unit on the premises specified on the licences issued.</P>
    <P>At present 25 home compounders are licensed to purchase and to incorporate MBM. Each applicant is assessed individually by my Department for suitability to hold licences under the provisions of the Diseases of Animals (BSE) (No. 2) Order, 1996 as set out above.</P>
    <P>All home compounders are subject to regular inspection of the premises and the audit of the use and destination of MBM purchased. In addition, my Department has to be satisfied that the home compounder is strictly observing the provisions of the Diseases of Animals (BSE) No. <Col N="1425" /> 2 Order, 1996. Licences are refused/withdrawn where the Department is not satisfied that the conditions of the Diseases of Animals (BSE) No. 2 Order, 1996, are being/will be observed.</P>
    <P>The production of meat and bone meal for feeding to non-ruminant animals is undertaken in accordance with existing scientific recommendations. Specified risk material is excluded from this process and the remaining material is rendered in accordance with EU parameters in approved plants which are under Departmental supervision.</P>
    <P>Pigs which have been fed meat and bone meal and product therefrom can be traded on the EU single market provided they meet animal health conditions laid down in European legislation. The ban in the UK on the feeding of meat and bone meal to any species was introduced in response to the high incidence of BSE in that country and remains in place as the processing parameters shown to inactivate transmissable sponigform encephalopathies are not being applied in rendering plants in the UK.</P>

      <P>Over the period 1992 to 1998, the number of family farms declined by nearly 2,500 per year on average according to CSO data. However, in the last two years this decline has slowed to 1,700 in 1997 and 1,400 in 1998. There was a sharp decline in the amount of agricultural land being sold in the same period.</P>
      <P>The reduction in farm numbers is confined almost exclusively to farms of less than 20 hectares. In most cases this occurs due to the death or retirement of a farmer without an heir, or where the heir does not wish to take over the farm, rather than due to an active family ceasing to farm. It is likely that this trend will continue over the next five years at approximately the same rate as in the recent past.</P>
      <P>In relation to the creation of rural employment, recent research shows that for every one job lost in agriculture in the period 1991 to 1996, 4.5 jobs were created in other sectors for those living in rural districts. Given the excellent employment performance in the last few years it is likely that this ratio has further improved since 1996. The Government nevertheless remains alive to the issue of employment in rural areas, and this will be a main focus of the forthcoming White Paper on rural development.</P>

      <P>The person named stated on her 1998 ewe premium application that at least 50 per cent of her holding was in the disadvantaged area.

She was paid £1,571.47 in respect of the second advance on 22 October 1998. However, subsequent checks revealed that the person named did not submit an 1998 area aid application and this gave rise to an overpayment in respect of the rural world premium which was offset against the final instalment of the 1998 ewe premium. Her full entitlement under the final instalment was £1,936.29 but taking the overpayment into account the amount due was £473.71. Payment was made on 26 February 1999.</P>

      <P>The person concerned applied for 162 ewes under the 1998 ewe premium scheme. Following an inspection of the flock on 31 March 1998 only 94 ewes were found. He was, therefore, deemed to have made an intentional false declaration and was debarred from the scheme for two years (i.e. 1998 and 1999 schemes). He has appealed this decision. This appeal is presently under consideration and a decision is expected shortly. He applied under the 1999 ewe premium scheme in respect of 94 ewes but he is not entitled to payment on the basis of the decision debarring him from the 1998 scheme.</P>
      <P>The person named applied for 17 cows under the 1998 suckler cow premium scheme on 28 October 1998. At a herd inspection carried out on 3 December 1998 the person named presented two animals which were deemed not to have calved and were therefore not eligible under the EU regulations governing the scheme. The resultant penalty applied in this case is that the applicant is debarred from the scheme for the year in question (1998) and the following year (1999) as he was deemed to have made an intentional false declaration. The person named was notified in writing of the decision in January 1999. In February of 1999 the person named sought to have this decision reviewed. This is currently under consideration and a decision on the matter is expected shortly.</P>

      <P>The statutory regulations relating to the operation of horse breeding societies are those relating to the approval and operation of stud books. The approval of stud books is regulated under the European Communities (Equine Stud-Book and Competition) Regulations, 1993, Statutory Instrument No. 305 of 1993. These regulations, which give legal effect to Council Directives 90/427/EEC and 90/428/EEC and Commission Decisions 92/216/EEC, 92/353/EEC, 92/354/EEC, 93/623/EEC, 96/78/EC and 96/79/EC, set out, among other things, the criteria which a body must meet if it is to maintain an officially recognised stud-book.</P>
      <P>With reference to inspections and approval of horses, the criteria for entry and registration in stud books for breeding purposes is set out in Commission Decision 96/78/EC while provisions relating to the division of stud books and breed characteristics are to be found in the annex to Commission Decision 92/353/EEC.</P>

      <P>Under EU regulations, farmers holding suckler cow quotas greater than seven are required to use at least 90 per cent of the quota every year, otherwise the part not used will be forfeited and returned to the national reserve. Farmers holding quotas of seven or less are required to use at least 90 per cent of the quota in any one of two consecutive years, otherwise the part not used in the second year will be forfeited and returned to the national reserve. As these rules are prescribed in the EU regulations, I have no discretion in their implementation nor can I introduce any concessionary measures in contravention of those rules.</P>
      <P>I announced recently that there will be a second application period for the 1999 suckler cow premium scheme in October next. This means that farmers who have not sold or leased their quotas during the May trading period will have an opportunity to do so in October. Quota that cannot be sold or leased during either trading period will revert to the national reserve and will be distributed from the year 2000 national reserve to eligible farmers who apply for, and require additional quota, in the year 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that there is presently an abundance of quota on the market but normal market forces of supply and demand are not regarded by the EU as constituting exceptional circumstances <Col N="1438" /> and the regulations as set out must, therefore, apply.</P>

      <P>The requirement for retention periods during which animals applied on under the various EU headage and premium schemes must be held and maintained by the applicant is an integral part of each scheme and is set out in EU regulations. In the case of cattle headage-beef cow and suckler cow premium schemes the regulations allow for animals applied on to be replaced by other eligible animals during the retention period. Retention periods serve to ensure that beneficiaries under the schemes are genuine farmers who normally maintain livestock on an ongoing basis.</P>
      <P>Different retention periods apply under the different schemes ranging from two months in the case of cattle headage, sheep headage and special beef premium to six months in the case of suckler cow premium. The longer retention period for the suckler cow premium reflects the fact that these animals are in fact the main breeding stock and are not normally disposed of except in the case of normal stock replacement. The shorter retention period for special beef premium reflects the fact that these animals form part of a producers trading stock.</P>
      <P>The retention period for the suckler cow premium scheme is set out in a Council regulation and any variation of the period would therefore require the agreement of the Council of Ministers. Any such change would have to be proposed by the EU Commission.</P>

      <P>In general, it is only possible for businesses which are VAT registered to recover the tax and this would normally exclude individuals. EU VAT law, with which Irish VAT law must comply, would rule out either zero rating or the reduced rating of security systems or alarms and such items must continue to be subject to the standard rate of VAT which in Ireland is 21 per cent. The general position is that where VAT is chargeable, the tax must apply regardless of the status of the customer. Therefore, it is not open to me to remove VAT from services supplied to elderly people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a general principle of taxation that, as far as possible, income from all sources should be subject to taxation. In line with this principle, earnings arising from participation in FCA activities and summer camps are reckonable as income for tax purposes in the same way as income from all other sources. Treating such earnings as income for tax purposes is essentially a matter of equity.</P>
      <P>I could not therefore agree to the introduction of additional tax reliefs or exemptions for a particular group of taxpayers such as FCA personnel. It must also be recognised that such a provision would undoubtedly generate cognate demands for similar treatment from other groups, for example part-time firemen, which in equity would be very hard to resist. Such expansion would greatly increase the cost of what is proposed.</P>
      <P>A tax relief of this nature would clearly result in a narrowing of the tax base which would be contrary to Government policy. The focus of Government policy in relation to income tax, as set out in the Government's policy programme, An Action Programme for the Millennium, is to reduce the burden of personal taxation in order to reward effort and provide an incentive to take up employment. FCA members in common with all other taxpayers have benefited from the implementation of this programme to date, and will continue to do so in the future.</P>

      <P>The blind person's tax allowance was introduced in the 1971 budget. The definition of blind person for the purposes of the allowance, which is set out in section 468 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, was established in consultation with the Department of Health.</P>
      <P>There is no provision for a similar relief for deaf or partially deaf persons. However, under section 469 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, medical expenses relief is available in respect of the cost of a hearing aid, where this has been prescribed by a medical practitioner as defined by the Act. This is in contrast to routine ophthalmic treatment, including provision and maintenance of spectacles, which is not covered by medical expenses relief. In addition, the Value-Added Tax Act, 1972, provides for the application of the zero rate of VAT to a range of medical equipment and appliances including deaf aids.</P>
      <P>As you will appreciate, I receive numerous requests, many from very worthwhile causes, for the introduction of new reliefs or the extension of existing ones. Tax reliefs by their very nature reduce the tax base and make general reform of the tax system that much more difficult. Government policy in recent years has been to reduce the burden of personal taxation to reward effort and improve the incentive to take up employment. This has benefited all taxpayers.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy, for his information, to the reply to <Col N="1442" /> the Adjournment debate held on 2 March, 1999 which dealt comprehensively with this matter and my reply to similar Parliamentary Questions Nos. 141 and 145 dated 27 April, 1999. I can confirm that I have no plans to include blind people to the list of those eligible for the disabled drivers and disabled passengers (tax concessions) scheme. The present medical criteria for access to the scheme relate essentially to disabilities which seriously and permanently impair the physical mobility of the person concerned. This reflects the origins of the scheme as a relief for disabled persons who were confined to wheelchairs but nevertheless were capable of driving suitably adapted motor cars.</P>
      <P>A review of the scheme is being undertaken by an interdepartmental group chaired by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform The existing medical criteria for qualification is one of the issues that have been raised with that group. I await its report. However the current scheme is costly and opening it up to wider ranges of disabilities would significantly add to this cost. I must caution, therefore, against an expectation that a broader range of persons who suffer from some form of disability or disablement will be admitted to the scheme as a result of this review.</P>

      <P>In the details supplied by the Deputy, he refers only to taxation matters and I take it that this is his main concern. As the Deputy will know, it is established practice that a Minister for Finance does not answer a parliamentary question about the tax affairs of an individual or a company, other than when the Deputy asking the question was acting on behalf of the taxpayer. In this instance it would appear that the Deputy is not asking the question with the consent of the company concerned. In these circumstances, therefore, I regret that particular information cannot be divulged on grounds of confidentiality.</P>
      <P>I wish to assure the Deputy, however, that the activities of all companies operating in the construction sector here are actively monitored by the Revenue Commissioners to ensure compliance with all appropriate tax requirements. While it is not appropriate, therefore, to comment on a particular contractor, Revenue are active in this area and do indeed take account of any information they receive when planning their compliance activities.</P>

      <P>The IFSC regime was originally approved by the European Commission in 1987 as a State aid. However, during 1997-98, the Commission reviewed its position in relation to this approval and, in the light of Ireland's changed socio-economic position, determined that the IFSC regime could no longer be considered compatible with the common market and that measures needed to be taken to eliminate this incompatibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In July 1998, agreement was reached with the EU Commission on the phasing out of the preferential IFSC regime, with effect from 1 January <Col N="1444" /> 2003. The effect of this agreement is that no new projects may be approved under the IFSC regime after 1999, while the number of new projects which may be approved in 1999 is limited to 67. In the circumstances, since the possibility of introducing any new tax measures targeted at the financial services sector of the economy would be unacceptable to the EU Commission, I do not propose to commission any studies to examine the feasibility of establishing further financial services centres, along the lines of the IFSC.</P>

      <P>Residential property tax was abolished with effect from the valuation date 5 April 1997. The revenue loss from this abolition was estimated at £15 million in a full year.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that, while data is not available which would enable an exact forecast of the residential property tax yield for 1999 to be made, it is estimated that the yield in 1999 would be around £29 million. This estimate takes into account the house price increases which have occurred since April, 1996, the last valuation date for the tax, and the effect of rising incomes over the same period. It also assumes no change to the basic operation of the tax.</P>
      <P>I should, however, remind the Deputy that when residential property tax was abolished in 1997, stamp duty rates on houses valued in excess of £150,000 were increased to recoup most of the loss in revenue as a result of the abolition of residential property tax.</P>

      <P>The administration of the registration system is a matter for An tÁrd-Chláraitheoir, the registrar-general of births, deaths and marriages, and for local registrars who operate under his general direction.</P>
      <P>The Registration of Births and Deaths Acts, 1863 to 1996, and the Marriages Acts of 1844 and 1863 provide that An t-Árd Chláraitheoir shall retain certified copies of the records of births, deaths and marriages returned to him on a quarterly basis by local registrars and that he shall compile and make available an index to such records.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have referred in recent replies, in relation to facilities provided by the general register office, to the steps being taken to maintain and improve indexes to the records of births, deaths and marriages. The Deputy may already be aware of the special project for the capture of the records of births, deaths and marriages and associated indexes in an electronic format which has been ongoing in Roscommon for some time. The first <Col N="1451" /> stage of this work which involves scanning the records and indexes from 1844 is making steady progress and the project team will shortly be in the position to begin the development of a retrieval package to provide electronic access to these records.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that when this archival records project is completed, it will improve the efficiency, flexibility, access and management of the records and the associated indexes and will provide potential for the development of a range of services, which would not be possible in a system reliant on printed indexes. This project will be of benefit to all customers of the registration service throughout the country, including those engaged in family research, who currently avail of the services of the research room in the general register office.</P>
    <P>In my reply of 27 April, in relation to facilities in the general register office, I indicated that plans were in hand to relocate the public counter on the first floor in Joyce House to provide additional space in the public search room and I now understand that this work will be completed by the end of June.</P>

      <P>The report of the review group on health and personal social services for people with physical and sensory disabilities, Towards an Independent Future, published in December 1996 set out the requirements for the development of these services, including speech and language therapy services. The report recommended that 150 new speech and language therapy posts be put in place over the following ten years. Since the report was published three new speech and language therapy posts were created in 1997 and ten new speech and language therapy posts in 1998, four of which are in the Eastern Health Board area.</P>
      <P>Another recommendation of the review group is the setting up of regional co-ordinating committees for services for people with physical and sensory disabilities. These bring together health boards, voluntary sector service providers and consumers. One of the primary functions of the co-ordinating committee is to advise on priorities for the allocation of funds available for the development of the services. This year £3 million &ndash; £6 million full year cost in the year 2000 &ndash; has been provided for the development of services. The allocation of funding out of this for the provision of additional speech and language therapy services will be considered by each board in consultation with its co-ordinating committee.</P>

      <P>The primary purpose of my visit to New Zealand was to attend the 12th Congress of the International Society for the Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect &ndash; ISPCAN &ndash; which was held in Auckland from 6 to 9 September. This congress is held every two years and the 1996 congress was held in Dublin.</P>
      <P>While in New Zealand, I availed of the opportunity to meet a wide range of individuals and organisations to study the New Zealand systems of child care and juvenile justice which are recognised to be of a very high standard. During the course of my visit, I was able to develop on many of the contacts made initially by Deputy Currie when he visited the country as Minister of State in 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The itinerary for my visit was as follows: Wednesday, 2 September &ndash; Wellington, 9 a.m. <Col N="1457" /> meeting with Children, Young Persons and their Families Service (CYPFS) Co-ordinator for overview of service; 10 a.m. meeting with lawyers at youth court; 11.30 a.m. meeting with Youth Advocates; 1 p.m. working lunch with CYPFS Managers of Practice Policy and Standards; 2.30 p.m. briefing on Children, Young Persons and Families Act by CYPFS National Manager, Policy and Standards; 9.30 p.m. visit to Wellington Irish Centre. Thursday, 3 September &ndash; Wellington, 9 a.m. visit to Residential Centre, discussions with staff; 12.30 p.m. working lunch with Director General, Department of Social Welfare; 2 p.m. meeting with senior officials of the Department of Social Welfare to discuss supports for families, the impact of urban development and social exclusion on disadvantage, co-ordination mechanisms between Government Departments and other agencies and social work in schools; 3.30 p.m. meeting with Mr. Roger Sowry, Minister of Social Services, Work and Income. Friday, 4 September &ndash; Wellington, 9.45 a.m. visit to Urban Maori Community Social Service Centre; 11.30 a.m. discussion with CYPFS officials on the progress of a new campaign called Breaking the Cycle. Saturday, 5 September &ndash; travel to Auckland. Sunday, 6 September &ndash; Auckland, 5 p.m. attendance at formal opening of IPSCAN Congress; 8 p.m. visit to Auckland Irish Centre. Monday, 7 September to Wednesday, 9 September &ndash; Auckland. In addition to attendance at the ISPCAN Congress in Auckland, I had wide-ranging discussions with the police youth aid co-ordinator for New Zealand on the New Zealand juvenile justice system. The co-ordinator arranged an additional programme for myself and the official from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. This included a meeting with youth aid staff from the Auckland region to discuss, among other matters, family group conferences; a meeting with police to discuss the management of youth projects; a meeting with the district commander of police for South Auckland to learn about the development of policies to deal with youth offending in that area; attendance at the municipal headquarters in one area of Auckland to witness an inter-agency approach to dealing with young offenders and families at risk and attendance at a family group conference. There were also informal discussions with youth aid and youth education staff and others.</P>
    <P>I also attended a number of functions with President McAleese who was on an official visit to New Zealand at the time.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1458" /> In all, I spent 12 days in New Zealand, arriving on 1 September and departing on 12 September, and I was accompanied on my visit by a principal officer from the law reform division of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, an assistant principal officer from the child care policy unit of the Department of Health and Children and by my private secretary.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 215 and 216 together.</P>
      <P>Consumption of tobacco increases the risk of morbidity and mortality from a wide range of illnesses. These include cancers, diseases of the heart and circulatory system, and respiratory conditions. Data on hospital discharges are collected through the hospital in-patient enquiry &ndash; HIPE &ndash; system which covers all publicly funded acute hospitals and mortality data are collected by the Central Statistics Office. The following table sets out statistics for 1997 showing the number of hospital discharges and the number of deaths registered for conditions regarded as smoking related. Full year data for 1998 are not yet available. A total of 58,397 hospitalisations and 15,961 deaths fall into this category representing 14 per cent of all public acute hospital discharges &ndash; overnight in-patients only are included in this category &ndash; and 50 per cent of all deaths. Caution should be exercised in the interpretation of these figures since they include all hospitalisations and deaths from the specified illnesses irrespective of whether they were due to smoking.</P>
      <P>In the publication Mortality from Smoking in Developed Countries 1950-2000 by Richard Peto and others it is estimated that in 1995 20 per cent of all deaths in Ireland could be attributed to smoking. Similar proportions are not available for morbidity, and it is therefore not possible to estimate with any precision the share of hospitalisations for smoking related illnesses which are due either directly or indirectly to smoking.</P>
      <P>Number of Discharges from Publicly Funded Acute Hospitals and Number of Deaths Registered for Conditions Regarded as Smoking Related, 1997.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>No tribunal of inquiry was established in the 1970s to examine an alleged link between brain damage and three-in-one vaccination. Concerns had been expressed at that time in relation to an alleged link between the whooping cough component of the three-in-one vaccine and the occurrence of brain damage in children. In response to these concerns an expert medical group on whooping cough vaccination was established in 1977 by the then Minister for Health to examine persons who, it was claimed, had been permanently damaged by whooping cough vaccination, to review the medical information available in relation to them and to indicate whether, in its opinion, the damage was attributable to the vaccination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The group was completely independent of the Department of Health in assessing cases. At the outset, it recognised that it would be impossible to prove conclusively in any case whether a person had been damaged by the whooping cough <Col N="1460" /> vaccine. Consequently, the group came to its conclusions on the balance of probability in individual cases. Where there was a reasonable doubt in any case, the group gave the benefit of the doubt to that person.</P>
    <P>The group found that in 16 of the 93 cases which presented themselves to the group, there was a reasonable probability that the vaccine was responsible for damage. An<i> ex gratia</i> payment was offered in each of these 16 cases. The group did not produce a report, other than a finding in each individual case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that a Charter of Rights for Hospital Patients was introduced in August 1992. It provides guidelines for good standards of practice in acute hospitals. Although the charter has no statutory basis, its objective is to ensure that the health service becomes more responsive to the needs of the individual patient and that there is a code of practice available which sets out what patients have a right to expect when they make use of hospital services.</P>
      <P>On the specific issue of the scheduling of appointments, section 2 of the charter states that:</P>
      <P>You have the right, when your family doctor refers you to hospital for an out-patient appointment, to receive confirmation within a reasonable time of the date of your first appointment; be given an individual appointment time; be seen by a consultant or senior doctor on your first appointment. You have the right, should your appointment at an out-patient department be cancelled by the hospital, to receive adequate and timely notice of such cancellation and to be given a new appointment on a priority basis.</P>
      <P>In this regard, my Department has recently asked all acute hospitals to indicate if they are allocating out-patient appointment times in accordance with the standards specified in the charter. I would expect that the question of allocating more suitable appointment times for patients who have to travel a distance will be looked at as part of their review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Minister for Health and Children, I am very concerned about the issue of equity of access for patients. Therefore, I would like to draw the <Col N="1462" /> Deputy's attention to an example of my Department's efforts in this area. The national cancer strategy places particular emphasis on reducing regional imbalances and, since taking office, I have made £19.5 million available under the strategy. The extra resources are being used for additional cancer treatment services, both in terms of staff and facilities, so that patients can, as much as possible, be treated within their own region.</P>
    <P>The development of mechanisms for improvements in patient advocacy is an important task for my Department and, in this regard, my objective is to provide a patient focused service, within which the priority must be equity of access to high quality of care, based on clinical need. The patients' charter was an important step in developing awareness of patients' rights and I intend to develop a comprehensive policy which will build on the good standards of practice which the charter provides.</P>

The health board's proposal is for a dispersed model of service around the four acute hospitals and the use of district hospital beds throughout the board's area.</P>
      <P>I understand that it is the policy of the South-Eastern Health Board that most patients in need of palliative care will be cared for at home or as near to home as possible. The existing palliative care service and the hospice-home care service within the board are very well integrated between the voluntary supported hospice nurses and the board's own professional staff. The health board is currently in the process of recruiting a consultant in palliative care and the hospice-home care service will come under his-her direction.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The new drug payment scheme, which will come into effect on 1 July 1999, replaces the drug refund scheme and the drug cost subsidisation scheme and is designed as a more patient friendly scheme with significant advantages over the existing schemes for the following reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the drug refund scheme, families and individuals pay the full cost of their prescription medicines and may, at the end of the quarter, claim reimbursement from their health board of expenditure over £90 in that calendar quarter. Many families and individuals have very heavy expenditure on drugs and medicines in a quarter and have to wait a further six weeks from the end of that quarter before they receive a refund. This can cause considerable cash flow problems for a significant number of families and individuals. This will not happen under the new drug payment scheme. From the introduction of the new scheme, no individual or family will have to pay more than £42 per month for prescribed medicines. It means that families and individuals will, for the first time, be able to budget for the cost <Col N="1464" /> of medicines. Families and individuals will know that, whatever the size of their drugs bill, they will not have to pay more than £42 per month. In addition, there are families where, although one member may qualify for a drug cost subsidisation scheme card, combined expenditure on medicines by other members, which can be considerable, cannot be recouped until the end of the quarter. With the new drug payment scheme, no family will have to pay more than £42 in any month for prescribed medicines. The new scheme will be of significant benefit to such families.</P>
    <P>The fact that the drug payment scheme will operate on a monthly basis has distinct advantages over the current drug refund scheme. Under the drug refund scheme, a family or an individual could, for example in one month have expenditure of say £80 but no expenditure in the other two months. They would not have been entitled to a refund. Under the new scheme, they will only have to pay £42 in that month.</P>
    <P>There are no qualifying criteria for inclusion in the new drug payment scheme. Where expenditure by a family or an individual exceeds £42 per month on prescribed medicines, the balance will be met by the State. This is in contrast to the old drug cost subsidisation scheme where patients had to be certified by their doctor as suffering from a condition requiring ongoing expenditure on medicines in excess of £32 per month.</P>
    <P>The new scheme will be easier to use than the drug refund scheme and will be more inclusive than the drug cost subsidisation scheme bringing overall benefits to a greater number of people. While I have no plans to review the proposals at this stage, I will monitor the scheme in operation.</P>

      <P>The national general practice information technology group was established in the autumn of 1997. The establishment of the group arose from the desire to ensure the strategic development of information technology in general practice and to avoid duplication of effort among the various parties involved in supporting general practice computerisation.</P>
      <P>Its specific terms of reference were determined by the group itself. They are to provide a national forum which allows for the sharing of ideas and information and the making of recommendations and preparation of guidelines on matters relating to the development of all aspects of information technology in general practice, including, in particular, electronic linkages with other health care providers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1467" /> The group is composed of representatives from: the general medical services and systems divisions of the Department of Health and Children; the health boards; the GMS (Payments) Board; Beaumont, St. Vincent's, St. James's and the Mater Hospital, Dublin; and the Irish College of General Practitioners. The group also has a full-time contracted national development officer appointed from an open competition. The group operates through a number of subgroups dealing with particular matters. Currently subgroups are active in the following areas, namely, training, software accreditation, coding and messaging.</P>
    <P>The group has not produced any reports to date. It has, however, launched a major training plan for IT for general practitioners which is currently being piloted in the Eastern and Midland Health Board areas. In the other areas referred to above, the various subgroups are working towards the making of various procedures and guidelines which it is proposed will then be nationally adopted.</P>

      <P>It is estimated that the current national level of computerisation is over 70 per cent and that figure represents an increase from the 64 per cent estimated level at the end of 1997.</P>
      <P>Ideally, I would like to see the records of all general practitioners computerised and my Department together with the general practice units in the health boards keeps the matter under ongoing review. It is clear that quality of usage rather than simple incidence of computerisation among GPs is the most important consideration. Accordingly, my Department and the health boards, through the national general practice information technology group, are funding a national training programme for all GPs.</P>
      <P>The programme, which is currently being piloted in the Eastern and Midland Health Board areas, is being delivered by the Irish College of General Practitioners. In that way, it is offering relevant computer training for GPs by GPs which it is felt will have a positive impact on GP response to the programme. The programme will be fully reviewed at the end of its pilot phase &ndash; that is, the autumn of this year &ndash; to establish its effectiveness.</P>

It is also represented on the interdepartmental committee subsequently established to evaluate, cost and prioritise the proposals in the report and the child care proposals in An Action Programme for the Millennium, the report of the Commission on the Family and the report of the Forum on Early Childhood Education. This committee, which is chaired by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, has been asked to report within a time-frame of six months.</P>
      <P>The expert group endorsed European targets which refer to the educational element of child care. The group also recognised in its report that the needs and rights of children should be a primary consideration and that care and education are inextricably linked elements in a child's holistic development. I am certain that this focus will be continued by the interdepartmental committee.</P>

      <P>The consultants' report on assessment for inter-country adoption shows that the Southern Health Board has the highest level of applications for adoption of all health boards, with 23 per cent of first applications for inter-country adoption coming to this board in 1998. The number of couples currently on the waiting list in the Southern Health Board area is 160 of whom 17 are from Kerry. The board, in recognition of the increasing waiting list, recently appointed three additional social workers to the adoption service, bringing the total number of staff employed in the service to 6.5, with 1.5 of these based in Kerry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am currently examining the recommendations of the consultants' report on assessment for inter-country adoption. The consultants propose a wide range of measures, including a standardised framework for inter-country adoption assessment. I will be following up on these recommend<Col N="1472" /> ations with the health boards and I am confident that their implementation will result in a more efficient and effective adoption service.</P>

      <P>House price statistics compiled by individual lending institutions from their own transactions can only provide a partial analysis of market trends. However, the latest figures published by First Active for the first quarter of 1999, which suggest house price increases of 2 per cent nationally and of 1.7 per cent in Dublin, seem to confirm a trend of moderation in house price increases that has been evident since the latter part of 1998. The general consensus is that the Government actions have played a key role in this moderation of house price increases. As the Government's measures to accelerate housing supply have increasing effect, I expect to see consolidation of price stabilisation and the establishment of a pattern of balanced housing growth into the medium term.</P>

      <P>This dispute, which I understand has now ended, does not appear to have had a significant effect on housing output. In fact, new house completions in the first quarter of 1999 are 24 per cent higher than in the same period last year and in Dublin, where output had been relatively sluggish in recent years, completions are 28 per cent higher. This trend, coming after record output of 42,349 housing units in 1998, indicates that significant progress is being made in increasing housing supply which is the key element of the Government's strategy to meet increased demand and secure house price stabilisation.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 252, 253 and 254 together.</P>
      <P>The salary of Mr. Justice Flood is being paid, as is the case with all judicial salaries, allowances and pensions, from the Central Fund. Mr. Justice Flood is not being paid any additional allowances in respect of his work for the tribunal, other than out of pocket expenses which he may incur.</P>
      <P>Total expenditure by my Department in relation to the tribunal up to 14 May 1999 was £3,516,902. This is made up of administrative costs and legal fees. Of this, £1,399,953 relates to administrative costs, broken down into £245,427 in respect of staffing costs and £1,154,526 on day to day running costs.</P>
      <P>Legal fees to date amount to £2,116,949 in total, including fees to counsel, the legal research assistant and solicitors, other than the salary of the solicitor assigned by the Chief State Solicitor's Office which is carried by that office. The following figures are the gross amounts, inclusive of VAT and withholding tax, paid to individual counsel up to 14 May 1999 &ndash; £462,634, £450,556, £357,191, £257,004, £155,896 and £201,949.</P>
      <P>Over 1,000 payments in relation to administrative costs of the tribunal have been processed by my Department to date. The total costs incurred by the tribunal involve expenditure on a wide range of matters, including, for example, legal searches, specialist services, office equipment, postage and telecommunication costs, couriers, catering, cleaning, etc.</P>
      <P>The tribunal is an independent body established pursuant to a resolution of the Houses of the Oireachtas and its activities are funded through my Department's Vote, out of which the tribunal is put in funds and costs incurred and properly certified are paid. This is, of course, subject to audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General. The tribunal's terms of reference passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas require the tribunal to carry out its preliminary investigations in private. The identification of individual persons, agents and institutions to which payments have been made could, therefore, compromise the business of the tribunal and it would not, therefore, be appropriate to publish the details requested.</P>

      <P>I am fully aware that An Bord Pleanála has, to an increased extent, not been able to meet its statutory objective to determine planning appeals within four months. The delay in disposing of appeals is due to the very substantial increase in the number of appeals coming before the board, reflecting the high level of activity in the national economy. My reply to Question No. 142 of 24 March 1999 outlined the various actions taken by my Department and the board to deal with delays and improve the time performance of the board. The board has assured me that it is taking all possible steps to speed up the staff recruitment process. In this regard, six additional consultants were appointed by the board last week. It is anticipated that five full-time planners will commence work with the board within the next six weeks. Interviews are scheduled over the next fortnight to recruit a further five additional full-time planners. Measures are also in place to fill administrative posts. It is a policy of the board to give priority to appeals relating to large scale residential &ndash; i.e. greater than 50 dwellings &ndash; and other major employment generating projects and the board has taken specific measures with a view to expediting such appeals. In consultation with the board, I will continue to keep the situation under review in the light of the trend in the volume of appeals and the board's performance.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to the reply to Question No. 35 of 27 April 1999 which sets out the position generally on the matter. The first local authority site for the system &ndash; Wexford motor tax office &ndash; will become <Col N="1478" /> operational during the summer. Once the system is proven it is intended to implement it as quickly as possible at all other 28 motor tax offices, and for this to take place over an 18 month period. As the planning for this aspect of the project has not yet been finalised, I am not in a position to give the Deputy a precise date for Limerick County Council within this general timescale.</P>

      <P>The quorum for a meeting of An Bord Pleanála under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1983, is three. When a decision is made by the members attending a meeting of the board, one of the members present will sign the decision. The board's procedures are such that no single person can ensure what the board's decision will be in a particular appeal.</P>
      <P>Most decisions are taken by a board meeting consisting of three members. It is a matter for the chairman of the board to decide whether a meeting of all members of the board is necessary where a particularly complex or sensitive case is involved. Last year 4,548 appeals were received by the board and it would clearly be inefficient to require that the full board should decide each appeal. Therefore I have no plans to amend the planning legislation as suggested by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>One of the qualifying conditions for entitlement to maternity benefit is that the woman's employer must certify that she is entitled to maternity leave under the Maternity Protection Act, 1994. Accordingly, entitlement to maternity benefit is contingent, in the first instance, on the woman being entitled to maternity leave.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the Maternity Protection Act, 1994, a pregnant worker who has entered into or works under a contract of employment is entitled to 14 weeks unpaid maternity leave from her employer, at least four of which must be taken immediately before the baby is due and four weeks immediately after the baby is born. The balance of six weeks can be taken at the woman's discretion.</P>
      <P>Where a woman finishes working and is no longer under a contract of employment, she is not normally entitled to maternity leave under the provisions of the Maternity Protection Act. However, as a woman can take up to a maximum of ten weeks maternity leave before the baby is due, if the baby is due within ten weeks of finishing work, it is possible for her employer to certify her as being entitled to maternity leave. Provided she has the necessary PRSI contributions, the woman will also be eligible for maternity benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case in question, the woman, who is a part-time teacher, finished her contract in June 1998. As her baby was due in November 1998, i.e, 23 weeks after she finished her contract, she was not entitled to maternity leave under the provisions of the Maternity Protection Act. Accordingly, she does not qualify for maternity benefit. However, the woman concerned qualified for unemployment benefit during the period since her contract expired in June 1998 up to January <Col N="1480" /> 1999. She has made further claims for unemployment benefit in February and again in March.</P>
    <P>I am already aware of the problems relating to entitlement to maternity benefit in cases such as that raised by the Deputy and, indeed, in similar cases where women are engaged in seasonal employment. However, as these matters also concern the woman's entitlement to maternity leave in the first instance, I have brought them to the attention of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform for consideration in the context of the review he is carrying out arising from the commitment in An Action Programme for the Millennium for the review and improvement of maternity protection legislation.</P>
    <P>I should point out that any proposals to extend maternity benefit entitlement to additional categories such as seasonal workers would have cost implications and would have to be considered in a budgetary context, in the light of available resources.</P>

      <P>The farm assist scheme came into operation on 7 April 1999. To allow potential claimants sufficient time to submit applications, any person who applies on or before 31 May will have their entitlement backdated to the commencement date of the scheme. To date over 700 new applications have been received and are being processed. Persons in receipt of small holder's unemployment assistance, pre-retirement allowance or disability allowance with means from farming also have the option of applying for farm assist. In the case of existing small holders it is possible that, where a means review has not taken place for a number of years and there has been a change in the person's circumstances, a reduced payment will apply. This can arise in any event as circumstances change and is independent of the introduction of the farm assist scheme.</P>
      <P>In view of the fact that new applications are being processed it is not possible at this time to provide details as to the amounts which will be paid. Farm assist is a practical response by the Government to the situation of low income farmers. In bringing forward the start date from the original target of June to early April, the Government recognised the need for an urgent response to the problem in this regard.</P>

      <Quest>if the introduction of the farm assist scheme will have a bearing on pension rights for farmers when they reach old age pension age in view of the fact that under this scheme they are no longer required to sign on and will no longer be receiving a credit contribution.</Quest>

      <P>The position with regard to pension rights for claimants of the new farm assist scheme does not differ from that which applied in relation to the unemployment (smallholder's) assistance scheme.</P>
      <P>The fact that farm assist claimants will no longer have to sign on the live register has no bearing on this position. The conditions for the award of credited contributions in respect of farmers claiming farm assist will be exactly the same as those which currently apply to unemployment assistance. Farmers transferring from unemployment (smallholder's) assistance to farm assist and who were previously entitled to credited contributions will, therefore, continue to be so entitled. These farmers, together with any new claimants who are entitled to credited contributions, will now be awarded those credited contributions in respect of contribution weeks rather than days of unemployment.</P>
      <P>With regard to the PRSI position of farmers, claimants of the farm assist payment will, in the same way as claimants of unemployment (smallholder's) assistance, be treated as an excepted category for PRSI purposes in respect of their income from self-employment. This measure was put in place in the Social Welfare Act, 1999 to ensure that the position of the existing unemployment (smallholder's) assistance claimants would be maintained when they transferred to farm assist.</P>
      <P>However, farmers who had been paying Class S &ndash; self-employment &ndash; PRSI contributions before they claimed unemployment (smallholder's) assistance were no longer able to pay these contributions. This continues to be the position when farmers who were hitherto paying Class S contributions now claim farm assist. While it remains open to them to apply to become voluntary PRSI contributors in order to maintain their social insurance records, I recognise that this may not be the most appropriate option. My Department will be reviewing the position to determine whether other arrangements can be put in place.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 268 to 273, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>My Department wrote recently to 11,700 disability benefit recipients who are being paid by pension book advising them of the transfer of administration of their claims from the Department's Longford office to Dublin. Over 20,000 such claims were transferred some years ago from cheque payment to pension book payment, as a temporary measure, pending the establishment of my Department's integrated short-term schemes &ndash; ISTS &ndash; computer system. This system has now been in operation for some time and it was decided to transfer these claims back to the original payment system and consolidate the administration of all disability benefit claims in one location and on one computer system. This will ensure better customer service and better management of the disability benefit system.</P>
      <P>The ISTS computer system offers the customer a range of weekly payment methods such as electronic funds transfer &ndash; EFT &ndash; direct to a bank or building society account or to a nominated account; cheque payment to the home address; or post-draft payable at the post office. The system does not support pension book payment.</P>
      <P>Disability benefit payments generally are made by cheque or EFT and originally it was proposed that the long-term payments would be paid in the same way. However, in view of concerns which were expressed it was decided to offer the opting of payment by post-draft where people wish to continue payment at post offices.</P>
      <P>There are currently 43,500 disability benefit claims in payment, including those claims which have recently been transferred from Longford. Some 11,000 of those claims are currently being paid by pension book with the remainder being paid by cheque or EFT. The average cost of the various payment methods varies; post-drafts and pension books cost 80p per transaction, cheques cost 50p per transaction, and EFT costs 3p per transaction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Customers currently being paid by pension book have been asked to state which of the above payment methods they would prefer. Replies <Col N="1484" /> have not yet been received in most cases, so it is not possible at this stage to quantify the savings involved.</P>
    <P>An Post was advised of the forthcoming change in administrative practices for those being paid disability benefit by pension book.</P>

    <P>A widow's and widower's non-contributory pension is available to those, without children, who do not qualify for the contributory pension. This is payable subject to a means test. From June, the maximum rate of the widow(er)'s non-contributory pension &ndash; at £78.50 for those over 66 years of age &ndash; will be 109 per cent of the commission's recommended rate.</P>
    <P>Title to these pensions also gives access to the free schemes, where appropriate. Special measures are in place to ensure that households do not suffer the loss of entitlements following the death of a spouse. Widows-widowers aged from 60 to 65 whose late spouses had been in receipt of the free schemes retain that entitlement.</P>
    <P>A one-parent family payment is available to those widows-widowers, with children, who do not qualify for a contributory widow's-widower's pension. This payment is available to men and women who are parenting alone and it is designed to, first, provide basic income support, taking into account the special needs and requirements of single parents and, second, to encourage lone parents to return to the workforce so that, over time, they can achieve a greater degree of economic independence.</P>
    <P>To this end, an earnings disregard of £115.38 per week is available under the one-parent family payment means test to those lone parents in employment.</P>
    <P>There is no consensus internationally about the best way to estimate the needs of one type of household over another. A number of different methods have been explored but, given the uncertainties about which method produces the most satisfactory results, one cannot rely heavily on any particular set of scales now available in analysing poverty or income inequality.</P>
    <P>The Economic and Social Research Institute is currently undertaking some analysis in this area for the working group examining the treatment of married, cohabiting and one-parent households under the tax and social welfare systems. It is planned to publish this report by mid-year.</P>
    <P>The question of future improvements in social welfare provisions for widows and widowers &ndash; as for all social welfare clients &ndash; is a matter for consideration by the Government in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>Prior to 1953 different types of contributions were payable &ndash; national health insurance, widow's and orphan's pension and unemployment insurance contributions &ndash; which gave specific entitlement only to the benefits of the schemes under which they were paid. The unified system of social insurance was introduced in 1953 and the first major extension to the range of contingencies covered came in 1961 with the introduction of the old age (contributory) pension scheme.</P>
      <P>While contributions paid prior to 1961 contained no pension element, it was decided to count all such contributions paid under the unified scheme towards qualification for the new pension. Special transitional arrangements were also made for people who were close to reaching pension age at that time, which permitted certain contributions paid before 1953 to be taken into account for satisfying the yearly average test.</P>
      <P>In addition, provision was made for pre-1953 contributions, paid under the National Health Insurance Acts, to be taken into account for the purposes of satisfying two of the qualifying contribution conditions for the old age (contributory) pension, namely, that a person must (i) have entered insurance at least ten years before pension age and (ii) have, at least, 156 contributions paid. This arrangement still applies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have often stated my commitment to ensuring that contributory pension coverage is as widely available as possible. In this regard, a detailed review is now under way by the Department of the contribution conditions applying to the old age (contributory) and retirement pensions, <Col N="1487" /> including the possible use of contributions paid prior to 1953. This is a particularly complex exercise with issues of equity and redistribution within the social welfare system to be examined.</P>
    <P>In undertaking this review I consider it important that the Department hears the views of older people, and in that context, the Department is consulting the main groups representing the interests of older people. I will report to the House on the outcome of the review which will, in the normal course, be publicly available when it has been considered by the Government.</P>

      <P>The 1999 budget provides for an increase of £6 per week for old age pensioners and £3 a week for their spouses with effect from the beginning of June. These increases will mean that in the two years since taking office, the Government has moved half way towards meeting its commitment to increase the old age contributory pension to £100 per week over its five year term.</P>
      <P>The question of future increases in social welfare payments, including the timing of these increases, are matters to be examined in a budgetary context in the light of available resources and having regard to the Government's other priorities.</P>

      <Quest>the proposals, if any, he has to bring the method of assessment of return on savings in relation to non-contributory old age pension in line with actual deposit interest rates; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>It would not be feasible to assess means from capital on the basis of actual returns from investments, as this would necessitate frequent reviews of entitlements of a very significant number of recipients whenever interest rates fluctuated or the capital was moved into a different investment option. For this reason a notional value is ascribed to the capital owned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the formula for the notional assessment of capital includes rates of 7.5 per cent and 15 per cent the actual effective assessment rates are much lower. For example, a single pensioner can have capital of up to £6,160 and a couple can have capital of up to £12,320 and still qualify for the maximum rate of old age (non-contributory) pension. In addition, a couple with capital of £20,000 would only be assessed with means of £600, giving an effective assessment rate of just 3 per cent. As only 2-4 per cent of pensioners have capital in <Col N="1488" /> excess of £20,000, this means that the effective assessment rates for the vast majority of pensioners are very much lower than the 7.5 per cent and 15 per cent rates which are used in the notional assessment formula.</P>
    <P>The current system is designed to ensure that those with modest amounts of capital receive the greater share of available support, while the small proportion of people with larger amounts of capital should avail of it to contribute, at least partially, towards meeting their needs.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, the Department is reviewing the system in the light of the interest rates currently available on investments. However, it should be noted that simply reducing the assessment rates of 7.5 per cent and 15 per cent down to the current levels of interest available on bank deposit accounts would disproportionately benefit those who are well off and this consideration was among those informing the decision of the previous Government to set the assessment rates at their present levels.</P>

      <P>The family mediation service is a State funded, professional, confidential service which enables couples, who have decided to separate or who have already separated, to negotiate their own separation agreement in a non-adversarial way. Family mediation aims to assist couples to reach agreement on all issues in relation to their separation, including financial provision, the family home and property and parenting arrangements for the children so that ongoing close relationships with both parents are made possible for the children.</P>
      <P>The family mediation service was extended for the first time to Cork in mid-October 1998. The service has been temporarily located at Plunkett Chambers, 21-23 Oliver Plunkett Street, Cork.</P>
      <P>A total of 16 couples attended the centre from the time of its opening in mid-October until the end of 1998; a further five couples from the Cork region attended the family mediation service centre in Limerick during 1998. There was no waiting list for the service in Cork in 1998. This year, demand for the service has grown with a greater awareness about what mediation can offer. Couples seeking to avail of the service in Cork receive their first appointment within two to three weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The nationwide expansion of the family mediation service is a key priority in the programme for Government, An Action Programme for the Millennium. Since last year the Government has radically expanded the service which is <Col N="1489" /> now available from regional centres as well as in Dublin and Limerick. The service handled approximately 250 cases annually up to the end of 1997. In 1998, as a result of the expansion of the service, 524 new couples were seen.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the decision which I took to allow turf cutting for domestic purposes to be phased out over ten years in raised bogs, proposed as special areas of conservation. While decisions such as this are within the competence of the member state, the Minister of State at my Department and I discussed the matter in January last with officials of DG-XI who raised no objections nor suggested any restrictions.</P>

      <P>I am aware of occasional comments to the effect that the resources for the National Gallery are not sufficient. The most recent refurbishment of the gallery gave rise to a need for additional attendant staff and such staff was appointed. As a result the gallery now has a complement of attendant staff which allows for all of the rooms to be open to the public in the normal course of events. However, due to staff absences from time to time, occasionally rooms have to be closed on a temporary basis.</P>
      <P>My Department has ongoing consultation with the management of the gallery concerning the overall staffing situation and the Deputy will appreciate that many of our national cultural institutions, including the National Gallery, have suffered historically from a lower level of resources than I would wish to see provided. I am constantly working to improve the situation in all our national cultural institutions.</P>

      <P>I am assuming the <Col N="1494" /> Deputy is referring to the phased designation of special areas of conservation (SACs).</P>
      <P>In 1997 Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department, published a list of over 200 proposed SACs which, in general, contain priority habitats listed in the EU Habitats Directive (92/43/EEC). I anticipate that more than 100 additional proposed SACs, largely containing non-priority habitat types, will be published in June and that a third list containing marine habitats will be published in late 1999 or early 2000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of liaison committees was to improve the flow of information between my Department and land holders in proposed SACs. The staff of Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department, have so far arranged well over 100 meetings in all parts of the country, and the process is ongoing. To date 40 committees have been established by landowners. In 35 cases, it appears that there is a requirement to have a further meeting in order to establish a committee and in a further 33 locations there has been no success yet in setting up a committee. My officials will continue to encourage the formation of committees in as many proposed SACs as possible.</P>
      <P>I strongly recommend that land holders participate in liaison committees as the purpose in setting them up was to fill the information gap which land holders had complained about in the ongoing and developing situation in relation to SACs. The liaison committees are intended to represent individuals, rather than organisations such as the one referred to by the Deputy. However the organisation referred to can involve itself in the process by encouraging the people it represents to attend meetings and elect committees. I am satisfied that it is in the best interests of all affected landowners to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 297 and 298 together.</P>
      <P>I am conscious of the social and economic impact that immediate cessation of turf cutting in raised bogs proposed for designation as special areas of conservation (SACs) would have on small communities and I have decided to make exceptional arrangements in the case of cutters for domestic use. Accordingly, such cutters will be given a period of up to ten years to make new arrangements.</P>
      <P>Alternatively, they may choose to cease cutting and to avail this year of the terms of the compensation package announced by me for the cessation of turf cutting in raised bogs SACs. The main provisions of this package provide for a payment of £1,300 per acre for turbary and fee simple, £1,100 per acre for turbary only and in each case, the amount of compensation will be increased by a single additional payment of £1,000 where the applicant agrees to cease cutting turf before the commencement of the current turf cutting season which has been notionally set at 31 May 1999. A streamlined scheme which should allow for early payment of compensation has been devised and advertised in local newspapers. Under this scheme payment of compensation will be made primarily on the basis of an affidavit sworn by the land/turbary owner or the person claiming traditional rights to turf cutting.</P>
      <P>Turf cutting in areas of bog which are outside proposed special areas of conservation may continue as before.</P>
      <P>The REP scheme is the responsibility of the Department of Agriculture and Food. My Department is involved in agreeing farming prescriptions for conservation of particular habitats under supplementary measure A of the revised REP scheme. Prescriptions for raised bogs will be agreed following consultation with farming interests.</P>

      <P>The Trustee (Authorised Investments) Act, 1958 provides for the designation of investments in which trust funds, including money under the control or subject to the order of any court, may be invested. Section 2 of the Act of 1958 provides that the Minister for Finance may by order vary by addition or deletion the investments in which trust funds may be invested. A new list of investments in which trust funds may be invested was set out in the Trustee (Authorised Investments) Order 1998. It contains general categories of securities, deposits, collective investment schemes, life assurance contracts and equities.</P>
      <P>It is a matter for a court to decide, within the provisions of the Act of 1958 and any order made thereunder by the Minister for Finance, the appropriate investment in respect of any moneys under its control. I have no function in the matter. I understand, however, that while courts seek to get the best possible return on investments they are also very conscious of the need to make safe investments. I also understand that the Registrar of Wards of Court, when making investment decisions in respect of a ward, invites recommendations from the Committee of the Estate of the Ward.</P>
      <P>The working group on a courts commission recommended, in their third report, that the courts service should establish a comprehensive financial structure for management of all financial affairs of the courts, which would include investment management. I expect to be in a position to make the necessary order formally establishing the courts service later this year and I will bring to the attention of the board the issue of investment policy.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that I have recently provided additional resources for this office to meet work backlogs. I expect that the question of resources for this office will also be reviewed by the incoming board in the light of its assessment of requirements for the office.</P>

      <P>The selection criteria for the recruitment of Garda trainees are prescribed by regulation and are reviewed on an ongoing basis by my Department.</P>
      <P>With regard to the requirement for leaving certificate Irish, this element of the minimum educational qualifications was last reviewed and revised in 1997 following a significant restructuring of the leaving certificate programme and the introduction of Irish at foundation level for leaving certificate students. There are no plans to abolish Irish or make it an optional requirement for Garda recruitment. Members of the Garda Síochána are required to provide a broad and increasing range of services to all sections of society and may be called upon at any time to communicate with the public in Irish, either orally or in writing.</P>
      <P>The minimum educational qualifications are not the only prerequisite for entry to the Garda college. Applicants must be successful in a competition, comprising written tests and a competitive interview, conducted by the Civil Service Commission on behalf of the Garda Commissioner. These selection procedures are underpinned by a professional job analysis led by consultants with expertise in occupational psychology and completed in 1997 to ensure that the procedures are job-related and assess candidates for those competencies required for effective performance in the job of garda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regard both the minimum educational requirements and the Civil Service Commission <Col N="1504" /> selection procedures as being important in the overall recruitment process.</P>
    <P>The Civil Service Commission is an independent statutory agency with proven expertise in recruitment selection. The SMI report of the steering group on the efficiency and effectiveness of the Garda Síochána published in late December 1997 examined human resource management, including recruitment, in An Garda Síochána and recommended that the role of the Civil Service Commission in garda recruitment remain unchanged.</P>

      <P>However, the information requested by the Deputy for the years 1992 to 1999 is set out in the following tabular statement. It should be noted that many of the applicants referred to failed to produce adequate documentary evidence of identity. This creates a particular difficulty when a region becomes recognised as a war zone to which forced repatriations are not going to happen. This would be the case with Kosovo. It is, of course, true that many refugees historically have been undocumented.</P>

      <P>The executive chairman of the Irish Sports Council and his team are currently working with the martial arts sporting organisations with the objective of achieving an appropriate structure for the future development of martial arts in Ireland. The national coaching and training centre is facilitating the process through a joint planning group representative of the Irish Martial Arts Commission, the Irish Taekwondo Union and the Official National Amateur Karate Association of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is expected that, on successful completion of this process, the martial arts organisations will be in a position to prepare and submit a joint proposal to the Irish Sports Council seeking formal recognition for funding purposes within the context of the requirements for such recognition. Under the recently enacted Irish Sports Council legislation, responsibility for such matters comes within the council's statutory remit, including consideration of any application emerging from <Col N="1507" /> the process currently under way with the martial arts organisations.</P>

      <P>My Department also provides a remote area transport grant for pupils who reside outside of the range of school transport services.

      <P>My Department's involvement in pre-school provision is largely confined to the early start pre-school pilot programme which is focused on areas of particular disadvantage. The 55 pre-school classes which currently operate within this programme cater for up to 15 pupils in the morning class and a further 15 in the afternoon class.</P>
      <P>There is no specific pupil teacher ratio applicable to infant classes generally in the primary system. The overall pupil teacher ratio in primary schools currently stands at 21:2. This will be further reduced in the next school year arising from the substantial improvements in staffing levels which I recently announced.</P>
      <P>A special reduced pupil teacher ratio of 15:1 is applicable to the junior classes of schools participating in the urban element of the breaking the cycle pilot scheme. Where necessary, additional staffing resources are made available to the schools in question to enable them to operate within this 15:1 ratio. Schools included in the urban element of the breaking the cycle pilot scheme, in common with all schools which have disadvantaged status, are also entitled to operate a maximum class size of 29:1 for classes generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1998, I convened a national forum on early childhood education. My objective in holding this forum was to allow all groups with an interest in this area to put forward their views as to how best to coordinate and support the future develop<Col N="1510" /> ment of early childhood education services. The question of staff to child ratios was one of the issues addressed in the forum discussions.</P>
    <P>The report on the outcome of the forum is currently being considered in my Department as part of the preparation of a White Paper on early childhood education. The White Paper will set out my proposals for future development of services in this area. The question of pupil teacher ratios for children in junior classes will be among the issues addressed in the White Paper.</P>

      <P>The Health and Safety Authority is the body with national responsibility for health and safety matters. At the beginning of 1996, the authority issued a report of the advisory committee on occupational safety and health at first and second level schools. This advisory committee included representatives of the partners in education, my Department and other interests. While this report did not identify bullying of teachers as a widespread issue, I am very concerned by recent reports of bullying and other threats to the health and safety of teachers. Teachers like other employees are entitled to feel safe and protected from all forms of bullying and intimidation in their working environment.</P>
      <P>Under the health and safety legislation, school managerial authorities in their role as employers are responsible for ensuring the safety and health of their employees. This duty requires the drawing up a safety statement for the school in consultation with those at risk. The statement should identify potential hazards and assess the risks to health and safety.</P>
      <P>Bullying should be considered as a potential hazard and assessed accordingly. Where there is a risk to health and safety from bullying, school based measures should be devised to prevent and deal with such behaviour and create awareness within the school that bullying behaviour is unacceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1511" /> We know that bullying thrives in an atmosphere of uncertainty and secrecy in which the victim often feels a sense of hopelessness and futility against the power exercised by the bully. A high degree of collective vigilance is needed throughout the school community if bullying behaviour is to be identified and firmly dealt with.</P>
    <P>My Department has recently completed consultations with teacher unions and management bodies concerning guidelines for second level schools on the issue of violence in schools. The guidelines outline the duty of school management authorities to provide a safe environment for employees and other persons present in the school and the measures to be taken to prevent or minimise the risk of assaults to teachers and other school staff. The guidelines also give guidance regarding the measures to be taken in support of staff who have been assaulted or threatened with assault. The guidelines emphasise the importance of developing a fair and efficient code of behaviour in schools to assist in the promotion of good relations between teachers, pupils and parents. Arrangements are now being made for the issue of the guidelines to all second level schools. Similar guidelines have already issued to primary schools.</P>
    <P>I am open to submissions from teacher and other school staff interests on the specific issue of bullying of teachers and if there is a need to address the issue further in the form of guidance to school management, I will do so in consultation with the partners and the Health and Safety Authority.</P>

      <P>The staffing of primary schools is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year. This is in accordance with guidelines agreed between this Department and the education partners.</P>
      <P>The current staffing of Sancta Maria CBS is a principal and eight mainstream class teachers based on an enrolment of 245 as at 30 September 1997. The school has also been allocated a disadvantaged concessionary teacher, a full-time home-school-community liaison co-ordinator and a remedial teacher. The enrolment as at 30 September 1998, on which the staffing for the 1999-2000 school year is based, was 208 and, unfortunately, does not meet the retention requirements for the seventh and eighth mainstream class teachers. Therefore, I regret that there is no basis whereby the school can retain these posts in the next school year.</P>
      <P>I should point out that this school also has two additional teachers in special classes, which are sanctioned on a temporary basis, for pupils with a mild general learning disability.</P>
      <P>Also, I am aware that the school has applied for a support teacher, formerly known as teacher counsellor. The operation of the support teacher project is being closely monitored by my Department's inspectorate. I have received an evaluation report on the project which I am currently considering. The question of any further expansion of this pilot project will be addressed following consideration of the evaluation report. I can assure the Deputy that the needs of Sancta Maria CBS will be fully considered in the context of any expansion of the support teacher project.</P>

      <P>The teacher/counsellor project was initiated in 1995 in response to representations made to the Department by some school principals and other personnel regarding difficulties being experienced in coping with a minority of disruptive pupils. The project was evaluated by the Department's inspectorate in March 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The persons deployed on the project work are <Col N="1514" /> fully qualified primary teachers and the project was renamed the support teacher project because this title reflects their qualifications and the emphasis of the work in the revised specification more accurately. The revised specification is concerned with supporting the targeted children's holistic development. Their school attainment is promoted through core curricular work. The development of the children's social and personal behaviour will be catered for through activities in the other areas of the curriculum and especially through art, crafts, music and drama. The support teachers will help the children through the activities described and children in need of counselling services will be referred to persons with appropriate professional qualifications.</P>
    <P>The schools that were included in the project in September 1998 were afforded the services because of difficulties they were experiencing in coping with disruptive and disturbed pupils.</P>
    <P>Schools address the needs of disruptive, disturbed and withdrawn pupils through the formulation of staff policies and practices for preventing and managing these behaviours. Many schools will receive further help shortly in the form of financial support for the development of such policies through the school development planning process.</P>
    <P>In January, an information meeting for principals and chairpersons of the support teacher project schools was held at which the rationale and emphasis of the project was explained and discussed. In March, a three day in-career development module for the support teachers covered the same areas and offered training and advice on the work involved. Persons attending the two gatherings were afforded time to express their views and to discuss the amended emphasis of the project. It is planned that further in-career modules will be provided for the support teachers over the next two school years and meetings between the support teachers and representatives of my Department will take place in this context.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 340 and 342 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1996, the student support schemes were extended to provide maintenance grants to undergraduate students pursuing approved third level courses in other EU member states. Prior to this, grants were only payable to students who were pursuing approved courses in the Republic and Northern Ireland. In this context and following discussions with the local authorities regarding the necessary administrative arrangements, it was agreed that students pursuing approved courses in other EU member states, including <Col N="1516" /> Northern Ireland, would be paid the value of the grant in the currency of the country in which they were studying and that the value of the maintenance grant to be paid in all circumstances would be the Irish value converted to the currency of the country in which the student is pursuing his or her course. Previously, students studying in Northern Ireland were paid the amount of the grant in sterling, without reference to exchange rates. Those students studying in Northern Ireland who were assessed under the student support schemes prior to 1996 continue to receive their grants in sterling, without reference to exchange rates. Students who commenced their studies from 1996 are paid under the revised arrangements. While I appreciate that the current exchange rates do not favour grant holders who are studying in Britain or Northern Ireland, I believe that these arrangements are equitable and efficient.</P>
    <P>There is no provision within the student support schemes for the local authorities or vocational education committees to supplement the grant payable to students studying in Britain. Indeed, such a supplement could not be made without giving rise to an anomalous inequity <i>vis-à-vis</i> students studying elsewhere in the EU.</P>
    <P>The statistical information available for the academic year 1997-8 shows that 1,789 students were in receipt of maintenance awards under the higher education grants scheme in respect of undergraduate studies in the UK, other than in Northern Ireland, and other EU member states at a cost of £2.78 million. A breakdown of the figures for 1997-8 by local authority area is attached. The figures for the 1998-9 academic year are not yet available. Separate figures are not available for Britain. However, it is understood that the majority of grant holders studying outside of Ireland are, in fact, in Britain.</P>
    <P>The higher education grants scheme does not provide assistance towards attendance at postgraduate courses outside Ireland.</P>
    <P>The statistical information is set out in the following table:</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the major objectives of physical education, at both primary and post-primary level, is the enhancement of physical well being through involvement in healthy physical activity. Through participation in a structured physical education programme, students are provided with the knowledge and skills by which they are enabled to make informed decisions concerning issues of health and personal well being. In addition to acquiring these skills and knowledge students are encouraged to develop a positive disposition towards participation in healthful activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In primary schools, physical education has long been regarded as being capable of making an important contribution to the proper development of children. The 1971 primary school curriculum recognises the importance of this aspect of human development and sets down a comprehensive programme in physical education comprising gymnastics, games, athletics, swimming, health education and other activities. It is recommended that all primary schools devote one hour per week to the subject. In the revised primary school curriculum, which is due to be launched in the schools during the next school year, physical education will be accorded an equally high status. The revised programme will comprise six strands, namely, athletics, games, dance, gymnastics, outdoor and adventure activities and aquatics. It is proposed to implement the revised curriculum in the schools on a phased basis over a number of years. Schools will be free to introduce the revised subject areas in whatever order they wish, <Col N="1518" /> taking account of the interests and expertise of their teachers. The phased implementation of the revised curriculum will be supported by an ongoing programme of in-career development for teachers in all curricular areas, including physical education.</P>
    <P>At post-primary level physical education continues to play a central role in the education of the child. At junior cycle level a new physical education syllabus, together with support materials, is being developed. As part of this process the Department of Education and Science, in conjunction with the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, is running a major pilot project in 60 schools. This project will seek to ensure that the quality of physical education provision is improved by directing participating teachers to examine and evaluate their teaching methods and their learning outcomes for students. The findings of this project will be disseminated to teachers on a nationwide basis next year.</P>
    <P>The NCCA is also currently preparing a leaving certificate syllabus in physical education. It is proposed that students who commence their leaving certificate cycle in 2001 will have the opportunity of selecting physical education as one of their subjects for examination. This heralds a major innovation in Irish education.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 348 to 353, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>My Department provides funding towards the cost of secretarial services in primary schools under two separate schemes. Under the scheme for the employment of secretaries that was introduced in 1978, my Department meets the full cost of salary and employer's PRSI. This is the scheme under which a number of primary schools qualified for a shared secretary arrangement. However, this scheme is being phased out as posts become vacant and there is no provision for the appointment of full time secretaries in posts that are being shared.</P>
      <P>There are 16 primary schools with 400 or more pupils that are involved in a sharing arrangement with another primary school. In the circumstances outlined above, it will not be possible to sanction the appointment of an additional full-time secretary to any of these schools.</P>
      <P>Under the Programme for Economic and Social Progress, PESP, a second scheme was introduced in 1992 whereby my Department provides additional capitation grants for primary schools towards the cost of secretarial services. The PESP provided for the introduction of a phased scheme of additional capitation grants with a view to expanding the provision of secretarial services to all primary schools with 100 pupils or more.</P>
      <P>Currently, all schools of 195 pupils or more, not including schools in the 1978 scheme outlined above, qualify for a grant of £15 per pupil, to a maximum of £7,500 per annum, towards the cost of secretarial services. The grants are based on school enrolments and are paid as additions to the standard per capita grant. The level and extent of service provided is a matter for local school management who, through the discretion afforded by the scheme, apply diverse arrangements for secretarial services.</P>
      <P>I wish to assure the Deputy that I remain committed to improvements in the provision of additional assistance to schools for secretarial services. The position of schools that are currently in receipt of the maximum grant available under the PESP scheme will be examined in the context of any improvements to the scheme which may be implemented in the future.</P>

      <P>I recently announced a major new funding initiative for the education sector. As a core element of this, a total of 225 new second level teachers will be appointed this year. These new teachers will enable the extension of the home-school-community liaison scheme to all second <Col N="1522" /> level schools currently designated as disadvantaged. In the current school year, of the 762 schools at second level, 190 schools have been allocated disadvantaged posts and qualify for disadvantaged status on that basis.</P>
      <P>A study of educational disadvantage conducted by the Combat Poverty Agency and the Education Research Centre in 1996 concluded that disadvantage status should be confined to 16 per cent of the school-going population. The study noted that such status had already been granted to 17 per cent of pupils. As an alternative to extending the disadvantaged areas scheme to additional schools, the study recommended that available resources be targeted on the most disadvantaged schools.</P>
      <P>While I have no proposals at present for designating further schools as disadvantaged, I can assure the Deputy that the position of Moyle Park College will receive full consideration in the context of any future review of the disadvantaged and home-school-community liaison schemes.</P>

      <P>The way in which resources are provided to second-level schools reflects the different management and ownership arrangements for vocational schools and community colleges, community and comprehensive schools and voluntary secondary schools. Consequently, direct comparison between the different sectors is difficult.</P>
      <P>The financial allocations for vocational schools and community colleges are made to the vocational education committees as part of a block grant to cover VEC head office overheads and other activities apart from the second-level programme. Voluntary secondary schools are funded on a <i>per capita </i>basis based upon enrolments while the annual budget for community and comprehensive schools takes into account factors which vary from school to school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of the demands for increased funding by voluntary secondary schools. There are also demands for increased funding in the other sectors of education as well as demands for increased spending on other public expenditure programmes. Notwithstanding the many competing demands on budgetary resources, the level of support for voluntary secondary schools has been increased since 1997. The standard <i>per capita </i>grant payable to voluntary secondary schools has been increased to £184 from £177 and assistance towards the provision of secretarial services in schools has been increased from £25 per pupil to £30 per pupil thereby increasing the maximum <Col N="1523" /> annual grant from £8,750 to £10,500 per eligible school. In addition, these schools have benefited under the IT 2000 initiative. Schools have welcomed these improvements. It is my intention to improve further the financial position of second-level schools to the extent that the availability of resources permits.</P>
    <P>A steering group on funding is currently examining the matter of equity of funding between the various sectors at second level. Under its terms of reference, the group will draw up a recommended funding framework designed to ensure equal treatment for different schools within the second-level sector while taking account of the needs of these different schools.</P>

      <P>A transport service was established to Gaelscoil Cloch na gCoillte with effect from September 1998. The children to whom the Deputy refers reside 8.5 miles from the gaelscoil and are eligible for free transport should they wish to avail of the service, which operates within 2.2 miles of their home.</P>
      <P>My Department may only sanction payment of a remote area grant where pupils reside at least three miles from their nearest suitable school, and from transport services to that school. As the distance from this family's home to the pick-up point is less than three miles, I regret that it would not be open to my Department to sanction a remote area grant or offer compensation as requested.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Government has already reduced the pupil-teacher ratio in both primary and second level schools.</P>
      <P>I should explain that while the pupil-teacher ratio serves a very useful function of indicating the relationship at national level between pupil numbers and teacher numbers, it does not accurately reflect the position in many classrooms. While there are schools which have a pupil-teacher ratio which is lower than the national average, I equally accept that there are schools with a ratio higher than the national average.</P>
      <P>The pupil-teacher ratio in primary schools now stands at 21:2. As a result of the substantially improved staffing schedule which I recently announced, this ratio will be further improved in the next school year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The pupil-teacher ratio at second level has improved due to the allocation of additional ex-quota and concessionary posts and the application of a reduced ratio in respect of a range of new programmes which have been introduced in second level schools. The Deputy will also be aware of my recent significant initiative which introduced a retention ratio of 18:1 in relation to schools with over quota full-time teachers who might otherwise be redeployed. This coupled with the provision of a remedial entitlement to all second level schools and the extension of the <Col N="1526" /> home school liaison scheme will have a consider-able and sustained impact on the pupil teacher ratio at second level.</P>
    <P>From the start of the 1999-2000 school year, in addition to retaining the demographic dividend and reducing class sizes in primary schools, and introducing a retention ratio at second level for over quota full-time teachers, the Government has sanctioned the creation of a further 450 new posts across both sectors. This is the first significant increase in teacher staffing for many years.</P>
    <P>I believe that these moves clearly indicate the importance which this Government attributes to education, and demonstrate its commitment to seriously addressing the issue of teaching resources available in our schools.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 386 and 387 together.</P>
      <P>St. Patrick's College, Naas, has accommodation for around 500 pupils. The proposed building project is to provide major improvement works to the existing school building and will not provide additional pupil places.</P>
      <P>The second level schools in the areas, referred to by the Deputy, have a combined total of around 6,000 permanent pupil places. As the Deputy is aware there are a number of building projects, at various stages of architectural planning, involving schools in these areas. When these projects are completed, the overall number of permanent pupil places will increase to around 8,000.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that these projects are proceeding due to the major increase in capital funding allocated to my Department in the last two years.</P>
