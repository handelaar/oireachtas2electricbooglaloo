      <P>Before proceeding with the Order of Business, I would like to take the opportunity to welcome to Dáil Éireann members of the committee for finance of the state parliament of Baden-Württemberg who are here with us this morning in the Distinguished Visitors Gallery. On my own behalf and on behalf of the Members of Dáil Éireann I wish to extend to the delegation a most sincere welcome to our country. I express the hope that you find your visit to Ireland to be interesting, successful and to our mutual benefit.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister indicate to the House the state of preparation of the special legislation being prepared for judicial pensions for two judges recently resigned, and if the pensions legislation in this case is creating precedence for others in other parts of the public sector who leave their jobs prematurely in terms of their pension entitlements?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>On that and a related matter, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform announced that the pensions will be payable from the date he made his statement to the Dáil. Was he aware that legislation was required and when will we see it, or are people to be left in limbo? Is there any intention to amend the compellability of witnesses Act to ensure that judicial or former judicial personages acting in a non-judicial capacity can be asked to give evidence before a committee of this House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I call Deputy Bruton on the same subject.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>What are the Government's plans in regard to the indication by one judge that he does not propose to co-operate with a committee of the House in regard to establishing the reason decisions were taken by him in a matter that is obviously of public concern?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister who brought in the legislation which guarantees the entitlements of people in the private sector to their pensions, I believe it is particularly important that public servants who have earned pensions are entitled to them, but that matter will come before the House and Deputies will have the opportunity to give their views on it.</P>
      <P>The committee is considering the question of compellability and we await its report. The committee will consider the matter today. I understand its legal adviser has been considering the position and the committee will then report back to the House. The Attorney General is anxious to give any assistance he can to the committee consistent with his function as adviser to Government on matters of law and legal opinion. I respectfully ask Members to wait until the committee considers that matter and reports back to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister assure the House that in preparing the pensions legislation for these two individuals, having regard to the need, under the Constitution, to treat similar cases similarly in regard to others in the public sector who may have similar occasion to resign prematurely for various reasons, they will also benefit under whatever criteria the Minister has established for the decision he made in regard to these two pensions?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>This is very serious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Any Bill that comes before the House will have the benefit of the Attorney Gen<Col N="451" /> eral's advice and Members on the other side of the House will have an opportunity to express their views on it if it comes in that form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has already indicated to the House that he is an expert on pensions. Will he agree that in creating new pension entitlements for one category of retiring public officials, one must ensure one acts consistently<i> vis-à-vis</i> other retired or potentially retired public officials whose retirement is occasioned by analogous circumstances?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot discuss the nature of the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I will try to frame my question within that ruling. The Minister said the committee is studying matters. That committee is subject to the law which precludes it from summoning or compelling judges or former judges to appear before it. My question asked about the Government's attitude to this legislative measure. Will it seek to amend the compellability Act to enable former judges, acting in a non-judicial fashion, to be summoned before a committee of this House to give evidence? The committee would welcome that attitude on the part of the Government before it has a chance to make a decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The committee has its own legal advice. The Government will give any assistance possible to the committee which will meet today to consider the matter. The Attorney General met the committee's legal adviser within the constraints under which he acts under the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is illegal to summon a former judge under the compellability Act. Does the Government intend to amend this Act?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I trust the Deputy understands that any law passed in the House cannot override the Constitution. We are in uncharted waters. Unusually I agree with Deputy Rabbitte who said this morning that he understands that Hugh O'Flaherty has good grounds for refusing to appear before the committee. Deputy Rabbitte said that the former judge is using the separation of powers under Article 35.2 of the Constitution and that he would not favour introducing retrospective legislation as Mr. O'Flaherty has been a respected judge of the Supreme Court. The Deputy also said that it was anathema to him to use the pension payment.</P>
      <P>The Government has always stood behind the separation of powers and the independence of the Judiciary. We are in uncharted waters. The committee is examining the matter and will report to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The committee has run into the sand and the Minister is happy to see it do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Above all people, the Deputy should be clear that the separation of powers is one of the fundamental principles on which the <Col N="452" /> State has developed. It has been upheld by successive Governments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister and the Government accept that the Constitution envisages the overview&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is pursuing a debate on this matter. We are on the Order of Business. It is not appropriate to discuss this matter now. It is quite disorderly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is possible for the House to look into an allegation of impropriety when a judge is serving, surely it is constitutional for such an investigation to take place after he has resigned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the pensions, I remind the Minister that the Government entered into these commitments and it is for the Government to explain how they can be dealt with without creating unwanted precedents. This is a Government responsibility as it made the commitments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister confirm that the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, sent a file to the Attorney General arising from the raising of a loan by AIB for the funding of Beaumont Hospital in 1980 when Deputy Woods was Minister for Health? Will the Minister make a statement on this matter?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Legislation is not involved in this matter. That was a good arrangement which provided funds for mental handicap and psychiatric <Col N="453" /> services.

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Public Transport: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy Yates on Wednesday, 5 May 1999:</P>
    <P Just="Center">That Dáil Éireann, conscious of the current Budget surplus projected this year and the anticipated proceeds of the initial public offering of shares in Telecom Éireann, calls on the Government to immediately commit £140 million of public expenditure to alleviate the national traffic crisis in Dublin and other large regional urban areas; and further calls on the Minister for Public Enterprise to expend this allocation on the following measures to urgently enhance public transport capacity and alleviate traffic flows:</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;the immediate ordering and purchase of an additional 250 buses this year for Dublin Bus, specifically to operate on the 11 quality bus corridors, with the objective of providing in the inner cordon area a bus every minute in peak times and every ten minutes thereafter;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;the provision of additional bus maintenance, garage, depot and other facilities to service this expansion of the bus fleet;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;the availability of &lsquo;real time' information systems at bus stops as to vehicle location and passenger information;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;the availability of an integrated ticketing system with a specific provision for both day and monthly tickets covering multi-journeys;</P>
    <P Just="Center">
      <Col N="458" />&ndash;the provision of a satellite-facilitated, centrally-controlled vehicle tracking system for the entire bus network and a central radio call centre for the taxi industry;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;the availability of bus route franchising, whereby Dublin Bus would subcontract selected arterial routes to the private sector, particularly for cross-city travel;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;to carry out an immediate study and design of potential reverse and contraflow routes;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;the enhancement of air-to-ground traffic surveillance to extend coverage to the entire urban area of Dublin;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;additional investment in high technology traffic control systems in the suburbs to maximise junction capacity and ensure priority for public transport;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;the expansion of Operation Freeflow through additional staff resources, including training;</P>
    <P Just="Center">and furthermore, calls on the Minister to implement the proposals submitted by Bus Éireann to upgrade the public transport bus services in Cork, Limerick, Waterford and Galway.</P>
    <P Just="Center">Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P Just="Center">To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ldquo;Dáil Éireann&mdash;</P>
    <P Just="Center">(a) welcomes the decisive response of the Government to the recommendations of the Dublin Transportation Office's short-term action plan;</P>
    <P Just="Center">(b) notes with satisfaction the progress which is being made in implementing the action plan, particularly the purchase of 150 extra buses and DART/suburban rail rolling stock, the implementation of the quality bus corridors and the upgrading of the suburban rail network;</P>
    <P Just="Center">(c) welcomes the provision for the first time of Exchequer capital funding to implement the bus and rail measures in the action plan;</P>
    <P Just="Center">(d) supports the Government in its commitment and determination to undertake further radical improvements to transport systems in the greater Dublin area and to provide for investment in urban public transport in Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford;</P>
    <P Just="Center">(e) welcomes the recent Government decision to urgently commission costing and feasibility studies on short and medium-term suburban rail development programmes for Dublin and Cork;</P>
    <P Just="Center">(f) notes that the Dublin Transportation Office is nearing completion of a comprehensive transport, investment and traffic management programme for the period 2000-2006, <Col N="459" /> which will be considered by the Government in its preparation of the National Development Plan.&rdquo;.</P>

    <P>Ms Shortall: I wish to share my time with Deputy Seán Ryan.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>At a time of exceptional economic growth, when we are told the country is awash with money, queueing has become the national pastime. We queue for hospital beds, public and private housing, child care places and public transport. I am a public representative for the Dublin North-West constituency, where a very large proportion of the population is dependent on public transport, and this problem is presented at my constituency clinics and office on a number of occasions every week. However, despite surveys, reports and reviews of all sorts over the past decade, very little has been done about it. I wish I could target my anger at one individual but the truth is I have no single person to blame. The fundamental problem is that we have no accountability in our system.</P>
      <P>As an elected member of Dublin Corporation, I sit on the newly created transportation and traffic strategic policy committee, a body which seeks to put together some form of planning for the city's transport and traffic problems but this important committee has no representative of Dublin Bus, Irish Rail or any statutory body with an interest and involvement in alleviating city traffic congestion. This is a fundamental problem with the new strategic policy committees. My understanding was that the whole point of those committees was to bring together the main players &ndash; the elected representatives, the city management, the director of traffic, those involved in providing public transport services and those involved in traffic. Unfortunately, however, those key representatives are disbarred from being members of these key strategic committees. The way we have found to get around that fundamental problem is to invite Dublin Bus and Irish Rail to attend our meetings and contribute to discussions, but they have no voting power. I ask the Minister to examine this gap in the provision of cross-sectoral involvement in dealing with our traffic and transport problems.</P>
      <P>This lack of overall strategy and co-ordination deficit requires the Minister's intervention. While the Minister's lackadaisical, hands-off, &ldquo;everything is grand&rdquo; approach may suit her media image, it does not suit Dublin's commuters. We need action on this problem from a Minister who is proactive, willing to shoulder the burden of responsibility and willing to insist taxpayers get value for money, that commuters get the public service they deserve and that our elderly and disabled get the social service they urgently require.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What other Minister would allocate millions of <Col N="460" /> pounds to a transport company without having any real say in how that money is spent? What other Minister would refuse to provide basic information, as she did when I asked in a recent parliamentary question about the level of subvention she is making to Dublin Bus? I asked how that percentage compares with the subventions given to public transport companies in other European cities, but the Minister refused to answer that question and referred me to the Library.</P>
    <P>Quite clearly, the Minister's refusal to answer that question was based on the knowledge that if those figures were put in the public domain it would make the Government look very bad in terms of its commitment to public transport. The Government is providing a subsidy in the region of 4 per cent to Dublin Bus, which compares very badly with the subsidies of between 50 and 80 per cent &ndash; with transport in Athens receiving a subsidy of 80 per cent &ndash; which are the norm in other European cities.</P>
    <P>Dublin Bus receives a great deal of criticism, some of which is deserved. However, we cannot expect a public transport company to provide a modern and efficient service unless it is on a proper financial footing. The meagre 4 per cent subsidy provided by the Minister is totally inadequate for that company to provide the kind of public transport service which is so urgently required in this city.</P>
    <P>What other Minister would stand by and watch thousands of commuters stranded because of the lack of an overall policy? Deputy Mitchell spoke last night about the need for a Minister for traffic. It would be a start if we simply had a Minister who showed some real interest in the problem. Accountability is at the heart of this problem. We have very poor accountability at ministerial level and there is virtually no accountability to the customer. I call on the Minister to take urgent action and to take responsibility for public transport. She must ensure the people of Dublin are given the level of service they urgently require so that they will no longer have to queue to go about their daily business.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. S. Ryan Mr. S. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have this opportunity to speak on the motion. I have no difficulty supporting this motion as I, and the Labour Party, have always acknowledged the necessity of an efficient and properly funded public transport system. However, over the years, the car lobby has been more successful than the public transport lobby in securing the ear of the Department of Finance whether for local, Exchequer or EU funding. Thankfully, that has changed in some regards and I hope that can be developed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dublin city and county are effectively gridlocked for most of the day, and this has major social, environmental and economic costs for our city. Why has Dublin Bus not provided the quantity and quality of service that would encourage greater numbers of people to leave their cars at home and travel by bus? The use of the DART <Col N="461" /> service between Bray and Howth indicates how people can be attracted by frequent services.</P>
    <P>While Dublin Bus must take some responsibility for the present problems, the lack of subvention is also a major cause. Over the years, the subvention has been reduced from £16.4 million in 1987 to £8.8 million last year, and that does not take inflation into account. It is a scandal that public transport in Dublin receives the lowest subvention of any capital in Europe.</P>
    <P>New buses are required, all of which must be wheelchair accessible. The DTI recommended the provision of quality bus corridors. These have not come on stream as quickly as quickly as we would like. However, I accept the local authorities have a role to play and that delays have caused some of the problems in that regard.</P>
    <P>Our capital city is badly in need, in the short-term, of a transport innovation for the millennium. The provision of an all night bus service for Dublin city and suburbs should be examined. There is a public outcry for transport services, particularly at weekends. There has been a complete change in social behaviour and this warrants such a service. The present arrangements are totally inadequate. All night bus services would provide a level of safety for the public, the manpower and materials are available and such services would gain the full support of the public, even at a cost, and would create an incentive for car owners to use public transport. This would be a great initiative for the millennium. The proposal was brought to my attention by Mr. Thomas Darby, retired general secretary of the bus and rail workers union and I understand it has also been put to the Minister.</P>
    <P>It is a scandal that people living on the peninsula of Donabate in my constituency cannot get to work from that rapidly growing suburb due to the lack of a bus service. An examination of the need for Nipper bus services throughout the county is long overdue. It should be possible in a town such as Swords, for example, to have Nipper buses rather than double decker buses bringing people from newly developed residential areas into that town and then have them travel in double decker buses into the city. What is needed is finance. This Government, despite the money it has at its disposal, has failed the people of Dublin. It is time it started to look after them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>This morning I had an early meeting in Ballyfermot and on my way back to Leinster House I turned off the road at Bluebell. I was listening to Deputies Moynihan-Cronin, Callely and others talking to Marion Finucane on the radio about the essential role of TDs and their clinics. I had another appointment at 10 a.m. <Col N="462" /> in Leinster House but it was 9.55 a.m. when I got here.</P>
      <P>The traffic moved at a snail's pace. The first obstacle was a JCB pottering along the road in front of the traffic. When I reached St. Stephen's Green, traffic was delayed by a skip being loaded onto the back of a lorry which took up a traffic lane. At the top of Grafton Street, the famous No. 10 bus was broken down at the corner of St. Stephen's Green clogging up the traffic in the process. On Molesworth Street a driver parked her car, turned on its hazard lights and went into the offices of the ISPCC.</P>
      <P>There is as large a problem with traffic management in the city as there is with the provision of resources. I guarantee Members that if they leave the House now to travel down Suffolk Street, they will find a series of drinks lorries decanting kegs of beer at every pub on that road, clogging the traffic at every corner. I agree with Deputy Shortall that co-ordination is essential. There must be some form of co-ordination between the operators and users of the transport system.</P>
      <P>The Irish are latter day converts to the merits of public transport. It is not long ago, certainly before the introduction of the DART, that public transport was regarded as a second class mode of transport. As soon as a person accumulated a few pounds they tended to buy a car and were quick to show it off in the nearest town.</P>
      <P>I support the amendment. The work the Minister is doing in co-operation with CIE, Dublin Bus and others is admirable. There is no reason Operation Freeflow should not operate through the year, apart from the allocation of Garda resources and there are more imaginative ways of dealing with that. I commend Owen Keegan, the director of traffic, and the Garda Síochána on the introduction of the new radio station. It will be a great help. The commuter requires more and accurate information about the availability of car parking places and the traffic problems throughout the city. I also commend the introduction of clamping. It was not a popular development but I support it and I believe it should be introduced in certain suburbs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 12 quality bus corridors being brought on stream before the end of 2000 are an important first step, but only that. The Lucan corridor is working effectively and the Finglas QBC is due to come on stream on 14 June. I cannot understand why the Finglas QBC has taken so long. Work started on it 18 months ago and it is still not complete. It is most unwise to bring quality bus corridors into operation before all the works are complete. That gives the impression that the work has not been thought out properly. The surveillance cameras, for example, are not in place. The yellow boxes and traffic lights sequences are not in place. Deputies receive constant complaints from motorists who are obliged to sit in their cars on the only available lane on the Finglas quality bus corridor and look at the empty lane beside them. The introduction of 150 new <Col N="463" /> buses will make a difference but until work on quality bus corridors is complete they should not be brought into operation.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on her ambitions for Luas. Many people derided her proposals but we must plan for the city's transport requirements 30 years from now. Much of the work in this area has been bedevilled by short-termism. The Minister's proposals are innovative, imaginative and long overdue. I welcome the consultation taking place about the phase linking Broadstone to the airport. If I were an airport customer, I would wish to be able to get to the airport as quickly as possible. There is a need to establish a quick link from Broadstone through DCU and the rejuvenated Ballymun to Dublin Airport as quickly as possible. Local discussions are taking place in Finglas and Ballymun about how Luas might traverse the area and I welcome that initiative. It is important that a Luas line be located in such areas where there is high dependency on public transport.</P>
    <P>When schools are closed there is a perceptible reduction in traffic. The introduction of school buses in the Dublin area would be a worthwhile innovation. It would prevent much of the congestion caused by parents having to drop their children to the gates of the school. I commend the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Government and this Minister on the major developments which have taken place in public transport in the last two years. The provision of high quality public transport is vitally important for the commercial and social life of the country. This is certainly true for Galway.</P>
      <P>Bus Éireann is embarking on a comprehensive bus replacement scheme for its urban bus services. The company proposes to purchase 40 new buses for this purpose this year. I am particularly glad that Galway will receive the first tranche of these new buses. I understand they have already been delivered and should be in operation in the near future. This development will create major improvements in both the quality and frequency of urban bus services, which will be welcomed by everybody. CIE has submitted an investment review to the Minister for Public Enterprise which proposes investment in buses and to improve bus priority. I look forward to a positive response to these proposals in the forthcoming national development plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to advocate the establishment of a commuter style rail service between Galway city and towns such as Oranmore, Athenry and Tuam. Dublin is not the only city with traffic problems. Galway endures the misery of traffic tailbacks stretching miles in all directions. Existing railway links between Galway and the towns of Oranmore, Athenry, Tuam and Ballinasloe could be used for commuter style rail services. These services must be a central part of transport proposals in the coming years. This proposal makes econ<Col N="464" /> omic sense when one considers that the estimated cost of developing a mile of motorway is up to £5 million compared with the cost of £0.3 million for upgrading a mile of railway track.</P>
    <P>A major transport and land use survey is being carried out at present in Galway. It is examining the problem of traffic jams from Galway to Claregalway, Oranmore and Barna. It is fortunate the train station in Galway is located in Eyre Square in the heart of the city, which is not the case in every town or city. When the Galway train arrives in Heuston Station, for example, a person is required to get further transport to the city centre, the airport or the ferry.</P>
    <P>Other areas of Galway where commuter services are needed are Renmore, Merlin Park, Oranmore and Athenry with extensions to Tuam, Gort and Ballinasloe in the near future. I understand the traffic build up in Galway is at a level predicted for 2020. There is an urgent need to develop a rail transport system.</P>
    <P>I congratulate Bus Átha Cliath for replacing 120 old buses with 120 new double decker buses which will increase capacity by 2,450 passenger trips. Bus Átha Cliath is also in the process of subcontracting 50 school bus runs to private operators, thus releasing buses and increasing capacity by 3,500 passenger trips. I also welcome the fact that ten new carriages for the DART service are due for delivery in September 1999 while a further 16 will be delivered in September 2000.</P>
    <P>I welcome the improvements on the Galway-Dublin railway line. The section between Galway and Ballinasloe was closed for some months but it has now been improved and reopened. There is now a better train service for people travelling from Galway to Dublin and Dublin to Galway. The good news is that trains are arriving on time. This is important for people who have business and hospital appointments and people who want to get to Dublin earlier.</P>
    <P>I support the amendment. I hope we will be able to get the necessary funding for public transport.</P>

      <P>I support the amendment. I congratulate the Government and the Minister in particular for the major developments and initiatives in public transport in the past two years. I have personal experience of using the buses in Dublin. I got the 11A bus from Clonskeagh this morning and I was in here at 8 a.m. It is a well run service and I congratulate Bus Átha Cliath on its excellent work.</P>
      <P>The provision of high quality public transport is vitally important for the commercial and social life of the country, including Cork. In the past I was critical of the high average age of the city bus fleet in Cork which is between 11 and 14 years old. I am glad to note that under this Government Bus Éireann is embarking on a comprehensive bus replacement scheme for its urban services. I understand the company proposes to purchase 40 new buses this year. That will create major improvements in the quality and frequency of urban bus services, a move which will be welcomed by everyone.</P>
      <P>It was confirmed today by the management of Bus Éireann that over half of the 40 new buses are earmarked for Cork and that seven city buses will arrive in Cork by the end of this month. I understand that plans are being finalised with staff for the introduction of these buses. Deputy Michael Kitt said that three buses have already arrived in Galway. That is the first tranche of ten buses which will come into the country this year.</P>
      <P>I hope the buses in Cork city are given a distinct livery, such as Cork City Bus. I hope Bus Éireann does away with the wrap around advertising on some of its fleet, particularly if it does not need the revenue generated from it.</P>
      <P>I am happy to note the investment proposals put forward by CIE on the opening of new stations and the provision of new services on the Mallow Cork and Cork/ Cobh routes. The Arrow service is over-subscribed in Cork. People queue every day for this service because of its efficiency and frequency. I hope CIE presses ahead with its proposals to open the Kilbarry station in Blackpool and the Blarney station close to my home. I also hope it introduces the Arrow service on the Cork/Mallow line. I welcome the upgrading of the railway track on the Mallow-Tralee line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="466" /> I am glad the Minister has authorised a feasibility study of the Cork-Midleton line and that she is considering reopening it. Kent station, Tivoli and Ballynoe, which is near the cross ferry river in Cobh, are along that line. Some 600 new houses are planned for that area which needs a new railway station. I hope that will be included in the proposals once the feasibility study is completed. The six miles of track would cost approximately £6.2 million. I hope the Government reopens Midleton and Carrigtohill stations as these two areas have a combined population of approximately 8,000, which is similar to Cobh.</P>
    <P>I welcome the recent decision by the Government to invest heavily in CIE and to urge it to look at its property portfolio and to sell off unwanted properties which could make vast sums of money to help it improve its services and its capital programme over the next few years.</P>
    <P>I urge the Opposition not to waste any more time in the Dáil by tabling such motions. It should let Government policy take its course.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment but I do so on the basis of the need to look at what is happening outside Dublin. There is general transport chaos and congestion because of the need for private transport companies to service Dublin. We should look at the manner in which Dublin docks operate and at the flow of trucks into and out of the city. It takes me one and a half hours to drive to Kilkenny but it takes me two and a half hours to get from Kilkenny to the Dáil. Anyone who commutes to Dublin to work on a daily basis or who transports goods to it from other parts of the country is affected by the inefficiencies of the transport system.</P>
      <P>There is life beyond Dublin. I ask the Government to focus on Kilkenny and on the fact there is no daily commuter system for people from Carlow or Kilkenny which would help to take cars off the road. With Government decentralisation an office is being set up in both counties. There is a need to ensure a commuter service is in operation. Recently at an Oireachtas sub-committee a Mr. Finn from Iarnród Éireann said the commuter service would be provided from both counties in the near future. Will the Minister ensure that commuter service is provided without delay? I have been informed the only reason for the delay is the logistics of catering for such a service in the Dublin station. In this day and age that problem should be overcome in the interests of the environment, in the interests of taking cars off the road and in the interests of ensuring quality of life in country areas and that people in country areas can commute daily to Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="467" /> The issue of tax designation was mentioned. Kilkenny station is in the new tax designated area. I appeal to the company to drive the current plans to provide all the infrastructure necessary and to develop Kilkenny railway station. It has at its disposal the land around that station, it has tax designation and there is not any reason for delay. Whatever delays there are in its planning system should be tackled.</P>
    <P>An extension of the rail service and proper road facilities to Bellvue port is essential. Bellvue has the ability to become the next Ringaskiddy. With proper infrastructure and money up front that can be achieved in the south-east. There was never a better time for either the Government or private individuals in partnership with the Government to ensure a proper road structure is put in place immediately. We have only to travel on any of the roads leading to Bellvue port to understand the need for a proper road infrastructure. In this I include a proper rail structure servicing that port. I suggest the funds either from the Government or private individuals should be made available to develop the railway line and the ring roads around Kilkenny city and Carlow town. Given that the south-east has much to offer there must be access to Dublin. To achieve this millions of pounds must be spent on the infrastructure, bearing in mind that for 15 years nothing was spent on it. It is almost a forgotten part of the country.</P>
    <P>Kilkenny city, which was not mentioned in the Minister's speech, is thriving. It has an increasing population and needs a public bus service. Estates on the outskirts of the city do not have a public service although a limited service is provided by the private sector. The time has come when CIE should invest, by way of partnership, with the private companies, reduce the size of the buses traversing a medieval city and provide an efficient bus service throughout the city. There are a number housing estates being built without public service access to the city centre, schools, hospitals and so on. There is an urgent need for the Government to recognise the need for a public service. Given that this need is not recognised in the Minister's speech, I appeal to her to ensure the inclusion of Kilkenny city in the development of a public-private bus service. I appeal to her also to look at Carlow town which is one-and-a-half hours from Dublin by car. Due to property prices, people who want a certain quality of life and want to live in counties such as Carlow or Kilkenny want to be in a position to commute. I appeal to the Minister to ensure funds are spent not only in Dublin but in other centres.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the greatest signs of the prosperity, wealth and growth of the country is increased traffic and increased car ownership. This is due not only to an increase in population but to the numbers of successful young people earning big salaries or returning from abroad with money to spend who spend it on their own <Col N="468" /> private transport. The traffic problem evolved as an inevitable consequence of our prosperity. Perhaps this should have been anticipated some years ago but certainly we recognise it as a good which has lead to an evil development.</P>
      <P>There is more at issue than what the Government can do about public transport. There is a culture and mindset in how people perceive public versus private transport. That Ireland did not have an undergound such as the Metro when other capital cities got into the habit of using public transport, meant that for many years people here felt it was a major step forward to move away from public transport and own cars. While we are changing the facilities, increasing investment, working on the various reports and recommendations we need to look at the culture and the mindset of those we are encouraging to use the public transport.</P>
      <P>Unlike some of my colleagues I wecome the opportunity to discuss this issue because it is a major problem for the city of Dublin, throughout the county and in the south suburbs. The problem should be tackled by the Government, the transport authorities &ndash; the Dublin Transport Authority, Bus Átha Cliath, the DART etc, &ndash; and at a local level.</P>
      <P>I welcome what initiatives the Minister has taken in recent months. The additional 150 buses, at a cost of £25.5 million, have already been approved. The quality bus corridors were a great idea but a little premature. There is no point in having a quality bus corridor if we do not have the buses. We have excellent bus lanes but there are no buses on them. The buses should have come first to be followed by the quality bus corridors.</P>

      <P>At least they would then work to capacity. My constituency of Dun Laoghaire is fortunate to have nine DART stations. The extra carriages coming on stream in September are welcome. The extra 16 giving a total of 26 by 2000 are also welcome and will increase capacity by 30 per cent. The extension of the platform at Blackrock, one of the busiest stations, is also welcome.</P>
      <P>The report on rail safety had major implications not only for rail systems throughout the country but for some stations and signals in my constituency. Immediate action is being taken on that. However, the traffic problem still exists. There are a number of things I would like the authorities to look at, particularly Bus Éireann, some of which are recommended in the motion. I cannot understand why every bus has to start in Bray and end up in Dublin city. By the time it gets to Clonkeen Road it is chock-a-block and cannot take any more passengers. I have contacted Dublin Bus on a number of occasions asking if it would do short runs, particularly at school time, between Bray and Blackrock, but to no avail. At school times we need a proper system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="469" /> We also need a community service. People who live within two miles of Loughlinstown Hospital, in Ballybrack or Loughlinstown, have no way of getting to the hospital. People who do not have private transport have to go into Dun Laoghaire or to Dublin to get another bus out to the hospital. A proper community service should be provided in suburban areas.</P>
    <P>Buses should also be replaced as the need arises. A delegation from Bus Éireann speaking about the school bus system throughout the country told us it had modern buses. One member of the committee looked at the cover of the video presented to us, highlighting its wonderful facilities, which showed a 1979 bus. The replacement of buses is an urgent matter. In the interests of safety the authorities must ensure crushing <i> a la </i>Japan does not take place. People are in a rush to get to work, but physically pushing passengers onto the DART is not safe or good enough.</P>
    <P>Problems emerge in the suburbs in terms of parking because people want to use public transport. There is a need to provide areas where people can park and use feeder buses. This would encourage people to take the DART and use buses. Another difficulty is that every estate now wants ramps, double yellow lines and disc parking. This is in addition to the problem that there is not proper disc parking and the traffic wardens are being removed. These problems are adding to the difficulties in the suburbs. The transport problems in Dublin must be dealt with on three fronts, the Government, the authorities and the local councils.</P>

      <P>The motion calls for the expenditure of £140 million from the sale of Telecom Éireann on public transport and the alleviation of the traffic crisis in Dublin and other regional centres. A number of practical suggestions have been outlined that could be implemented and would greatly alleviate the stress and pressure felt by people. Much sense was spoken by a number of Members on the Government benches and I hope they decide to back up that positive approach by supporting the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have used the road from Fairview and Clontarf on a number of occasions in the morning. It is astounding that there is only one lane of traffic entering the city on that route in the morning. It is incredible. The frustration, curses and passion expressed by drivers about city managers, the Government and traffic managers is incredible. Deputy Yates made a proposal regarding contraflows and reverse flows. These operate in most cities and the proposal should be implemented <Col N="470" /> immediately. This would mean that three lanes would be available for traffic in the morning and the evening. A reverse flow is manageable, practical and successful.</P>
    <P>It is possible to move more people per hour by train than by any other method. Many people assume that Ireland has reached the stage of a developed country because of the effects of growth in the economy. However, that is far from the case. We have reached the stage where we are suffering serious stress in terms of skills shortages and inability to do business efficiently and professionally by movement through areas such as Cork, Galway, Dublin and elsewhere. This has a disadvantageous effect on the way people view Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Government should be magnanimous and take on board some, if not all, of the practical proposals made. It should consider making a real impact on providing a quality rail service throughout the country. Thousands of commuters would use the rail service if it was efficient, professional, comfortable and economical. The western line from Athlone to Westport and Ballina, with which the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, is familiar, needs a real shake up. Passengers are acutely aware of the impact of possible derailments such as those which occurred in recent years.</P>
    <P>I commend the efforts of members of Iarnród Éireann in presenting the facilities which exist. For example, the local stationmaster in Castlebar won the inter-city award for the presentation of rail stations nationally. I commend him and his staff on their efforts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate Deputy Yates and Deputy Mitchell on tabling the motion. Once again, this side is trying to focus the Government's mind on finding solutions to traffic and public transport problems in urban centres. My role is to deal with the area I represent, Cork city, and the comments of Deputy O'Flynn made my blood boil. He accused the Opposition of wasting valuable Government time. He said he has found during the local elections campaign in Cork that people have no problems with public transport and traffic. However, the Deputy insulted the people of Cork and I refute his comments. I hope other Deputies on the Government side who represent people in Cork will give a more accurate reflection of the situation in the city at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The difference between Cork and other parts of the country is that a land use and transportation plan has been implemented over the past 20 years. This has resulted in £30 million being spent on the road infrastructure in and around Cork city and the ring road network will improve traffic flow considerably. The full benefit will be reaped when the Lee tunnel and the Blackpool bypass open. However, while the road infrastructure may have improved, largely due to EU funding, the overall land use and transportation plan will not succeed in reducing traffic problems unless the public transport needs are also <Col N="471" /> addressed and the roads can be used to their maximum potential. A motorway is no use during rush hour if it is gridlocked with cars, lorries and buses. The only way the roads will be used to their maximum capacity is if people are offered an alternative to using their cars. This would mean a smaller number of cars trying to get into the centre of the city.</P>
    <P>When people think of traffic problems they always refer only to Dublin. Perhaps this is why the people of Cork have been treated as second class citizens from a public transport point of view. Two major issues need to be solved in Cork. The first is that there is not enough buses in the Cork bus fleet and, second, the fleet is too old to be as efficient as possible. Of the 63 buses in Cork, 45 date from 1984 or earlier. They are almost beyond their useful life and we are supposed to be encouraging people to use public transport as an alternative to cars.</P>
    <P>Bus Éireann in Cork has devised a plan which it considers would have a significant impact on traffic problems there. I call on the Minister to invest in public transport because Bus Éireann in Cork does not have the resources to implement its plan and the Government can afford it at present. Money from the budget surplus and the sale of Telecom Éireann shares should be put back into the economy through investment in public transport.</P>
    <P>I welcome studies on long-term traffic plans, but the immediate and urgent requirements are simple from the point of view of buses. There is a need for more and newer buses. Deputy O'Flynn said earlier that seven new buses are on their way to Cork. He said he was informed of this by the management of Bus Éireann this morning. I also spoke to the management of Bus Éireann this morning and I too was told that seven new buses are coming to Cork. However, I was also told that this is only scratching the surface of the problem because the seven new buses will merely replace older buses that are not fit to be on the road. They will have no impact on the overall size of the fleet which drastically needs to be increased. A total of 40 new buses are needed, not ten. There is a need to replace buses but also to increase the size of the fleet. People will use buses if they are offered a service which is on time, clean, modern and accessible to all. The one positive aspect of the seven new buses for Cork is that they are accessible to wheelchair users and I welcome that. I reiterate my disgust at what Deputy O'Flynn said this morning. I hope the Cork Deputies on the Government benches will give a more accurate reflection of the problems there.</P>

      <P>I commend my colleagues Deputies Yates and Olivia Mitchell for this very timely motion. We will put it down again and again until the Government reaches a stage where it can admit to having a traffic policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="472" /> I take this opportunity to call on the Taoiseach as head of Government to recognise that the lack of a coherent traffic policy in Dublin and other cities will mean that the young people in the public gallery today will experience the effects of gridlock and traffic congestion and suffer from ulcers, heart attacks and frustration unless the Government adopts the measures in this motion. It is interesting that my colleague, Deputy Olivia Mitchell, who was first elected less than two years ago, has made more impact than the Minister dealing with transport. Her name is synonymous with trying to find solutions for gridlock in Dublin. The Government has a cheek to table an amendment to this motion.</P>
    <P>Where are the park and ride buses which operated during the Christmas period? We need a permanent park and ride service in the capital, in Cork, Waterford and other large cities. Will those who direct traffic policy be more innovative and introduce long-term rather than short-term measures?</P>
    <P>There was a time when the buses in Dublin were referred to as grapes, because they came in bunches. I would welcome a few &ldquo;grapes&rdquo;, because now we do not see buses coming, even in bunches. I drive in from Malahide every morning, trying to avoid the rush hour traffic, but there is no time during the day when there is not a traffic jam on the road from the northside through Malahide, Coolock, Donnycarney, Clontarf and Fairview. Deputy Kenny referred to a blockage in Fairview at Edge's Corner which is fondly known as the library, because one has time to read a library book sitting in the traffic jam. It is ready made for the counter flow that Fine Gael proposes. We have one lane and a bus lane for inward traffic and when I am caught in the traffic I sit and count the buses using the bus lane beside me. One could count them on one hand.</P>
    <P>North Dublin has a train service which is completely under resourced. I welcome the fact the previous Government agreed to extend the DART service to north Dublin stations from the middle of next year. Unless there is investment in decent car parking facilities and measures to alleviate congestion in the towns with DART stations, people will continue to use cars. I am calling for proper investment in infrastructure to complement the DART.</P>
    <P>Bus Átha Cliath should allow private buses on some routes, for example orbital buses. Why should the people of Ballyboughal, Naul and Garristown be denied a bus service because the bus route is from Garristown to the city centre instead of to Swords, from where they could link into bus services? We need innovative and imaginative thinking on traffic policy.</P>
    <P>For more than a year the Minister has had a proposal from Crossans to run a private bus service from Howth junction to Dublin airport to enable people from Howth and the surrounding areas to take the DART and then get a private bus to the airport. I call on the Minister to give a decision on that innovative proposal.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="473" /> The people would have an extra access point to Dublin airport until such time as Luas is in place or there is a proper rail service to the airport.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms F. Fitzgerald Ms F. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms F. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate Deputies Yates and Olivia Mitchell on the trojan work they have done on the huge public transport crisis in Dublin and throughout the country. The Government's response to the motion is disturbing and does not seem to indicate it is aware of the crisis.</P>
      <P> Urgent crisis measures are needed to deal with the traffic as well as better long-term planning. We have neither. The Luas project is way behind schedule and will cost much more than was estimated for. This is adding to the problems in the south inner suburbs, where traffic is the number one issue. The traffic problem has the potential to seriously undermine our economic success. The infrastructural deficits in transport, child care and housing are driving people who returned to Ireland to leave again. Such services are taken for granted in cities in other countries.</P>
      <P>This motion is timely and reflects the concerns of Dublin citizens whose quality of life is being affected. The journey time for most journeys has been extended by up to an hour in the past year. This serious problem is not getting the appropriate response at Government level. Quite a good deal can be done in the short-term. In Dublin South-East we need a range of traffic calming measures. Dublin Corporation is doing a good job but does not have sufficient resources. We need to ensure that it has the resources to implement traffic calming measures which would make a huge difference to the suburbs. It is very clear there is no point in having quality bus corridors if there is an insufficient number of buses. We need to order more buses. Empty bus corridors are a major source of annoyance to drivers.</P>
      <P>In the longer term it is good policy to move people from private to public transport. It is unrealistic to expect people to change to public transport if the public transport service does not get them to work and around the city. We need to take the initiative on school transport. Commuters are clogging up the roads bringing children to and from schools, because they have no alternative. We need a plan at national level to deal with this issue with proper consultation and liaison between the Department dealing with transport and the schools.  There is a great deal more to say, but my main point is that urgent action is needed and the measures outlined by my colleagues would make a difference.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I join others in complimenting my colleagues Deputies Yates and Olivia Mitchell for keeping high on the agenda the issue of traffic gridlock and public transport in Dublin. As we approach the end of another Dáil year I regret there has been little action on this issue by the Coalition Government. I left home this morning at 8.10 a.m. and arrived at Newlands Cross at 8.50 a.m. It took me until 10.35 a.m. to arrive in <Col N="474" /> Leinster House, the Order of Business was under way. This is unbelievable. Despite Deputy Yates, Deputy Olivia Mitchell and others keeping this matter high on the agenda for the last 12 months or more, it is extraordinary that little or nothing has been done by way of initiative by the present Government.</P>
      <P>Iarnród Éireann is chopping and changing timetables in a high-handed manner, with little regard to the needs of the public. In my town, Portlaoise, over 2,000 private sector houses are currently being built and many people commute daily to Dublin. A major reason for people moving to Portlaoise is the quality of life available in the midlands, which is not available in Dublin, and Portlaoise is a good commuter town because of the rapid rail service to the capital. Without consultation or regard for the public's wishes, Iarnród Éireann decided that the 5.30 p.m. train from Dublin to Cork will no longer stop at Portlaoise and that commuters will have to make alternative arrangements. This is a gross interference with and diminution of the quality of life of those commuting daily from the town. I call on the company to reverse that decision.</P>
      <P>A number of my constituents in County Offaly have complained that Bus Éireann buses no longer stop at request stops in Rochfortbridge and Milltownpass on the Galway-Dublin route. Old age pensioners in particular are discommoded when the buses refuse to stop, again for reasons which have not been made known to consumers. Bus Éireann should act to ensure consumers can use the public transport system.</P>
      <P>Packed trains are also causing difficulties for my constituents. The Friday Dublin-Cork train is full when it leaves Heuston Station and when it gets to Portlaoise there is no room for anyone wishing to board. Similarly, commuters in County Offaly using the Galway-Dublin train on Sunday evenings and Monday mornings pay the full fare but have no chance of seats.</P>
      <P>The Minister must allow for the smooth running of CIE by making funds available for badly needed investment. The inability of Bus Éireann and Iarnród Éireann to cater for consumers is keeping people on the road in cars, because public transport is not a viable alternative. By excluding commuters from the train in Portlaoise, CIE consigns them to cars, which means up to another 200 cars travelling to Dublin every day. CIE has no regard for the provision of a quality service to the consumer.</P>

      <P>Again I make the case for Cork. On a number of occasions I have mentioned the need to reopen the rail link from Cork to Midleton and Youghal, which are becoming satellite towns of the city and are growing at a phenomenal rate. The transport deficit into Cork is worrying. The city is being choked; every morning we hear of major tailbacks at Dunkettle and Tivoli, and people in my constituency are suffering greatly as a result. Businesses in the city and <Col N="475" /> in east Cork are also affected. People cannot reach their destinations on time and they spend many hours in cars.</P>
      <P>The answer is to reopen the rail link to Midleton. Over 12 months ago I was told, on an Adjournment Debate, that this would cost £8 million. The Minister said at that time that the reopening of the rail link to Cobh in 1996, by the previous Government, was a major success and traffic had increased by 20 per cent in 12 months. I ask the Minister to do something similar for the Midleton-Youghal link. He should make the money available and look to the future. Public transport has been analysed and investigated to death, it is now time for action. We want to see trains on the tracks, particularly on that track.</P>
      <P>Cork city is running out of parking space and people do not want to bring their cars into the city but they have no choice. The answer is to open the rail link and I plead with the Minister to make a political decision to do this because that is what it will take. This Government should have the courage of its convictions and take action. It has been in office for two years yet nothing has been done in this area.</P>
      <P>Tourism and industry are suffering. Students are suffering also &ndash; they cannot make their lectures or examinations on time, they must rise at an ungodly hour to get in before the traffic jams. The problems Dublin is experiencing now are beginning in Cork, so we should act before it is too late. Industries are refusing to locate in Ireland because of our traffic gridlock. This is the Government's fault because it is doing nothing; it is not showing leadership nor is it taking any action. It has been up to the Opposition to show initiative.</P>
      <P>All groups in east Cork and the city are asking the Government to take action on the rail link. The UDCs in Youghal and Midleton, the chambers of commerce in Youghal, Midleton, Cobh and Cork city, the county council, and Cork Corporation have all called for action but the Government is deaf. I ask it to listen.</P>

In essence, cars are glorified wheelchairs &ndash; they are a necessity because they provide mobility for those who live too far from their work, schools, their relatives or public transport. If there were huge sales of wheelchairs I do not think Deputy Hanafin would say that was an indication of the success of the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The costs of transport must be taken into account. Some £7,000 million is spent on cars but only £500 million on public transport. There is a great imbalance and everyone talks about the need to redress it. The costs are further added to when one considers that Dublin businesses estimate losses of £1.2 billion as a result of traffic <Col N="476" /> congestion, and that Earthwatch estimates that the resulting noise and air pollution costs £220 million. That does not include the many lives lost and the people who suffer brain damage and other injuries from traffic accidents.</P>
    <P>The support received by public transport is often the source of arguments in this House. The chief executive of CIE, in a letter to Members of the Joint Committee on Public Enterprise and Transport, wrote:</P>
    <P>CIE's subvention in 1987 was £116 million. Ten years later, in 1998, through the course of a number of administrations, it was £107 million. Taking account of inflation it should have been over £150 million.</P>
    <P>This is another huge loss of resources but instead of responding to the obvious need, the Government has found ways of putting a good face on matters while CIE's resources have been downgraded.</P>
    <P>The ESRI has pointed out the needs in this area and highlighted the absence of a detailed physical plan for urban development, a matter for which the Government has clear responsibility. The ESRI stated that in the future there will be a huge increase in car traffic. That eventuality must be responded to by means of legislation to stem the rise in traffic volumes. The ESRI also highlighted a number of issues which have been debated publicly for a long period. For example, the park and ride capacity is woefully inadequate at many suburban rail stations in north Dublin. The DART could easily be extended to Drogheda because, from an engineering point of view, no major work would be required and there is a major need for access to Dublin Airport and Swords. For a number of years calls have been made to provide these basic services and I ask the Government to respond to people's needs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since coming to office less than two years ago, the Government has acted with vision and determination to tackle the transport challenges facing the greater Dublin area. We immediately responded to the short-term action plan prepared by the Dublin Transportation Office by providing over £70 million of investment in buses, suburban rail and cycle facilities, which the office recommended. For the first time the Exchequer has provided direct capital funding for bus and rail investment. Under previous Governments this funding would have had to be met from CIE's resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In all, 12 quality bus corridors will be completed by the end of 2000. The Malahide Road and Lucan corridors are already in place and further QBCs, including those to Rathfarnham, Tallaght, and north Finglas, will be completed this year with the remainder being completed next year. The bus fleet is also being increased. Already 32 of the 150 additional buses which have been ordered have been delivered with the <Col N="477" /> remainder being delivered in phases throughout the year.</P>
    <P>A major investment programme on DART and suburban rail has already been put in place and is continuing. The Maynooth line is being upgraded, with the provision of double track from Clonsilla to Maynooth. New stations have been provided and work has commenced on the development of Barrow Street station between Pearse Station, and Lansdowne Road station. Twenty six new DART carriages have been ordered and will be used to enhance existing services and to cater for the extended DART network to Malahide and Greystones. The light rail project is proceeding in line with the indicative timetable set out last year. The way is now clear to build the Tallaght line, and approval has been given to order light railway vehicles. The public inquiry on the Sandyford line is nearing completion.</P>
    <P>My colleague Deputy Dempsey, Minister for the Environment and Local Government, together with the local and regional authorities in the greater Dublin area, commissioned the preparation of the strategic planning guidelines. These guidelines for the first time provide the land use planning framework for the development of our capital city and the surrounding area.</P>
    <P>My Department supported the development of real time passenger information for the suburban rail and bus networks. It is already in use on the DART and is being extended. The system for buses has been in development in Bus Átha Cliath for some time with financial support from the Exchequer. The necessary design work is nearing completion and the system will be put into operation later this year on the Lucan QBC initially.</P>
    <P>The public transport requirements of the other major urban areas of Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford will also be considered in the preparation of the national development plan. Last month, the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, announced that the Government had given its approval for costing and feasibility work on a major suburban rail development programme, taking account of the recommendations of the strategic planning guidelines. The Dublin Transportation Office is nearing completion of a comprehensive investment plan for the period 2000 to 2006 which will be considered by the Government when preparing the national development plan.</P>
    <P>While a great deal has been achieved in the past few years, much more remains to be done. We are, therefore, continuing to plan for the future. The Government can be relied on to provide a properly planned and co-ordinated response to the transport challenges in our major urban areas. We will set out a clear strategy to address these problems in the forthcoming national development plan when we have received and considered the detailed proposals of agencies such as the DTO. Our record to date shows that we are committed to investment in our transport system.</P>

      <P>I support the motion tabled by Deputies Yates and Olivia Mitchell. There is no doubt that the motion deals with one of the most serious problems in our country which is causing major concern to people. We must remember that this motion on public transport, transport capacity and traffic flow does not merely apply to our capital city, Dublin, it applies to every city, town and main traffic artery throughout the country.</P>
      <P>Due to the lack of investment in infrastructure in recent decades, we have created traffic chaos and commuters are now faced with almost total gridlock. Every day people must endure traffic jams, queues, delays, congestion, overcrowding, waiting and all that goes with an almost unworkable traffic management plan. People are finding it increasingly difficult to travel to their destination by private or public transport. For example, when driving from Dublin to Cashel in my constituency it takes up to 90 minutes to pass through Kildare and Monasterevin, and that does not take account of the time delay in travelling from one's starting point in the city to the N24.</P>
      <P>In the past, delays were confined to peak traffic times but now they occur all day, every day. Let us now consider the case of a person taking public transport and using Iarnród Éireann. For my example I choose last Friday evening, the beginning of the bank holiday weekend, when one would have expected Iarnród Éireann to have made the necessary arrangements to cater for the increase in the numbers using its services. However, on the Dublin to Cork train last Friday evening, I witnessed serious overcrowding and I believe that the basic ground rules governing safety were ignored by Iarnród Éireann. All corridors and entrances were packed with passengers and luggage. It was impossible to move from one carriage to the next and one thing was certain, in the event of an emergency there would have been no escape.</P>
      <P>Is this acceptable? People who paid for a seat on the train were obliged to stand. Does anyone care anymore? Those who were fortunate to obtain a seat had been obliged to stand in a queue for 90 minutes before the train departed. Where are the facilities for the disabled, the sick and those who are not able to try to secure a seat? Many of the passengers dreaded the thoughts of returning to Dublin on Monday because they knew they would be obliged to stand for the entire journey.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On wet days, passengers have no option but to stand in the rain outside Heuston Station waiting to be catered for by an appalling taxi service. Again, there are no facilities for those unable to gain access to taxis. In my opinion, the taxi business is the most protected monopoly in town. <Col N="479" /> From recent experience I believe that taxi companies do not always log one's booking because business is too good. People are left waiting in the hope that a taxi will eventually arrive. The excuses never change, it is always a busy period, the weather is causing additional demands or the service is slow due to traffic congestion.</P>
    <P>We must accept the one major problem in terms of taxis and hackneys, namely, that there are insufficient numbers of both on our roads. Someone must take the initiative and confront the inadequate taxi service available to commuters. However, no one seems to consider the rights of commuters; there seems to be a need to protect vested interests.</P>
    <P>In my constituency, Clonmel &ndash; one of the most thriving towns in the country &ndash; might as well be an island in terms of traffic and travel facilities. The railway station is almost derelict and I cannot understand why it is not dealt with under the Derelict Sites Act. One passenger train passes through the station each day and it is impossible to travel by rail from Clonmel to Dublin. We need a modern railway station and a feeder service to Limerick Junction.</P>
    <P>The proposals in the motion before the House will help to alleviate some of the congestion on our streets and roads and some of the frustration felt by commuters. I congratulate Deputies Yates and Mitchell on bringing forward realistic, logical and implementable proposals. I urge the Government to support the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Deputies Yates and Mitchell on bringing forward this very important motion. Ireland continues to have a substantial infrastructural deficit compared to the most developed member states of the European Union, despite the rapid convergence of average income levels as a result of rapid economic growth. There has also been rapid growth in transport, the built environment and energy needs. Fine Gael has proposed a major overhaul of public transport with the establishment of an independent authority along the lines of the Independent Radio and Television Commission to regulate a new competitive regime for road passenger movement. That is urgently required.</P>
      <P>Deputy Yates has called for the updating of the Road Transport Act, 1932. There is concern about the isolation suffered by many people who do not have access to a car, particularly those living in rural areas. The allocation of £100 million over five years to develop public transport should be shared between CIE and licensed private bus operators. Competition rather than privatisation is important. Being in business, I appreciate that competition is the life of trade. Introducing competition into this sector would be the best way to reform CIE. Public transport is a large business. Having regard to the number of cars on our roads, if groups had to competitively fight for business, the sector would be much more efficient and stronger.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="480" /> In regard to Sligo, while I welcome the major Curlew bypass and the Collooney bypass, the issue of an inner relief road has been one of major concern to people in Sligo town for the past 20 years. Sligo is heavily congested. The volume of traffic reaches nightmare levels on weekdays and weekends between 4 p.m. and 6 p.m. Decisiveness by the National Road Authority to address this problem is urgently required.</P>
    <P>I was concerned by a recent comment made by Mr. Flynn, an engineer with the National Road Authority. He said that public transport was not a viable alternative in the Sligo context. That is an incredible statement, but he conceded that a weakness of the NRA is that its responsibility extends only to roads and public transport is a matter for someone else. Greater co-ordination is required. There should be an established link between the National Roads Authority and CIE. The amount of congestion in Sligo town is unbelievable and it is incredible that it was stated that public transport is not a viable alternative in that context. Our party leader indicated the necessity for a proper public transport service in rural areas, between villages and towns.</P>
    <P>Traffic congestion curbs economic growth. Having regard to our skills shortage, traffic congestion had begun to create significant difficulties in marketing Ireland to investors.  Investors who have seen the chaos in Sligo town have decided not to invest there because of various problems, including the basic problem of people finding it difficult to get to work on time.  Potential employers are factoring in traffic difficulties when making a decision on job offers. Deputy Flanagan stated that it took him from 8.10 a.m. to 11.35 a.m. to get to Leinster House. That establishes my point.</P>
    <P>Greater co-ordination is needed between the National Roads Authority and CIE in terms of investment plans. I welcome the major investment on the Sligo-Dublin rail line. The most important and startling fact in that context is that according to Iarnód Éireann approximately 500,000 passengers travel on the Sligo-Dublin line every year. Since 1990 passenger numbers have increased by 33 per cent. If those new customers were lost to the railway, that would be an additional 54,000 car movements in and out of Dublin. Such investment is urgently required on that line. Rail travel is a luxurious way to travel. CIE might examine investing more frequently in light rail carriages than in large rail carriages that are mainly used. I welcome the announcement of investment in the service from Longford to Carrick-on-Shannon and the commitment to a service from Carrick-on-Shannon to Sligo. This service was never more urgently required.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all the Deputies who spoke on this debate, especially those who supported the motion. I thank the Labour Party and the Green Party for their support. First, I must respond to the Minister's amendment and her response to the motion. The Minister does not <Col N="481" /> understand the feeling of road rage. We heard Members' personal anecdotes. I had a meeting at 10 a.m. with a person who was coming into Dublin Airport. He rang me at 10.20 to say he had left Dublin Airport at 8.30 a.m. and he would not be able to get here on time. That is only one of many anecdotes we have heard in this debate alone.</P>
      <P>The Minister does not seem to understand that people are getting so irate with the grinding halt of Dublin traffic gridlock. Her amendment is utterly smug and complacent to the point of being indifferent to the problem. New words have entered the lexicon, namely, &ldquo;decommitting&rdquo; Luas. &ldquo;Abort&rdquo; is the word I would use. The £221 million provided by the previous Government, including European funds, has been spent over and over again. This is the first time we have an Exchequer surplus, but the same amount of money will be spent on a few extra rail cars and buses. That is the money of which the Minister has made such play.</P>
      <P>There has not been any new initiative, except the Atkins report and the Andersen report of a study into Luas and a decision to put it back until 2005 and beyond the time of the next general election, no matter how short or long a period that may be. The Government has made no impact on addressing the problem of traffic gridlock. The economic barrier to the development of this and other major cities because of traffic gridlock and the sheer erosion of the quality and efficiency of lifestyles in Dublin because of traffic gridlock is appalling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have the nearest thing I have ever seen to Euro Disney in Ireland in proposals, which some people have taken seriously. The Minister said that the strategic planning guidelines include a number of suggestions for improving the suburban rail network in the longer term. She said that while these are only at a conceptual basis and require detailed and technical economic feasibility work, they point the way forward. Her spin people announced a new inland rail link to Navan. The people of Navan are expecting this. <Col N="482" /> They have announced a new rail link via the Belfast line to Swords and Dublin Airport, quadrupling the existing Dublin lines where reasonable. When I asked CIE when these would be put in place, I was told they would not happen within a decade. I was told there is no money and no design. Some of these proposals are the result of a school project. CIE was asked for information. A student from Dunleer wrote to CIE for information about 2020 thinking on public transport in Dublin. The Minister then asked if there were any new ideas and this was put into a Euro Disney-like proposal. It is not a reality. The Minister flaps and waffles as if she is doing something about this.</P>
    <P>This motion sets out something that is possible to achieve. We need to spend about £4 billion on public transport to bring it up to modern European standards. A total of £140 million can be spent now. Eleven quality bus corridors could be put in place and an additional 250 new buses articulated in double deckers could be provided. A real time information service could be provided by a speaker, similar to that on the DART, which would state that a bus will arrive in a few minutes. A satellite controlled vehicle tracking system could be provided.</P>
    <P>The flow of traffic in Dublin and other cities, including Cork, Limerick and Waterford, could be improved by the provision of a second helicopter to have a proper operation freeflow all year around. We have costed all these measures, the price of buses, real time information and all the nuts and bolts, and put this forward in a very practical proposal. The money is there. We have never had an Exchequer surplus of £1 billion. There could be an Exchequer surplus of £2 billion depending on whether the Government sells 20 per cent or 35 per cent of Telecom Éireann. However, this issue is a matter of political indifference. This will be a key issue in the European and local elections. We will bring this issue to the doorsteps because the Government, particularly the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, does not know or care about this issue.</P>

    <Title>Architectural Heritage (National Inventory) and Historic Monuments (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 1998  [  Seanad ]  : Second Stage</Title>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to open this debate on Second Stage of the Architectural Heritage (National Inventory) and Historical Monuments (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill. The introduction of the Bill in the Dáil today represents an important step forward in meeting the commitments to the protection of our built heritage set out in the programme for Government, An Action Programme for the Millennium. Those commitments are to protect and enhance our built heritage and environment, give full legal protection to sites of artistic, heritage and historic interest, and introduce measures to promote the preservation of our historic dwellings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As we put in place the individual mechanisms for achieving these ambitious aims, it is essential to keep in mind the importance of the agenda we have set. While considering the detail of each proposal we need to keep in mind the importance of our architectural heritage as a cornerstone for our understanding of the past. Every small town in Ireland has its own memories and tells its own story through the unique combination of urban <Col N="485" /> life and culture, its structure, street pattern and the variety, type, style and craftsmanship of its buildings. In a period of such growth as we are currently experiencing in Ireland, it is important to proactively maintain, manage and develop the cultural and historical quality of our environment.</P>
    <P>The importance of the built heritage, not only at local and national but also at European and international level, is clearly expressed in the Convention for the Protection of the Architectural Heritage of Europe, the Granada convention, which Ireland ratified in 1997. The convention recognises that &ldquo;the architectural heritage constitutes an irreplaceable expression of the richness and diversity of Europe's cultural heritage, bears inestimable witness to our past and is a common heritage of all Europeans&rdquo;. We owe it to ourselves and to those coming after us to take responsibility, both personally and collectively, for the shape, nature and quality of the environment in which we live and which we pass on to future generations.</P>
    <P>While we have, unfortunately, on many occasions in the past not taken seriously enough the importance of conserving our built heritage we are, as a nation, changing our attitudes. In recent years there has been a notable shift at all levels towards a more positive and active approach to ensuring the future of our historic buildings, and I believe a recognition of the social and economic benefits of such conservation is developing in the nation's consciousness.</P>
    <P>Against that background, an interdepartmental working group on strengthening the protection of the architectural heritage reported in 1996 on current policies and procedures and made recommendations as to the way forward. Drawing from the recommendations in that report and the subsequent public consultation process, I and my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, brought forward to Government and obtained agreement on a package of legislative, financial and administrative measures for the protection of the architectural heritage which we announced in May of last year.</P>
    <P>The legislative measures involved the enactment of a Bill to place the national inventory of architectural heritage on a statutory basis. This is the Bill before the House today. The national inventory of architectural heritage, a systematic recording of the architectural heritage of the State, was commenced in 1990 on a non-statutory basis, with limited resources and no rights of access to property for the purposes of recording, for example, interiors of buildings. In addition, a new planning Bill to give comprehensive protection to buildings of architectural, artistic and historic importance was introduced in the Seanad in December of last year by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.</P>
    <P>The new planning Bill will strengthen existing local authority policies and procedures for conserving the architectural heritage. There will be a clear obligation on each planning authority to <Col N="486" /> establish and maintain a record of protected structures as part of its development plan; a co-ordinated approach to this new system will be ensured through the provision of national guidance issued by the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands in consultation with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. Local authorities will be required to have regard to such guidance in the establishment of the record of protected structures.</P>
    <P>In addition, local authorities will be obliged to have regard to individual structures recommended for protection by the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands. The Deputies will note the close co-operation which the new protective regime entails between the two Departments. The Bill is at the centre of this co-operative approach.</P>
    <P>The effective implementation of these new measures requires a knowledge and understanding of our built environment. If we do not know and understand what we have, we are not in a position to decide what to protect and how we should protect it. An inventory is a basic and essential management tool for any resource which facilitates the formulation and implementation of policy. Therefore, a systematic programme of identification, classification and evaluation of the architectural heritage is essential to making informed judgments and establishing a planned programme of preservation using a combination of legislative safeguards and financial incentives. This Bill will place the National Inventory of Architectural Heritage on a statutory basis and will provide this systematic recording nationally.</P>
    <P>The new protection measures also include the establishment of a new grant-aid scheme for approved conservation works to protected structures. This scheme, for which the Minister for the Environment and Local Government has primary responsibility, will commence in 1999, be administered by the local authorities, have funding of approximately £4 million per annum, and will be operated in accordance with national criteria and standards drawn up by an advisory group made up of representatives of my Department, the Department of the Environment and Local Government and the Heritage Council. Details of the scheme are currently being finalised and will be announced shortly.</P>
    <P>The full package of measures for the protection of the architectural heritage, of which the Bill is a key element, also provides for annual funding of £800,000 to my Department to ensure that a full record of the architectural heritage, the National Inventory of Architectural Heritage, is completed within 12 years, to resource the key role which the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands will perform in recommending buildings to planning authorities for protection, and in providing advice to local authorities on development proposals affecting protected buildings. An accelerated interim inven<Col N="487" /> tory of each county will be completed as a priority, pending completion of the full inventory.</P>
    <P>The main features of the Bill are: the National Inventory of Architectural Heritage, a systematic recording of the architectural heritage of the State will be placed on a statutory basis; legal rights of access to buildings by duly authorised officers will be established for the purpose of preparing the inventory; local authorities serving a dangerous building notice on a building entered in the Register of Historic Monuments must notify the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands of the issue of the notice; and local authorities carrying out work on a dangerous building which is a registered historic monument must, in so far as possible, preserve the building, having regard to public safety requirements.</P>
    <P>As I stated previously, the National Inventory of Architectural Heritage will identify those buildings which the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands will recommend to local authorities for protection under the new planning legislation. A new regime for the protection of the architectural heritage must have at its core a comprehensive and detailed record of the stock of buildings which constitute the architectural heritage of the State. The creation of this record must be made a priority. As we move into the new millennium we must ensure that we are in a position to conserve our architecture for future generations by providing the essential database required for the planned management and protection of our architectural heritage. It is vital that a full and detailed record of our national architectural heritage is available to those involved in the protection of that heritage for this and future generations.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a vital element in the fulfilment of the commitment in the programme for Government to the protection of our architectural heritage. It will also ensure that we meet our commitment to identify properties for protection under the Convention for the Protection of the Architectural Heritage of Europe, the Granada convention, which Ireland ratified in January 1997.</P>
    <P>I will now deal with the main provisions of the Bill. Section 1 is the interpretation provision. It includes a definition of &ldquo;architectural heritage&rdquo; as meaning structures and buildings, together with their settings, grounds, fixtures and fittings, groups of such structures and buildings, and sites, which are of architectural, historical, archaeological, artistic, scientific or technical interest. This definition is similar to that in the Granada convention.</P>
    <P>Section 2 provides for the establishment and maintenance of the National Inventory of Architectural Heritage by the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands and for the making available and publication by the Minister of information from the inventory.</P>
    <P>Section 2(1) provides that the Minister shall cause to be established and maintained an inven<Col N="488" /> tory to be known as the National Inventory of Architectural Heritage. Section 2(2) provides that the Minister may do any or all of the following: (a) determine the form and content of the inventory; (b) designate for the purposes of the inventory categories of architectural heritage; (c) cause the designated category or categories to which each entry in the inventory belongs to be specified in the inventory; and (d) cause an entry in the inventory to be amended or deleted.</P>
    <P>Section 3(3) provides that the Minister may: (a) make information contained in the inventory available to a planning authority but solely for the purpose of the exercise by the authority of its statutory functions, including planning and development, relating to architectural heritage; and (b) publish information from the inventory and in so doing shall have regard to the security, privacy and safety of property and persons affected.</P>
    <P>The Local Government (Planning and Development) Bill, 1998, deals with the system of protected structures, and provides that the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands may recommend specific structures for inclusion by planning authorities in their records of protected structures. These recommendations will be based on the data in the National Inventory of Architectural Heritage.</P>
    <P>Section 3 provides for the appointment by the Minister, or by an authorised officer of the Minister, of authorised officers and for the powers and functions of such officers. Section 3(1) provides that the Minister, or an officer of the Minister authorised by him or her in that behalf, may, in writing, appoint persons as authorised officers for the purposes of this section.</P>
    <P>Section 3(2) provides that every person appointed under subsection (1) shall, on appointment, be provided by the Minister or the appointing officer, as the case may be, with a certificate of appointment. Section 3(3) provides that, when exercising a function conferred by this section, an authorised officer shall, if requested by any person affected, inform such person of the nature of the function being exercised and produce for inspection that officer's certificate of appointment.</P>
    <P>Section 3(4) provides that, subject to subsection (5), an authorised officer may do any or all of the following: (a) at all reasonable times enter any premises for the purposes of the establishment and maintenance of the inventory; (b) in any premises entered under this section do all things necessary for or incidental to those purposes; (c) require any occupier of the premises to give the authorised officer such assistance as he or she may reasonably require for those purposes.</P>
    <P>Section 3(5) to 3(8) restrict the right of access of authorised officers in respect of private dwellings by providing that such access shall be subject to the consent of the occupier or in accordance with a warrant issued by the District Court pursuant to an application under this section. They also provide <Col N="489" /> that an authorised officer shall, in the case of a private dwelling, inform the occupier of the nature of his or her functions and of the reasons for entry and afford the occupier the opportunity to give reasons entry should be refused.</P>
    <P>Section 4 makes it an offence, subject to a fine not exceeding £1,500 on summary conviction, to obstruct or interfere with an authorised officer carrying out his functions under section 3, or to fail to assist an authorised officer without reasonable excuse. Proceedings in respect of a summary offence under this section may be brought and prosecuted by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Section 5 places obligations on sanitary authorities in respect of registered historic monuments subject to dangerous building notices, and in respect of works on such monuments. The obligations are consultative in nature given the importance that must, of course, be attached to the safety of people and property even when the danger arises from a registered historic monument.</P>
    <P>Subsection (1) is the interpretation provision and provides <i>inter alia</i> that for the purposes of the section &ldquo;monument&rdquo; means any historic monument entered in the register of historic monuments under section 5 of the National Monuments (Amendment) Act, 1987. Subsection (2) provides that as soon as practicable after serving or proposing to serve a dangerous building notice under section 3 (1) of the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Act, 1964, in respect of a monument, a sanitary authority shall inform the Minister of the particulars of the notice.</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) provides that a sanitary authority which under section 3 (2) of the 1964 Act carries out works on a monument shall as far as possible preserve the monument in as much as its preservation is not likely to cause a danger to any person or property. Subsection (4) provides that as soon as practicable after carrying out works under section 3 (2) of the 1964 Act on a monument, a sanitary authority shall inform the Minister of the works which have been carried out.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I wish to again stress the importance of this short Bill in the context of the Government's package of measures for the protection of the architectural heritage. As I have stated, it is vital that a full and detailed record of our architectural heritage is available to those involved in the protection of that heritage for this and future generations. The National lnventory of Architectural Heritage, which will be given a statutory basis under the present Bill and the carrying out of which will be accelerated over the coming years, will provide that detailed record.</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill to the House and I look forward to the support of Deputies for its passage through this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">

      <P>This legislation is timely. It is a small but important Bill which is long overdue and it will have the support of this side of the House. I note the Minister's speech was the same as the one she gave in the Seanad when she introduced the Bill, except for a few minor changes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the same Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I know but many comments were made in the Seanad when she introduced the Bill. Perhaps she could have changed her speech a little more. When one travels around this country, the number of different kinds of buildings of historic, architectural and artistic importance one passes is amazing. The Minister is right that in every town and village there are places which mean something to people. They are part of our roots and reflect our personality. It is right that these should be listed and that people should be aware of them. I support the signing of the Granada Convention and its implementation on a statutory basis in this Bill.</P>
      <P>When I was pressurised by ministerial business I had the privilege of travelling to various functions by helicopter. I travelled over parts of the country through which one would not normally drive. I saw a huge number of big old houses, many in ruins but others still occupied. I do not know who lives in them and their history in many cases is long and infamous. It is important to have these buildings listed.</P>
      <P>The introduction of legislation such as this receives a general welcome from all the various bodies and organisations associated with this kind of activity because they see it is worthwhile. However, the real demonstration of how serious one is is to provide the resources to implement it. I support the grant aid scheme of £4 million in 1999. This is worthwhile and will have a huge take-up. One could spend £500,000 or £600,000 repairing roofs, stonework, steps, etc., of houses which are 200 or 300 years old.</P>
      <P>Is there a limit on the grant which can be acquired? What other conditions are attached? Does the building have to examined by an architectural historian or conservation officer? Buildings less than 100 years old might be socially or technically important and may have been burned down or become dilapidated. If a community group or conservation organisation wishes to restore it, what criteria apply?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said in the earlier debate on transport, too many people think we have arrived at a point where we are a developed country because of the explosion in the economy and the amount of building which is taking place. We are a long way from that. If one compares our standards with Germany and other developed countries in Europe, we still have a long way to go. There is a need for Ireland to be able to draw down funds <Col N="491" /> from particular EU programmes. This is one such area.</P>
    <P>The explosion of planning applications can be seen in every provincial paper. While there used to be half a dozen planning applications for bungalows and houses, there are now columns of applications for 50 or 100 houses or changes in house type. If this continues, and I hope it will, for another 12 years to 2010 and 2011, we could have had five Governments by then given the uncertainty of these matters. The planning process may well have destroyed the settings, grounds and in some cases, the buildings referred to in the proposed national inventory list.</P>
    <P>I am not sure of the mechanics of this. For example, a local authority or the Department says building X in County Kilkenny is to be examined for listing in terms of its international, regional or local importance. I understand there are three stages involved. One person fills out a form which complies with various international standards and deals with location, size, number of rooms, etc. That is then checked by someone else. If there is a disagreement between these two people an adjudicator makes a decision in order to keep the information levels up to a national standard. It is right and proper that there is a national standard of information relevant to all these matters. However, I do not understand, if this has been collected on a non-statutory basis, admittedly with very limited resources, for the past nine years, how it is going to take another 12 to complete it. This is a relatively small island, although there are thousands of buildings. Providing the resources to enable this to happen would be a demonstration of how effective this legislation will be and how the Minister can make her mark on the creation of this inventory.</P>
    <P>The Minister said in reply to a recent question by her esteemed constituency colleague, Deputy Donal Carey, that conservation officers, as distinct from architectural historians, would need to be appointed to some individual local authorities but they could be shared in some cases. That may well be so, depending on the size of the local authority or the number of buildings. However, universities and other third level institutions which run programmes related to arts, heritage and culture should be able to supply personnel to carry out the initial checks on buildings that are potentially listable under the national inventory, which would greatly speed up the process.</P>
    <P>The Minister is carrying out an interim inventory at the moment, which she says is to be expedited. What does that mean in terms of resources for the Department and local authorities? As I understand it, one person in the Department is dealing with this, with the assistance of secretarial staff and field assistants. If the interim inventory is to be expedited and prioritised, what extra personnel are to be appointed? Has any county completed collection on a non-statutory basis in the past nine years? Will the Minister report at the end of Second Stage, or <Col N="492" /> supply the information to us whenever it is available, on the situation in each local authority area? The chief architect in my own local authority area told me there is a short list of protected buildings, which does not include all the buildings that should be protected. What extra resources, in terms of personnel, are being supplied by the Department for the Minister to expedite the interim inventory list? How is it proposed that that be done through each local authority?</P>
    <P>How has the 12 year schedule been determined? In 12 years' time &ndash; 2011 &ndash; this country will have changed radically. The number of cranes on the horizon of Dublin and many other towns and cities may continue to increase. The explanatory memorandum refers to structures and buildings, together with their settings, grounds, fixtures and fittings, groups of such structures and buildings and sites. Groups of new houses of different types of architecture, with different colours, Spanish arches, columns, bricks and so on, are often built up against very old buildings and the two styles completely contrast. If that continues, this element of the Bill will not be able to be implemented. I would like to tease out how it was determined that this will take 12 years. Is it based on the information collected in a non-statutory way to date? Have there been meetings with the local authorities?</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister has included in the Bill that her Department must be notified about planning applications for dangerous buildings. We have all witnessed cases where contractors or builders acquire large buildings, are refused or decide not to apply for planning permission and let the buildings become run down, with the roofs removed and the windows smashed. The buildings then become unstable and dangerous and notice is served to have them demolished. That has been a deliberate policy in some cases, much to the detriment of the work the Minister is trying to do in this Bill. It is important that local authorities are required to notify the Department of proposals in this regard.</P>
    <P>I am interested in the interiors of many of these buildings. When one passes by on the roadside one sees the external features of buildings, which may be old, grey, beaten down and warped. The owners of these buildings may apply for a grant under the scheme, which may be approved. What powers do the personnel, to be appointed under the Bill, have to enter a 300 year old house and take photographs of the plasterwork, the door lintels and other features? The owner may have radically changed the interior of the house, with a different colour scheme and so on, in the past 20 years without requiring planning permission. A house could be in pristine condition, from an architectural and historic point of view, and an officer could get the agreement of the owner to look at the house, note the features and so on. The house could then be sold and the new owner could decide to change it completely by putting in modern facilities, such as water and heating, knocking down some of the internal walls to <Col N="493" /> make the rooms bigger and so on. Are powers in that regard given under the Bill to conservation officers or architectural historians who will carry out this work?</P>
    <P>The listing of a building brings with it benefits but it also brings with it disadvantages. If building X is listed on the inventory, people looking for their genealogical roots or for information about their place of ancestry may decide to visit it. That could result in many people arriving at a building listed on the inventory, although it might be a private building which is not publicly accessible. That could be a disadvantage. What is the position in that regard, although owners obviously have a right to refuse access? What does it mean to list a building? That could cause difficulty, depending on the diplomacy of the personnel who call for the purposes of the inventory.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy Dempsey, put through a planning Bill to give protection to architecturally important buildings. It is essential that local authorities, which are referred to in the original Act as &ldquo;sanitary authorities&rdquo;, understand how important this is. Development is leading planning in so many local authorities that it has surpassed the remit and responsibility of councillors. While councillors, the elected representatives of the people, may have particularly strong views for or against a development, the executive authority of the local authority and the planning officer can overrule their wishes in many cases. It then goes to An Bord Pleanála, if that is the case. There is a need for parallel co-ordination so that the local authority fully appreciates, in terms of its planning for future development, the importance of the consequences of this Bill and the setting up of the inventory.</P>
    <P>When one drives through Ballsbridge one can see the RDS buildings, the new hotel and the development by Bewleys. Further down the road, on its right hand side, one can see the architectural wonder of the British Embassy which replaced the old original building. I am not an architect and I am not qualified to speak authoritatively on streetscapes and so forth, but that building looks completely out of place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>It was a disgraceful planning decision. That is not to say the British Government is not entitled to an embassy, but the current structure is appalling and does not complement the fine buildings on that road and throughout the locality. If this legislation had been in force when that building was contemplated, it would not have been built. The local authority would more than likely have decided the original buildings were of architectural importance and, while development could have taken place, it would not have permitted the current structure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The information is to be compiled in each local authority area. If owners of listed buildings wish to extend the buildings, who will give authoris<Col N="494" /> ation for that adjustment? Will it be the planning office in the local authority or the officer who listed the building in the national inventory? Let us say a building is listed as one of international importance and for whatever reason its owners decide to extend or change it. Is that still strictly a matter for the planning authority? Must it take cognisance of the category of listing determined in the case of that building? What legal restrictions on that type of development can be enforced under this legislation?</P>
    <P>The proposal for a 12 year period should be reduced to about five years. Is it intended that this period should operate on a 26 county basis? Is it envisaged that each county will do the work at the same time or that the inventory will be compiled progressively by moving through the country, county by county or province by province?</P>
    <P>It is important that qualified personnel are available to local authorities to carry out this work properly. Students from third level institutions could be utilised to analyse the information so it can be categorised correctly. Is it proposed to hold examinations and interviews for qualified personnel for the local authorities? When can one expect these qualified personnel to be put in place in individual local authority areas or are they to be shared by a number of local authorities? Is there a public examination for these positions? Are there enough qualified personnel to do this work? Does the Minister expect to secure the resources to fund that? Will the resources come from the Department of the Environment and Local Government or from the Minister's Vote? Has a case been made to the Department of Finance to provide for it?</P>
    <P>I support the legislation, but it is critical that the Minister is given the resources and facilities to ensure it is implemented in the shortest time and most effective manner possible. This country is developing at a ferocious rate and many of these buildings could fall prey to the bulldozers, as happened on many other occasions.</P>
    <P>I read the Official Report of the debate on this legislation in the Seanad, in which references were made to a number of successful operations. I opened King House in Boyle when I was Minister. It is a first class concept. There are also indications that applications will be lodged for Moore Hall, the home of the first president of Connacht on the shores of Lough Carra. These are worthy but costly operations.</P>
    <P>We can tease out the details of the legislation on Committee Stage, but I hope the Minister can deal with the general questions I raised when she replies to this debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have preferred more time to discuss this subject because I have a great interest in it. However, I thank Deputy Kenny for sharing his time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I compliment the Minister, yet again, on her initiative. It is most important. My maiden speech in the Dáil in 1987 was on the National Monu<Col N="495" /> ments Bill. I pointed out then that we were destroying our archaeological heritage by moving earthworks, forts, field formations and so forth. I said that unless the provisions of the Bill were enforced, this destruction would continue. Unfortunately, it has. I can think of many places from which old earthen forts have disappeared. I even witnessed damage and interference to the ruins of castles and other structures.</P>
    <P>There are certain national monuments which cannot be touched and other monuments which are listed and whose owners must give two months' notice of works being carried out on them. However, that notice requirement is not being complied with in many cases. Local authorities do not have sufficient personnel to enforce the provision. As a result, some of our archaeological heritage is being lost. I hope that will not happen in the case of this legislation. I appeal to the Minister to ensure the necessary finance is made available to appoint enough conservation officers to implement the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>We continue to destroy some of our most precious and valuable built heritage. It is difficult to know what goes on inside a building. In cases where urgent repairs are required &ndash; this problem will arise in the context of this legislation &ndash; people are not prepared to go to the local authority and seek permission to carry out the repairs. There might be a serious leak in a house or a 200 or 300 year old ceiling might have collapsed. This is the type of problem the Minister will encounter. Rather than take the official route, people will opt to do the job immediately. In many cases, they will be advised to do that. Consequently, we are continuously losing important facades of buildings, some of which might be up to 300 years old, and unique plasterwork carried out by the great artisans of 100 years ago. I have seen examples of this. We have also lost good and intricate ceiling work which was an integral part of the old great houses in Ireland. We lost much of our built heritage during the War of Independence. Unfortunately, the combatants did not adopt the Lenin approach. After the revolution in Russia, Lenin's supporters advised him to destroy everything that dated from before the revolution. He refused saying &ldquo;what is theirs today is ours tomorrow&rdquo;. Both sides in the War of Independence, despite their good intentions, destroyed a huge amount of our built heritage. That heritage would have been important for our tourism industry. We have lost a lot and we continue to lose it. I hope this legislation will arrest that trend. Our built heritage reflects our sophistication as a nation and shows how we respect what is around us. We have been lacking in such sophistication because much of our architectural or built heritage was passed on to us from a colonial power so we did not respect it. We have been guilty of much unwanted destruction and I hope this will change.</P>
    <P>Numerous buildings throughout the country would be lost to our communities only for the <Col N="496" /> work done by FÁS. FÁS has carried out high quality work in preserving numerous buildings. People who work in FÁS agree that it is important that such work is done under proper supervision, although the people who advise them are not always available. I hope the conservation officers will provide the necessary guidance, information, technical skills and backup to ensure that the work involved in restoring old buildings, ceilings or plasterwork is done properly.</P>
    <P>The Heritage Council launched the buildings at risk survey in August 1998 and it received approximately 280 completed forms. Its budget in 1998 was £500,000, but that did not meet its needs. I ask the Minister to ensure that the grant for the project is substantially increased. Last year the Heritage Council could not use all the £500,000 because it could not get builders to do the work. I ask the Minister to re-examine the system which does not allow unspent money to be carried over.</P>
    <P>The Minister is allocating £3.9 million to local government to repair listed buildings. How will that be allocated and how much will be given to each local authority? </P>
    <P>In the village of Finuge, where I come from, there is a unique thatched cottage which has been there for approximately 300 years. Despite the fact that I contacted the appropriate authorities about it, the mechanisms were not in place to do anything about it. As the building was in danger of being lost to the community, a local group was formed and we hope to purchase it in the near future. I hope this Bill ensures neglect similar to this does not happen again. It is one of few thatched cottages in the country. I ask the Minister to pay particular attention to preserving these thatched cottages which are part of our heritage.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for coming to Kerry to launch the film commission. A film is already being made because of her visit.</P>

      <P>Fáiltím roimh an Bille. Tá sé thar a bheith tábhachtach go mbéadh sé seo críochnaithe agus chomh hiomlán agus is féidir é chomh luath agus is féidir é. Ní amháin sin ach caithfidh an Rialtas go leor airgid a chur ar fáil chun déileáil le séadchomharthaí stairiúla atá i gcontúirt nó a bhfuil sé tábhachtach oibreacha práinneacha a chur i gcrích. Cabhróidh an Lucht Oibre leis an Aire an Bille seo a chur tríd an Dáil chomh luath agus is féidir.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister for introducing this important Bill. The Labour Party will assist in its speedy passage through the House. My comments will be based on my experience and on representations I received from an individual about which I wrote to the Minister. I will not present my views but the views of the person involved which should be aired.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that access will be available to the interiors of buildings under this Bill. I recall some years ago somebody informing me of the removal of ornamental fireplaces in an important <Col N="497" /> historical house in my constituency which had not been used as a residence for some time. I immediately contacted the county planning officer who was committed to our heritage. However, I discovered that the local authority did not have the power to intervene. I do not know where those fireplaces are now, but they are a great loss to the area. The house was also vandalised. Its magnificent timber window frames, which would cost a great deal of money to replace, disappeared.</P>
    <P>An article sent to me recently by an individual indicated that 30 important archaeological sites are lost in County Kerry each year. Some years ago a friend was excavating at the back of his house and he dug up a bronze age grave. It was a little chamber which measured two feet by one foot by one foot and there was an urn inside. I immediately informed the Keeper of Irish Antiquities at the National Museum of Ireland who came to see it. He dated it somewhere between 1600 and 2000 BC. He said it was usual for 16 bronze age graves to be built together. My friend then remembered that when he was cutting out the foundations of his house he noticed a slab of stone which could possibly have been another bronze age grave. The keeper believed it could be excavated and retrieved at a later stage.</P>
    <P>I carried out some inquiries in the area and discovered that much of the soil was removed in the early 1960s when the new road was being built. One of the local people remembered that his children found bones during the excavation. I was told there were two phases with the bronze age graves. Initially the bodies were allowed to rot and the bones put into the chamber. Subsequently the bodies were cremated and the urn, retrieved in the area I speak of, would have contained ashes and a trace of oats. Even at that stage they had an idea of the afterlife and food for the journey. The reason I make these points is the likelihood that there could be up to a dozen other chambers, small graves, in the area. How does the State protect them? Obviously the State cannot excavate in all these areas. That that information is available should mean that many of these very important historical remains will be protected and secured in the fullness of time.</P>
    <P>I had discussions with Lord Hartington in Lismore Castle a few years ago. Lismore Castle is a very important historical building in County Waterford. Robert Boyle, the father of modern chemistry, was born there. The family is anxious to keep the building as a residence. There is a development plan with which the family would co-operate in terms of out-houses and other parts of the complex being developed as an area for a tourism focus. All the consultants who have looked at west Waterford say Lismore Castle should be developed as the hub to attract other tourism. Apart from the tourism aspect there is the conservation and refurbishment of the building which is an important part of the heritage in my area. What can be done in cases such as this? For example, can tax breaks be introduced? I welcome the interdepartmental approach because <Col N="498" /> it ensures the taxpayer gets the best deal at the end of the day. A combination of tax breaks and grants would be important in the development of areas such as this. The £4 million available to local authorities is welcome but I do not think the Minister in her contribution here or in the Seanad considered it was enough. I wish her well in her efforts to have the allocation increased dramatically given that we have an overview of our heritage and can identify priorities and that there is a systematic and structured approach to this area.</P>
    <P>Has the Minister had discussions with her colleague the Minister for Finance on the matter of assisting owners of historical buildings to bring them up to an attractive standard? There may be ways of clawing back in the event of tourist income accruing. By using the imagination and being creative we can develop a roll-over whereby money invested will come back again. At the end of the day citizens, who are our first concern in the matter of heritage, will benefit.</P>
    <P>Another historical monument in my area is the metal man in Tramore. For many years there has been a problem of access to the metal man. There is an old piseog that if a girl hops all the way around the middle pillar she will be married within 12 months. All these little things are part of our culture and how people look at the world. I realise the whole business of access is not easy. There is also the question of balancing various interests. Given that there are no easy solutions we have to work hard to move this agenda forward.</P>
    <P>In respect of monuments in private ownership the Minister stated:</P>
    <P>These provisions present a reasonable balance between the rights of occupiers of private dwellings and the importance of identifying those elements of the architectural heritage of the State for protection.</P>
    <P>I support the idea of balance. I would ask the Minister to respond to some of the points raised in a letter I received. I do not necessarily agree with all of them  but they should be given an airing and should be looked at in the overall context. The letter reads:</P>
    <P>If passed into law it [the Bill] would provide for intrusive invasion into private property of citizens of this State and provide for a great encroachment into the right to privacy of the citizen, a privacy which, as you know, requires that before entry is made into private property the consent of the property owner is necessary. In the Bill there is not a reference to, much less a commitment to, public liability or responsibility for those who would be coming onto private property and this, in turn, would make the already unacceptable bad liability situation even worse for the property holder. Indemnity from claim by trespassers is required to protect the property holding from trespassing people and this is not the case at the moment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="499" /> The ever-increasing cost of public liability insurance cover would soar even further. It would be difficult to blame the insurance companies for doing so. Even when the gardaí apply for a warrant to enter a private household they are required to satisfy a court that they have reason to believe or suspect that some law has been breached or some crime committed. No such requirement is included in section 3 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill states that the inventory will be made of private property and that the Minister may publish information from the inventory but to whom? Will it be made available to other State bodies, hotels, guesthouses, tourist organisations etc. none of whom are prepared to take public liability or responsibility for their guests or for those whom they invite or attract on to private property? I believe that those who appoint, invite or attract people to come onto private property should be held accountable for the consequences of doing so.</P>
    <P>In her contribution the Minister mentioned publication and publishing. In publishing information from the inventory one shall have regard to the security, privacy and safety of property and persons affected. These are the questions that need to be addressed. In respect of owners' liability legislation we are moving into another Department's area of responsibility. If a particular building is given a great deal of notice in the inventory it could result in many people wishing to visit it. Does my correspondent have a point that his exposure to public liability will increase and he will have to pay a higher premium in the future? These are rhetorical questions but the issue of access is related. I support the Bill but we must look further forward and consider where the legislation is leading. The maximum level of access to our heritage should be afforded to citizens. However, at the same time, the issue of the security of buildings arises. If particular buildings or their grounds have a large throughput, the opportunity is created for people who are so disposed to steal from the building. I will not deal with the provisions of the occupier's liability legislation, but I ask the Minister to give comfort to my correspondent where possible.</P>
    <P>Earlier I raised the potential for excavation, such as the bronze age graves I mentioned, but cases can also arise in urban areas. For example, the Theatre Royal in Waterford was recently refurbished and a nice job was done but, in the course of the work, remnants of the old city walls were discovered. Ultimately, it will probably cost more money to look after the old city walls than it cost to refurbish the theatre. There may not be certain knowledge in urban areas but old records could indicate certain historical remains which would be important in terms of excavation. In the context of the inventory, is it intended to identify potential areas of importance? It may not be certain that an area contains important historical <Col N="500" /> remains, but records and the balance of judgment might suggest the location of remains which would be worth exposing and putting on display.</P>
    <P>This is not an easy matter. Such issues arose in Waterford city previously in the context of an inner city shopping development where the site was acquired by the city council but some important discoveries were made. The Bill contains a definition of architectural heritage and also a definition of site, which means an area which is partially built upon and is sufficiently distinctive or homogenous to be topographically definable. Similar to the area I described in relation to the bronze age graves, my concern is what exactly the Bill will do in terms of recording that type of area which is likely to be important in the context of discoveries in the future.</P>
    <P>This also applies in urban areas where levels develop over time. The dumping process in cities causes some buildings to be covered over. Building is carried out on top of them and some of the most important artefacts and historical remains can be contained in such areas. I ask the Minister to cover this aspect in her reply to the debate.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kenny raised the issue of how the 12 year time frame was developed and on what it is based. I omitted to mention earlier cases where urgent action is required in relation to important historical or architectural remains. There does not appear to be either a system or the resources to react to such cases. I welcome the greater awareness at all levels in relation to our heritage. For example, Canon Power in his book, <i>Logainmneacha na nDéise</i>, describes in detail an oratory in Kilbride. This led me to believe that it was in a good state of preservation at that stage but, apparently in the late 1940s, the landowner decided to demolish the little oratory, which was near a non-descript 18th century ruin, to provide trunking for a driveway. I hope such outrageous cases are in the past. Another case involved the remains of the foundations of one of the early Christian churches. I understand the land was leased and the remains were ploughed and lost forever.</P>
    <P>These events happen but other remains &ndash; I discussed an example with the Minister in the House last week &ndash; could deteriorate rapidly if they do not receive urgent attention and if they are not secured. When they are open to vandalism, all types of articles are removed. For example, the window frames of a house were removed and, I suspect, used for firewood. I do not know what other use could have been made of them. The issue of the ability to respond to real emergencies and to urgent cases to ensure an historical or architecturally important part of our heritage is secured must be addressed. If action is not taken in such cases, it will not be possible to do anything about them later.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the advisory committee which will lay down the guidelines for the disbursement of the £4 million. The committee will comprise representatives of the Department of the Environment and Local Government, the <Col N="501" /> Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands and the Heritage Council. In the context of the input of the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, the Minister should ensure that a contingency element is included for local authority areas. This would mean that in genuine cases, where there is a real danger to a particularly important part of our heritage, the local authority would be in a position to respond quickly.</P>
    <P>Grants are available, but there should a scheme similar to that in the USA where tax breaks are available. Packages are available to private citizens or groups. It could be said that a tax break is income foregone, but this type of measure would bring much more money into the sector. It would help to speed up the process of conservation and refurbishment and ensure better presentation generally.</P>
    <P> There are sensitive areas on the margins that have to be dealt with but, as the Minister outlined in her letter, it is a question of balance, which is not easily achieved.</P>
    <P> I compliment the Minister on the Bill and wish her well in its implementation and I look forward to her response at the end of the Second Stage debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on introducing the Architectural Heritage (National Inventory) and Historic Monuments (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 1998, which follows on from the Local Government (Planning and Development) Bill, 1998, introduced by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey.</P>
      <P>The Local Government (Planning and Development) Bill refers to ensuring the protection and survival into the future of our built heritage and this Bill implements it. For the first time there is a commitment to give full legal protection to sites of artistic, heritage and historic interest and there are measures to promote the preservation of our heritage dwellings. I hope that adequate resources will be provided for financial assistance and for expertise on conservation. I was delighted to hear both Ministers refer to the allocation of resources and the figure of £4 million. The Minister, Deputy Dempsey, referred to the allocation of £300,000 per annum to assist local authorities in employing conservation expertise and the Minister, Deputy de Valera, refers to annual funding of £800,000 to ensure there a full record of architectural heritage is carried out within 12 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The local authorities hope to employ between 15 and 20 conservation officers to carry out the functions under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Bill, 1998. I hope there will be consistency in regard to the built environment and that we will see the end of unseemly rows. Guidelines have been drawn up by Duchas, the heritage body under the auspices of the Department of the Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the <Col N="502" /> Islands in consultation with the Department of the Environment and Local Government. As there is co-operation between the two Departments, there should be a meeting of minds on what is a building of significance.</P>
    <P>The Minister may recall when we were lobbying for the draining of the River Suck and a marina for the town of Ballinasloe, there was a major row about an old mill. The archaeologists thought the mill should be knocked but there was local opposition to that. I am convinced the right decision was taken, the mill was knocked, the river was drained and a marina was built closer to the town. I am digressing a little but I think it is important that marinas are located as near as possible to a town.</P>
    <P>An additional cost for community employment schemes in supervising work on heritage buildings, monuments and graveyards is that archaeologists have to be employed at a cost of £30 per hour and should a report be required it will cost up to £700. On some occasions the local authority may be able to contribute to the cost but this will vary from area to area. This is a prohibitive cost for local groups raising money to restore a building. There should be a consistent policy on this matter.</P>
    <P>Urban renewal schemes have benefited the cities but in recent times the scheme has been extended and Ballinalsoe and part of Tuam have been included and the old buildings in these towns will benefit. The Department of the Environment and Local Government will introduce a scheme to improve the streetscape. Will grants be provided by the Department to carry out this work? The Minister of State, Deputy Dan Wallace, has referred to the environmental partnership scheme for local and national projects which will encompass conservation measures as well as recycling and litter control.</P>
    <P>The schemes are in place but I hope we will have funding for them. The local authorities would like to know before 1 August what the schemes for the villages and smaller towns will involve. The upper Shannon &ndash; the Leas-Cheann Comhairle has an interest in this &ndash; comes under the rural renewal scheme and I hope to get further details on it.</P>
    <P>The European Union has a role in the protection of our heritage. The EU is investigating the commercial aspects of the urban and rural renewal schemes. It has clearly stated there is funding for the restoration of church buildings. The town clock in St. John's Church, Ballinasloe, has just been restored at a cost of £10,000. Many churches are not used and are in danger of falling down if something is not done about them. Church of Ireland members have said that if these churches are not restored they will be knocked, which would be a pity. My local authority colleagues tell me there is a fund for church restoration and it should be used. In my village, Castleblakeney, the Leader programme has provided a grant of 70 per cent of the cost of restoring a church, which is typical of what can be done <Col N="503" /> to preserve buildings. Many churches have been turned into interpretative centres, museums, libraries or community centres in villages which previously had none, and these are good ways to use such buildings. It is a welcome development.</P>
    <P>Each county has a national monuments committee, which has made lists of buildings. The late Martin Joyce was a member of one such committee. He was responsible for preserving the Aughrim collection, relating to the battle, and was the driving force behind the Aughrim interpretative centre, opened some years ago by the former President, Mrs. Mary Robinson. We are lucky that we had people like Martin Joyce who gave such time, effort and energy to preserve historic relics.</P>
    <P>Tourism boards have an important role in regard to these buildings. Buildings such as the Aughrim site, Kilconnell Abbey, Clontuskert Abbey and Clonfert Abbey, founded by St. Brendan, are tourist attractions and European visitors, particularly from Germany and Austria, are keen to see these historic parts of Galway and Ireland.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Shea referred to the importance of access to these sites. The interpretative centre in Aughrim has all the information about Aughrim but many people want to see the battle site and people are disappointed when they cannot do so. The tourism board has promoted these buildings and provided good signposts. I hope it can co-operate with local authorities on this work in the future. Will the board continue erecting signs for buildings, battle sites and monuments or, in light of the legislation introduced by the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, will it be transferred to local authorities?</P>
    <P>The relationship between the owner or occupier of a protected structure and the local authority is important. In many cases signs have been taken down and money has been spent replacing them. I hope the Minister for the Environment and Local Government has agreed to this measure which I welcome.</P>
    <P>Another possible source of confrontation is the way a building is restored. Removing ivy from buildings, for instance, is a special art. One must employ an archaeologist and consider the type of stone involved, it is not simply a matter of setting up a FÁS scheme. Lessons can be learned from the mistakes made. The co-operation of the owner is crucial. Buildings on land are usually owned by farmers and most of them are caring people. It may be necessary to fence off an area or move livestock. All these areas must be considered in detail.</P>
    <P>When introducing his Bill the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, spoke of the need for planning permission not only for the building but for the curtilage, and such permission should be obtained in good time. Many older buildings were constructed without planning permission but were built in a tasteful way. The buildings in question are often focal points in towns and villages. The Derelict Sites Act, 1990, imposed levies on people who did not comply with the law. The County <Col N="504" /> Galway national monuments advisory committee has done great work in identifying buildings which need attention.</P>
    <P>I welcome the £4 million in grant aid for buildings, mentioned by the Minister. Perhaps she could give more detail about how it will be made available because there is great need for it. Everyone is concerned about our heritage and the money should be provided as quickly as possible to the communities who require it.</P>

      <P>I join other Members in commending the Minister on bringing forward this Bill, which is the result of a substantial interdepartmental study concluded in 1996 entitled Strengthening the Protection of the Architectural Heritage, which made a substantial analysis of this area. The study also demonstrates the far-sightedness of the former Minister, Deputy Michael Higgins. The current Minister has been willing to take on board its 64 recommendations. By and large the Bill is based on the thoughts of the interdepartmental committee. The report dealt with the listing of buildings, the national inventory of architecture, financial and tax incentives, grant aid, training, education, advisory services, etc., and other Members have touched on these matters.</P>
      <P>From my experience in office, I know there is still a need to draw together the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, the Department of the Environment and Local Government and the Department of Finance. Most Deputies favour the fast route, they feel that the 12 year period in the Bill is too long. In my view the interdepartmental group studying this matter would have to remain in place on a continuous basis. Dúchas is not really designed to facilitate this, but perhaps a subcommittee could be established to expedite matters in respect of our architectural heritage.</P>
      <P>There is an economic consideration of which account must be taken. Studies on tourism reveal that our built environment is one of the reasons tourists visit Ireland. People travel to this country to see old and listed buildings; therefore, the value of our architectural heritage is high. If this area of tourism is to be developed further, increased investment will be required. Previous speakers referred to the £5 million allocation recommended by the committee in 1996, but since then the coffers of the Department of Finance have been awash with money. In order to fully develop and preserve our architectural heritage, a greater investment and commitment must be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In its recommendations, the committee sought to have grant aid allocations to be funded, wholly or partly, from national lottery funding. In 1996, <Col N="505" /> people making modest applications for grant aid did not realise the Minister for Finance would have a substantial surplus at his disposal in 1999. In my opinion, part of that surplus should be used for capital investment in projects of this nature.</P>
    <P>As the Minister is aware, Ennis Abbey is visited by large numbers of tourists each year. It is currently the subject of controversy because Dúchas does not have adequate resources and is slow to respond to difficulties involving planning. A proposal has been put forward to build a modern complex beside Ennis Abbey and Dúchas, if it had received adequate funding and aid, could have purchased the land adjacent to the abbey. The Minister and her Department have plans to erect a roof over Ennis Abbey in order to make it more amenable to visitors. It is also envisaged that guided tours of the substantial heritage contained in the abbey will be provided. The attitude appears to be that improvements should be limited to the perimeter of the building, with no thought given to creating other amenities which would be valuable to the tourism industry in Ennis.</P>
    <P>I accept the need to provide housing and promote development in Ennis but the site adjacent to the abbey is not the place for this. However, Dúchas can do nothing because it lacks the necessary funds to purchase the site. The Department appears to be caught between a rock and a hard place. It will be culturally disastrous for Ennis if An Bord Pleanála grants permission for a housing development beside the abbey.</P>
    <P>When the EU examined this area, it made a number of recommendations. As previous speakers stated, the EU is prepared to collectively support the built environment and protect architectural heritage. We should move towards consolidating the efforts of the different groups working to protect such heritage. Leader groups, FÁS and community groups are responsible for this in various constituencies.</P>
    <P>When the interdepartmental group made its recommendations, it stated that a central authority should be nominated by the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands and given responsibility for carrying out a national inventory and making other recommendations. If the central authority is based in the Department, it will not receive the necessary support. County planning and strategy groups were established in the west but for some reason they appear to be paralysed or immobile. If these groups were brought together they could consolidate county development plans and Dúchas's plans for their areas. If the Minister or one of her colleagues brought these groups together it would help to expedite matters and reduce the 12 year time frame which, in my view, is a recipe for disaster because it will lead to valuable heritage being lost forever.</P>
    <P>A good suggestion for the preservation of heritage of this nature emerged from proposals for the conservation of the Burren, namely, the creation of a necklace of interpretative centres. A <Col N="506" /> similar development could be put in place in respect of abbeys. For example, in addition to Ennis Abbey there are also abbeys at Killone, Quin and Newmarket-on-Fergus in County Clare. I believe necklaces of abbeys could be created as a heritage and tourism interest. Given that the Minister and the Minister for Finance have access to substantial funds, they should take action on this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>Twelve years is too long a period to grant in respect of carrying out a national inventory of all buildings in the State. The systematic recording of the State's architectural heritage began in 1990 and has been carried out on a non-statutory basis. Those responsible for making such records have no right of access to the interiors of buildings. This deficiency is to be rectified by the new Bill which will provide legal rights of entry to buildings for the purpose of establishing the inventory.</P>
      <P>Under the new law, local authorities serving a dangerous building notice on a structure listed in the inventory will be obliged to notify the Minister. That is an important development. However, if they are to take effective action in this regard, local authorities must be given adequate funding. The national inventory of our architectural heritage will identify those buildings which the Minister will recommend local authorities to preserve. It is important that adequate funding should be allocated in each region for the purpose of preserving the architectural heritage.</P>
      <P>As I said, 12 years is a long period and, as Deputy Carey stated, the inventory should be completed within a shorter time frame because a great deal of damage could be done in the interim. At the core of the protection of our national heritage must lie a comprehensive and detailed record of the stock of buildings that constitute the architectural heritage of this State. It is important to carry out an initial survey and it would be beneficial if a more detailed survey could be carried out during the 12 year period, but the completion of a full survey during that period will pose a major problem.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on the work done to Ballymote Castle and on the recent celebrations there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Mr. Flood)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 4 together.</P>
      <P>The European Council recently agreed a funding package of Community support for the 2000-06 period. While the outcome for Ireland was good given the extreme difficulty of the negotiations, the level of EU Structural Funds available over that period will be approximately half that available to Ireland under the current Community Support Framework.</P>
      <P>Work has already commenced on agreeing priorities for EU co-funding under Ireland's next national development plan and on clarifying the Commission's new procedures for the next round of Structural Funds. There is a separate national consultation process to be undergone, inclusive of the social partners, while the creation of new authorities for the two new regions and the possibility of regional operational programmes add further necessary layers to the planning process. Until such time as this overall process is completed, it is difficult to give any indication of likely levels of EU financial commitments and programmes, including what their commitment will be to current EU funded programmes.</P>
      <P>The Deputies can rest assured that the Government will not be deflected, however, from its commitment to tackle social exclusion in deprived areas and of ensuring that the overall objectives of current programmes remain a priority. In particular, very good work has already been done by the partnerships and ADM-supported community groups in developing a new and innovative area based approach, which is currently being considered in the context of ongoing work on local government reform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister of State take into consideration that 800 full-time staff are employed by the 38 partnerships throughout the country as well as 500 other staff under the community employment scheme? Has he taken into consideration that the partnerships are a national response to long-term unemployment and social exclusion in urban and rural areas? Does he realise that if an early decision is not made about them and if the uncertainty about their future is not eliminated, staff, whose skills and expertise have made the partnerships so successful, will be dispersed and lost to the scheme? Will the Minister of State give a guarantee in the House today that the 38 partnerships at present operating will survive under the next national development plan? Will he confirm if partnerships will survive <Col N="508" /> in areas with Objective One status and areas that will not have that status?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government recognises the tremendous work already undertaken by the partnerships and ADM-supported community groups. That is a matter of record in any of the areas in which they operate. I agree with the Deputy they have made a significant contribution in their areas of responsibility. The future position of partnerships and the supported community groups will come into focus in the drawing up of the next national development plan. The Taoiseach indicated it is the Government's firm intention to continue to direct a focus of attention at areas of disadvantage, both rural and urban. Given the experience of the ADM-supported community groups and partnerships, it is important that focus should continue.</P>
      <P>Regarding the future staffing arrangements of the partnerships, the drawing up of the next national development plan will have to take into account the issue referred to by the Deputy. That plan, which is driven by the Minister for Finance, is at an advanced stage.</P>

Will staff be laid off in the transition period &ndash; when the present funding has been used and the process is finalised &ndash; and recruited later if required when the new funding is in place? Will the Minister of State assure the partnerships that transitional funding will be made available to them until such time as this process is finalised?</P>

      <P>No decisions have been taken with regard to the future funding of local development arrangements. That will be part and parcel of the national development plan. I ask the Deputy to take into account the positive comments I made about the role of partnerships and supported community groups.</P>
      <P>Recently Planet, the organisation representing the area based partnerships, wrote to the Taoiseach outlining its legitimate concerns, as raised by the two Deputies.

      <P>Despite all the talk of the Celtic tiger, vast areas of this country are still affected by high unemployment and social exclusion. The Minister of State praised the partnership programmes and their performance over the past number of years, but mere lip service and praise are insufficient. He avoided answering part of previous question. Will he give a guarantee in this House today that the survival of the existing 38 partnerships will be guaranteed under the next national development plan? Will partnerships in areas outside those that have Objective One <Col N="509" /> status survive? I ask the Minister of State to give a specific answer to a specific question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>I can give the Deputy a specific answer. It would be foolhardy of me to give a blanket commitment now such as that being sought by Deputy Allen and Deputy Moynihan-Cronin. That would pre-empt the national development plan. I can only put on the record the experience to date of the partnerships and the community groups and state they have made a significant contribution. That must be taken into account in tackling the issues referred to by Deputy Allen, particularly in relation to areas of disadvantage and neglect. That is the Government's firm intention. The Taoiseach stated we intend to continue to target these areas because they still have a considerable distance to go in terms of fighting and dealing with the effects of social exclusion.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State's comments. I am sure when he meets representative of Planet on 17 May the main concern will be about the transition period. I am sure he will agree that is the main problem facing them. He said there will be a commitment to the partnerships but that EU funds will be halved. A large number of the staff are leaving the partnerships because of the uncertainty prevailing. Many members of the staff who have given their time and have valuable experience are concerned about the transition period. They hope the partnerships will continue in place after the next round of EU funding. They want a commitment to the partnerships in respect of the transition period and the funding to ensure that comes from central Government rather than Europe.</P>

      <P>As the Minister of State responsible for area based partnerships, I am concerned whenever very skilled staff leave to pursue alternative careers. In this case there are a number of reasons for such departures. Individuals who have been part of the partnership process have benefited greatly by being part of it. Some of them are furthering their careers by availing of other opportunities that have opened up and they are entitled to do that. I accept any transitional period is always a period of uncertainty and individual members of staff may make decisions based on what they perceive to be the future. The national development plan will deal with the issue of uncertainty raised by the two Deputies.We are anxious to ensure the plan is brought forward as quickly as possible so that specific issues which cause uncertainty can be dealt with. A transitional period is difficult for any organisation. The Government is, however, committed to the partnership process and, through the national development plan, we will be able to continue that commitment, particularly in targeting the areas of neglect and social inclusion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department produced a discussion paper last March, entitled &ldquo;Strategy for Tourism Development in the context of EU Structural Funding 2000-2006&rdquo;. The paper proposes objectives, and a strategic approach, for future investment in product development, marketing and training, based on a range of possible policy actions to meet those objectives. The new directions suggested are founded on a selective approach based on environmentally sensitive sustainable tourism and regional development.</P>
      <P>Precisely how this will be reflected in measures under the new national development plan remains to be seen. Work has already commenced on agreeing priorities for EU co-funding under Ireland's next national development plan and on clarifying the Commission's new procedures for the next round of Structural Funds. There is a separate national consultation process to be undergone, inclusive of the social partners, while the creation of new authorities for the two new regions and the possibility of regional operational programmes add further necessary layers to the planning process. Until such time as this overall process is completed, it is difficult to give any indication of likely levels of EU financial commitments or to what programmes or measures they will be made.</P>
      <P>The process will also, of course, have regard to the paper prepared by the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation, &ldquo;Strategy for Growth beyond 2000 &ndash; A Strategic Framework for Irish Tourism&rdquo; and to Bord Fáilte's business plan for Irish tourism marketing 1998 &ndash; 2003.</P>
      <P>In arriving at a proposed strategic approach to product development specifically, my Department took account of views expressed by the European Commission that in times of rapid growth, the industry should be capable of, and expected to, respond adequately to market investment needs. All the indications from the Commission are that in the post-1999 period, the industry will be expected to contribute increasingly to its own product development, responding to the needs and demands of the market. Account was also taken of the European Commission's priorities, including environmental protection, job creation, competitiveness and regional development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposed strategic approach for product development in the post-1999 period, as set out <Col N="511" /> in the discussion paper, will therefore be biased towards areas classified as either developing or undeveloped tourist areas; based on differentiated aid levels which are likely to be less than current levels; have an agreed level of product investment for the 2000 &ndash; 2006 period based on a much higher proportion of investment from the industry itself and less from the EU; reinforced by the selective and targeted use or adjustment of tax-based incentive schemes, subject to Government and EU approval, to stimulate physical developments consistent with sustainable tourism goals; and reliant on market forces to fund product investment in established tourist areas. State support may be provided, however, for an overall integrated planning and management approach to alleviate success-related strains such as congestion etc. based on a product mix reflecting thematic programmes, such as special interest holidays and dedicated health-leisure centres, as opposed to a project-based approach.</P>
    <P>As part of this framework, my Department will closely monitor the new tourism and environment initiative which was established under the operational programme for tourism in response to the mid-term evaluation of the programme. It is envisaged that the initiative will play an important role in developing future tourism policy in the next round of Community Structural Funds.</P>
    <P>Precisely how this will be reflected in measures under the new national development plan remains to be seen and will depend to a large degree on the outcome of the consultation process which I have outlined.</P>

      <P>When will the process of consultation be completed and who will be consulted? Will the Minister ensure regional imbalance is addressed in the consultation process? The majority of tourists stay in Dublin and do not go to the regions. There are regions of this island which are beautiful but which have no tradition of tourism. These are the areas I ask the Minister to address as part of the consultation process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Deputy those issues will be addressed. We are aware of the intense growth in tourism in Dublin city and we welcome it. We have marketed this country as an island destination and have been very successful. We expect 5.9 million visitors to the island this year. It is my intention that figure should be equally divided between the regions and I introduced policies to do so. In my meetings with Bord Fáilte, it has been my priority to insist that the main policy should be for an equal spread throughout the regions. I believe in that policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The national development plan is already incorporated in our approaches to the EU. It is in keeping with EU thinking because it agrees that it wants to spread funding on a regional basis. It <Col N="512" /> wants product development to be extended to the regions.</P>
    <P>We have done exceptionally well since 1989. Since then everyone involved has worked exceptionally hard and we have an excellent product. As a result of EU investment, this island has become a quality destination. We will insist that continues. I agree more product investment should be directed to the regions. The other regions which are doing well, the south-west and the east coast, are experiencing congestion as a result of this success. That is detrimental to those regions and does not give a proper picture. If we can spread this around, everyone will benefit.</P>
    <P>The talks are ongoing at various levels. My Department is in discussions with the Department of Finance. I will insist, when putting our proposals to the Department of Finance for the national development plan, that tourism is very important to this State. It is worth £2.5 billion to the economy. In 2005-06, it is estimated that it will be worth £4.5 billion. We must protect that. Any industry worth so much is worth looking after. There is huge competition. Today there are elections in Scotland and Wales. When countries start to devolve, they start to think about competitiveness.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the new arrangements under his Department's carding scheme may result in some athletes incurring a tax liability; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[11719/99]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I introduced the international carding scheme in 1998 to provide a range of supports, both financial and non-financial, to assist Ireland's most talented players and athletes realise their potential to perform successfully at the highest international levels.</P>
      <P>Arising from experience of the first year of operation, I made a number of improvements and modifications to the 1999 scheme. One such improvement is that players or athletes who have reached international or world class standard in their sport may now opt to have up to half the maximum grant applicable to their category applied to their general living expenses, instead of towards meeting costs directly arising from the pursuit of training and competition programmes. This change was made to facilitate athletes undertaking the gruelling levels of training required to reach world and Olympic finals to participate in full time training.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of whether a tax liability arises in respect of any payment made under the international carding scheme is, of course, a matter between an individual athlete and the Revenue Commissioners. The Department of Finance has advised that, in general, payments made to athletes which are directly associated with training <Col N="513" /> requirements are not regarded as income for tax purposes, but it is the responsibility of the player or athlete to satisfy the Revenue Commissioners regarding the nature of such expenses. However, the Department of Finance has also indicated that any part of a grant payment which is applied to ordinary living expenses would be treated as taxable income. This information was conveyed to athletes in the outline of the 1999 carding scheme.</P>
    <P>It would, of course, be the responsibility of the player or athlete to declare the amount for income tax purposes and it would be a matter for the Revenue Commissioners to determine if there is a liability to income tax.</P>
    <P>Grant payments made under the international carding scheme are subject to tax clearance procedures in the same way as any other grant-subsidy schemes operated by the State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is regrettable that the modification to the card system which the Minister made will result in some athletes being liable for tax. Has the Minister considered asking the Department of Finance to classify grants to athletes under the carding system as exempt from taxation? Has he considered discussing with the Department of Finance an offer of tax free status to those athletes who are not earning a great deal, unlike the top athletes involved in international competitions?  Has he considered discussing with the Department of Finance the possibility of offering tax free status to those athletes who are not earning the huge amounts of money earned by the top athletes who compete in international competitions throughout the world? It is regrettable that we do not have a tax free status for the grants now being offered to athletes. Will the Minister consider entering into discussions with the Department of Finance so as to offer these grants on a tax free basis?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Deputy bringing this matter to my attention because until I read this question I was unaware of it. Unfortunately, this is the result of different Finance Bills introduced over the years. The Deputy is aware that up to £24,000 is available to athletes on a graded basis but they have told me that expenses for training purposes and so on have to be vouched, so this year I tried to be flexible. They also told me that much of that money was spent on ordinary living expenses so when I introduced it I asked my Department to make it as flexible as possible. Unfortunately, I then found out about this issue although I am sure the Department of Finance is only applying it on the basis of the Finance Acts brought forward by various Governments. I will try to obtain more information on this particular aspect. I do not want the athletes <Col N="514" /> to experience any undue harassment because of this matter. I thank the Deputy for bringing it to my attention. Perhaps my Department was aware of it; I certainly was not and I was trying to be as flexible as possible.</P>
      <P>For the information of the House, should a player athlete decide to avail of the option, the maximum grant that may be awarded in respect of general living expenses in each of the categories is as follows: a world class one athlete can avail of up to £12,000 living expenses; a world class two athlete can avail of up to £9,000; a world class three athlete can avail of up to £7,500; and the international athlete can use £4,500 towards his living expenses. If the Deputy wants to raise this matter with me at a later stage I will be happy to do so.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister's positive response. I raise the query as a result of an approach made to me by a prominent athlete who had substantial concerns about the implications of the tax position. Will the Minister take into consideration that some of our athletes exist on social welfare and a grant they receive from the Minister's Department? Income from all sources is liable for taxation. Will the Minister consider preparing a memorandum for the Minister for Finance on the question of offering these grants on a tax free basis? Surely we owe that to our prominent athletes and potential world champions. To extend the question slightly&mdash;</P>

      <Quest>the steps, if any, he is taking to ensure that the expanding tourism sector will be able to meet its labour demands within the parameters of Partnership 2000 in view of a company's decision (details supplied) to cut back on investing in Ireland due to labour shortages.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>The tourism industry has been experiencing an increasing problem with labour and skills shortages in recent years but these difficulties are not unique to the sector. Due to Ireland's recent favourable economic performance and changing demographic structure, labour shortages are affecting many sectors in the economy, including retailing, building and construction and software.</P>
      <P>In response to these difficulties, both the tourism industry representative bodies and CERT continue to work individually and in partnership to promote careers in tourism in a very competitive environment.</P>
      <P>In November 1998 CERT launched the first National Tourism Careers Roadshow as part of its recruitment drive. The roadshow toured nationwide and was supported by a major media and advertising campaign. It featured career days in 35 prime venues and was backed by similar events in CERT's centres which together attracted more than 10,000 student visitors. A databank of more than 8,000 people seeking further contact and summer jobs in the industry has been compiled.</P>
      <P>A &ldquo;Careers in Tourism Magazine&rdquo;, sponsored by CERT, the Irish Hotels Federation and the Restaurants Association of Ireland, was produced and given to every student who attended any of the career promotion events. A 16 page careers supplement was also produced in a national newspaper and 5,000 copies of the supplement were distributed at career events throughout 1998.</P>
      <P>Workshops for career guidance counsellors took place in Kilkenny, Carlow and Kerry, 60 school exhibitions were attended by CERT and 283 career talks were given to 10,000 students. These talks were targeted at those schools that did not attend the careers roadshows.</P>
      <P>A tourism recruitment promotion with 2FM radio took place in January and February this year involving participation in street entertainment and radio slots over a three week period.</P>
      <P>The Telephone Careers Information Line on Freefone 1800 produced over 3,000 inquiries on tourism careers. Careers information was circulated to more than 1,400 schools, FÁS offices, libraries and youth organisations. Information packs were made available to all industry personnel giving career talks. These packs include career brochures and course information, a careers video and overhead slides.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding the competitive labour environment, CERT maintained 1998 recruitment levels at close to the previous year's levels with the assistance of a range of interventions, including those I have already outlined. I understand from CERT that it anticipates a broadly similar outturn in 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On many occasions since taking up office, I have urged the industry to become more proac<Col N="516" /> tive in addressing recruitment difficulties and labour shortages and to take appropriate steps to counter the perceived poor image of tourism as a career opportunity. In this context I particularly welcome the Irish Hotels Federation's quality employer programme which is based on best practice in all aspects of employment including recruitment, induction training, ongoing performance assessment, career progression and conditions of pay and employment. In the two years since the programme was introduced, approximately 60 per cent of members of the federation have applied for accreditation and 220 establishments have been accredited so far. The Restaurants Association of Ireland's restaurant and customer charter is another good example of the type of initiative needed.</P>
    <P>As the labour market is expected to tighten, with unemployment levels declining further over the coming years, greater emphasis may well have to be placed on other potential sources of labour for the tourism sector, including married women returning to work, retired people, those wishing to work part time and non-national labour. The key challenge facing the industry and CERT is how to put in place appropriate policies, programmes and arrangements to attract, motivate and retain a skilled labour force in the face of declining labour availability and increasing competition from other sectors. For the industry this will also involve considering internal training requirements and measures which could improve labour productivity. In the context of preparations for the new National Development Plan, my Department is working closely with CERT to identify the most appropriate focus for its activities in the future and specific measures which should be undertaken by it to help address the training requirements of the industry in an increasingly competitive labour market.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree that the human resource base is important to the successful development of tourism? There are 156 Bord Fáilte approved units of accommodation in Sligo, with all its attractions, and 58 in Leitrim. A leading company has declined to invest further in the tourism industry because, despite what the Minister said in his reply, it cannot recruit staff. Is there a policy for retraining staff and to encourage people into the tourism industry? Large numbers of tourists are coming to this country and the industry will be badly served if we do not have qualified trained personnel on the ground. What provision has been made for investment in human resources, particularly in the western and Border counties? Companies are declining to expand because they cannot recruit staff, despite all the announcements the Minister has made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>There is enormous potential in the tourism area but the problem is that many people are using it as a type of one-stop-shop before they take up a different career. That has come about as a result of the industry's bad <Col N="517" /> image. I have raised this matter with those in the industry and they have responded positively by introducing quality approved programmes and the restaurants have also come on board. We are trying to get away from the image that the service industry is not what it once was. Irish people will never again be servile. We are trying to get away from that mentality. There is enormous potential in the industry and jobs in tourism in the future will pay well, particularly with the introduction of the minimum wage, but it is difficult to indoctrinate that in people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister plans to further promote the culture of enterprise and business in schools? There is a misunderstanding on the part of teachers with regard to encouraging students to go into business and the service industry. The Minister is correct that there is a misunderstanding of the role of serving the customer but he could do a great deal to further indoctrinate the enormous potential of the industry. I appeal to him to promote the tourism industry in the forthcoming school term. We must develop tourism in Sligo, Leitrim and the Border counties. If we do not succeed in encouraging people to work in hotels and restaurants, the industry will not grow.</P>

      <P>I agree and that is what we did this year. CERT embarked on a roadshow and visited 38 schools. We targeted schools it was unable to get to and it visited schools to promote careers in tourism. We targeted 10,000 students and I hope that will continue next year. One does not see the effects of a measure for two or three years. I agree that there is a shortage of labour in tourism, as in all sectors. We will have to look towards the future.</P>

      <P>There is huge potential and Sweden is an example. It brought its academy to Spain five years ago. Ireland has over 380 courses and Sweden has very few, yet it has over 40 players listed in the world rankings. Sweden has no golfing history but it set up its academy in Spain and this has worked. Fortunately, it moved its academy to Ireland last year and will be here for the next five years. I see what the Deputy is getting at and it is worth pursuing. There is huge potential as we have 384 golf courses and £100 million comes into the economy every year through golf. It has been a huge benefit to us.</P>

I am grateful to them as they were willing to put up £100,000 which I was willing to match. Unfortunately difficulties arose with involving the GUI in the carding scheme. It is still worth pursuing but we could not reach agreement between the businesses and the GUI. I tried this last year but was unable to pursue it.</P>

      <P>Government policy on tourism development fully recognises that Ireland's clean environment is one of our major natural tourism strengths and that the appropriate balance must be struck between conservation and development. In so far as tourism is concerned, my Department's Statement of Strategy 1998-2000, states that the Department mission is to contribute to the economic and social progress of Irish society by developing a sustainable tourism sector which champions high standards in marketing, service quality and product development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-99 specifically states that the Government is determined that existing environmental resources will be managed in a way that will yield the great<Col N="521" /> est sustainable benefit to present generations while maintaining the potential to meet the needs and aspirations of future generations. Key sustainability factors which apply under this programme are the emphasis on: extending the tourism season away from the July and August peak times; tourism revenue rather than visitor numbers and improving existing rather than new tourism product.</P>
    <P>Under the programme, all developments are required to comply with the best environmental standards. The impact of the planning process on tourism development is further strengthened by the requirement that planning approval must be obtained before grant assistance under the OP is confirmed.</P>
    <P>Arising directly from the mid-term review of the operational programme, a new measure, the tourism and the environment initiative, was written into and funded under the OP. The objective of this initiative is to generate practical demonstration projects during the 1999 tourism season which address issues where tourism and the environment interface. The intention is to encourage projects that would point to ways of supporting balanced tourism development while at the same time sustaining the environment on which it is based.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>The initiative attracted more than 120 applications from all over Ireland and EU funding of some £2.6 million is being made available to the 22 selected projects to assist with the costs of implementation. The progress of these projects, many of which are located at popular tourist destinations in Counties Kerry, Galway, Donegal, Cork and Wicklow is being closely monitored by Bord Fáilte and Shannon Development so that impacts can be measured. It is anticipated that these projects will add considerably to learning on best practice in, for example, visitor management schemes, litter control, traffic management and carrying capacity analysis, management of sensitive areas and so influence future tourism policy. The initiative touches on all the vital elements of good tourism policy. First, it addresses issues which are becoming of increasing concern. Second, it is regionally spread and tackles the precise problems in the precise locations where they occur. Third, the projects are locally driven.</P>
    <P>A one-day workshop for the promoters and managers of the 22 projects took place on Thursday, 29 April. The purpose of the workshop was to have project managers focus on the key issues of measuring individual project impact through evaluation of baseline data, indicators and targets. In addition, the workshop allowed promoters exchange views and experiences in implementing their various projects. More than 80 people attended. The external evaluator for the tourism operational programme will produce an interim report on the initiative later this year and a full evaluation early in 2000.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="522" /> In preparation for the new national development plan, my Department produced a discussion paper last March, entitled &ldquo;Strategy for Tourism Development in the context of EU Structural Funding 2000-2006&rdquo;. The paper proposes objectives and a strategic approach for future investment in product development, marketing and training, based on a range of possible policy actions to meet those objectives. The new directions suggested are founded on a selective approach based on environmentally sensitive, sustainable tourism and regional development. Considerable emphasis is placed, therefore, on ensuring that future growth in tourism is environmentally sustainable.</P>
    <P>In planning for post-1999, my Department will closely monitor the new tourism and the environment initiative which it is envisaged will play an important role in developing future tourism policy in the next round of Community Structural Funds.</P>

What links are there between his Department, the Department of the Environment and Local Government and local authorities to deal with these key issues?

      <P>We have a litter problem which is difficult to overcome. We need to start in schools. A baby learns and retains more in his or her first year than in the next 50 years. The same applies to children in their formative years. Consequently, if a child touches a hot stove he or she learns not to touch it again. We need to start educating children in school about this matter. It is not possible to teach an old dog new tricks.</P>
      <P>None of us takes individual responsibility for littering. We often see people throwing bags from cars or cigarette butts here and there but none of us take individual responsibility and confront those people &ndash; I suppose we know what we would get. That is the tendency of the Irish mentality which is unfortunate. I was delighted when litter wardens were appointed and litter courts set up. I wish they had a higher profile and could be extended to different parts of the country. This is a wonderful clean island and I hope it will continue to be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>My abhorrence of the practice of drug taking to enhance sporting performance is widely known. Drug taking to enhance sporting abilities and achievements is contrary to the values of sport and the principles for which it stands, namely, fair play, loyal competition and equal chance. Such doping also endangers the health of athletes, and is totally contrary to sport as a life enhancing, healthy activity.</P>
      <P>The past 20 years have seen more change in sport than in the whole of the previous century. Commercialisation and professionalism have changed completely the sports environment. Where once honour alone was at issue on the playing field now huge sums of money are often also at stake. Given human nature, we cannot be too surprised if the honour and the pleasure of participating in sport have been overtaken by the desire to win, sometimes at any price. We cannot be complacent and assume that Irish athletes are not equally subject to such pressures and temptations as athletes from other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Against this background and given my profession of medical practitioner, I identified the issue of doping in sport as a key priority upon taking office as Ireland's first senior Minister with responsibility for sport. I am pleased to say that over the past year I have overseen a number of innovative developments in this field. As the Deputy will be aware I have introduced draft legislation to establish the Irish Sports Council on a statutory footing. A function of the council will be to take such actions, as it considers appropri<Col N="524" /> ate, including testing, to combat doping in sport. In addition, the draft legislation provides for the establishment of an anti-doping committee of the Irish Sports Council to assist and advise the council in fulfilling its anti-doping function. Yesterday saw the draft legislation pass Second Stage in the Seanad and I hope that the Bill will be enacted within the next few weeks.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>In this context it is proposed that Ireland first ever national sports anti-doping programme which I launched last year, will be operated under the auspices of the statutory Irish Sports Council. Once the programme becomes operational, Ireland will be in a position to ratify the Council of Europe Anti-Doping Convention, 1989, which we signed in June 1992.</P>
    <P>While my immediate core objectives are the introduction of a statutory based Irish Sports Council and the subsequent implementation of the national sports anti-doping programme, I also believe that the measures in the programme should be complemented and strengthened by additional legislative measures targeted at the possession and supply of certain performance enhancing drugs.</P>
    <P>In this context I have had discussions with my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, concerning the possible inclusion of certain substances used for enhancing sporting performance under Ireland general drugs legislation. It is hoped that such measures will be in place by the end of 1999.</P>
    <P>Such changes will send a strong, clear signal to all those who promote and facilitate the use of certain performance enhancing drugs that they will, in future, be committing a criminal offence and be subject to the full rigours of the law.</P>
    <P>Drug abuse in sport, of its nature, cannot be tackled at just the national level. This has been acknowledged at European level with the European Union committing itself to work with sports organisations in the fight against doping in sport. I too believe strongly that we must all work together at international level to address the issue.</P>

Is there any evidence of substantial drug taking by Irish athletes to enhance their performance?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>

I cannot start the anti-doping programme until the Seanad passes the Bill to set up the sports council. I hope that will be set up in the next few weeks. I had anticipated that I would have 600 tests carried out this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="525" /> While the Bill has been going through the House, tenders have gone out to different laboratories which are willing to take on the testing. We are putting in place all those other issues which will be ready to go once the Bill is enacted. After those tests are carried out I will be able to give the Deputy and the rest of the country an idea of how prevalent the use of doping is in sport.</P>

Once the testing is in place we will have mobile units which will be able to travel to any part of the country and turn up at football, hurling, boxing, tennis, swimming events, etc. I have received great support from all the national governing bodies and a few, particularly the rowing body, have offered themselves as guinea pigs in this area. I am very grateful for the response I have had from the national governing bodies, all of which are anti-doping in sport. As we know, it is the coaches and individual athletes who are at fault here. I have received total commitment from the national governing bodies. I will, perhaps, be able to answer the question at the end of the year.</P>

What plans does the Minister have to co-ordinate all this effort?

      <P>I agree there is a great deal of duplication. Recent research indicated there were 22 different organisations involved in tourism marketing. It is very difficult to draw them together without causing some form of ruckus. It was also indicated to me that approximately £100 million of EU funding was given to different groups outside the remit of my Department, which also gave rise to a great deal of overlapping. Some maturity has been brought to the whole process recently because groups such as Leader groups and enterprise boards have come together and pooled their resources with either the county or regional tourism bodies in their areas. I hope a certain amount of that overlapping has been overcome. Last year I introduced budgets for the regional tourism authorities for the first time, which I am continuing this year. The report back from last year was successful. I was delighted to see regional tourism authorities bringing that message to different European markets, such as Berlin, Milan and London. I believe that marketing is the future.</P>

      <P>It is pointless to call for an increased investment in infrastructure without defining the economic strategy served by such an investment and the specific projects to be targeted. Historically there have not been resources to meet the calls for infrastructure investment from the west and all other regions. Despite the attractiveness of the west, it has performed poorly, with growth of 70 per cent below that of the national average. Targeting particular regions can often result in a great deal of hot air but little action.</P>

      <P>I am optimistic and believe there is great potential for the west. The policies introduced by different Governments in 1989 and 1993 in regard to EU structural funding have worked, generally, for this country. Now that those areas have Objective One status, I can see huge development in the west in the years ahead. There is great potential there.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation</askee>
      <Quest>the position regarding the delays in drawing down funding for approved projects in the local task force areas; if all 1997 and 1998 funding has been drawn down; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[11768/99]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government in 1997 allocated £10 million to support the implementation of more than 200 separate initiatives in action plans prepared by the 13 local drugs task forces. These task forces were set up in Dublin and north Cork city to develop an integrated response to the drug problem, particularly the heroin problem, in their <Col N="528" /> areas; and to involve local communities in the planning, design and implementation of that response.</P>
      <P>The funding is held in the Vote of my Department and is transferred on request, as projects become operational, to other Departments and agencies which are acting as channels of funding to the approved projects.</P>
      <P>Approximately £7.4 million has been drawn down by these Departments and agencies, to date, and around 91 per cent of the projects are currently in receipt of funding. Funding in respect of outstanding projects still not fully operational is being held in the Vote of my Department, for payment in instalments to the projects as required. An important feature of the initiative is the engagement of local communities in the design and planning of strategies to respond to the drug problem in their areas and in the implementation of the approved projects. In the majority of cases, this has been undertaken by voluntary and community groups in partnership with relevant statutory agencies and assisted by the local drugs task forces. It is hoped that this approach will assist the viability and sustainability of these projects and facilitate their future &ldquo;mainstreaming&rdquo;. However, a vital prerequisite to achieving this is the need to develop the capacity of community and voluntary organisations to deliver locally based drug programmes and services.</P>
      <P>In the task force areas where strong community structures were already in place prior to the setting up of the initiative, the emphasis in the action plans was on developing and expanding those structures. Accordingly, in such areas, it was possible to get the majority of approved projects up and running relatively quickly. It is notable that these areas either had a long tradition of community involvement in responding to the drug problem or had a local partnership company which had established a strong community network in the area. Conversely, in the areas where community networks were less developed, the emphasis in the plans was on building up these structures and, as a result, it has taken longer to get projects in these areas off the ground.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The four principal features which have impacted on the speed at which projects are being established are: the fact that they are designed to address gaps in current service provision means that, in many instances, they have to be designed and planned from scratch; in many instances, appropriate management structures have had to be put in place as a prerequisite to ensuring that the projects will work effectively, meet their objectives and are sustainable with a view to their future &ldquo;mainstreaming&rdquo;; the lack of suitable premises from which programmes and services could be run and, in a number of instances, local opposition to such services due to a misunderstanding as to their purpose, which is to provide <Col N="529" /> back-up and support to the care and after care services being provided by the health board; andthe shortage of appropriately trained personnel to deliver drug programmes and services and the potential competition which this can cause between projects.</P>
    <P>The local drugs task forces, the Departments and agencies acting as channels of funding and the national drugs strategy team all play an important role in ensuring the effective implementation and monitoring of the approved projects.</P>
    <P>The task forces assist in the planning and design of the projects and submit regular reports to the national drugs strategy team on progress in their implementation.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that every effort is being made to ensure that the £10 million provided by the Government to support these initiatives is fully spent. Strategy team members and the statutory representatives on the local task forces are currently making every effort to assist in overcoming problems or difficulties inhibiting the start up of projects being funded through their Departments or agencies.</P>

      <P>In general there has been progress. I brought the concerns expressed by the Deputies when this matter was last discussed to the attention of the national drugs strategy team. Additional support has been given to local promoting groups through the local drugs task forces to assist them and to clear what might loosely be described as bureaucratic delays which might have found their way into the process of drawing down funding. A total of 91 per cent of the projects are now drawing down the funding.</P>
      <P>A few individual projects have not yet commenced to draw down funding for different reasons. This might be due to the lack of qualified local staff in the local area. Premises remain a difficulty in that suitable premises are not available to the local promoting group in some areas. The fact that 91 per cent of the approved projects are drawing down funding indicates that soon all projects will be drawing it down.</P>

Over 3,000 individuals are currently availing of the treatment services in the Eastern Health Board area. The most recent information available from that health board indicates that approximately 600 people are still waiting to access treatment services. The Eastern Health Board has established 40 such treatment centres with the support of the local drugs task forces.

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department produced a discussion paper last March entitled &ldquo;Strategy for Tourism Development in the context of EU Structural Funding 2000-2006&rdquo;. The paper proposes objectives and a strategic approach for future investment in product development, marketing and training based on a range of possible policy actions to meet those objectives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="531" /> The new directions suggested are founded on a selective approach based on environmentally sensitive, sustainable tourism and regional development. By its nature, such an approach would prioritise projects for those areas which are currently underdeveloped for tourism, thereby spreading development and relieving tourism congestion in peak periods.</P>
    <P>How this will be reflected in measures under the new national development plan remains to be seen. Work has already commenced on agreeing priorities for EU co-funding under Ireland's next national development plan and on clarifying the Commission's new procedures for the next round of Structural Funds. There is a separate national consultation process to be undergone, inclusive of the social partners, while the creation of new authorities for the two new regions and the possibility of regional operational programmes adds further necessary layers to the planning process. Until such time as this overall process is completed, it is difficult to give any indication of likely levels of EU financial commitments and programmes.</P>
    <P>The process will also, of course, have regard to the paper prepared by the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation, &ldquo;Strategy for Growth beyond 2000 &ndash; A Strategic Framework for Irish Tourism&rdquo;, and to Bord Fáilte's business plan for Irish tourism marketing 1998-2003.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. B. Moynihan-Cronin</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that one of the main problems causing regional imbalance is lack of access through regional airports, railways and roads? What proposals do the Minister and his Department have to address that? Does he agree that an interdepartmental body should be established to make recommendations in this area? A number of Departments are involved in providing access, including the Department of the Environment and Local Government and the Department of Public Enterprise, and a coherent approach is needed to deal with it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Perry referred to another difficulty &ndash; securing staff to work in the tourism industry. I believe that might be due to the rates of pay. When the minimum wage is introduced, what proposals do the Minister and his Department have to police the rates of pay in the service sector?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the new procedures for questions, I will probably not be able to answer both of the Deputy's questions. I agree that access is vitally important. The city of Derry airport was opened yesterday with the introduction of Ryanair flights to London.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present, approximately 12 million people come through Dublin Airport each year. Cork and Farranfore airports are doing well but other <Col N="532" /> airports are not. We must improve access. Having been in Donegal with the Tánaiste this week I have seen the importance of access not just for tourists but for investors. The main question asked by investors who are considering setting up an enterprise in a region is how accessible the region is for people coming from the United States and for workers and training personnel. I am acutely aware of the importance of access in this regard.</P>
    <P>I am not sure that an interdepartmental body is the proper way to proceed. There is great co-operation between the Department and the Northern Ireland authorities and I hope that can be expanded and increased in the future.</P>

      <P>Many people will not take up work in the tourism industry because of the rates of pay.

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>It will cause problems when it is introduced. I am already in discussions with the tourism industry about it. We have said in the past that we want to ensure this country does not become known as an expensive destination. Otherwise, we are only cutting our throats. While there are many other petty areas we could talk about, I want the industry to concentrate on its approach to the minimum wage. I do not want the industry to be forced to put up its prices so that we become known as an expensive desti<Col N="533" /> nation. The industry is committed to ensuring that does not happen. We must work together on this issue.</P>
      <P>The minimum wage will impact more on the tourism industry than on any other industry. I agree with the Deputy that it is vitally important we start working on it now. I ask the industry to concentrate on this area so that what happened in 1973 with the decimal coinage does not happen to us as a result of the minimum wage.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 and 23 together.</P>
      <P>The European Council recently agreed a funding package of Community support for the 2000-06 period. While the outcome for Ireland was good given the extreme difficulty of the negotiations, the level of EU Structural Funds available over that period will be approximately half that available to Ireland under the current Community Support Framework.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="535" /> Work has already commenced on agreeing priorities for EU co-funding under Ireland's next national development plan and on clarifying the Commission's new procedures for the next round of Structural Funds.

Until such time as this overall process is completed, it is difficult to give any indication of the likely levels of EU financial commitments and programmes, including their commitment to current EU-funded programmes.</P>
    <P>The Government will not be deflected from its commitment to tackle social exclusion in deprived areas and to ensure that the overall objectives of current programmes remain a priority. In particular, good work has already been done by the partnerships and ADM-supported community groups in developing a new and innovative area-based approach, which is currently being considered in the context of ongoing work on local government reform.</P>

The Deputy might be interested to know that the group has received funding at the rate of £60,000 per annum over the past three years to meet its objectives.</P>

      <i>Additional Information</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>The Government, in line with the commitment given in the joint programme, An Action Programme for the Millennium, decided in November 1997 to initiate a tender procedure to invite proposals for a national 50 metre swimming pool. The tender procedure is being conducted in accordance with EU Council Directive 93/37/EEC, concerning the co-ordination of procedures for the award of public works contracts. A project team was established by the Department to assist with the preparation of invitation to tender documentation and to oversee the tendering process. This team comprises representatives of a number of Departments and other organisations.</P>
    <P>The tender procedure notice for the project was published in the Official Journal of the European Communities and in the Irish media in January 1998. The invitation was open to both the public and private sectors. The Department requested developers to come forward with proposals for the design, construction, financing and management of a 50 metre swimming pool, capable of meeting the training requirements of Ireland's high-performance swimmers for international competition. Such developers were required to demonstrate that they had the necessary financial status, technical knowledge and experience to undertake the development.</P>
    <P>The Government has agreed to provide capital assistance, up to a maximum of £6 million, and annual operational assistance, up to a maximum of £250,000, for a maximum period of 20 years towards the cost of implementation of the successful tender. The deadline for submission of full tenders from qualified candidates was 27 November 1998, and three tender proposals were received on that date. Two tender proposals, one with a location in Dublin and the other in Limerick, were deemed by the project team overseeing the tender process with the assistance of independent professional consultants to have met the qualification criteria and these proposals have proceeded to the evaluation and assessment phase of the project.</P>
    <P>However, on 18 January 1999 the other tenderer applied for and was given leave by the High Court to seek to have their disqualification set aside and their tender considered. The case is listed for hearing in the High Court on 12 May. Meanwhile, the detailed evaluation of the two remaining tenders is well advanced, but effectively stalled pending the outcome of the High <Col N="537" /> Court case. The evaluation is being undertaken by an independent multi-disciplinary consultancy team which will produce a full technical assessment and evaluation report for the project team. The team will then report its findings and recommendations, following which I will present a memorandum to the Government on the matter. A timetable for the final decision and public announcement on the outcome is conditional, however, on the progress of the High Court proceedings.</P>

      <P>An independent group, Kit Campbell, brought forward the initial report in 1994 and it has been dealing with all aspects of the tender process. The criteria for the building of a 50 metre pool were set out in advance. Those criteria are available from my Department. A 50 metre swimming pool is a facility for high performance athletes who have been deprived of such a facility since the foundation of the State. In the context of providing a facility for a high performance athlete, other matters are irrelevant.</P>

    <Title>Architectural Heritage (National Inventory) and Historic Monuments (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 1998  [  Seanad ]  : Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P Just="Center">Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;<Col N="538" /></P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for the news on the use of Ballymote Castle for the millennium celebrations.</P>
      <P>The Bill which defines &ldquo;architectural heritage&rdquo; imposes a clear obligation on local authorities to draw up lists of buildings to be protected because of their architectural, historical, archaeological, artistic, scientific, social or technical interest. The protection of historic buildings is a discretionary function. This is also taken to mean that only the front wall of a building is protected; the interior may be altered or demolished unless specifically listed for preservation. This Bill extends protection to the whole structure including its interior and specifies that all works which affect its character will require planning permission. However, local authorities will have to spell out the scope of such works in each case. Given that the planners may not have dealt with this type of work previously, local authorities will need people with special expertise.</P>
      <P>Under the provisions of the Bill, local authorities are being given wide powers, including that of compulsory purchase where necesssary, to ensure heritage buildings are protected. Owners of protected buildings are advised to ensure such buildings do not become endangered. They can seek financial assistance under a new grant aid scheme for protected buildings. This scheme will commence next year and will have funding of approximately £4 million. What percentage of the funds will be allocated to each county? How can those funds be acquired? Will grants be made available to owner-occupiers where the cost of conservation works would be considerably higher? It is important that information on how to avail of that fund should be in the public domain. The scheme will be administered by the local authorities which will appoint conservation officers to enable them carry out their functions. There is a grey area which needs to be developed. It is stated that local authorities will be able to draw on the resources of the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands. Will the Minister clarify how that will happen?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has indicated that the national inventory of architectural heritage is to be completed within 12 years. It seems unreasonable that it should take 12 years. In issuing guidelines on the approach to be adopted throughout the State, it is important that, unlike the judicial system where different rules may apply in one county or court, there is consistency from one local authority to the next. Buildings may now be designated for protection at any time independently of the five year review period for local authority development plans. It is important that under the five year county council development plans all buildings listed will automatically become protected buildings. Local authorities will have the power to require works to be undertaken to restore the character of protected building, the <Col N="539" /> removal of inappropriate windows, etc., but will have to pay for such works when alterations are not authorised. Many buildings, such as Ballymote Castle, have new windows which are totally out of character. Planners should have a say on how money is spent on that structure.</P>
    <P>The Bill gives statutory recognition to conservation areas to protect townscapes and streetscapes. In the past the ESB had underground cabling. Perhaps funds could be provided for the maintenance of all the old architectural structures in towns. People arriving in a small town or village notice its unique character. Streetscapes and townscapes are important. There may be some fine architectural buildings in a run-down area. The Border counties have availed of cross-Border funding under the town and village renewal scheme. Sligo County Council has operated that scheme very successfully in small villages. The improvements works carried out with this funding to footpaths, paving and lighting have uplifted the whole community. If we could match the funding from the IFI and <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> it could be used very effectively in the Border counties. In Northern Ireland the town and village centres have been nicely landscaped.</P>
    <P>The Irish Architectural Archive was founded in 1976 to collect and preserve the records of Ireland's architectural heritage and to make those records available to those who wish to visit them. We owe those people a huge debt of gratitude. The collection housed by the archive comprises the largest body of historic architectural records in Ireland and as such constitutes a vital national culture resource. It includes the most significant body of historic Irish architectural drawings in the world with in excess of 80,000 drawings ranging from the late 17th to the late 20th century. Also housed in the archive are over 300,000 photographs making this one of the largest collections of photographs in Ireland and an extensive reference library with in excess of 11,000 items of printed matter. The Irish Architectural Archive contains material, primary or secondary, on every important Irish building, period or style and the most significant buildings in the 32 counties. We are extraordinarily lucky to have that material in the Irish Architectural Archive which I have visited at 73 Merrion Square.</P>
    <P>Thousands of visits are made to the archive annually by people in search of information. It has produced a guideline of those involved in conservation and restoration and recommends craftsmen whom people can employ. Local authorities should have access to its reference books. This would help them to develop the huge stock of listed buildings on file. Given that the archive in Merrion Square has a huge record of all listed buildings and that it is expected to take 12 years to provide a full record of the architectural heri<Col N="540" /> tage, perhaps following consultation with the archive the 12 year period could be reduced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>In eight minutes Deputy Perry dealt with a wide range of issues in the Bill and more. Much can be done in this area, and I appreciate that a certain amount of work has been done in recent years regarding our heritage and the preservation of historic buildings and monuments.</P>
      <P>We are at a severe disadvantage because we do not have as much ancient infrastructure as Britain, France and Germany in terms of castles and old dwellings which were lived in for centuries. Many of our great homes, castles and monuments were destroyed during various periods. Some of them are now derelict while others have been rebuilt. Occasionally one is lived in following refurbishment to make it habitable.</P>
      <P>In the main, Ireland's disadvantage stems from the fact that our ancestors were loath to record the circumstances under which they lived. Many of us cannot go back any further than our grandparents when it comes to recording historical events because the circumstances were so awful that they did not want anybody to know about it subsequently. Our knowledge is severely limited as a result and anything the Heritage Council can do to revive the situation as it was up to 200 years ago is welcome.</P>
      <P>We have some idea of what happened after the Famine, although many of us cannot go back further than our grandparents which only brings us to the beginning of this century. There is a dearth of information and knowledge about the true situation before the Famine and this makes it difficult to ascertain the exact position.</P>
      <P>I raised with the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Michael D. Higgins, and other Ministers, the old Folklore Commission which operated in the 1920s and 1930s when the State was set up. Governments were sufficiently enlightened to send out teams of investigators who interviewed the oldest people in various rural areas throughout the country. The information gleaned from those interviews still exists in archives in Dublin and I understand it has never been released. If it was released, I am not aware of the degree to which it was made known to the public.</P>
      <P>A man in his eighties who was interviewed in 1925 could go back to the Famine. There must be a vast wealth of knowledge in the archives in University College, Dublin, or wherever they are located. The findings and reports of the Folklore Commission would be of tremendous interest if they were released. They would also need to be publicised but I do not know how that would be done. The records would be of enormous interest to school children, although they would have to be of a certain age to appreciate what was involved. For example, there is no point giving the information to toddlers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="541" /> There is an inhibition in our history. People buried the past because it was so unpalatable. However, we must make the best of what is available. The material in the folklore archives is an example of what could be done. Nobody knows the contents of the investigations which were carried out but I understand they went on until the 1950s. I knew an old man who was interviewed. The practice appears to have died out during the 1950s but it went on for 25 or 30 years and it is a pity we cannot benefit from the results.</P>
    <P>Making information about the past available from reputable sources such as that is a major difficulty. We probably should make more use of county councils, town commissioners and library committees in spreading the information among the public. A statutory mechanism should be established where the information available in Dublin and various museums and libraries throughout the country in the form of old newspapers etc is dispensed. It is no good having the information unless it is imparted to people who can benefit from it. There is a great breakdown in that regard and it worries me that the story is not being told. As matters stand, structures under which the information could be provided do not exist.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to take an initiative to ensure a mechanism is set up where information can be imparted to the public. It is not a major custom in Ireland for people to go into a library and forage around to try to uncover material. Many libraries do not have the resources to enable that, although some of the modern libraries have tremendous facilities where it can be done. People should be encouraged to do it, but leaders in the community, such as councillors and curators, are needed to get people interested.</P>
    <P>Dr. Julian Walton, who contributes on the local radio station in Waterford, WLR, must be one of the foremost experts on local history. He does an item every day called &ldquo;On This Day&rdquo; where he recounts a famous event which occurred perhaps 80 or 200 years previously in relation to a local incident. The item is hugely popular and there would be a tremendous appetite for this type of education and information if there were people such as Dr. Walton to impart it. Everybody in the area listens to the item which is of immense interest. I do not know if there are comparable items on other local or national radio stations. However, the Minister and her officials would be most interested in the way Dr. Walton presents the items. He makes events 200 or 300 years ago seem alive.</P>
    <P>The crux of the matter is finding methods to provide information. Local radio stations are great, but councils, whose functions appear to have dwindled and been taken over by county and city managers and public servants, should have a role. Councils have a civic spirit and that is why they exist. The energies of councils should <Col N="542" /> be utilised through library and vocational committees or the council itself.</P>
    <P>A great activity in recent years has been the work done by county councils and local authorities in conjunction with FÁS in the cleaning up and renovation of graveyards. It appears to be a morbid subject and visiting a graveyard which is covered with weeds, briars and nettles is not entertaining or advisable. Some graveyards are a state of the art archeological record. Old churches are sometimes sited near graveyards and one can visualise the true situation during the penal days as well as reading the history of the parish from the inscriptions This is a tremendous achievement and shows what can be done. However, much work remains to be done.</P>
    <P>Deputy Perry referred to streetscapes. A local community can establish the shops and the families that lived in the town a hundred years ago. This work is being done and we should encourage it, as it gives us a great insight into how our forefathers lived.</P>
    <P>We are not doing enough to preserve simple things, for example, mass paths. I live near a very ancient graveyard and an old farmer in the locality pointed out two borreens which were mass paths in the old days but which I would have thought were not of great benefit to anybody. These mass paths would probably date from 300 to 400 years and people would use these paths to get to the graveyard and the ancient church in the centre of it. These mass paths are covered in briars and there is now a stream where once there was a path. These sites should be identified and recorded. In the American wild west they have gone to great lengths to define and retain the old pony express paths that existed between the west and east coast. They have been preserved as they were 150 years ago. We seem to ignore the remains of our heritage.</P>
    <P>I am sure there are roads called the &ldquo;New Line&rdquo; in every county. There are at least three such roads in County Waterford. Those roads are quite modern and I do not know where the original roads were. I do not know anybody locally who knows where the original roads were. By mapping out the old mass paths and the route of the ancient roads we would gain a greater insight into our heritage. Heritage is not just about bricks and mortar but includes roadways, pathways, bridges and so on. There are some fantastic old bridges and instead of demolishing them we could erect the modern bridge in parallel with it. There is a very awkward bridge for road users near Clonmel called Sir Thomas's bridge. I am sure it is at least 200 years old and is unique. It should be retained when the new bridge is built.</P>
    <P>I hate to think of the damage done to our heritage by bulldozers and JCBs. How many developers will stop work and report they have come across an historical monument or an artefact of archeological importance. Developers will loose a <Col N="543" /> mint of money if their work is held up. I do not know if there are means of compensating people in those situations or if penalties are imposed on people who destroy monuments in the course of construction work. There may be penalties but I have heard of a case where it was imposed. Mr. Webb and his son were out searching with metal detectors when they found the Derrynaflan Chalice. They were almost prosecuted, but it would have never been found if they had not located it. They have to be given credit for handing up the chalice. I think treasures are being destroyed every day of the week but nothing is done about it. If this were to happen in England, culprits would feel the rigours of the law. We do not have the staff resources to check out what is happening. It is a national shortcoming that we are negligent in that regard. We are very mercenary in ways. Now that we have more wealth we are inclined to get our priorities wrong. One of our priorities should be to preserve our heritage.</P>
    <P>An old limekiln seems insignificant but these lovely structures show real craftsmanship and are works of art, however, I see them being bulldozed every few weeks when they get in the way of building work or land reclamation. This should not be allowed happen.</P>
    <P>The old lioss, the circular formations within which people lived thousands of years ago, up to six millennia ago, have been allowed to disappear.</P>
    <P>It is a disgrace that Lismore Castle in County Waterford is not open to the public. If it were within 40 or 50 miles of Dublin it would be open to the public.</P>
    <P>This magnificent structure dating back 700 &ndash; 800 years has been occupied over most of that period by the Duke of Devonshire and his family. About one third of the castle is habitable. If the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands and the owners were to liaise with each other, a scheme could be devised to have the other two-thirds renovated and open to the public for viewing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies for their contributions, which I found enlightening, interesting and helpful. It was very positive that in both Houses the protection of our architectural heritage went beyond party politics. A number of issues repeatedly came to the fore in the debate. Deputy Kenny, like many other Deputies, mentioned the question of resources. I am the first to say that the £800,000 for my Department and the £4 million through the local authorities in the legislation from the Department of the Environment and Local Government is not enough, it is only the beginning. I look to Members of this House to support further funding for this, and some have already offered their support. We <Col N="544" /> must do our utmost to obtain further funding to protect our heritage. Every county has an opportunity to see how its heritage can be conserved and protected and the richness of the heritage poses the problem of funding. All would appreciate that the Bill establishes the principle of such funding and we will be trying our level best to increase the money already available.</P>
      <P>The timescale for the inventory was raised by many Deputies. Some people asked why it would take 12 years, because a lot of damage could be done in that time. I accept that, but without this legislation to establish a national inventory we would wait between 25 and 30 years to have the work carried out. I have not pulled that figure out of the air, it is a recognised fact. There are one million structures of architectural heritage significance to be put on the inventory, and one can imagine how much work that will involve. It will also mean additional personnel will be required and that has been built into the package we have been discussing.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kenny also mentioned the work done by the NIAH to date. Thus far, the County Clare survey has been published in draft form, field work has been done in another six counties, 26 interim county surveys are to be completed within three years and information is being given to local authorities as soon as it becomes available. Since I came to office nine final town surveys have been published, together with 12 in draft form. The work is ongoing and there is a lot to be done.</P>
      <P>As to staff resources, the existing technical staff of the NIAH consists of one permanent member of staff and four and a half contract staff. My aim is to have ten technical staff, with sufficient administrative back-up, within one year. The recruitment of staff has already been initiated through the Civil Service Commission. Redeployment of staff within the Civil Service may occur. Finance will be available to contract work out to universities, local authorities and others.</P>
      <P>Co-ordination with local authorities is of extreme importance, which is why we have provided that the grant scheme will go through the local authorities. They will have responsibility for disbursing the money in their areas. In order to ensure the work is of the highest possible quality there will be national guidance. One of the primary bodies giving such guidance and specific information and expertise will be my Department. The sum of £800,000, mentioned already, will go towards this purpose and the other Bill, moved by my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, has funding also.</P>
      <P>Planning applications relating to listed buildings will be subject to the planning laws in the usual way. Where listed buildings are concerned, the Department will be asked for its observations and will have direct input in giving the information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="545" /> I concur with the remarks of Deputy Deenihan and Deputy Deasy about FÁS workers. They have done a tremendous amount of work. Not only can the scheme do that, it provides this generation with an opportunity to learn those skills and crafts and keep them in circulation. I look forward to greater communication and co-ordination between Dúchas and FÁS.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deenihan referred to heritage buildings which might be at risk. The allocation to these buildings is a matter for the National Heritage Council, which is an independent body, although it comes under the aegis of my Department. The Minister of the day provides the council's allocation and since I came into office I am glad that I have been able to increase it. I thank the council's members who have put in such a tremendous amount of work on our behalf to ensure we conserve as much as possible, given the resources on hand.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Shea mentioned the loss of our interior heritage, a matter raised often in the Seanad debate. Sadly, many interiors have been destroyed or have deteriorated over the years, although facades may have been retained in some cases. This issue has been addressed in the Bill because we are well aware of the importance of the interior and the context of the heritage building.</P>
    <P>Both Deputy O'Shea and Deputy Deasy mentioned Lismore Castle and we know the great heritage of that building. The only direct financial assistance which may apply to that castle would be through the local authority grant scheme which will come into operation on foot of these Bills. Other possible avenues are the National Heritage Council and the tax relief scheme, under which a stately home is allowed open to the public for a certain number of days per year.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Shea also referred to the balance between access to and preservation and conservation of our heritage, and the privacy of those who live in heritage buildings which are also private dwellings. The legislation stipulates that consent is required in order to gain access to such buildings. In the absence of consent, the authorised officers may apply to the District Court for a warrant and they must satisfy the court that access to the dwelling is required for the specific purpose of the national inventory.</P>
    <P>When drafting the Bill we gave careful consideration to the publication of information, a matter which was also raised in the Seanad, and we decided that it is the responsibility of the Minister of the day to exercise his or her discretion in that regard while taking account of security issues. It is a question of trying to achieve a fair balance between granting access to such information about our heritage while ensuring that the rights of those occupying private dwellings are recognised.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="546" /> With regard to occupiers' liability, a number of years ago Deputy Deenihan, while in Opposition, introduced a Bill dealing with that matter. I recall taking part in the debate on that legislation and concurring with many of the points he raised. Since then, the position in respect of occupiers' liability has improved and we have addressed many of the issues which required attention. The Bill before the House will not alter or amend the legal provisions governing occupiers' liability.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to a number of issues about which Deputy Michael Kitt was concerned. The Deputy did tremendous work on a project to develop a marina on the River Suck at Ballinasloe. He was committed to the project from the outset and his efforts are finally coming to fruition. I wish everyone involved with the project, particularly Deputy Kitt, well.</P>
    <P>Like other Members, Deputy Kitt referred to the financial elements of the Bill. He placed on record the fact that these should merely be seen as a beginning. He also emphasised the significance of the work carried out by local authorities. It is important to take this opportunity &ndash; Members representing constituencies outside Dublin will be particularly sensitive to this &ndash; to state that it is the responsibility of people to express an interest in and take ownership of the heritage in their areas rather than leaving it to authorities in the capital city to decide the manner in which these issues should be addressed. The financial proposal contained in this package is important because it establishes the fact that the grant system will be put in place at local authority level.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kitt also raised the issue of signage. My Department is responsible for the signage relating to historic properties owned by the State or those in State care. The Tourist Board and local authorities have similar functions and it is important that we adopt a co-ordinated approach in this area because we must cater not only for the needs of those interested in local architectural heritage, monuments and buildings but also for those of tourists.</P>
    <P>Deputy Donal Carey referred to the 12 year timescale. Given the additional financial and staffing resources being made available to the NIAH, the time it would take in normal circumstances to carry out the national inventory and take note of the many issues which must be addressed as quickly as possible in order to conserve our heritage, can now be greatly shortened. I agree with the Deputy's comments on funding and I look forward to his support and that of other Members in attempting to secure additional funds.</P>
    <P>Deputy Carey also referred to the situation at Ennis Friary. This is an issue of interest not only to Deputy Carey and me but also to others who are interested in architectural heritage. One of the groups actively pursuing this matter and a <Col N="547" /> number of local people have been in contact with me in respect of plans for Ennis Friary. It is important that these people should be consulted about any plans put forward.</P>
    <P>Deputy Perry referred to the consistency and co-ordination required to ensure that a proper, organised and ordered approach is taken to the conservation of our heritage. A number of committees have already been established to ensure that such an approach is adopted. The NIAH advisory committee provides advice on the operation of the inventory, while a number of groups are working on the construction of guidelines for public authorities. The Department of the Environment and Local Government also runs a number of schemes and is co-ordinating matters with my Department on that issue.</P>
    <P>I recently had the opportunity to visit the architectural archive to which Deputy Perry referred in order to learn about the great work carried out by everyone involved with that project. The members of the Irish Architectural Archive have correlated and preserved a tremendous amount of information for the benefit of the State and the general public. I agree with Deputy Deasy that, while it is important to ensure that such information is correlated and preserved, we must also ensure that it is accessible and available to the local public. It was for this reason I was anxious to see funding allocated to the national archives for its new headquarters because in time the public will gain greater access to the information deposited there.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deasy also referred to the importance of local history and the valuable information known to older members of the community which must be passed on and made accessible. However, the Deputy did not raise one issue, namely, attempting to correlate women's history. I am particularly interested in the women's project because women were often written out of history and, like the folklore commission, we are trying to see how further information can be gathered about women's experiences.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>People in Ardmore, County Waterford, were horrified to learn that the boatcove at Ardmore was not included in the small harbours programme announced by the Minister. More than £4 million was made available to improve the infrastructure of a variety of small harbours around the country.</P>
      <P>Ardmore has a small pier and a good deal of work is being done on the boatcove section of it. A total of £45,000 was secured from the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources in 1995 and £38,000 was secured from the county council. That constituted a fair sum of money necessary to carry out a certain amount of work.</P>
      <P>The boatcove and pier are not weather-proof. One cannot bring a boat in or out or moor it in the area during bad weather, and the weather need not even be stormy. In any period of bad weather the whole area is very exposed. A further injection of cash is badly needed.</P>
      <P>This problem may arise because Waterford County Council may not have applied for a grant under this small harbours programme this year. If that is the case, it was extremely remiss because everybody knows work on the harbour must be completed.</P>
      <P>A study carried out by University College Cork indicates that between £0.8 million and £1.5 million is needed to make the harbour safe in all weathers. That would be a considerable investment. Some of the projects listed for which money was granted involve as much as £400,000 for 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I advocate that funding for Ardmore harbour be considered on a phased basis to make it a safe haven in all weathers. That is essential. It has tremendous potential. It could employ up to 50 or 60 people. When the driftnet salmon exercise was in full swing in the 1970s and early 1980s, approximately 40 people were employed full-time during the summer season. All that has finished now because of restrictions, but the pier could be <Col N="549" /> utilised by 50 or 60 fishermen who might fish for whitefish, lobster, crab or shrimp.</P>
    <P>Ardmore harbour also has major potential for leisure activities. Allowances should be made for the needs of those engaged in the leisure sector and fishermen. I ask the Minister to give a commitment that Ardmore will be considered under future programmes and that he and some officials in his Department will study the work carried out by the experts from University College Cork and implement the programme they laid out to make the harbour weather-proof.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for the points he made about Ardmore harbour. I am pleased to have this opportunity to address the House on harbour development and, in particular, on the 1999 programme for the development of small harbours. This programme supports investment in a considerable number of small harbours and landing facilities around the coast to the benefit of fishing, aquaculture and marine tourism and leisure. It is a clear indication of the Government's commitment to the provision of safe, modern and efficient ports and landing places.</P>
      <P>The small harbours programme I announced last month was an entirely new initiative which will facilitate and support improvement and development works at 41 locations in eight counties. It represents a total investment of almost £4 million and will be a major boost for fishermen, fish farmers and those involved in tourism and leisure projects as well as local coastal communities.</P>
      <P>The investment will focus on providing new facilities, or upgrading existing ones, at locations where existing infrastructure is no longer adequate for current uses. There is a particular emphasis on facilities for the fast expanding aquaculture industry, but the works to be carried out under the programme will also help to underpin jobs in other key areas, such as inshore fisheries, sea angling and marine tourism. My Department will contribute 75 per cent of the cost of the works at each of the locations with the balance of the funding coming from local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that my Department has an extensive list of proposals on hands for harbour development and, notwithstanding the very substantially increased funding provided by the Government this year, the demand for financial assistance for works is considerably greater than the resources available. For example, numerous proposals were submitted to my Department over recent years by fishery harbour users, including fishermen, processors and the aquaculture industry as well as local authorities. In addition, my Department identified upgrading and development requirements at key centres of activity around the coast. It is necessary, therefore, to direct the available funding towards the <Col N="550" /> locations of greatest priority. This was the approach I adopted in drawing up the programme I announced last month.</P>
    <P>Projects that cannot be included in a particular programme are kept on record in my Department and receive full and careful consideration in the context of any subsequent proposals for allocation of funding.</P>
    <P>The harbour infrastructure at Ardmore is owned by Waterford County Council and, as with local authority harbour facilities generally, development or maintenance works are the responsibility of the county council in the first instance. As the Deputy stated, in 1995 my Department provided grant aid of £45,000 to the county council to support an overall investment of £75,000 in improvement works in Ardmore consisting of an extension of the existing slipway.</P>
    <P>To date, Waterford County Council has not made any proposals to my Department for further development works at Ardmore, and the Deputy mentioned this might be the case. I assure him any proposals the local authority wishes to put forward will be considered carefully in the drawing up of further works programmes, taking account of available funding and overall investment priorities.</P>
    <P>I would like to bring to the attention of the House that the 1999 small harbours programme is in addition to the £7.35 million which the Government made available this year for works at key strategic fishery harbours, including Killybegs, Dingle, Castletownbere, Burtonport, Greencastle and Kilmore Quay. I am pleased that the combined expenditure under the major fishery harbours programme and the small harbours programme represents an increase of almost 350 per cent over expenditure in 1998. I am confident this substantially increased expenditure will contribute significantly to developing Ireland's marine resources for the benefit of the country as a whole and for people in coastal communities in particular. I will also seek high levels of funding for harbour works in future years so that our shore infrastructure can effectively meet the requirements of the fishing fleet, the aquaculture industry and tourism and leisure needs through the provision of berthage and related facilities that are safe, up to date and efficient.</P>
    <P>The Deputy said that, according to the UCC study, the estimated cost of carrying out the necessary work would be between £0.8 million to £1.5 million and he asked if funding that work could be considered on a phased basis. I will have that matter examined.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to raise this matter. Legitimate questions involving the circumstances surrounding the introduction of section 19 of the Finance Act, 1994, will not go away. Due to the persistent efforts of Deputies in this House and the <i>Sunday Tribune</i>, new information regarding this extraordinary decision continues to trickle into the public domain. The controversy has been an issue of public concern since the beginning of the year yet, incredibly, the Government will not provide full and frank answers.</P>
      <P>In common with the Taoiseach's concealment of his role in the Sheedy affair, the obfuscation and evasion of the Government on this issue only serves to fuel suspicions that someone has something to hide regarding the unprecedented decision taken by the then Minister for Finance in his 1994 budget.</P>
      <P>The facts are well known to Members of the House. However, last week the <i>Sunday Tribune</i> published information that has come to light as a result of questions put by Deputy Noonan. I appreciate that a number of Ministers and Deputies may have been more concerned at another headline screaming out at them from that issue of the newspaper.</P>
      <P>I will outline the latest revelations. The fact that section 19 of the Finance Act benefited one person only who happened to be a donor to the Fianna Fáil Party is well established. The Taoiseach, in defence of his role in this affair, has attempted to douse the flames by claiming that Mr. Rohan's tax assessment had already been brought before the Appeal Commissioners and that they had found in his favour. The Taoiseach claims that Mr. Rohan's tax bill was nil at the time the legislation was introduced and, therefore, any claims of impropriety or worse were unfounded.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach failed, however, to place on the public record what was eventually wangled out of the Department of Finance after a series of Parliamentary Questions &ndash; the fact the Revenue Commissioners were intent on appealing the decision of the Appeal Commissioners to the High Court. According to newspaper reports, the tax due on behalf of Mr. Rohan was approximately £1.5 million. Their efforts to recover this money in the wake of the Appeal Commissioners' judgment were blocked by the introduction of section 19. This section of the Finance Act scuppered the intention of the Revenue Commissioners to mount a legal challenge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is now incontrovertible evidence that the introduction of section 19 of the Finance Act <Col N="552" /> materially benefited Mr. Rohan. It prevented the Revenue Commissioners from pursuing a High Court case. Mr. Rohan could contentedly enjoy the lavish contents of his stately home in the certain knowledge that Bertie Ahern's allegedly innocuous section 19 had saved him the trouble to defending the tax implications of his opulent hobby before a court of law. Our hero was free with one bound.</P>
    <P>I remind Deputies of the statement made in this House by the Minister for Finance on 16 December 1998 on the role of the Revenue Commissioners in bringing Appeal Commissioners' judgments before the courts. On that occasion, when the nation was outraged at the fact that Mr. C. J. Haughey's tax assessment was reduced to zero, the Minister for Finance attempted to reassure the nation with the following words:</P>
    <P>I understand it is standard Revenue practice where considerable tax is at risk, or where points of tax principle are involved for Revenue to vigorously pursue such liabilities and matters through the courts. Where the issues are complex it is rare for the Appeals Commissioner's decision to be taken as final by either side. It can be taken that the Revenue Commissioners will appeal this case through the courts in keeping with their normal practice.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance claimed it is normal practice for the Revenue Commissioners to vigorously appeal complex cases to courts. Could the Minister explain to the House why, if this is normal accepted practice, did the then Minister for Finance block this expected and usual course of action with section 19 of the Finance Act? This Government cannot have it both ways. When one Fianna Fáil leader plays ducks and drakes with the tax authorities in this State we are told to keep calm, the Revenue will take all possible steps to pursue the case through the courts. However, when a Fianna Fáil donor is about to receive the same vigorous attention from the Revenue Commissioners, the law is changed, preventing a legal challenge from the Revenue.</P>
    <P>In view of the extraordinary circumstances surrounding this matter, I call on the Minister to give a full and frank explanation. In the absence of that, I call on the Taoiseach to come before the House, make a statement and answer questions on this extraordinary affair.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I dealt with this issue previously in reply to Parliamentary Questions and during the passage of the Finance Bill, 1999. In answering this matter, I want to outline once more the background to the introduction of this relief in section 19 of the Finance Act, 1994.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section introduced a relief which exempted specified benefits provided to any individual by <Col N="553" /> his employers from the benefit-in-kind income tax charge under section 117 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, and a similar income tax charge under section 96 of the Corporation Tax Act, 1976. The exempted benefit consists of the loan to any individual of a work of art or a scientific collection owned by his or her employer and which is available for viewing by the public. The section has effect for the tax year 1993-4 and subsequent years but could also apply from the introduction of the relief for expenditure on significant buildings, that is, from the year of assessment 1982-3.</P>
    <P>The original representations which gave rise to section 19 date from February 1993. On that occasion the Irish Georgian Society wrote to the Minister saying that the society had recently been approached by a number of members who were deeply concerned by what they believed was a new proposal by the Revenue Commissioners to tax art collections in certain circumstances. The society pointed out that many of its members allowed the public to visit their historic houses to view, study and enjoy the buildings and art collections. This access was recognised in the previous section 19 of the Finance Act, 1982.</P>
    <P>The society proposed a tax relief for such collections on view to the public in such &ldquo;section 19&rdquo; houses, in order to retain important collections in the State for the enjoyment of the people and in the interest of preserving the national heritage.</P>
    <P>By way of explanation, section 19 of the Finance Act, 1982, now section 482 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, provides tax relief on the repair, maintenance or restoration of a building which is intrinsically of significant scientific, historical, architectural or aesthetic interest. The building must be determined by the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands to be intrinsically of significant scientific, historical, architectural or aesthetic interest. The Revenue Commissioners then determine that the building is one to which reasonable access is afforded to the public. This relief came into effect from the 1982-3 tax year.</P>
    <P>Around the same time as the representation had been received from the Irish Georgian Society, the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands wrote supporting the proposal, referring in particular to the case of a tax assessment on a named individual. The individual concerned also wrote to the Minister in October 1993 seeking an amendment to the Finance Acts indicating that such a change would be doing a great service to Irish heritage and that there was a danger of people moving works of art out of the State for sale. As indicated in reply to a question on 27 April 1999, the tax case in question had been heard and was won on appeal to the Appeal Commissioners in May 1993 by the taxpayer but the Revenue authorities were continuing to pursue the case.</P>
    <P>In January 1994, representations from Bord <Col N="554" /> Fáilte were forwarded by the Department of the Taoiseach supporting the proposed change to the Finance Acts. Having examined the matter, the Minister replied to the individual concerned in January 1994 that a suitable provision would be included in the Finance Bill. The Department of the Taoiseach was also informed of the position.</P>
    <P>As a result of this decision, the Department drew up parameters for the relief in consultation with the Revenue, as is normal in the case of Finance Bill provisions. These parameters included provision for the retrospective effect of the relief to the tax year 1982-3. The proposed scheme of relief was published in the Finance Bill, 1994, as initiated, as section 17.</P>
    <P>This retrospection is consistent with the year in which the relief for expenditure on significant buildings was introduced. There is nothing unusual in reliefs being made retrospective in certain circumstances and this has been a feature of various Finance Acts passed over the years. The proposed relief was specifically mentioned by the Minister in his Second Stage contribution and was amended as it went through the House, having been discussed in some detail.</P>
    <P>As will be clear, this legislation was enacted following representations from a number of reputable sources and was supported in the House when it was being passed. The legislation applied generally; it was not confined to a sole beneficiary, as has been claimed in the media. Others in similar circumstances to those described in the legislation could benefit as could those who might, but for the relief provided by section 19, have been liable to assessment of tax on the objects in question. During the passing of the Bill in 1994, the then Opposition spokesperson speculated on how the BIK assessment might affect particular individuals other than the person now being associated with section 19. Furthermore, that Deputy made it clear that assessing art as a benefit-in-kind in these circumstances had surprised even the tax experts at the time.</P>
    <P>I have on each occasion on which this matter was raised provided what information I could to the House. I have no problem with this. There are limitations, however, as some of the questions may relate to an individual's actual tax liability and, in accordance with long-standing confidentiality arrangements, it is not the practice to give such details in the House. Nevertheless, I hope the considerable detail I have given on this and other occasions explains the position to the Deputy.</P>

      <P>The matter I am raising is not one of national interest but it is of great concern <Col N="555" /> to the people in a small village who are proud of their area. It is embarrassing for all of us that a Department is preventing the tidy towns committee and the local community from aspiring to win, or even compete in, the tidy villages competition. I refer to the appalling derelict state of the Garda station in the village of Golden, where I was born and reared. Golden is a beautiful village. Much work has been done through FÁS and in co-operation with the local community, but the eyesore in the village is the Garda station. I am not talking about millions of pounds but a small sum of money is required to bring that building up to an acceptable standard. If it is allowed to deteriorate much further, it should come under the derelict sites Act. It is unfair of a Department to allow a building which is in a prominent position in the village &ndash; it is located at the entrance to the village &ndash; fall into such disrepair. The paint is peeling off the walls and the building looks dilapidated.</P>
      <P>It is bad enough that the local community no longer has a member of the Garda Síochána living in their village but it is another matter that they are left with this eyesore. We are talking about a small amount of money but it would mean a great deal to the local community in their aspiration to win the tidy villages competition. They want to be proud of their locality. I ask the Minister to provide the money necessary to bring this building up to an acceptable standard.</P>
      <P>We should not have to raise a matter such as this on the floor of the House. This is a reasonable request from an honest, hard-working and sincere community. I look forward to good news from the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, for raising this issue and affording me the opportunity to explain the position regarding Golden Garda station in County Tipperary. The Minister is aware that Golden Garda station leaves much to be desired. To remedy this situation, various options have been considered, including refurbishing the existing station or building a new one on a greenfield site. At one stage the latter option was reckoned to be the best one. To this end, the Office of Public Works was requested to search for a site or premises in the area which would be suitable to meet Garda requirements. I understand, however, that to date no suitable site has been identified. In view of this ongoing difficulty in obtaining a site, the Minister recently instructed his officials to re-examine the matter. As a result, the Office of Public Works has been requested to examine again the minimum cost of refurbishing the existing station. It also has been asked to consider if it would be feasible and more economical to demolish the existing building and <Col N="556" /> build a new station on the site. When these options have been examined, the Minister will see how quickly the matter can be progressed. There will be no avoidable delay in resolving the difficulties at Golden Garda station, subject to other Garda building priorities.</P>
      <P>A great deal has been achieved in recent years in improving the standards of accommodation at Garda stations throughout the country. It is, however, a largescale operation. This programme of improvement has a high priority both with the Minister and the Government. This year, for instance, more than £10 million has been provided for the building and maintenance of Garda stations. The gardaí occupy 704 Garda stations, units of accommodation throughout the country, including married quarters, large complexes like Templemore and Garda Headquarters, and a variety of smaller units. Many of the buildings occupied by them were built before the foundation of the State and were designed for a different era. Many, like the one in Golden, need major upgrading or replacement.</P>
      <P>Tipperary has not been forgotten in the Minister's Garda building programme. Work on the extension and refurbishment of Thurles Garda station, costing £1.3 million, is scheduled to be completed in the autumn. The Minister also secured a special allocation this year for development of the Garda College at Templemore. This project will provide a residential block, lecture theatres and recreational facilities to cater for the increased number of recruits being inducted as part of the Government's programme to increase the strength of the force to 12,000. This project, which will cost in excess of £3 million, will start later this year. There are also plans to build a new district headquarters in the town of Templemore. I understand from the Office of Public Works that negotiations for the purchase of premises in the town for the new station are at an advanced stage.</P>
      <P>A great deal of work has been done in recent years to upgrade Garda accommodation and I am sure Members of the House will acknowledge the many improvements to Garda stations and the new stations built in recent years throughout the country. Golden Garda station will follow as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>Over the weekend, a popular young Dún Laoghaire man, Mr. Mark Bryan, was slaughtered by a car driven by a 20 year old thief out on bail who was driving on the wrong side of the Lucan bypass. A few weeks earlier, a father of four working in his hackney car, Mr. Derek Hall, Tallaght, was also tragically slaughtered by a similar stolen car. Over recent years, as the Minister knows, approximately nine people have been killed in Cork city. My constituency has <Col N="557" /> been plagued with the problem. There have been several near misses and people are asking when the next fatality will occur.</P>
      <P>I read the response in today's <i>Irish Independent</i> of the Garda Commissioner, Mr. Pat Byrne, who rightly emphasised the issues of safety and the use of a helicopter and a stinger, but that response is not good enough. It is not good enough for the Bryan and Hall families, the families who lost loved ones in Cork or in my constituents who live in terror three or four nights a week. That response is one of the reasons I have asked for an independent audit of our crime statistics. In relation to joyriding, for example, if the 400 or 500 members of the travelling public who are affected by this crime on a nightly basis reported these cases &ndash; the majority of them do not &ndash; our crime statistics would be higher. Perhaps the Commissioner would take this matter seriously.</P>
      <P>This is about the eighth occasion I have raised this problem in the Dáil &ndash; I raised it four or five times with the Taoiseach on the Order of Business &ndash; and the third time I have raised it on the Adjournment, yet the problem remains. I commend Assistant Garda Commissioner McHugh who, in response to my previous request, helped to set up a joyriding task force for the Dublin north-east area comprising the local authority, public representatives, the gardaí and local people. That is an initiative but public representatives have not been kept informed of meetings. The Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, also has responsibility in this area. A few weeks ago Deputy Shortall was thrown out of the House when she demanded that the juvenile justice Bill, which has been on the stocks for the last four years, be passed. That Bill emphasises victim support and restorative justice and would be a welcome addition to the legislation available to the Garda.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party is willing to support amendments to the Road Traffic Act, 1994, if it is not strong enough and if the Garda Commissioner needs additional powers. More Garda resources are needed in the worst affected areas in north Cork and Dublin city. The J and R districts of north-east Dublin need another 50 or 60 gardaí. These resources should be made available in a manner similar to that used to tackle the drugs problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should expand the task force idea to the south side of Dublin, Cork city and other affected areas. Most of all we need an education and information campaign targeted at young people. The Minister, Deputy McCreevy, recently gave the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy McDaid, about £14 million for the youth projects under the sports capital programme. That is about 25 per cent of the money needed. I could spend £2 million in my constituency. The money allocated is not enough when we consider what needs to be done. My task force area is pro<Col N="558" /> posing to set up a car education and young driver training course similar to those introduced some years ago when this problem first plagued us. These courses try to involve some of the young people in responsible careers in driving after they have completed their punishment, if that is what they desire. This needs support from the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>This is a serious problem. What happened to the families in Tallaght and Dun Laoghaire is outrageous. I urge the Ministers for Finance and Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Garda Commissioner to take the problem seriously and try to solve it once and for all.</P>

With regard to the incident which occurred 2 May 1999 at 2.14 a.m. on the N4 Lucan bypass, on behalf of the Minister, I wish to extend sympathy to the relatives of the person killed in that incident. The matter is under investigation with a view to submitting a file to the Law Officers.</P>
      <P>The Minister understands that provisional statistics for 1998 indicate that unauthorised taking are 13,793. At a time when there are indications of a dramatic and consistent decrease in crime generally, this is a matter which gives the Minister cause for concern. As the Minister has outlined to the House on previous occasions, the problem of joyriding is an example of disorderly and unruly activities by a small minority of young people, most of whom come from backgrounds which may have disadvantages of various kinds. Although disadvantage is not an excuse for this type of behaviour, it does highlight the need for an inter-agency approach to the problem.</P>
      <P>The Garda Síochána have the power and resources to deal with the problem. The Minister has been informed by Garda authorities that certain measures have been taken. There are higher visibility patrols in urban areas. Gardaí are also using the vehicle stopping device known as the &ldquo;stinger&rdquo;. This device is not automatically used in every case of joyriding as the safety of the general public is the primary concern. An assessment must be made in each instance by a senior ranking Garda officer as to whether it is safe to use the stinger in a given circumstance. The stinger was used on 18 occasions in 1998 and 13 occasions in 1997. The device and the Garda air support unit combined have been used to apprehend car thieves.</P>
      <P>The gardaí have the power under section 41 of the Road Traffic Act, 1994, to stop and seize vehicles they believe to be driven by under-age drivers. Gardaí liaise with local authorities on traffic management issues with the result that traffic calming measures are introduced or will be introduced in urban areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="559" /> As part of the continuing campaign against joyriding, the Garda are deeply conscious of the need to secure the support of the public in the worst affected areas. This is why, as well as apprehending offenders, they are and will continue to meet with local people and community groups who are concerned about anti-social activities.</P>
    <P>The Minister supports and funds programmes generally referred to as youth diversion schemes, which are community based and designed to draw young people away from crime. In the current year, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform will fund 24 Garda youth diversion projects. This represents a doubling of these projects from 12 to 24 during this Government's term of office. The Minister also funds projects run by the Probation and Welfare Service.</P>
    <P>Of the 14 Garda projects established between 1991 and 1998, seven operate in Dublin in Ronanstown, Tallaght, Blanchardstown, Cherry Orchard, Darndale, the north inner city and Finglas south. The six new projects being established this year will be located at Donore Avenue, O'Devaney Gardens, Ballybrack/ Loughlinstown, lower Ballyfermot and Ballymun.</P>
    <P>Three projects have been established in Cork city in Knocknaheeney, Mahon and the Glen. <Col N="560" /> The two Limerick projects are based in Moyross and Southhill. Two projects also operate in Waterford in Ballybeg and Farran Park in the south-east of the city. The remaining projects are located in Bray, Tralee, Sligo and Dundalk.</P>
    <P>Through the combined efforts of local agencies, these projects aim to identify the young people at risk and assess intervention programmes to service their needs. They also aim to promote the productive and creative use of the target group's leisure time with a view to enabling their integration into mainstream youth activity groups, and to liaise closely with parents, schools, other agencies and the community in general.</P>
    <P>The Garda Síochána will not let up in their continuing campaign against joyriding and will continue to work with local communities and State services so that all possible steps are taken to deter such behaviour. The need for an inter-agency approach to this problem in disadvantaged areas is one which has been expounded on numerous occasions. I assure the Deputy that the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform will continue do its utmost to try to resolve the difficulty in so far as it is in a position to do so.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.15 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 11 May 1999.</P>

    <P>(Dr. McDaid): As Minister, I have overall responsibility for the formulation of national policy in the areas of tourism, sport and recreation and, through my Department, for monitoring its implementation. The execution of policy is a matter for the statutory state agencies under the remit of my Department. These include Bord Fáilte Éireann, CERT and Shannon Development in respect of tourism development in the mid-west region. Exchequer funding for these bodies is provided through the Vote of my Department as set out in the Book of Estimates and approved by the Dáil each year.</P>
    <P>All the funds discharged through my Department's Vote are monitored and controlled in accordance with the principles of Government accounting practices and procedures set out in public financial procedures prepared by the Department of Finance. In addition, the accounts of my Department and the state agencies under its aegis are audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General and together with his report thereon are laid before each House of the Oireachtas. In addition, the Secretary General of my Department and the chief executives of the state bodies under its aegis are subject as the Accounting Officers for expenditure by their respective organisations to examination by the Committee of Public Accounts.</P>
    <P>These financial management controls and procedures provide full accountability and transparency in expenditure by the state agencies.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>A key sport policy objective of my Department is to encourage increased participation in sport <Col N="562" /> and recreation by people of all ages and abilities, particularly those from disadvantaged communities. Towards this end the Department provides financial assistance to some 75 national governing bodies of sport for sport participation programmes and, from time to time, to a range of other organisations in respect of specific projects and programmes directed at increasing participation in sport.</P>
    <P>In the past such organisations have included the Irish Heart Foundation, Dublin Healthy Cities Project and Age and Opportunity, an organisation which directs its programmes towards older people, for its &ldquo;Go for Life&rdquo; programme, which provides older people with the opportunity to participate in sport.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, legislation is currently before the Seanad regarding the creation of a new statutory Sports Council which will have a number of functions, including a statutory function of developing strategies for increasing participation in sport and the co-ordination of their implementation by all bodies involved in promoting recreational sport and providing recreational facilities.</P>

      <P>In partnership with the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation, I have been engaged over the past year in planning to address the future policy challenges facing the industry. Given the increasingly competitive and sophisticated global marketplace in which we operate, we both agree on the need to secure adequate provision for tourism marketing for the year 2000 onwards.</P>
      <P>As I have already indicated in my reply to previous parliamentary questions, one of the options which I have been exploring, in consultation with the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation, for the future financing of tourism destination marketing, is the possible introduction of a modest visitor levy in line with practice in many other countries, but without prejudice to the case for continued EU funding for tourism marketing under the next round of Structural Funds.</P>
      <P>While no final decisions have been taken yet in relation to the possible introduction of a levy, I share the industry's anxiety that the issue of future provision for tourism marketing be resolved as soon as possible to properly plan for 2000 and subsequent years, and I am working towards achieving this objective.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid)</NameTxt>
      <P>The tourism industry has been experiencing an increasing problem with labour and skill shortages in recent years but these difficulties are not unique to the sector. Due to Ireland's recent favourable economic performance and changing demographic structure, labour shortages are now affecting many sectors in the economy including retailing, building and construction and software.</P>
      <P>In response to these difficulties, both the tourism industry representative bodies and CERT continue to work individually and in partnership to promote careers in tourism in a very competitive environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="564" /> In November 1998, CERT launched the first national tourism careers roadshow as part of its recruitment drive. The roadshow toured nationwide and was supported by a major media and advertising campaign. It featured careers days in 35 prime venues and was backed by similar events in CERT's own centres which together attracted over 10,000 student visitors. A databank of over 8,000 seeking further contact and summer jobs in the industry has been compiled.</P>
    <P>A <i>Careers in Tourism Magazine,</i> sponsored by CERT, the Irish Hotels Federation and the Restaurants Association of Ireland, was produced and given to every student who attended any of the career promotion events. A 16 page careers supplement was also produced in a national newspaper and 5,000 copies of the supplement were distributed at career events throughout 1998.</P>
    <P>Workshops for career guidance counsellors took place in Kilkenny, Carlow and Kerry, 60 school exhibitions were also attended by CERT and 283 career talks were given to 10,000 students. These talks were targeted at those schools that did not attend the careers roadshows.</P>
    <P>A tourism recruitment promotion with 2FM Radio took place in January and February this year involving participation in street entertainment and radio slots over a three week period.</P>
    <P>The telephone careers information line on freephone 1800 produced more than 3,000 inquiries on tourism careers. Careers information was circulated to over 1,400 schools, FÁS offices, libraries and youth organisations. Information packs were made available to all industry personnel giving career talks. These packs include career brochures and course information, a careers video and overhead slides.</P>
    <P>I understand that notwithstanding the competitive labour environment, CERT maintained 1998 recruitment levels at close to the previous year's levels with the assistance of a range of interventions, including those which I have already outlined. I understand from CERT that it anticipates a broadly similar outturn in 1999.</P>
    <P>On many occasions since taking up office, I have urged the industry to become more proactive in addressing recruitment difficulties and labour shortages and to take appropriate steps to counter the perceived poor image of tourism as a career opportunity. In this context I particularly welcome the Irish Hotels Federation's quality employer programme which is based on best practice in all aspects of employment including recruitment, induction training, ongoing performance assessment, career progression and conditions of pay and employment. I understand that in the two years since the programme was introduced, about 60 per cent of members of the federation have applied for accreditation and that 220 establishments have been accredited so far. The Restaurants Association of Ireland's restaurant and customer charter is another good example of the type of initiative needed.</P>
    <P>As the labour market is expected to tighten with unemployment levels declining further over <Col N="565" /> the coming years, greater emphasis may well have to be placed on other potential sources of labour for the tourism sector, including married women returning to work, retired people, those wishing to work part-time and non-national labour. The key challenge facing the industry and CERT is how to put in place appropriate policies, programmes and arrangements to attract, motivate and retain a skilled labour force in the face of declining labour availability and increasing competition from other sectors. For the industry this will also involve considering internal training requirements and measures which could improve labour productivity. In the context of preparations for the new national development plan, my Department is working closely with CERT to identify the most appropriate focus for its activities in the future and specific measures which should be undertaken by it to help address the training requirements of the industry, in an increasingly competitive labour market.</P>

      <P>My Department also administers the £20 million grant to the GAA towards the ongoing development of Croke Park. The grant is being paid over a three year period 1998-2000. To date, an amount of £7 million has been paid in respect of work done to date.</P>
      <P>No decisions have yet been made on what national facilities, if any, will be funded under the 1999 round of grant allocations under the sports capital programme. However, I recently decided that an in-depth feasibility study should be commissioned in relation to a proposal to develop an indoor facility at Morton Stadium. The study will examine a number of issues, including the demand for such a facility and the optimum scale and projected costs of the proposed facility.</P>
      <P>In relation to the development of a national stadium, the Deputy should note that in October last year, the Government agreed to the commissioning of a feasibility study, and to the establishment of a stadium steering committee to conduct and to make recommendations based on the findings of the study. The steering committee is chaired by Mr. Derek Keogh and includes representatives from major sporting organisations, including the FAI, the GAA and the IRFU, as well as representatives from the private sector and a number of Government Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The committee is overseeing the preparation of a feasibility study which will address the issues necessary for the Government to make an early decision on the matter. The study will examine a range of issues relevant to the feasibility of <Col N="568" /> developing and operating a stadium, including the economic, social and other benefits that can be expected to be derived, and will analyse potential demand for use of the facilities from various sporting, entertainment and other commercial categories.</P>
    <P>The steering committee expect that the finalised feasibility study, and the recommendations on it, will be available for consideration by the Government by September 1999.</P>

      <P>The overall objective purpose of the youth and sport grant scheme operated by the vocational education committees with financial assistance from my Department is to promote participation in sport and youth activities at local and county level, especially among disadvantaged groups and young people generally within the VEC areas. The scheme is currently being reviewed in my Department with particular regard to its overall objective and how this can be best achieved. The VEC sector has already been consulted and the review is expected to be completed shortly.</P>
      <P>The recommendations arising from the review will be considered in framing appropriate initiatives to assist the vocational education committees in the development of sport at local level. I expect that, before the end of next month, invitations for proposals for 1999, with new guidelines, will issue to vocational education committees with allocations being made shortly afterwards.</P>

The campaign has produced a range of information that is continually updated and expanded, is freely available and has been widely distributed to businesses. The campaign has a consultative committee, which includes representatives from CERT and the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation, to advise on the content of the campaign and to circulate material to the businesses which are members of the organisations represented on it. In addition, the Euro Changeover Board of Ireland has run an extensive public information programme on the changeover to the euro including advertising, a leaflet for every household, and the board continues to provide information for the public, including via its web site.</P>
      <P>As regards tourism specifically, CERT has developed an EMU workshop specifically for the tourism industry. This workshop was promoted throughout the industry in 1998. A total of 17 workshops were held throughout the country, with attendance by over 300 managers and supervisors.</P>
      <P>CERT is working with the Forfás campaign in the development of appropriate training materials for industry and with the Association for Monetary Union in Europe on euro guides for tourism operators. Furthermore, a meeting will be held shortly, under the auspices of the Forfás EMU business awareness campaign, to review the preparedness of the tourism sector to deal with tourists this summer in the context of the euro and to see what measures, if any, need to be taken now for that purpose.

      <P>In pursuit of the policy objective of developing strategies to increase participation in sport, my Department has agreed with the Department of Education and Science to launch an initiative involving the Irish Sports Council and the National Coaching and Training Centre, which is designed to help schools increase participation in sport and physical education. The Department of Education and Science is already piloting a new physical education curriculum in selected schools throughout the country.</P>
      <P>The new initiative will provide for specialist training in the National Coaching and Training Centre for club coaches, teachers and parents which will enable them to work with children in selected schools in expanding and enhancing the range and quality of sport available. It is intended that this training will help achieve synergy between schools and the resources and expertise available to them in clubs and sports organisations in the local community.</P>
      <P>Other programmes under way in the area of children's and school sport are Youth Sport Foyle and Youth Sport West, which are operated by Donegal and Sligo Vocational Education Committees respectively in co-operation with the Western Education and Library Board in Northern Ireland. The purpose of these projects is to develop mechanisms to establish links, and maintain them on an ongoing basis, between schools and sports organisations and local clubs aimed at providing positive sporting experiences for school children across a range of sports activities.</P>

      <P>One of the Government's key priorities is to ensure a more focused and better co-ordinated response by the statutory authorities in addressing the needs of severely disadvantaged urban communities.</P>
      <P>To that end, the Interdepartmental Committee on Local Development, which I chair, has been given a mandate to oversee the creation of an integrated services process which aims to produce a model of best practice that can be extended to other deprived urban areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first phase of that project involved a close look at the situation on the ground in four areas &ndash; Dublin's north-east inner city, the canal communities of Fatima Mansions, St. Teresa's <Col N="571" /> Garden, St. Michael's House, Dolphin House, Jobstown, Tallaght and Togher, Cork.</P>
    <P>Following a decision by the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion, the implementation phase was launched by the Taoiseach on 4 December 1998 at a special meeting of Secretaries General of relevant Departments and chief executive officers of relevant statutory agencies.</P>
    <P>Each of these relevant Departments and statutory agencies has designated an official at national and local level, who is responsible for driving the integrated services process within that Department or agency.</P>
    <P>Persons designated at local level have commenced the process of identifying a suitable methodology for addressing the needs of each area, as part of an implementation team. They are being assisted in this process by a national co-ordinator based in ADM Limited, who is looking after operational aspects of the project, and by four development and monitoring officers, one based in each of the target areas.</P>
    <P>Progress reports by the development and monitoring officers indicate a commitment from all agencies, at local level, to participate fully in the ISP.</P>
    <P>A number of task-specific sub-groups have also been established in each area to focus on specific priority issues. In addition, work is proceeding on the establishment of community consultative mechanisms in the four areas as a possible way of giving local people the opportunity to participate in a meaningful way in the process.</P>

The workshops are under the control of management committees drawn from different sectors of the community. The management committees employ the staff in CTW's and are responsible for the terms and conditions of their employment.</P>
      <P>The role of FÁS is to provide funding for the payment of staff wages, and for payment of allowances to trainees. In 1997, a review was undertaken of FÁS's funding of CTW's.

      <P>The job initiative <Col N="573" /> programme is a programme targeted at persons over 35 years of age who have been unemployed for five years. The programme is administered by FÁS. Under the programme FÁS provides a grant of £210 per week for each participant to job initiative managing agents. From this amount the managing agent is required by FÁS to set a rate for the job for a particular post that an employee will fill. The managing agent is obliged to allocate at least 2 per cent of funding to training or development for the employee, and the managing agent may allocate a maximum of 10 per cent of the grant to materials and administration costs.</P>
      <P>The rate of pay is determined by the managing agent in consultation with local trade unions and the local area partnership is asked to confirm the acceptability of the rate for the job.</P>
      <P>The managing agent may only top up wages for those on the job initiative from their own resources where such top up measures are necessary to establish a rate for the job which matches existing trade union rates within the managing agent's organisation.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government deeply regrets that there has been a resumption of the civil war in Angola and at the unacceptable impact which this is having on the civilian population. Conflict has resumed despite the support which had been given by Ireland and other members of the international community to the implementation of the Lusaka peace process under which some concrete progress had been made towards demobilisation, disarmament, demining, local power-sharing and parliamentary democracy. The Government and <Col N="575" /> other EU member states have voiced their concerns about the increase in human rights abuses and breaches of international humanitarian law in Angola at the recent fifty-fifth session of the UN Commission on Human Rights in Geneva.</P>
      <P>In its statement of 14 April, the UN Security Council has reiterated that the primary cause of the current crisis in Angola is the refusal by UNITA to comply with the basic provisions of the Lusaka protocol and has called on UNITA to comply with its obligations to demilitarise and to permit the extension of State administration to areas under its control. The council has also expressed its concern at the continued violation of its sanctions against UNITA which has been rearming. It has welcomed the mission to Angola by the chairman of the relevant UN sanctions committee which is to take place this month. The UN sanctions have been supported by the adoption of an EU common position and Council Regulations and by corresponding national legislation.</P>
      <P>The Angolan conflict also has disturbing regional implications given bilateral tensions with Zambia and the ongoing war in the neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo. It is hoped that the recent signing of a memorandum of understanding between Angola and Zambia, which was brokered by Swaziland, and recent EU démarches in Luanda and Lusaka will help to ease these tensions. Ongoing efforts to begin a peaceful dialogue in the Democratic Republic of Congo should, if successful, also help to lift some of the obstacles to a peaceful settlement within Angola.</P>
      <P>It is the firm view of the Government that there is no alternative to a political settlement of the Angolan conflict. We will therefore continue to call on both sides to return to negotiation, to desist from remining, to respect human rights and to co-operate fully with humanitarian organisations in the delivery of emergency assistance. We will also continue to support the provision of such assistance &ndash; last month a grant for Angola of £150,000 was made by the Government to the International Committee of the Red Cross. We will continue to support regional efforts and those of Mr. Issa Diallo, the special representative of the UN Secretary General, to ensure a continued UN presence in Angola and to bring about an early end to the conflict.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 44 to 46, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The Government is conscious of the need to ensure that the agricultural and wider economic development of developing countries is not undermined by EU export subsidies or through CAP policies in general. There have been significant improvements in the situation in recent years and we continue to strive to ensure that national and EU policies promote the economic advancement of developing countries.</P>
      <P>Ireland is working with other member states to ensure a greater coherence between our development and other policies within the European Union. A resolution on coherence was agreed at the Development Council in June 1997 and work is ongoing particularly in the areas of fisheries, migration, conflict prevention and food security. In the food security area, the resolution draws attention to the need to ensure that agricultural exports and food aid in kind do not damage the production and marketing capacity of developing countries.</P>
      <P>As a rule there is close co-ordination between my Department and other Departments including Agriculture and Food and Enterprise, Trade and Employment to ensure that the interests of least developed countries inform our perspective. Ireland views this procedure as essentially part of a wider strategy to protect the interests of the least developed countries in international fora. This informed our position in the discussions on the EU mandate for post-Lomé negotiations, where Ireland and its EU partners have agreed that least developed countries will receive access to EU markets for essentially all goods.</P>
      <P>We have in addition welcomed the EU Commission's proposal for the implementation of tariff and quota free access for products from least developed countries by the end of the forthcoming millennium round of world trade negotiations.</P>

      <Quest>when a person (details supplied) in County Mayo will receive the remainder of 1998 sheep headage and premia entitlements; and the amounts already paid out to him including cheque dates and number of animals in view of the fact he believes he has not been paid his full entitlements on 50 animals.</Quest>

      <P>Under the 1998 sheep schemes the person named applied on 45 breeding ewes and ten hogget ewes. He notified his local office in writing that he had disposed of five hogget ewes. Consequently the payments that issued to him under the ewe premium and sheep headage schemes were the subject of a 20 per cent reduction penalty. However, a review of his case established that he had disposed of five hogget ewes in order to meet his commitments under his REPS plan. Therefore, it was decided that since the reduction in sheep numbers was a requirement under his REPS plan any payments due to him under the sheep schemes should be limited to the number acceptable under his REPS plan (50 animals in this case). Under the 1998 sheep headage scheme including top-up his full entitlement in respect of 50 ewes was £555. Payments to date are as follows, £400 paid 19 November 1998, £44 paid 30 November 1998 and £171 paid 25 February 1999. This resulted in an overpayment of £60.</P>
      <P>Under the 1998 ewe premium scheme his full entitlement in respect of 50 ewes was £1,147.25. Payments to date are as follows, £431.31 paid under the first advance on 19 June 1998 and £213.08 paid under the second advance on 21 October 1998. Therefore, taking the overpayment into account the amount now due to the person in question is £442.86. Arrangements are being made to have £442.86 paid to him shortly.</P>

      <P>As a member of the World Trade Organisation, the EU is bound by the organisation's agreements and rules on trade, which include recognition of the importance of favourable treatment for developing countries. The EU grants preferential access to its markets for a wide range of agricultural products from developing countries mainly through its generalised scheme of preferences and the Lomé Convention.</P>
      <P>The EU Development Ministers adopted in June 1997 a resolution on the issue of coherence between the Community's development cooperation and its other policies. The areas covered by this resolution include food security. In the food security area, the resolution emphasises the need to ensure that agricultural exports and food aid in kind do not damage the production and marketing capacity of developing countries. The EU also operates a code of practice, adopted in 1997, in relation to food aid, which aims to avoid any harmful effects of food aid on local production and marketing structures.</P>

      <P>Section 476 of the 1997 Taxes Consolidation Act provides for tax relief from income tax, at the standard rate, for expenditure by individuals on certain training courses.

    <P>Plans are under way to develop a further 106 places nationally. Revenue funding for existing places is included in each health board's annual allocation and is not separately identified.</P>
    <P>A manager in a children's centre must have a recognised qualification and at least five years post-qualification experience. The recognised qualifications are; the National Diploma in Child Care awarded by the National Council for Educational Awards; the National Diploma in Applied Social Studies in Social Care, with appropriate practice placements, awarded by the National Council for Educational Awards; the Diploma in Child Care-Social Studies awarded by the Dublin Institute of Technology; the Diploma in Applied Social Studies &ndash; Social Care, with appropriate practice placements, awarded by the Dublin Institute of Technology or a qualification equivalent to one of the above.</P>
    <P>A house parent is also required to possess one of the aforementioned qualifications for entry to the grade. The current basic qualification for trainee and assistant house parents is the leaving certificate. An assistant house parent must acquire a recognised qualification in child care-social work in order to progress to the top of the salary scale. It is essential that holders of these qualifications, or equivalent qualifications, have completed appropriate practice placements as part of their course.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="585" /> The largest planned developments are at St. Ita's, Portrane and Ballydowd with 24 purpose built places being provided at each location. A special project team has prepared the plans based on expertise from the United Kingdom. The other places will be provided in either suitably adapted or purpose built premises.</P>
    <P>The Child Care (Standards in Children's Residential Centres) Regulations, 1996, apply to the current service. However it has been decided that special standards will be required for the operation of this specialist service. Such standards are now to be developed in consultation with the new social services inspectorate which will inspect this high support service.</P>
    <P>I am also proposing to establish a new joint Department of Health and Children and Education and Science body to ensure the effective planning and utilisation of the high support services provided under the aegis of both Departments.</P>

      <P>The report of the national task force on suicide which was published in February, 1998 put forward a national suicide prevention-reduction <Col N="586" /> strategy and identified the various authorities with jurisdiction in suicide prevention strategies and their respective responsibilities.</P>
      <P>Since the publication of the report, I have been in contact with my ministerial colleagues in the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Education and Science, and Environment and Local Government, with a view to implementing the task force recommendations in so far as these Departments are concerned. My Department has also contacted all the statutory agencies identified in the report with jurisdiction in suicide prevention strategies requesting that the necessary measures are put in place to ensure the implementation of the recommendations which relate to their respective areas.</P>
      <P>The establishment of a suicide research group by the chief executive officers of the health boards is central to the strategy to prevent and reduce suicide and attempted suicide. The group was established last year and has met on several occasions. Arising from the deliberations of the group so far, it is intended to appoint a research-co-ordinator with secretarial facilities and I have provided the necessary funds to allow this important work to proceed.</P>
      <P>The majority of health boards have appointed resource officers and have established multi-sectorial and multi-disciplinary working groups to examine the implementation of the recommendations of the report. They are engaged in a range of activities including, the promotion of positive mental health and the de-stigmatisation of suicide, provision of information in relation to suicide and parasuicide, liaison with the media and provision of training requirements for staff in relation to suicide and parasuicide. The process of consultation with statutory and voluntary groups on the issue of suicide has also commenced in many health board areas.</P>
      <P>The task force identified particular at-risk groups of suicide and recommended that steps be taken to make the mental health services more accessible to the public, particularly to our young people. Concern was also expressed at the risk of suicide in older people. I am committed to further develop child and adolescent psychiatric services and mental health services for older people during 1999 which will assist in the early identification of suicidal behaviour and provide the necessary support and treatment to individuals at risk.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may be assured that I am committed to implementing the national suicide prevention-reduction strategy recommended in the report of the national task force on suicide.</P>

      <P>I am very conscious of the importance of reducing waiting times in all specialties as much as possible. It is, of course, open to each consultant to review their waiting lists and to treat individual patients sooner, in light of changing clinical priorities.</P>
      <P>I have recently taken a range of significant initiatives to address the issue of waiting lists and waiting times for public in-patients. These include: the provision of £20 million for the treatment of patients on waiting lists. This represents an increase of two-thirds over the 1998 figure and is 2.5 times higher than the amount allocated by the previous Government for waiting lists in 1997; the provision of £9 million to services for older people. This will help to free up acute hospital beds, some of which are occupied at present by patients who cannot be accommodated in sub-acute or rehabilitation facilities; the provision of £2 million to selected accident and emergency services. This will again ensure that acute facilities are more easily available for elective work, including treatments for those on waiting lists; the issuing of a new policy circular and guidelines to all relevant agencies regarding the way in which the waiting list initiative should be operated in future.</P>
      <P>The policy circular and guidelines, issued by my Department on 7 January 1999 outline revised and updated procedures in relation to improving the liaison and communication arrangements between acute hospitals and general practitioners; ensuring a more effective management of waiting lists at acute hospital level through the appointment of an implementation group and a patient co-ordinator-bed manager in each hospital; improved management of out-patient waiting lists; and clarifying the criteria for inclusion on a public in-patient waiting list.</P>
      <P>The policy circular reiterates the targets of treating adults in target specialties within 12 months, and of treating children in target specialties within six months.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was in receipt of disability benefit from April 1997 as a result of a road traffic accident in which she sustained injuries to her neck and back. Her claim was disallowed from 10 September 1998 following an examination by a medical assessor of the Department who considered she was capable of work. She appealed this decision to the social welfare appeals office and was examined by another medical assessor who was also of the opinion that she was capable of work. An appeals officer, having examined the case, decided that an oral hearing of the appeal should take place before a decision is made and this is scheduled to take place on 19 May 1999.</P>
      <P>A certain level of delay is inevitable where cases go to appeal, particularly where an oral hearing is required and the necessary arrangements have to be made. An additional delay occurs where, as in cases of this kind, a second medical examination is required. The appeals process is quasi-judicial and the procedures which apply are designed to ensure that every case gets full and satisfactory consideration.</P>
      <P>There has been a significant increase in recent years in the number of appeals being put before the social welfare appeals office. Additional appeals officers were appointed to deal with the increase but there is still a backlog to be dealt with.</P>
      <P>This matter is being addressed and any necessary measures will be taken to minimise the delays in dealing with appeals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that regulations were introduced in November 1997 to provide for the tapered withdrawal of the qualified adult allowance for people claiming unemployment benefit, unemployment assistance, disability benefit, disability allowance, pre-retirement allowance, injury benefit and unemployability supplement.</P>
      <P>This represented the first step towards alleviating the poverty trap associated with the complete withdrawal of the qualified adult allowance once the earnings of the spouse or partner of the social welfare claimant exceeded £60 per week. Priority was given to those schemes where disincentives to employment are most prevalent.</P>
      <P>Under the revised arrangements, where the spouse or partner is earning between £60 and £90, a reduced rate qualified adult allowance continues to be payable. In the 1999 budget, provision has been made to extend the upper limit of the income range from £90 to £105 from October next, in order to further enhance the incentive for people to avail of employment opportunities. The question of extending these arrangements to cover other categories of welfare claimants, including pensioners, is a matter which will arise for consideration in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>The objective of the back to work allowance scheme is to give an incentive to long-term unemployed persons who, in the absence of the scheme, would not be in a position to take up a job.</P>
      <P>The scheme has a limited number of places and is targeted at people who need an additional incentive to return to the workforce. It is, therefore, a requirement of the scheme that an application must be made prior to taking up employment.</P>
      <P>The person concerned commenced employment on 27 July 1998. He applied for the allowance on 21 October 1998. Under the rules of the scheme his application was refused as the claim was late and that he was in a position to return to the workforce without the need for the financial incentive which the scheme provides. There were no circumstances in this case which would justify any revision of this decision.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 81 to 84, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>Civil legal aid and advice, in accordance with the provisions of the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995, is provided by the Legal Aid Board from a nationwide network of law centres to applicants who meet the qualifying criteria contained in the 1995 Act and in regulations made under the Act. While the Act provides for payment of a contribution by an applicant, which is calculated in accordance with the regulations, it also provides that the contribution can be dispensed with in certain circumstances.</P>
      <P>The board currently operates 30 full-time law centres around the country, with seven in Dublin, two in Cork and one in each of the remaining counties apart from counties Carlow, Roscommon and Leitrim. The law centres at Cork are located at South Mall and Pope's Quay and had a staff complement which included four solicitors and five solicitors respectively until July 1998 when each of the Cork law centres was allocated an additional solicitor post.</P>
      <P>The Legal Aid Board has operated a private practitioner scheme in the Dublin area for some years which provides a complimentary legal service to that which is already available from the law centres in certain family law matters. I understand that the board intends to extend the scheme on a nationwide basis in the coming months.</P>
      <P>In the course of 1996, 691 and 715 people were provided with legal services by the law centres at South Mall and Pope's Quay respectively. In 1997, the corresponding throughput of cases increased to 713 and 988. The corresponding figures for 1998 are not yet to hand. They are being collated in the context of the preparation of the 1998 annual report of the Legal Aid Board.</P>

      <P>An interdepartmental group was established in April 1998 under the chairmanship of my Department with a view to determine what modifications, if any, might be proposed to the disabled drivers and disabled passengers (tax concessions) scheme which is administered by the Revenue Commissioners. In addition to the representative from my Department who was appointed chairperson, the group is comprised of a representative from the Department of Finance, the Department of Health and Children and the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
      <P>While the interdepartmental group, which met on two occasions, did not request the public to make submissions, it will have regard to any submissions received in the matter. To date it has received two formal submissions and has available to it many items of correspondence concerning the operation of the scheme. Also, it will be meeting with representatives of a number of organisations that have indicated a wish to make an oral submission to the group. It is intended that the group will furnish its report for consideration by the Minister for Finance prior to the summer recess.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 86 and 88 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to Bord Fáilte, almost £20 million is expected to be available for overseas marketing in 1999, when all sources, including European Regional Development Fund and the overseas tourism marketing initiative, are taken into account. As I informed the Deputy on 1 December 1998, Parliamentary Question No. 61, the focus of our tourism promotional <Col N="593" /> activity is on developing a less peaked market, with higher yield and greater regional distribution of economic benefits. This involves a range of measures undertaken by Bord Fáilte in full partnership with the tourism trade in Ireland and, where relevant, overseas, which are designed to encourage both consumers and trade to consider Ireland as a year round destination, with a wide variety of top-class facilities and attractions throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Visitor numbers in 1999 are forecast by Bord Fáilte to grow by 7 per cent and, in the case of tourism revenue, a 9 per cent increase on the 1998 estimated outturn of £2.3 billion is expected.</P>

      <P>The latest tender procedure for the development of a national conference centre in Dublin, with EU assistance of up to £33 million ECU under the operational programme for tourism 1994-99, was organised by Bord Fáilte under the direction of the independent management board for product development, and advertised in 1997.</P>
      <P>The procedure was conducted under the terms of EU council directive 93/37/EEC and sought a proposal for the design, construction and operation of the centre. Bord Fáilte-led evaluation teams undertook detailed assessments of full tender submissions which were received from five consortia. The management board concluded that the tenders submitted were not such as to enable it to make a recommendation and the process then proceeded in April 1998 to the &lsquo;negotiated procedure' stage provided for in Article 7 of the EU directive. This was conducted by an independent team of technical experts, specially appointed for the purpose by Bord Fáilte. On consideration of their findings, and following a positive recommendation by the board of Bord Fáilte, the management board decided on the proposal submitted by Spencer Dock International Convention Centre Limited to develop the project at a site in Dublin docklands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the terms of the operational programme, decisions on grant applications in respect of amounts at or above 15 million ECU (productive investments) must be made with the agreement of the Government and the EU Commission on foot of a cost-benefit analysis conducted in accordance with community law. This cost-benefit analysis, which was favourable towards the project, was undertaken by independent consultants and, on 16 September 1998, the Government agreed to the making of <Col N="594" /> a submission to the EU Commission recommending formal approval for a 33 million ECU grant towards the cost of developing the project. A final decision by the Commission on this submission was delayed while it concluded its examination of a complaint lodged with it on the tender procedures used in the public procurement process. Its examination has now been completed, and I understand that the commissioners made a formal decision, at their meeting of 21 April, to close the complaint case. The Spencer Dock consortium has been advised of this development and has been requested to submit an up-to-date timetable for completion of the project.</P>
