      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies will be sad to have learned in recent days of the death of Joe Farrell, a former Member of this House. May he rest in peace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Joe had a distinguished political career during which he served in both Houses of the Oireachtas for 20 years. He first served as a Senator from 1961 to 1973 and during those 12 years he was a <Col N="2" /> member of the Seanad Committee on Procedure and Privileges. He was elected to the Dáil where he served until 1981 and held the distinguished honour of being the oldest Member of the 21st Dáil.</P>
    <P>Joe was a member of Louth County Council and Dundalk Urban District Council, on which he served as chairman for three terms. He also served as a member of the Louth county committee of agriculture, in which he displayed great interest, and the Eastern Regional Tourism Organisation. He served as chairman of the North Eastern Health Board on many occasions including 1991, the year of his retirement from the board. He gave long and distinguished service to many committees, boards and organisations and served as chairman of Dundalk Harbour Board from 1970 to 1973. He had particular interest and expertise in that area.</P>
    <P>Joe was regarded as a chairman of great ability, a fact which is highlighted by his election to many such positions throughout his career. He was considered to be astute and to possess an enormous capacity to assess a situation to ensure that justice and fair play prevailed. His great courtesy and personal qualities earned him respect from Members on all sides of the House. Long after his retirement, he continued to attend various <Col N="3" /> social and political functions. He particularly liked to attend functions where issues of parliamentary democracy were discussed in order to maintain the contacts he made during his career.</P>
    <P>Joe was born in Dundalk in July 1905 and educated at St. Malachy's school. On the Government's behalf I wish to offer our deepest condolences to his wife, Margaret, and his extended family. We thank them for his long life of service to our party and his enormous interest in its affairs, in all things political and in the affairs of his native county.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Having served in the House with the late Joe Farrell, I wish to express sympathy to the Fianna Fáil Party's organisation in County Louth for the loss it has suffered.</P>
      <P>Joe Farrell was a man of great personal courtesy and deep personal convictions. He had strong family connections in south Armagh and held deep feelings about partition and a number of the divisive issues that caused so much hurt in this country in the early part of the century. However, he did not allow his strong convictions to interfere with his personal relationships with those who held different beliefs.</P>
      <P>Joe displayed the qualities of courtesy and kindness in both his general demeanour and in his contributions in the House. As the Taoiseach stated, he carried those qualities into his work for the North Eastern Health Board which, in addition to Louth, covers Meath, Monaghan and Cavan. He served as chairman of the board at a comparatively advanced age which is a tribute to his great abilities. His wife, Margaret Taaffe, to whom I express my deep sympathy, hailed from Mornington, County Meath, and he also had family connections in my part of the country. He was a man of very deep political conviction and his loyalty to the Fianna Fáil Party was not ever in question. He was very closely associated, as the House will be aware, with the late Frank Aiken.</P>
      <P>It would probably be considered that there were few closer political relationships in the Oireachtas or in politics than that between the late Joe Farrell and the late Frank Aiken. They worked together throughout their political careers and Joe Farrell was to some degree perhaps in the shadow of Frank Aiken but he did not let that diminish his own self-esteem or beliefs. On behalf of the Fine Gael Party and the Members who served with Joe Farrell, I express my sympathy to Margaret and the family on the loss that they have suffered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I recall serving with the late Deputy Joe Farrell during his second term in the House, along with many other Members, including the Taoiseach, who were elected in 1977. As Deputy Bruton said, for many years he was the late Deputy Frank Aiken's right hand man in north Louth, as the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Ahern, will testify. Frank Aiken enjoyed the comfort of being able to live <Col N="4" /> in Sandyford, Dublin, for most of his adult political life and not be burdened with having to visit the Louth constituency because it was so well minded by Deputy Joe Farrell for such a long time.</P>
      <P>I know this because my mother is a Dundalk woman and he knew her and her extended family well. His connection with Frank Aiken led to contact and friendship with my father. My uncle, Séan Quinn, succeeded Frank Aiken as OC of the 4th Northern Division when he became Chief of Staff of the IRA. Following the end of the Civil War and the attempts to build the process which we have now successfully arrived at, there were many social occasions in Dundalk in which my father and Joe Farrell were involved which were related to the old IRA.</P>
      <P>It was against that background when I entered the House that Joe Farrell displayed courtesies, pleasantries and friendship to me while having diametrically opposed political views. As previous speakers said, he was a courteous gentleman. He arrived late to this House but gave a long and loyal service to his party, his senior constituency colleague, the county council and various other bodies. On behalf of the Labour Party, I extend my sympathy to his wife and family.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I too offer my condolences to Joe Farrell's wife, Margaret. As previous speakers said, his loss is immense to Louth and the Fianna Fáil Party. Deputy Quinn's remarks were absolutely correct. He looked after the constituency for Frank Aiken for many years to such an extent that Frank Aiken had to visit the constituency only once a month on a Sunday morning to attend two meetings, one in Cooley and one in Dundalk, a tradition that has continued to this day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Things have been going downhill ever since.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure whether I would get away with visiting the constituency once a month. From the day I entered politics 20 years ago, Joe Farrell was an incredible mentor and adviser to me and I will be forever grateful. Even up to his last few years, he regularly attended Fianna Fáil meetings in Louth. When meetings got hot, Joe Farrell was always one to cut the argument dead with a few words and he was always sensible, even though he was in his nineties. He died this day last week at the ripe old age of 94 and in these days of eternal cynicism towards people in public life he was an example <Col N="5" /> to all of us in that he dedicated his life to public service. I wish &lsquo;Baby' Margaret, as she is known, all the best for the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you for the opportunity, a Cheann Comhairle, to join with the Taoiseach, party leaders and my constituency colleague, Deputy Ahern, in this expression of sympathy to Joe Farrell's widow, Margaret, brother, sister and his extended family in County Louth and further afield. In many ways the remarks of previous speakers encapsulated Joe Farrell's life. He was blessed with longevity, which is indeed a feature of political life in Louth, and died at the age of 94. He was heavily involved in politics in County Louth as a member of various local authorities, including Dundalk UDC and Louth County Council, and for a long period he served as chairman of the North Eastern Health Board. He served in the Seanad before he entered the Dáil in 1973, as successor to Frank Aiken. Deputy Quinn's comment that he was a close political friend of Frank Aiken is true.</P>
      <P>Joe Farrell was very much involved in the formative years of the State and with the passage of time he became a very significant figure in County Louth. He will be a great loss to us at party level in the constituency because he had great organisational sense. As the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs said, monthly meetings on a Sunday morning are still a feature. Perhaps other aspects of the political culture have changed since the days of Frank Aiken and Joe Farrell but that is progression in the political arena.</P>

The rules for this are being laid down in Seattle in a round starting there this week but the House has not debated the issue or the Government's position on it. Does the Taoiseach agree the House should debate the world trade round and globalisation generally so people have a clear understanding of Ireland's position on it within the EU?</P>

      <P>Tomorrow I will lay before the Houses of the Oireachtas copies of the commencement orders for the British-Irish Agreement Act, 1999, and the British-Irish Agreement (Amendment) Act, 1999; the notifications exchanged between the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland confirming that each Government has completed the requirements under Article 4 of the British-Irish Agreement for entry into force of the Agreement and, by the exchange of notifications, bringing the Agreement into force; and the declaration by the Government under Article 29.7.3º of the Constitution that the State has become obliged to give effect to the amendment of the Constitution by substituting new texts for Articles 2 and 3 as approved by the people in a referendum on 22 May 1998.</P>
      <P>Everyone in the House and every person is entitled to feel a great sense of pride today in what we have been able to achieve together to bring about peace in Northern Ireland. The coming into force of the Good Friday Agreement, which was given such strong support 18 months ago by the people of Ireland, North and South, is a source of great satisfaction to us all. The peace process, which began more than ten years ago, is now reaching its climax. With the full political settlement now about to be implemented, we have the strongest possible basis for permanent peace in the country such as has never before been experienced in our history.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="10" /> The peace process, although it has been slowed down at times, has been enormously successful because it has the momentum of the people behind it. Yesterday the President in Office of the European Council, Prime Minister Lipponen of Finland, conveyed his congratulations in person. All Europe wants peace in Northern Ireland to succeed. President Clinton, whom I met at the OSCE conference in Istanbul two weeks ago, has expressed his delight with the progress that has now been made. Irish people around the world, knowing how difficult it has been to resolve the conflict and seeing the problems that other peace processes have had to confront, will share in our pride and satisfaction.</P>
    <P>The Government has been closely involved in every stage of the process. As Taoiseach, I pay tribute to my predecessors for their contribution to the development of the peace process, Deputies John Bruton and Albert Reynolds, and also Mr. Charles Haughey. I also thank the current Opposition leaders, including Deputy Quinn, for their steady, although not unquestioning, support. Throughout the recent review, I remained in close contact with party leaders as well as the British Government. Some of our senior officials, whom I thank warmly for their dedication, were constantly on hand in Stormont to assist the chairman and the parties, whenever required.</P>
    <P>Our great thanks go to former Senator George Mitchell, who over the past five years has given so much of his time to the Northern Ireland peace process. Without his role at so many different crucial stages it is doubtful that we could have reached where we are today. I thanked President Clinton very warmly for allowing us to avail of George Mitchell's services and for his own strong support and commitment shown by many interventions over the past seven years. Yesterday, I conveyed my thanks to the Finnish Prime Minister for the contribution of his predecessor Harri Holkerri. I also had the opportunity to thank, in Istanbul, the Prime Minister of Canada, Jean Chrétien for the equally important contribution of General de Chastelain. He still has a central role in overseeing the implementation of the decommissioning process, as set out in the Good Friday Agreement. Great credit belongs in the final review phase to the parties themselves, who resolved their differences in direct dialogue and negotiation with each other, with the help and support of Senator Mitchell and the two Governments. Some of the issues were very difficult ones for all sides but, at length, sufficient trust and confidence was established to enable them to agree on a basis on which to proceed, through a sequence of steps that did not do any violence to the spirit of their respective political commitments or of the Agreement which they had signed.</P>
    <P>Direct rule, described by at least one Secretary of State as quasi-colonial, will end tonight. For the first time in 25 years, as part of a set of institutions that reflect the totality of relationships, we have a democratically elected devolved Govern<Col N="11" /> ment in Northern Ireland. This time, however, it is on a fully inclusive basis, something that has not happened before. Not every party took part in all stages of negotiating the Good Friday Agreement, but all the eligible parties are present in the new Administration from the DUP through to Sinn Féin.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the new First Minister David Trimble, the new Deputy First Minister Séamus Mallon and all their colleagues on their appointment. We wish them the very best in their new responsibilities, and we look forward to working with the Ministers concerned in the North-South Ministerial Council.</P>
    <P>Everyone involved has had to take their courage in both hands. The First Minister, David Trimble, faced a difficult and unenviable party situation, but with great skill he has secured majority support for this huge step forward. John Hume, Séamus Mallon and their colleagues in the SDLP can claim that the Good Friday Agreement embodies, above all, their vision for more than 25 years. In embracing the peace process and in trying to bring fully into the democratic arena movements that operated at least in part outside it, they took enormous political and personal risks.</P>
    <P>John Hume recently received the Légion d'Honneur from the French Government, to add to the Nobel Prize for peace which he shared with David Trimble. It was in recognition of John Hume's unfailing democratic commitment, and those who strongly criticised or doubted him in the past should acknowledge his honourable contribution today.</P>
    <P>Though some Deputies may find it strange to hear me saying it, I am glad the DUP have taken up their positions in the Executive, and it was a very human sight to see the new DUP Ministers being congratulated by their families and friends. Far be it from me to suggest a theme for a sermon to the leader who visited me in Government Buildings as head of the Free Presbyterian Church in Ulster a few weeks ago, but when we listen at Christmas to the prophet who foresees that &ldquo;the wolf also shall dwell with the lamb&rdquo; and that &ldquo;they shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain&rdquo;, we will surely think of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>At this juncture, it is right for me to say that I understand and appreciate the distance that Sinn Féin and the Republican movement have been prepared to travel, the bridges they have crossed. All of the larger parties in this House emerged at one time or another from a revolutionary past. That is also in its own way true of those who follow in the tradition of Carson and Craig. Regardless of strong conflicting views and convictions about the struggles of the past, we must all look to the future. Here in this State we have successfully built on and sustained a constitutional Republican tradition for more than 70 years. A parallel task has already been engaging for some time past the Sinn Féin party that, along with the <Col N="12" /> SDLP, has its own distinctive and constructive contribution to make to that tradition.</P>
    <P>Great courage and vision has been shown by Sinn Féin and the republican movement as a whole, in embracing the Good Friday Agreement as the way forward and as the best alternative to conflict. Full and complete implementation of the Agreement is now under way. Devolution will be a reality tomorrow. Decommissioning has been acknowledged to be essential. It has been left to the last. Implementing this part of the Agreement cannot reasonably be interpreted by anyone as a verdict on the conflict of the last 30 years or as changing its outcome. As I have said, everyone will already have their own strongly held opinions on the Troubles that are unlikely to change. Decommissioning is a necessary contribution to the consolidation of peace and democracy and to the creation of trust. It will provide the conditions that will lead to a genuine all-round demilitarisation of Northern Ireland. It should also be clearly understood that just as decommissioning is a voluntary act so also is a willingness by any party to serve with others in Government. The work of General de Chastelain and the independent Commission remains central to resolving the whole problem satisfactorily. The de Chastelain Commission should now be allowed to get on with its work. That is why it was established, and that is what we should give it the space to do.</P>
    <P>If there are still sinister forces waiting tactically for the most propitious moment to try to destroy by their actions the working of the Good Friday Peace Agreement, let me issue a warning. This Government and this House, representing the Irish people, will not tolerate any paramilitary attack by dissident organisations. We are determined that they will, for all practical purposes, be dissolved and disarmed, if they will not do that voluntarily themselves. There is no vestige of an excuse today for any organisation that would call itself Republican to repudiate or deny the living democracy that now exists in Ireland both North and South.</P>

      <P>In the good atmosphere created by recent developments, we should not ignore the importance of continued implementation of other parts of the Agreement, especially those relating to justice, security and human rights matters, which remain the responsibility of the two Governments. I attach particular importance to the full implementation without delay of the Patten Report, which arbitrates fairly between widely differing conceptions about the future of policing. It is of vital importance to the future that young people from the Nationalist community be encouraged by changes that are also symbolically reflected to join in a new beginning to policing, so that the change is felt as soon as possible on the ground. The past services of the RUC have been properly recognised, but they, as the parties in the Assembly have had to do, need <Col N="13" /> to accept their part in the radical changes in governance required by the Good Friday Agreement.</P>
      <P>I also acknowledge the constructive role played by smaller parties, such as the Alliance Party, the Women's Coalition and the loyalists, who have been unswerving in their support for the Good Friday Agreement, and who have on many occasions been courageous in speaking the truth, when it was not always popular or safe for them to do so. On them now falls the role of being the guardians of an accountable democracy. I also look forward to the further development of social partnership in the North, under the auspices of the Civic Forum. I am confident that the loyalists will also contribute to the achievement of all the purposes of the Agreement, including decommissioning, and will not be found wanting.</P>
      <P>The Agreement brings into force both constitutional and institutional changes. Tomorrow, the new Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution take effect, while in Britain the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, has already been repealed. I emphasise that Articles 2 and 3 are not disappearing, but are being inserted, as approved by the people, in their new form, in place of the previous text.</P>
      <P>The new Articles 2 and 3 encapsulate our modern understanding of constitutional Republicanism. The last traces of irredentism are gone. The nation is defined in the most open, inclusive and pluralist manner possible, without coercion. Any North-South discrimination in obtaining passports will be abolished, under the new Nationality and Citizenship Bill. The whole tenor of the Articles will put a new emphasis on civic society, as one of the pillars underpinning the State, alongside the cultural nationalism expressed in Article 1 and at the end of Article 2 in relation to the Diaspora. Irish people and people of Irish descent living abroad have expressed appreciation of the recognition of their identity and affinity to this country afforded in the last sentence of Article 2.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new Article 3 draws on the work of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution of 1967, of which Seán Lemass, as well as the present Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, the Minister of State, Deputy Bobby Molloy, and Deputy Michael O'Kennedy were members. It also incorporates the insights of some of the finest legal brains that have served successive Governments. It is a statement of peaceful intent, of a desire to unite Ireland in harmony and friendship, only by democratic means and with consent. The principle of concurrent self-determination first contained in the Downing Street Declaration is clearly expressed, and there is a recognition of both jurisdictions on the island. The second sentence of Article 3 together with new Articles 29.7 and 29.8 empower the State to establish institutions with executive powers and functions shared between the two jurisdictions to exercise powers and functions in all or any part of Ireland, thus providing constitutional authorisation and underpinning for North-South bodies. I also look <Col N="14" /> forward to British media organisations reflecting the fact that there is no longer any political disagreement about the constitutional status of Northern Ireland, and that consequently each jurisdiction on this island should be accorded by them the name by which it is internationally recognised, Ireland and Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I have already stated that these Articles will now be irrevocable. They express the spirit of Ireland today and the conditionality of their implementation is now terminated. I could not envisage a situation, even where the functions of the Agreement had been interrupted for a considerable time, that the parties in this House or the people would wish to revert to the previous wording. The old Articles 2 and 3 were put in place as a form of protest against the legitimacy of partition, after all the safeguards of the 1920-1 settlement had been cast aside. They are being replaced, like the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, by a constructive and more explicitly democratic method of uniting the country should the conditions for this exist. All sides have had to take risks for peace. This is the risk that we are taking.</P>
    <P>The Anglo-Irish Agreement also lapses tomorrow. While many of its functions will be replaced by the new institutions, the establishment as part of the Good Friday Agreement of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference with a secretariat that relates to non-devolved matters ensures that no vacuum is created.</P>
    <P>The setting up of the North-South Ministerial Council and the implementation bodies is of particular importance to us. It is not only a reinstatement of an essential element missing from the implementation of the 1921 settlement, it is also the logical culmination of the initiative on North-South co-operation begun on our side by Seán Lemass and Jack Lynch. I have no doubt that on the basis of the functional policy areas agreed last December and last March much useful and practical work will be done of benefit to all. Its value will not just be symbolic but real. In the voluntary sector, North-South institutions such as professional, trade union, culture and sporting organisations as well as all the main churches, have for decades operated cross-Border, either on a provincial or all-island basis. Such institutions of course lead to closer and friendlier relations but they pose no threat because decisions on constitutional matters in the future remain entirely in the hands of the people, as set out in the Agreement and will be taken quite independently of the work of any North-South body.</P>
    <P>I also look forward to the establishment of the British-Irish Council. We appointed consuls in Cardiff and Edinburgh last year and we are already developing our bilateral relations with Scotland and Wales in a productive and beneficial way without prejudice to, and indeed enhancing, our relations with the United Kingdom as a whole.</P>
    <P>Many difficulties will inevitably arise in the future. There are also still some immediate diffi<Col N="15" /> cult hurdles to be overcome. I hope that a spirit of political co-operation will gradually gain the upper hand over the spirit of confrontation and that no one will be slow to carry out the actions that are necessary, if the work which we celebrate today is to endure.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputy Bruton, Deputy Quinn and other Opposition spokespeople who have been extremely constructive at Question Time during the last two and a half years and have been involved in this process for a long time. I thank the Tánaiste, my Cabinet colleagues and all my parliamentary colleagues. We have made a major step forward. There is more work to be done but we can truly say that in 24 hours history will be made. It will never be the same again. We are now in a more constructive and positive position, many people have participated in that and I thank everyone who did so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is right that the House should reflect on how long it has taken us to come to this day. On 1 February 1967, the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association was formed. That was the beginning of the struggle for a more just and peaceful order on this island. On 20 June 1968, Austin Currie made a protest against housing policy in Northern Ireland when a single woman was allocated a house because of her religious belief, despite the fact that there was a large number of Catholics with far greater need of housing who had not been allocated houses because of their religious beliefs. Austin Currie occupied a house in Caledon, County Tyrone, in protest against that housing policy. To those two peaceful acts of passive resistance we can trace the success we have achieved today. That campaign advanced when the first civil rights march took place, again on the proposition of Austin Currie, from Coalisland to Dungannon. That was followed by other peaceful civil rights marches seeking justice and an approach which recognised the identities of both communities in Northern Ireland. It is important that we recognise the work that was done by those who agitated peacefully for constitutional change. It is quite possible that all we have achieved today could have been achieved ten years earlier if the peaceful path had been followed by all concerned. That is my conviction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the light of the discussions of the last few weeks when the issue has been whether Gerry Adams of Sinn Féin or David Trimble of the Ulster Unionist Party would make the first move and when those two men have been rightly praised for the courage they have shown, it is important that we not forget the role played by the Social Democratic and Labour Party. If we are looking for a seminal document which 25 years ago encompassed, predicted and proposed the model which we now see brought to fruition we can find it in &ldquo;Towards a New Ireland&rdquo;, proposed by the SDLP on 20 September 1972. The work of the SDLP with the Government, with the government and political leaders in the United <Col N="16" /> States, with the British Government, with the Unionist community and with Sinn Féin has led us to the situation we are in today.</P>
    <P>We should also recognise the wisdom of the words spoken by the late Cardinal Conway when he asked in 1971, &ldquo;Who, in their sane senses, wants to bomb a million Protestants into a united Ireland?&rdquo;. Is it not a pity those words were not listened to then by more people? Thank God they are being listened to now and have been heard at last. After the grief and the loss of so many lives over such a long period, the words of Cardinal Conway are at last being answered. It is now the case that no attempt is being made to bomb anyone into anything anymore. That is a great day.</P>
    <P>Great thought is given to the role being played by Sinn Féin. It is of immense importance. Sinn Féin is constitutionalising republicanism. It is bringing republicanism in its physical force form painfully but inexorably into the normal stream of democratic politics. It is important to analyse where the political success of Sinn Féin commenced. Was it due simply to good constituency work? Was it due to the campaign of the IRA and the social control it was able to exercise on criminal activity in suburbs whose residents are of a republican persuasion? I say no to those questions. That is not the source of the growth of support for Sinn Féin. The source of the growth of Sinn Féin's electoral support can be traced back to the hunger strikes because the first occasion on which a Sinn Féin person stood for election in Northern Ireland was when Bobby Sands was elected in Fermanagh-South Tyrone. What does that teach us? It teaches us that it is through sacrifice of oneself by oneself that political progress is made. Sinn Féin's success can be traced back to the hunger strikes, which we in this House would have opposed and condemned, and which principally hurt the people who are mounting the campaign themselves. It was because of a willingness to suffer pain rather than to inflict it that Sinn Féin gained electoral support. The support for Bobby Sands from people in Northern Ireland who voted for him was a recognition that he had suffered. The lesson of Sinn Féin electoral support is not that the pursuit of power by violent means will be rewarded, quite the contrary; the lesson is, just as is the lesson of passive resistance shown by Austin Currie, that it is only by a willingness to suffer oneself that one will persuade others of the depth of one's convictions, not by inflicting suffering on others. That is the profound message of this peace process. It is only by a willingness to suffer oneself, to demonstrate one's convictions, not by inflicting pain on others, that one makes progress. I pay tribute to all those who have suffered and sacrificed so much and who have undergone so much pain so that we can celebrate this day today. There has been an enormous amount of pain. There are people, families of the victims of loyalist killings, who suffer pain today; there are people who were wounded by loyalists and by the IRA who are still in pain today and who understand the meaning of <Col N="17" /> chronic pain daily and nightly. Those people's pain is at last securing some recompense in the fact that as much as they suffer, their children and their children's children will, hopefully, enjoy a better life.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has praised many people in his speech. I acknowledge and appreciate that and I am sure all those who have been mentioned do likewise. I mention in particular the man who dealt over a longer period consistently with this problem than any other Member of this House, the former Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dick Spring. Deputy Spring's patience, skill, tact and commitment deserve to be remembered on this day. He was a very good Minister and never sought the limelight himself. He was always willing to allow the Taoiseach of the day to take the credit for his work, and that was sometimes the case, and his contribution deserves to be remembered on this occasion. For personal reasons I wish to recall the work of the late Hugh Coveney, who was one of those closely involved in the talks process, as a Minister who won the affection of people on all sides of the debate.</P>
    <P>We have before us work almost completed but work still in progress. The remaining issue that needs to be dealt with is the actual decommissioning of weapons. Decommissioning is part of the Good Friday Agreement. It is as much part of the Good Friday Agreement as the Executive or the North-South bodies. The Executive has been set up, the North-South bodies are being set up, decommissioning has not yet started. When the Irish people voted in the recent referendum they voted for decommissioning just as much as they voted for the North-South bodies or for the Executive. No party or movement should, particularly in the context of decommissioning, allow itself to get hung up on the issue of whether the steps it takes under the Good Friday Agreement are voluntary steps or steps taken under pressure. All steps taken under the Good Friday Agreement are essentially voluntary. No one was forced to sign the Good Friday Agreement. Equally all steps by all parties under the Good Friday Agreement are to some degree at least taken under pressure because each person taking a step knows that if he or his party does not play their part, others will not play theirs. All acts under the Good Friday Agreement, including decommissioning, are both voluntary and under pressure. An attempt should not be made to say that everybody else's steps should be taken under pressure and it is legitimate to look to the British Government to pressurise Unionists but that republicans should not take any steps under any pressure from anyone.</P>
    <P>Everyone is under pressure but at the end of the day everyone is a volunteer. That distinction should cease to be made because in politics no one is completely free of taking account of the needs of others. The essence of politics is about reconciling the needs of differing people. Everyone is under pressure in politics but everyone <Col N="18" /> who is in politics is a volunteer. The futile argument about whether decommissioning will be a voluntary act or an act taken under pressure should be cast aside; it has no meaning. It does not matter. Face does not matter at this stage. Enough people have died. Enough people have suffered. A good enough future beckons for everybody to forget about face, to get on with the job and finish the work.</P>
    <P>I conclude my remarks by paying tribute to the Taoiseach. The Taoiseach has shown tremendous skill and balance in dealing with this issue. He has shown a sensitivity to the Unionist community which may have been more difficult for a Leader of Fianna Fail to show than it might have been for a Leader of Fine Gael and for that I pay him tribute. I also think he has been able to keep the republican community and the Nationalist community in Northern Ireland moving forward as well and I pay tribute to him personally for that. It is a good day for the Taoiseach and he deserves to be pleased with what he has achieved. I know much remains to be done and that, perhaps, even in the next few months hard things will have to be said by the Taoiseach or by whoever holds his office but I have no doubt he will not flinch from saying them. We have come a long way and we still have a small distance to go. I have no doubt we will go the distance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been several false storms in Northern Ireland, several occasions since the Good Friday Agreement when hopes of a breakthrough were raised only to be dashed by last minute problems. However, 18 months on from the Good Friday Agreement, it does now seem that Northern Ireland stands poised to enter a new era that will see the creation of political structures that are capable of winning broad support among the people of Northern Ireland and making political violence a thing of the past.</P>
      <P>We are not totally out of the woods yet. There are still many problems and difficulties to be overcome. There are still unscrupulous groups, both loyalist and republican, who will leave no stone unturned in their efforts to undermine what has been achieved and to push Northern Ireland back over the precipice into sectarian violence and conflict.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are also democratic political parties in Northern Ireland who remain opposed to the Good Friday Agreement and to the structures that have now been agreed. It is clear that there is a significant body of Unionist opinion which is not happy with what has been agreed, and we should not lightly disregard views that are genuinely felt and which have been forged against the background of the terrible violence in Northern Ireland over the past 30 years. We must respect their right to hold and express these views but seek to convince them that they are wrong by ensuring that all of the institutions &ndash; those within Northern Ireland, the North-South bodies and the new East-West structures &ndash; act in a fair and <Col N="19" /> impartial manner and that they work to serve the interests of all of us who must share this island.</P>
    <P>Probably never before in this century have we seen in a single week so many developments of an historic nature. Who, even a few weeks ago, could have believed with certainty that we would see members of the Ulster Unionist Party, the DUP, the SDLP and Sinn Féin come together to form a power sharing Executive? Who would have believed that members of the republican movement, who fought so long to destroy the Northern Ireland state would take their place on the Executive, which is about to resume responsibility for so much of life in Northern Ireland subject to the overall authority of the Westminster Parliament? Who would have believed that we would have ever seen the day when Martin McGuinness would take a pledge of office that included a commitment &ldquo;to serve all of the people of Northern Ireland equally . to nonviolence and exclusively peaceful and democratic means.&rdquo;  The developments are not over. Tomorrow we will see the formal devolution of power by Westminster to the new Executive. In one of the potentially most significant developments, the Government will give effect in the House to the decision of the people in the referendum of May 1998 to drastically amend Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution. Within days we will see the first meeting of the North-South Bodies and within weeks the establishment of the Council of the Isles.</P>
    <P>The potential for radical transformation of the complicated political relationships within this island and between the two neighbouring islands is without precedent in our history. Already it is clear that there has been a dramatic transformation in both the Unionist and republican mindset. Without this change the progress that has already been made would not have been possible. The challenge now is for politicians in Northern Ireland to rise above sectional interests and to commit themselves to serving the interests of the entire community there.</P>
    <P>In fairness to all the political leaders in Northern Ireland who were involved in the negotiations that led to the Good Friday Agreement and who have worked tirelessly to overcome all the difficulties that were subsequently encountered, they have shown a capacity for change that many observers of the Northern Ireland scene thought we would never see. The deal now on offer differs from previous attempts to find a formula to implement the provisions of the Agreement in that it has been brokered by the parties themselves under the chair of George Mitchell, with minimal input from London and Dublin. Figuratively speaking, this is a deal between the Falls Road and the Shankill Road rather than between Dublin and London and because of that it has a better chance of succeeding.</P>
    <P>After 25 years of direct rule the people of Northern Ireland and their elected representatives have been handed back responsibility for <Col N="20" /> much of their own destiny. Trust is essential, but there must also be the potential for sanction if, following the establishment of an Executive, anyone defaults on their obligations. Republicans have been taken on their word on the issue of decommissioning and notwithstanding the difficult and emotive nature of this issue, there can be no backtracking from the commitment to decommissioning contained in the Good Friday Agreement. In this regard the Labour Party fully supports the position of the two Governments that they would have to step in and assume their responsibilities. This may include appropriate suspension arrangements if there is failure by any party to implement any significant part of the Agreement.</P>
    <P>On an occasion like this when so much has been achieved and when there is so much hope and optimism, one does not want to focus on potential negatives. However, it would be unwise to dismiss the decommissioning problem or believe that it will go away. All of the arguments on decommissioning have been well rehearsed and there is little value in going over them again. Its resolution is central to the building of full trust between the two communities and between their political representatives. A willingness to confront and deal with the decommissioning issue on the part of all the paramilitary organisations will be full and final evidence that those who previously resorted to violence and terror are themselves now fully committed to the democratic road and that there will be no going back.</P>
    <P>Last Saturday David Trimble achieved what many believed to be unachievable. He persuaded his party to share power in an Executive with Sinn Féin in advance of any decommissioning. It was a remarkable achievement and the opportunities it now opens must not be lost. It might have been preferable if he had not had to agree to reconvene the Ulster Unionist Council next February. It would also have been preferable if the IRA had commenced decommissioning as soon as the Good Friday Agreement had been concluded. However, these things did not happen and we must all work within the world of what is possible.</P>
    <P>There are grounds for optimism that progress will be made. The expected appointment by the IRA of an interlocutor will be a huge step forward. Thankfully Northern Ireland is now enjoying the most peaceful period it has experienced since 1968. The number of punishment attacks has dramatically declined and there has been close to six months without a politically motivated murder. Vigilance and care continue to be required. It is an imperfect peace but can anyone honestly look at the situation in any of the 30 years that preceded the Good Friday Agreement and say it was better then than it is now?</P>
    <P>While the focus of attention has primarily been on the changes taking place in Northern Ireland, we should not ignore the fact that change is taking place in this jurisdiction also and that more change will be required. In agreeing to the <Col N="21" /> creation of North-South bodies with real power the Oireachtas and the people of this State have also agreed to cede a degree of sovereignty. Some issues that would previously have been decided exclusively by the Oireachtas will now be decided by North-South bodies which will include among their membership, and among those making decisions, members of the Ulster Unionist Party and the DUP.</P>
    <P>Perhaps in both symbolic and legal terms, as has already been referred to by the Taoiseach, the most dramatic change by far will be the amendments to Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution, which will come into effect tomorrow following the making by the Government of the appropriate order. I strongly believe that the changes to Articles 2 and 3 will be good, not just for the situation in Northern Ireland, but for the political culture of this State. Articles 2 and 3 have provoked strong feeling, for and against, but in recent years they have caused offence to Unionists in Northern Ireland, who saw them as providing some veneer of legitimacy to the activities of the Provisional IRA. They were also regarded by many democrats in this State as being totally inappropriate to the Constitution of a modern democratic state.</P>
    <P>Many democratic nationalists in Northern Ireland, who found themselves discriminated against and excluded from Government over a long period, regarded Articles 2 and 3 as an important statement of their Irishness and an important link with this State. Now that the situation has changed so dramatically in Northern Ireland, and when new relationships are being developed within Northern Ireland and within this island, they can be changed with the minimum of controversy.</P>
    <P>Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution were a product of their time. They were key elements of a Constitution that was drafted and put to the people more than 60 years ago, within 15 years of the end of the bitter and bloody civil war and when the memory of what many people regarded as the betrayal by the Boundary Commission was still fresh in the mind. It was also the decade of the economic war, when Britain still occupied a number of Irish ports and it was a time when most people believed that partition would be a temporary phenomenon which would not last for more than a few decades at most.</P>
    <P>Those who drafted the Articles in good faith could not have foreseen the way in which partition would endure or events would evolve. Nevertheless, it is a valid criticism of our society that we did not move earlier in the period of the violence over the past 30 year to change them. There were those who ploughed a lonely furrow in trying to convince the public that change was required. My late colleague, Jim Kemmy, springs to mind, as does Mary Robinson. Gradually there was a consensus towards change. Nine years ago this month, the Dáil debated a Private Members' Bill, tabled by Deputy De Rossa, proposing a new form of wording for the two Articles. The Bill <Col N="22" /> was supported by Fine Gael and the Labour Party but was voted down by the parties that make up this Government, Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats.</P>
    <P>We have moved on to a situation where the proposal to amend Articles 2 and 3, as part of the Good Friday Agreement, could be passed without opposition in the Dáil and subsequently endorsed by more than 90 per cent of those who voted in the referendum. This was a clear statement of a desire on the part of the people of this State for a new relationship with the people of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Many people in this country retain an aspiration to a united Ireland &ndash; as recently as last weekend, the Taoiseach restated his own wish to see a united Ireland &ndash; and it is their right to do so, but the more progress we make in implementing the Good Friday Agreement, the more we move towards closer integration within the EU, the less relevant the Border and the traditional aspiration to a territorially united Ireland become. For me, the prospect of the people of this island living and working together in peace and harmony is far more important than the existence of any border. For me, a permanent, lasting peace in Northern Ireland is a far greater priority than the creation of a unitary state on the island.</P>
    <P>There are other obligations under the Good Friday Agreement with which the Government has been tardy in dealing. For instance, under the Agreement both Governments were required to establish an independent human rights commission. The British Government acted promptly; the legislation was enacted by Westminster prior to last Christmas and a chief executive was appointed in March of this year, but it took the Government more than a year and prolonged prompting from the Labour Party to produce the legislation, and debate on the Second Stage of the Bill commenced only last week. It is not clear yet when it will be law. Because of the delay in this jurisdiction, it has not been possible to establish the joint committee of representatives of the two human rights commissions, North and South, as a forum for consideration of human rights issues on this island, which was provided for in the Agreement.</P>
    <P>As a result of the Agreement, a nationality and citizenship Bill is required. It, too, was promised prior to the summer recess. We are still waiting for it, but earlier today it was promised that it would be published before Christmas.</P>
    <P>Under the Agreement the Government is committed to taking &ldquo;further active steps to demonstrate its respect for the different traditions on the island of Ireland&rdquo;. What has been done to honour this commitment? There was a similar commitment in the Downing Street Declaration which led to the establishment of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation. The forum fulfilled a useful function, but its work was brought to a premature end by the termination of the original IRA ceasefire in February 1996. Much of the work started was not completed. For instance, a specific sub-<Col N="23" /> committee of the forum was examining obstacles to reconciliation in the South. It had prepared a draft report which, while not completed, would still provide a valuable contribution to the debate about the future direction of our society. It should be finalised and published. We have always been quick to demand change in Northern Ireland but slower to confront the need for change in our own society. If we are to build a genuinely new political relationship on this island, that change is also required in the Republic.</P>
    <P>There have been many dark days in Northern Ireland over the past three decades &ndash; Bloody Sunday, Bloody Friday, La Mons, the Droppin' Well, Enniskillen, Greysteel and Louginisland. We, too, have experienced terrible incidents, most notably the Dublin and Monaghan bombings in 1974. The people of Britain suffered terribly too. Scores died in Birmingham and elsewhere. We can all now dare to hope for a better future. As I said at the outset, there are still many dangers but there are also many precedents from which we can draw comfort. There are many cases in the history of Ireland and elsewhere of people rejecting violence and taking the democratic road. There are many precedents for sworn political enemies putting aside enmity and working together. It was, I think, the murdered Israeli Prime Minister, Yitzhak Rabin, who said the real challenge is not making peace with your friends but making peace with your enemies.</P>
    <P>This State was conceived in a violent war of independence and delivered in a bitter and bloody civil war. At the end of that civil war in 1923, the prospects for the peaceful development of this island must have looked grim, given that each side in that conflict had sought to outdo the other in cruelty. Yet we largely overcame that legacy of bitterness, the most crucial development perhaps being in 1932, when the Cumann na nGaedhael Government, in accordance with the democratic wishes of the electorate, handed over power to those who just a decade earlier had waged a vicious war against them. I have no doubt the people and the politicians of Northern Ireland can put conflict and bitterness behind them also.</P>
    <P>I want to join the Leader of the Fine Gael Party in paying a particular tribute to the Taoiseach for the work he has carried out over the past two and half years. This is a great day for all of us but, in particular, it must be a wonderful day for the Taoiseach and he is entitled to take due pride in the contribution he has made.</P>
    <P>I also wish to place on record the appreciation of the Labour Party for the enormous commitment shown by Senator George Mitchell in the search for peace. On many occasions during the negotiations leading up to the Good Friday Agreement and in the tortuous days of the review process, he must have been tempted to walk away and say &ldquo;a plague on all your houses&rdquo;. Few would have criticised him had he done so but he stayed <Col N="24" /> with it, showing endless tact, diplomacy, skill and tenacity.</P>
    <P>Joining with Deputy Bruton, I particularly pay tribute to the major role played by my predecessor, Deputy Spring, during his 15 years as Leader of the Labour Party and his two terms as Tánaiste. His vision, leadership, and absolute commitment to democratic principles were crucial, especially in the period leading up to the Downing Street Declaration and the IRA ceasefire.</P>
    <P>The political leaders in Northern Ireland have grown in stature through the process. The First Minister, Mr. Trimble, whose election as leader of the Ulster Unionist Party was greeted with widespread apprehension, has shown himself to be a leader of great vision, courage and commitment. Mr. Adams and Mr. McGuinness have surprised many with their skill and commitment and their ability to move the Republican movement along the democratic road. They are formidable, thoughtful leaders, who have the capacity to change and much to offer. The smaller parties, the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland, the PUP, the UDP and the Women's Coalition, have all played their part.</P>
    <P>It would be remiss not to recognise the architects of this success. While the SDLP may not have received the same public attention or publicity as some other parties in Northern Ireland in recent months, it remains very much a key player, the voice of the majority of nationalists and a party without whom the current process could not have been brought to this level. Without the courage and vision of Mr. Hume, Northern Ireland might still be snared in what at times seemed like the never-ending cycle of death and destruction. We all owe a debt of considerable gratitude to politicians like those in the SDLP who in the darkest days of the past 30 years, when Northern Ireland threatened to be overwhelmed by sectarianism and laid waste by terrorism and violence, stood firmly and fearlessly behind democratic standards and values which they espouse and which have been a beacon to us all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult for people living through particular events to assess how those happenings will come to be judged by history, but there can be little doubt that coming to the end of the millennium there is now real hope that the people of this island &ndash; indeed, these islands &ndash; can put behind them some of the most difficult problems which have bedevilled them, in one form or another, for hundreds of years. This is the result of the enormous effort on the part of many people who have worked relentlessly in a process which has been fraught with difficulty, which called for many sacrifices, and which involved for all of us a willingness to let go of mindsets which could have condemned future generations on this island to live in the shadow of violence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While it would be foolish to pretend that all <Col N="25" /> the difficulties with this process are over, the fact that we all have come so far proves that with continued effort and determination the prize of lasting peace on this island, where people are treated equally and with respect, whatever their political traditions and allegiances, is in our grasp.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that in the past ten years or so we have seen enormous changes taking place in the world. The Cold War has ended, and perhaps the most potent symbol of that was the demolition of the wall that divided the people of Berlin. While we, on this island, cannot point to anything as graphic, what is happening on this island is no less dramatic for that because the people, both North and South, by their democratic will in accepting the Good Friday Agreement, have put in place arrangements that will allow us &ndash; while still cherishing our profound political beliefs &ndash; to make a new beginning in how we organise our affairs.</P>
    <P>I can well understand how some people remain profoundly uneasy about the developments which are taking place. It is the case that too long a suffering can make a stone of the heart, and which of us could criticise those who have been subject to the most appalling suffering for being resentful at some of what is now taking place? Both I and my predecessors as Ministers for Justice have been called upon to take decisions which go against the traditional grain.</P>
    <P>When I introduced to the House, in light of the Good Friday Agreement, the Release of Prisoners Bill, I made the point that I fully understood the reservations people had about that measure. This was equally the case when legislation establishing the Commission for the Location of Victims' Remains was debated. However, both measures were necessary as part of the process of achieving peace on this island. While people cannot be expected to forget the terrible wrongs that have been done, our aim has been to ensure that type of suffering can be put behind us at last.</P>
    <P>It is only right to pay particular tribute to the work done by my immediate predecessors, Deputy Owen and Máire Geoghegan-Quinn &ndash; often, by necessity, privately and unacknowledged &ndash; as part of the peace process. Similarly, I would like to pay tribute to the work of the officials of my Department who have had a central role to play in this regard. It is only right to acknowledge also the role of all my predecessors as Ministers for Justice over the past 30 years or so, who were called upon to take difficult and vital decisions to protect the security and integrity of the State.</P>
    <P>This afternoon I am travelling to Belfast with my colleague the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, for a shadow meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council. This is just one of a number of bodies that has the potential to transform the way we go about our business on this island and, indeed, with neighbouring jurisdictions. The operation of these bodies will reinforce the fact that, irrespective of the political <Col N="26" /> traditions of the people of this island, we have far more in common than divides us. The measure of the success of these institutions will be the improvements which they can bring about in the quality of life for all the people of the island.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware that, as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I have responsibility for measures relating to decommissioning. I do not propose to dwell at length on all the issues which surround decommissioning. The arguments have been rehearsed all too often. The position, however, is perfectly straightforward. The procedures are in place in our law for decommissioning to be achieved. Decommissioning falls to be dealt with by the decommissioning body, under General John de Chastelain, and we should give him the time and space to get on with his work.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier that not everyone is happy with present developments and this is the case with people who come from either end of the political spectrum. That is as it should be in democratic societies. I want simply to say this to the small number of people who might be tempted to use violence to thwart the will of the vast majority of the people of this island: the full resources of the State will be used against them and they will not succeed.</P>

      <P>The people of this island have invested far too much in this new beginning to be deflected by those who have no regard for human rights or human life. I want to take this opportunity to pay particular tribute to the role being played by the Garda Síochána. While there is no room for complacency, the House will be aware of recent successes by the Garda Síochána in this regard. In a literal sense, the Garda Síochána are the guardians of the peace. This is in line with their long and proud tradition which, unfortunately, has seen a number of gardaí having to make the ultimate sacrifice in protecting the community.</P>
      <P>After the events of the past few years, there is a realisation that it is not just in Yeats's poem &ldquo;The Lake Isle of lnnisfree&rdquo; that &ldquo;peace comes dropping slow&rdquo;. It is a prize worth the effort, however, and I believe that all Members of the House will regard it as the finest legacy we have been able to help bestow on future generations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to join with the comments of previous speakers in offering a word of appreciation to the Taoiseach and his Ministers for their contribution to the historic and momentous events of this week. The Mitchell review of the Good Friday Agreement has produced the result the vast majority of the people on this island have been awaiting since the Agreement was signed in April 1998. The huge leap of faith taken by Mr. David Trimble and the Ulster Unionist Party last Saturday has, more than any<Col N="27" /> thing else, resulted in the historic political advance of the last few days.</P>
      <P>Over the past few months media buzz words, such as &ldquo;jumping together&rdquo;, &ldquo;choreography&rdquo; and &ldquo;mood music&rdquo;, were seen as essential components of progress in the Assembly and the formation of the Executive. However, the Ulster Unionist Party succeeded, which is a clear demonstration that it can place trust in the process. Others must now vindicate that trust, with particular reference to the republican movement and the question of decommissioning.</P>
      <P>The fact that Mr. Trimble kept the decommissioning issue on the agenda throughout the past few difficult weeks was, in essence, the provision of a great service to all constitutional democrats. After all, it would be totally unthinkable in our Republic for a party so inextricably linked with a terrorist organisation, to gain participation in a coalition Government. I welcome, however, the imminent appointment of an IRA liaison officer to the Independent Commission on Decommissioning and I hope the Ulster Freedom Fighters will rethink its reservations about a similar appointment. The policy of the UDA, to wait until republicans make the first move, cannot be maintained. Senator Mitchell is right to demand that all paramilitary organisations should appoint their representatives to the decommissioning body on the same day as devolution is agreed. This day has now come.</P>
      <P>While much of the debate on decommissioning has been conducted north of the Border, the important question of decommissioning terrorist weapons in the Republic must be dealt with. Recently, we have heard here, in Stormont and elsewhere that decommissioning is a voluntary act. It may be so, but a strict obligation on the matter of decommissioning is contained in the Good Friday Agreement. The decline in violent paramilitary style beatings in Northern Ireland over the weeks that coincided with the presence of Senator George Mitchell is proof that those responsible can turn violence on and off like a tap. Recent surveys in republican areas show clearly that there is widespread opposition to these paramilitary style attacks which must be stopped immediately. Such beatings have no place in Irish politics.</P>
      <P>The setting in place of the North/South bodies tomorrow will herald a new chapter in the relationship between people and politicians North and South. The huge gamble taken by the Ulster Unionist Party will definitely pay off as a level of trust between the parties develops in an atmosphere of constructive political debate. This trust will render the issue of decommissioning all the less painful for republicans and loyalists alike.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As we can see, the pieces of the jigsaw are now coming together, including the prisoner release issue, the Patten report on the RUC, the Human Rights Commission, economic regeneration and Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution. Great credit is due to the Taoiseach and all political leaders <Col N="28" /> on both sides of the water who have shown marvellous courage in the face of adversity. While politics and politicians will continue to play a central role in the building of a peaceful future for all the people of this island, it will require a determined effort by individuals and organisations North and South. We in the Republic have a particular responsibility in this regard. Despite some horrific incidents, by and large, we have been spared much of the violence and suffering of the last 30 years. In contrast, Northern Ireland society has been deeply wounded by the long campaign of violence, intimidation, murder and mayhem.</P>
    <P>There is an urgent need for people in the Republic to contribute to the healing process which is now required throughout the whole island. In so doing we are also serving our own long-term interests. People in the Republic must now reach out to both communities in Northern Ireland with a new spirit of generosity. At the most basic level we should be prepared to make a significant annual contribution to supporting victims of violence, many of whom will carry physical and emotional scars for the rest of their lives. We should think in terms of the development of a peace park, perhaps in a cross-Border location. We should think in terms of a physical memorial to the victims of violence. However, at the most basic level, we should commit ourselves to the provision of £10 million per year for the next few years to victim support organisations in Northern Ireland. Local authorities, chambers of commerce, business organisations and sports clubs in the South should actively seek out and develop cross-Border partnerships straight away.</P>
    <P>The Department of Education and Science should provide ongoing funding for North-South inter-school activities. An additional post of responsibility could be established in each second level school to further such an initiative. We also need an active North-South staff and student exchange programme among third level colleges and universities in both jurisdictions.</P>
    <P>Networks on this island in the areas of transport, telecommunications, energy and media need a radical overhaul to encourage ease of access, more competition and a more consumer friendly environment which will benefit all the people on the island.</P>
    <P>Over the past 30 years, violence was a huge inhibiting factor which encouraged an attitude of withdrawal and disengagement by people in the Republic. As the political institutions in Northern Ireland begin to work and a peaceful society becomes firmly established, this attitude should change. The year 2000 should mark a new start. Every citizen and organisation in the Republic should take an initiative during the coming year towards reaching out to people in Northern Ireland. At a minimum, every adult in this jurisdiction should make a conscious decision to visit Northern Ireland, if only for a day trip.</P>
    <P>In the years ahead, if we work together, North and South, we can have the kind of Ireland which <Col N="29" /> John Hume talks about, an Ireland free from political violence for the first time in its history. That Ireland is one to which we can all aspire and make a solid contribution.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to contribute to these statements and I welcome the historic events of this week. That much overused word is most appropriate on this occasion. In the euphoria of the Good Friday Agreement, words were written and ideals were espoused, yet it is hard to take in the reality of naming Ministers and the devolution of powers tomorrow.</P>
      <P>I compliment those who brought this day to pass &ndash; the Taoiseach, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and their officials, Prime Minister Blair, Mo Mowlam, Peter Mandelson and their officials, President Clinton, and that most patient of all men, George Mitchell, alongside John Hume, David Trimble, Gerry Adams, the members of the SDLP, Sinn Féin and UUP and the positive influence of the many smaller parties, such as the Women's Coalition. Without the leaps of faith on all sides in the talks, a solution would not have been reached. While the challenge ahead is great, I wish the new Ministers and chairs on all sides every success in their ministries.</P>
      <P>As someone who was born in 1968 in Derry, lived in Donegal, studied for seven years in Belfast and had a brief spell teaching in Coleraine and Derry, I have always been on the fringes of what has been termed the &ldquo;Troubles&rdquo;. For as long as I remember, there were searches on entering shops and crossing the Border, a constant feeling that something was about to happen. It is only in the past four years or so that what I considered &ldquo;normal&rdquo; was altered, thankfully, to a real sense of normality. With the beginning of a peace process, the searches decreased and the Border presence reduced to a point, particularly in my immediate region, where one truly has the sense of an easing of tension and foreboding and the breaking through of a sense of ordinariness. What the people of our island want most is an ordinary existence &ndash; nothing extraordinary &ndash; as the new, much talked about, millennium approaches. They just want a sense of being able to go about their day-to-day business in a safe, positive and progressive environment, free from threats.</P>
      <P>I do not speak as an expert on life in Derry, Belfast or any other town or village and I do not pretend that everything in these areas is satisfactory. Serious and important issues remain to be resolved and a true sense of safety and security &ndash; that sense of ordinariness &ndash; is still as far away. That challenge still remains and the legacy of many past actions will take time to heal so people can move on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="30" /> I speak as someone who has been involved in cross-Border co-operation and who, while living in the most northerly region and hearing so much about the east, south and west, still awaits some recognition for the North. We have found over the many years of working together as local public representatives from various political backgrounds &ndash; whether Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Unionist, Nationalist, republican or independent &ndash; that we have more in common than that which divides us, although I worry about the solution to the evolving punt-pound-euro situation.</P>
    <P>We have a geographical regional disparity that crosses the fields of, for example, employment and infrastructure. We have a common difficulty with waste management and attracting tourists that could be resolved by joint projects and joint marketing. We have common issues within agriculture that could be assisted by combining our voice in Europe. We have a potential that could be realised with the implementation of the all-Ireland bodies that we in the north-west have awaited for years. I trust we will have implementation bodies located in Donegal. Together we have a future, which can only be the brighter for the fact that local elected representatives will have a direct say in how their area is developed. True regional support should be given and Ministers or Assembly members will be truly accountable to their immediate electorate.</P>
    <P>This is a very exciting time. I look forward to the co-operation that will deliver the development of the infrastructure from Dublin to Derry &ndash; the A5/N2 road, the Dublin-Derry train service and the Dublin-Derry air link. I look forward to the continued development, at local authority level, of the regional co-operation that already exists, and will soon be seen in the provision of a car ferry service from Magilligan to Greencastle. I also trust that co-operation will be furthered by a local knowledge of the value of the projects that we intend to pursue.</P>
    <P>There is much for all to gain and little to lose from co-operation on an island the size of Ireland. I wish every success to those involved in what is one of the most exciting challenges that a person is liable to face in any lifetime. Go n'eirí an bóthar libh.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to make a contribution to this very important debate. I congratulate the Taoiseach and Government on negotiating the Good Friday Agreement and making possible its implementation. The establishment of a devolved, all-inclusive government in Northern Ireland is truly historic. All the people of Ireland, regardless of where they live, their religious beliefs or their political orientation, can say it is great to witness these historic changes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many doubted that such progress could come. The people of Northern Ireland and their political representatives realised, as the end of this millennium approached, that whatever might have divided them in the past was nothing in comparison to what would unite them in the future, that <Col N="31" /> is, the prospect of a shared peace and prosperity in which no one need live in fear.</P>
    <P>No one is under any illusions that it will be easy, but then government never is. It is about taking decisions that are tough because they impact on the lives of thousands of people. The Good Friday Agreement was made possible by people of vision, political leaders, and people who could see further than the rest of us. The establishment of devolved government is not to be downplayed. However, of almost equal significance is the creation of the various cross-Border bodies to address areas of common interest and importance for all who live on this island.</P>
    <P>The amendments to Articles 2 and 3 of our Constitution, which come in the wake of devolved government in Northern Ireland, will bring the day of reunification of the two parts of our land closer than ever. Before this, we could only dream of unity. It was, for all intents and purposes, unrealisable as a result of generations of hostility and mistrust. In 1922, when Ireland was divided, the shock felt by people on both sides of the new Border was immense. The end of streets, bridges and hedgerows, were turned into a frontier. Sometimes these were guarded by checkpoints, at other times they were closed completely. The permanence of this Border etched itself on the minds of generations. Friends were no longer able to meet and exchange views or seek advice. They grew apart and, worse still, became strangers as time went on, failing to recognise that, whatever their differences, they also had many matters in common.</P>
    <P>Areas on either side of the Border, such as my county of Cavan and County Fermanagh, share many similar problems. However, it is only now that people will be able to talk to one another and work together. Common approaches to common problems signify real unity. The advent of devolved Government comes in the middle of winter when everything seems dormant. However, it also comes in the last month of the millennium &ndash; a millennium often marred by war and violence. The people of Ireland, North and South, can look forward with hope and confidence to the new millennium as never before as, without doubt, it has the potential of being the dawn of a new era.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>The House rejoices in the historic events of the past week and those to come in the next few days. However, one would hardly realise the historic nature of the occasion given the sparsity of Members, when there are only two people in the Public Gallery and no one in the Press Gallery. We can predict with confidence that tomorrow's newspaper headlines will be about the budget and not about this historic event. In a way that is appropriate and fitting. I look forward to the day when the Northern Assembly will not debate the divisive historic and constitutional issues but will concentrate, as this House will do later today, on the bread and butter issues which <Col N="32" /> are the concern of all people, North and South, and of both traditions in the North. I join with others, particularly with Deputy John Bruton, in paying tribute to the Taoiseach and his Ministers for the commitment, tenacity and skill they have shown. I would not allow anyone to take anything from them in this regard.</P>
      <P>I have waited a long time for this day and I never doubted it would come. I wish to quote from the official report of the Northern Ireland Assembly on 28 May 1974. Within the last few minutes of the existence of that Assembly and the power sharing Executive, in which I was Minister for Housing, Local Government and Planning, I stated:</P>
      <P>Irrespective of what happens and how this community may go in the future, somebody at the end of the day is going to have to come in and pick up the pieces, no matter how shattered those pieces are. When he does that someone will remember &ndash; and I should like to think a lot of people will remember &ndash; and say there was an idea about once; the idea was partnership in the North between Catholic and Protestant and partnership in this island between Irishmen.</P>
      <P>I did not think it was going to take 25 and a half years but I rejoice that it has happened. Above all else on this occasion, we should remember the victims &ndash; the dead of the past 30 years, the maimed, the grieving relatives, and the disappeared and their relatives who still do not have a focus for their grieving.</P>
      <P>I was a member of the last power sharing Executive which was brought to an end by the Ulster Workers Council strike. However, the UWC did not bring it down on its own. It was also brought down by a weak and vacillating Labour Government without sufficient commitment and an escalation of the IRA's campaign. Brian Faulkner tried to sell the Sunningdale Agreement as something which would bring peace, but the response was an escalation of the IRA's campaign in places like Bangor and Larne which had never experienced bombs before.</P>
      <P>The Executive also failed because its time had not yet come. We were told it was the Council of Ireland which brought it down but for many it was the idea of Catholics in Government. Unfortunately there are still some who do not want a Taig about the place but, I am glad to say, they number far fewer than they did 25 years ago. I am confident that this power sharing Executive involving partnership arrangements in the North, and between North and South, will last. I have long believed that the involvement of all traditions in Government in the North and tackling the political, social, economic and cultural problems would bring about reconciliation which is the only lasting solution to the problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Major problems will arise not too far down the road, but they can be successfully tackled. These include decommissioning, acceptable policing, Orange Order marches and the DUP taking the <Col N="33" /> role of Opposition within Government. Growing confidence and trust in each other will create the conditions whereby the larger problems can be tackled. For example, the DUP will come to terms with the new arrangements. To a large extent there has traditionally been similarities between the DUP and militant republicans, including, on occasions, support for violence. The DUP, and Dr. Paisley in particular, have been anti the Protestant and Unionist establishment in the North and have felt treated as second class Protestants. They too now come in from the political cold. People such as Peter Robinson and Nigel Dodds have never been content to see their political futures on the bankbenches at Westminster or Stormont. They too are now tasting power and will never willingly return to the backbenches.</P>
    <P>A tremendous responsibility now rests on this House and on this and future Governments. In the past we have been able to blame the British and intransigent unionism for lack of progress on a whole range of political, economic and social matters. For generations we have looked forward to the day when changes in the North, and between North and South, would give us the opportunity to overcome those problems. That day has arrived and the challenge of past commitments, promises and half promises stare us in the face. Prescribed reading for all of us should be the New Ireland Forum report and its sectional studies.</P>
    <P>In particular, we face the challenge of North-South co-operation, an essential element of the Good Friday Agreement, and an area where, economically, much is to be gained to mutual advantage and to the betterment of the lives of people North and South. However, it is not all gain &ndash; there will also be pain. At the time of the Sunningdale Executive there was a marked reluctance among some civil servants to give meaningful powers to proposed North-South bodies &ndash; the tradition of empire building runs deep. There will be occasions when a gain for the North, such as in attracting a new, much sought after industry, will not automatically be seen as an achievement for the whole island and <i>vice versa</i>. Firm and determined political leadership will be required. In order that the wide field of North-South co-operation can be maximised, the Taoiseach should appoint a Minister with responsibility for co-ordinating efforts in this area.</P>
    <P>Acceptable policing is a crucial element in a lasting settlement in Northern Ireland. Policing has always been a potential Achilles heel and so it remains. Even if the Patten report is implemented in full there will still be a major problem. Policing remains a function under the control of the British Government. The new Northern Ireland Executive has the power to make laws but it will rely on a police force outside its control to enforce those laws. Any Government without the power to enforce its own laws is a eunuch. The argument has been used that <Col N="34" /> policing is too sensitive an issue to be in the hands of local politicians. The opposite is now the case in the new context &ndash; policing is too sensitive an issue not to be under the control of the new Executive.</P>
    <P>An effort is already being made to rewrite the history of the past 30 years. The truth is the past 30 years represent one of the clearest examples in history of the futility of violence in achieving political objectives. In comparison with the Good Friday Agreement, I believe that from the point of view of Nationalist Ireland, Sunningdale was a better deal. It not only had power sharing but a Council of Ireland which had an elected tier so politicians from the Dáil and Stormont would meet in regular session. Articles 2 and 3 also remained in the Constitution. All of that is arguable. However, what is not arguable is that the difference between Sunningdale and the Good Friday Agreement does not justify the loss of a single life, never mind the 2,000 people and more who perished between 1974 and 1999. As efforts are made to rewrite history, the futility of violence should remain central.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, there has been too much talk of unity in recent days. The future is not inevitable in terms of Irish unity, certainly as regards the traditional meaning of the word. The difference now is the acceptance that we will proceed by consent, agreement and peaceful means. Cardinal Conway was quoted with approval earlier. When he was asked on a radio programme in the aftermath of Sunningdale whether the new arrangements, because of the equality they would bring, would make Catholics content with their position within the United Kingdom, or if they would encourage their efforts towards a united Ireland, the wise Cardinal replied: &ldquo;I am prepared to leave the answer to that question to history&rdquo;. I agree with him and I recommend that the House and everyone else do likewise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Ms O'Donnell)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is, beyond doubt, a historic day and week not only for the peace process but also in the history of this island. Today, we are less than one day from the entry into force of the British-Irish Agreement, the devolution of powers from Westminster and the coming into being of arrangements that will, for the first time, bring representatives from administrations in both parts of this island into structured co-operation with each other. These are momentous events that will have a profound effect on political life not only in Northern Ireland but throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When power is devolved at midnight this evening we will, for the first time, see an Executive created on which all political traditions in Northern Ireland are represented. There were those who said that the process through which Ministers were nominated on Monday was low key &ndash; perhaps it was, just as this debate is low key. However, it is surely remarkable, and reflective of the extraordinary changes taking place this <Col N="35" /> week, that we have reached a stage where representatives of Sinn Féin and of the DUP could take their seats on the same Executive in a low key way.</P>
    <P>The Ministers who will serve on the Executive will have many demanding tasks and heavy responsibilities ahead of them but I know from my contact with all of the political parties in Northern Ireland throughout the process, that those are demands and responsibilities they have long wished to have placed on their shoulders. They have been longing to assume the mantle of responsibility and power. People have spoken of the advent of real politics in the North and hopefully we are witnessing the start of that process this week.</P>
    <P>Tomorrow morning will also see the British-Irish Agreement enter into force when the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland exchange the necessary notifications. The supplementary agreements bringing the North-South Ministerial Council, the Implementation Bodies, the British-Irish Council and the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference into being will also enter into force at the same time. Through these agreements, we will see new structures unique for co-operation between the two parts of this island come into being. On my departure from the House I shall be travelling to Belfast where, together with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I shall be representing the Government at a meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council in shadow form. David Trimble and Séamus Mallon, as First Minister-designate and Deputy First Minister-designate, will be representing the Shadow Executive.</P>
    <P>The meeting is expected to be technical and low key and is necessary for procedural and legal reasons. However, its significance will lie in its symbolic importance as the first meeting of an institution which we are determined will become hugely important. The inaugural plenary meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council is expected to take place, probably in Armagh, later this month, and our ministerial team will be led by the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste.</P>
    <P>The Council will oversee and direct the work of the six implementation bodies which are to be formally established tomorrow. They will deal with waterways, food safety, trade and business development, EU programmes, aquaculture and marine matters, and language issues. These will be effective and meaningful executive agencies, with an all-island or cross-Border remit. Inevitably, it will take a little time for them to become fully operational but considerable preparatory work has been done, interim chief executives are in place and I look forward to them making their mark very quickly.</P>
    <P>However, the North-South Ministerial Council's brief will be much wider. It will provide a framework for the consideration of all matters of mutual interest within our joint competence. Six areas have been selected for priority co-operation <Col N="36" />&ndash; transport, agriculture, environment, health, education and tourism. These are richly promising. They have been identified by economists and representative groups such as the CBI-IBEC Joint Council as being specially significant. There is obvious scope for us to exploit economies of scale, to share our common experiences, and to face future challenges together. The Council can also choose to look at other areas, for example, energy, training and combating poverty and social exclusion on the island. In our view, no issue of potential interest should be omitted or overlooked.</P>
    <P>None of this is in any way threatening. Analysis and consultation must, by definition, proceed on a joint basis. Over the months of strand two negotiations we had earlier this year, with the UUP in particular, on North-South issues, this message has got through loud and clear. Unionists, following the lead of the Northern Ireland business, trade union and voluntary communities, realise that enhanced interaction with the South can be strongly to their benefit.</P>
    <P>We too, in this jurisdiction, have things to learn from the North. It will be a challenge for our Departments and State agencies to examine their own activities and practices in this new light, and to adjust to the changed situation. In truth, however, there has during this decade been substantial progress in this direction. Once upon a time our public service was accused of a kind of closet partitionism. If this was ever true, it no longer is &ndash; the co-operation offered by all Departments has been, and continues to be, remarkable. The new British-Irish institutions will allow us to deepen and widen the already close ties between the peoples of these islands, to our mutual benefit.</P>
    <P>Alongside these remarkable new institutional arrangements, tomorrow significant constitutional change will also take place. It has long been my view that the majority of people on this island wish to see their Constitution place more emphasis on the unity of people rather than territory. In the new wording of Article 3 we will express our desire to unite all of the people of Ireland in all of the diversity of our identities and of our traditions. We will state firmly that we recognise that a united Ireland shall only be brought about through peaceful means and with the consent of the people of Ireland, North and South.</P>
    <P>Yes, it is true that were the institutions under the Agreement to fail, the changes to the Constitution would stand. However, first, I do not believe the institutions will fail. I am fully convinced there is a will on the part of all who will operate them to see them succeed for the benefit of all of our people. Second, and more importantly, I believe that the changes we are making will bring the Constitution more closely into line with the will of the people of Ireland, who voted in such large numbers in May 1998. As we watch events unfold this week, we should remember the extraordinary work, courage and <Col N="37" /> commitment on the part of a great number of people that has made them possible. I think of the sustained vision of John Hume. I know that without Séamus Mallon's unswerving commitment to seeing the Agreement he worked so hard to bring about fully implemented, we would not be making such progress this week. David Trimble has again proved himself a courageous and innovative leader of his people. He has taken considerable personal and political risks and we owe him a great deal. The leaders of the republican community, Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness have also stretched their community to its very limits. I am pleased to see two Sinn Féin Ministers ready to take their places in the new institutions being created this week.</P>
    <P>I know I speak for everyone in the House, and for all the people of Ireland, when I say we could not have made it to this point without the relentless commitment, patience, optimism and persistence of Senator George Mitchell. The embodiment of the international support with which the peace process has been blessed, he has helped to bring us to this remarkable point in our history. We owe him a great debt and will always remember and honour his contribution.</P>
    <P>It is a cliché to say we stand on the threshold of a new millennium, a new century and a fresh start. The events of this week show more clearly than ever that we in Ireland have realised our future belongs together, that we can and must trust each other and build a future in peace and partnership. Many people in Northern Ireland are at different stages of trust, confidence and forgiveness. The fact that the institutions are this week moving towards full implementation of the process will transform the context in which many people who have not yet reached a stage of confidence in the future and forgiveness of the evils of the past will begin to build a trust in people. We can then get on with living our lives in peace and prosperity on this island.</P>

      <P>As a Deputy from a Border county, I congratulate all those involved in bringing about what is undoubtedly an historic agreement and occasion in Northern Ireland. In the decades and generations to come, people will look back at the courage of those who kept to the task set for them and lived and worked day and night to bring about a resolution to what seemed an almost impossible problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We salute the courage of Senator George Mitchell who was sent to Northern Ireland to do a specific job. He stuck with that task, even though at times it was felt he would not succeed. We appreciate what he has done and hope this House will recognise his work and courage. We salute all the leaders in Northern Ireland. We salute David <Col N="38" /> Trimble for bringing his people with him. This was not easy because those people come from an historic past of deep rooted beliefs and feelings. However, they have moved forward. I thank my party leader, Deputy John Bruton, for his sensitive and courageous statements when this was not popular. He encouraged the Unionist people to take the road to peace. We congratulate Gerry Adams on leading Sinn Féin-IRA when it seemed they were entrenched and not prepared to move. These people were encouraged to take the peaceful way forward which they recognised. We acknowledge the low key statesman, John Hume. I am aware of the work he did behind the scenes which was acknowledged by both sides in Northern Ireland. It was disappointing that former Secretary of State, Mo Mowlam, was not around when the final part of jigsaw was put in place. She worked extremely hard and was available at all times to deal with issues. She may have been outspoken at times but people understood and appreciated her views.</P>
    <P>We thank and congratulate all those involved because this is a new beginning. Coming from the Border constituency of Cavan-Monaghan, we have lived in the shadow of the Northern Ireland troubles for the past 25 years and suffered from the spill-over. I hope this is in the past, to be buried but not forgotten. We must not allow this to be repeated. In this context, the present Ministers and Assembly will need tremendous courage to get on with the task of building trust. These people can now administer their own affairs and we in the South have a role to play in supporting and working with them. They will soon realise we cannot live in isolation because we are a small island. Members will recall that during the BSE outbreak in Great Britain, Ian Paisley said the cattle in Northern Ireland were Irish. People claim to be Irish when it is advantageous. We are all Irish now, we are all looking to the same markets and promoting the same ideas. There are many areas in which we can co-operate, particularly in relation to tourism. The Erne catchment area, which encompasses Fermanagh, Cavan and Monaghan, has huge potential. It is the greatest waterway in Europe which we can market together and where we have a common purpose. The Tourist Board in the Republic and its Northern Ireland counterpart can work together to promote this amenity. We in the Republic have been facing tremendous problems in the agriculture sector. I have tried to raise the issue in this House. I hope the Minister for Agriculture in Northern Ireland visits the Republic immediately to see how we can work together to resolve what is a common problem, North and South, the demise of small farms in both parts of the country.</P>
    <P>Education has a tremendous role to play. This is where the real future lies for young people. There can be cross-Border co-operation whereby schools will interact. School tours can be organised for young people North and South. This will enable them to see that people North and South <Col N="39" /> are the same, that we live on the same island with a common objective to build and work for future generations. I know the present Ministers will grasp this opportunity and that the Government will support any avenue of co-operation, joint partnerships or promotional initiatives. If this is beneficial to the Republic, it will be beneficial to Northern Ireland. It will support the Border counties from Donegal to Louth which have suffered and been neglected. Again, I congratulate everyone involved and I assure the people of Northern Ireland that we in the South are anxious to support and work with them.</P>

      <P>Every cliché in the dictionary could be used as we undertake this debate. I add my words of support to everything that has been said. The House and the entire country is overjoyed by the developments of the past few weeks and days. This is a welcome and long awaited discussion. Over the past five or six years, many of us were impatient from time to time as a result of the long delays, the difficulties encountered and the way in which the process took one step forward and two backwards. However, in a strange way, this has been helpful and worthwhile because it has brought many of the politicians in Northern Ireland closer together. They now recognise that they must work in tandem with each other. All the disappointments, doubts and hurdles jumped over the past five years will make for a stronger and better future. I pay tribute to all those concerned &ndash; the Taoiseach, the British Prime Minister and their predecessors, our Ministers and all the various Government Ministers and politicians in Northern Ireland &ndash; who have worked to bring about this successful conclusion to a centuries old problem.</P>
      <P>History has been the greatest problem as far as Northern Ireland is concerned. We were literally bound by the history of past generations. I am a little fearful, and support Deputy Currie's remarks, about stargazing into the future and pre-deciding what the Ireland of the next century will look like. We should leave that task to the next generation of politicians. The task of this generation of politicians, both in the Republic and in Northern Ireland, is to allow the people of Northern Ireland to have a normal future with normal political debate and let the future be decided by the next generation of politicians. I fear we may be setting too high a hurdle for the politicians of today to jump. Much work remains to be done on the wider theme of reconciliation. Much progress has been made but many people who have been wounded both physically and mentally will take time to come to terms with the new political reality. We must be understanding, considerate and support these people in every way possible. I wish the process well and thank all those involved in bringing it to fruition.</P>

      <P>Last night was a momentous occasion in the House of Commons in providing <Col N="40" /> for the devolution of power to the Northern Ireland Assembly and Executive. Today is as significant in this House.</P>
      <P>It is heartening to witness the level of consensus on all sides in the House this afternoon. The men and women who established this State over 77 years ago would feel justifiably proud of their achievement. They did this courageously at the time and against such hostility that it is only now all parties accept their achievement. We can all play a pro-active part in helping this Agreement to be successful, through Government and non-governmental agencies, town twinning and so on. We have a critical role to play in whatever way we can to create a level of buoyancy and activity that will be irreversible. The train is just leaving the station and we must keep it going and accelerate its progress. There are major challenges ahead such as policing, housing, employment opportunities and so on. I foresee great difficulties in regard to decommissioning. I appeal to everyone to handle this issue sensitively and carefully over the coming months. February is looming. At Christmas the Assembly will be just up and running from an organisational point of view and as there will not be much activity after Christmas, it is very important that the deadline is not seen as an end in itself. This issue could derail the process and must be handled with great care. I hope, at the end of the day, it will not bring down this peace agreement.</P>

      <P>This is a momentous week in the history of the Irish people. We are finally seeing the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement with the establishment of the Executive, the All-Ireland Ministerial Council and the all-Ireland implementation bodies. It has been a long and difficult road to this point but, at such a time, the difficulties pale in comparison to what has now been set in place.</P>
      <P>Sinn Féin's view of the Good Friday Agreement is clear. We see it as a major step forward, a vehicle for progressive change. We are totally committed to the full implementation of the Agreement. That in no way negates our republican beliefs and goals. On the contrary, we see the Agreement and the new political dispensation it brings with it as a secure foundation for building a better society here and now and as a bridge to a new future for all our people. We will be working to ensure that it hastens the day when we will see a united Ireland, sovereign and independent. That is our central aim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The creation this week of a partnership administration involving republicans, Nationalists and Unionists is a truly historic achievement and credit goes to the pro-Agreement parties who finally made it happen. Despite all the delays in getting <Col N="41" /> to this point, no one should under-estimate the scale of this achievement. For republicans it has been a very difficult path to follow and there will be further difficulties ahead but we carry with us our belief in the ability of all the people of this island of diverse political opinion to work together for the common good.</P>
    <P>I congratulate my colleagues, the new Minister for Education, Martin McGuinness, and the new Minister for Health and Public Safety, Bairbre de Brún. I know both of them will apply to their ministries the sense of justice and equality which is the bedrock of Irish republicanism. Their experience over many years in campaigning with communities for social justice will equip them for their onerous new roles. I know also that their diligence and attention to detail make them well qualified to fulfil their tasks.</P>
    <P>As a Deputy representing a Border constituency, I look forward to working with the Sinn Féin Ministers and the other new Ministers and committee members of all parties in ensuring that we fulfil the potential of the Agreement to bring real and tangible benefits to the people of the Border counties and the entire country. We have the opportunity to put behind us decades of failed partitionist politics which saw a stunted economy and regions, such as the Border region, marginalised and under-developed.</P>
    <P>For the people of the Border counties partition has been a daily reality thwarting their efforts to progress economically and socially. It has lasted for most of this century. For them, therefore, the all-Ireland nature of the Agreement is vital. It has potential to develop the island economy and to rebuild communities across the artificial boundary. That potential must be fulfilled and the Irish Government has a huge responsibility to ensure that.</P>
    <P>There is a palpable sense of achievement about the events of this week but this is only a beginning. The Agreement carries the promise and the potential for change. These have yet to be delivered. Resistance to change has been the factor that delayed the implementation of the Agreement. There is no doubt that there will be continued resistance to change not only from some political parties but from vested interests. I mention in particular the RUC. That discredited force has been engaged in a charm offensive that has been indulged by certain sections of the media with smiling photographs of RUC Chief Constable, Ronnie Flanagan, receiving awards from schoolchildren. More seriously, there has been a public relations link-up between the Garda Commissioner and the RUC Chief. Indulgence by elements in this State in such a rearguard action by the RUC, whose future is clearly under threat, shows a blindness on their part to the need for fundamental change.</P>
    <P>The Patten report highlighted the need for a new policing service in the Six Counties. Many of its recommendations are progressive; many do not nearly go far enough. All are dependent on legislation and implementation by the British <Col N="42" /> Government. What will not be accepted by republicans is any shirking from this task on the part of the British Government in an effort to mollify the rejectionist wing of Unionism.</P>
    <P>A word of caution is also needed on the Ulster Unionist Council meeting at the weekend. David Trimble did step outside the Mitchell review and the Good Friday Agreement by setting a new deadline of next February on decommissioning. This again underlines the role of the international independent Commission on Decommissioning. However, I will conclude on a brighter note. Sinn Féin has entered the new Executive in a spirit of partnership, extending the hand of friendship to our Unionist neighbours. I believe that, by working together, our common interest as an island people will come to the fore and we can all embrace a new sense of Irishness in a new millennium. This can be, and I hope is, the beginning of a new era for all of Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Much praise has been expressed for politicians across the spectrum of Northern Ireland politics for their achievement in the establishment of a governmental structure for Northern Ireland. They have been credited with making the breakthrough in circumstances that would have overwhelmed lesser women and men. That praise is richly deserved. The establishment of an inclusive Executive based on a sharing of power in a place where power was misused for so long is truly momentous. All have played their part. Senator George Mitchell, in particular, is owed our debt of gratitude. But credit for the achievement lies not only with politicians. We elected representatives are still answerable to the people, no matter how visionary and innovative some of us may be. Today it is the people of Northern Ireland to whom we must pay the highest tribute. They most of all have suffered horrific loss and pain when tragedy destroyed the hopes and happiness of so many families and communities. Such tragedy could have crushed the spirit of reconciliation both to their loss and with their fellow citizens but, instead, thousands of people in Northern Ireland found the fortitude to transcend the pain, hatred and terror visited upon them. It is they who have enabled the politicians to bring about this new, remarkable political framework.</P>
      <P>An ugly war was waged in the name of self-determination and republicanism. Even though those who waged it are as yet unwilling to say so, it is clear that the war is over and that it failed in its objective. Self-determination was not won through violence, it was realised fully and unequivocally when the people of this island, Irish and British together, voted overwhelmingly in favour of the Good Friday Agreement, thereby determining their future. As a result of that vote, a devolved Government is being established which is built on the consent of the people and centred, at its heart, on the unity of Catholic, Protestant and Dissenter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the strength of the new Northern <Col N="43" /> Ireland Government, but it is also the reality which presents us with challenges regarding the inclusiveness of our forms of government in the South. How do we protect, for example, the rights of minorities? There is often a presumption in the South that prejudice begins on the other side of the Border and that it is the responsibility of those living in Northern Ireland to abandon hardline attitudes and accept consensus as the price of peace. The fact that, against all the odds, politicians in Northern Ireland have proven their worth in transforming their attitudes poses questions in terms of how much or how little we have changed.</P>
    <P>There has certainly been progress. As Deputy Quinn pointed out, it is only nine years since parties on the left introduced a Private Members' Bill which proposed changes to Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution. The Government of the day, a coalition of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats, rejected the Bill. We have moved on but we have not moved far enough. The record of the Government in human rights is not good. The British Government introduced legislation to establish a human rights commission last December and established its executive last March. The Irish Government only published the relevant legislation in mid-year and, remarkably, the debate in the House only commenced on Thursday last.</P>
    <P>This leisurely pace towards honouring commitments made by the Taoiseach does not reflect well on the State. We have been very quick to judge others while contentedly ignoring the abuse of human rights at home. The continuing delay in publishing the mental health Bill is a case in point. The failure to publish that Bill is an ongoing denial of basic human rights to psychiatric patients. It represents a contravention of the EU Convention on Human Rights. People who are incarcerated against their will are not protected in ways that are universally recognised. As we approach the end of the current session, the Bill has not yet even been published. That hardly shows a desire or thirst on the part of the State to protect human rights.</P>
    <P>It is worth noting that many politicians, particularly those in the US, have shown a keenness to pursue the issue of reforming the RUC. There is no doubt that the RUC must be reformed but that presents us with a challenge, namely, do we have democratic control of our police force and do communities have an input when justice is being denied or not being delivered correctly by those given authority and power in that regard? These are issues we must tackle if we are serious about fully recognising and acknowledging the progress that has been made in Northern Ireland. Given the State's treatment of asylum seekers and travellers, how can we talk about equality when we see the grave injustices which still exist?</P>
    <P>When we consider the institutions being established in Northern Ireland, it is clear that those who have been elected Ministers will be dealing <Col N="44" /> with and concentrating on the normal, bread and butter social and economic issues with which this House deals on a daily basis. They will be obliged to make difficult decisions. For example, the Minister for Health in Northern Ireland will be obliged to deal with a number of serious issues in terms of the prioritisation of resources. We must ensure that we can support the Ministers in Northern Ireland in every way so they can carry out the kind of work which results from being in government.</P>
    <P>It is clear that these Ministers will be answerable to the electorate and that they will be governed by the inexorable pressure exerted by voters. That applies to members of the DUP as much as anyone else. I accept that DUP Ministers may create all sorts of interesting dilemmas within the Government of Northern Ireland. However, I welcome the fact that they have come on board. The DUP's representatives will also be answerable to their constituents and they will be obliged to cater for those people's social and economic needs.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge the good work done by politicians and people who, during the dark days of the past, assisted in making progress. In that context, I refer to the early 1970s when the republican movement split over a decision on whether it should pursue a campaign of violence or take the road towards democratic principles and politics.</P>
    <P>I am glad I have lived to see this day. It is a tragedy that so many have not lived to see it. In the memory of those who lost their lives, we must ensure that the Government takes action in respect of the human rights of our citizens and that the Northern Ireland Government and the new relationship between these islands works effectively for everyone.</P>

      <P>I welcome the establishment of the Northern Ireland Executive. I compliment the parties in the North, particularly the SDLP which has followed a consistent policy for 30 years. That policy has, in the main, been responsible for current developments in Northern Ireland. I also compliment the two Governments, the Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, the British Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, their predecessors, previous Governments, the President of the United States, Mr. Clinton, and Senator George Mitchell.</P>
      <P>It is important to remember people of preceding generations who worked to bring about an end to conflict on this island. We must also remember those on both sides of the Border who were the victims of violence. Both sides of the community suffered in equal measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Today, however, we must look forward to peace, to an end to the destruction of life and property on this island and to see equal recognition for both communities in Northern Ireland. <Col N="45" /> For the first time since the establishment of Northern Ireland the rights of Nationalists will be protected. This is happening because of the changes that are coming about as a result of the Good Friday Agreement. We also look forward to the restoration of normality. In that context, I am concerned about the part of Northern Ireland which abuts my constituency, namely, south Armagh. There is no sign of a return to normality in that area. It is time the British Army reconsidered the level of its activity in south Armagh and reduced it. I also appeal to the small number of paramilitaries operating in south Armagh and other areas to change their ways, enter the fold along with everyone else and accept that constitutional politics represents the way forward. People on both sides of the Border, when they voted in the two referenda, decreed that everyone should take this course of action.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the establishment of the cross-Border bodies which will offer tremendous benefits to everyone on the island, North and South. There will be great opportunities for the 12 Border counties which suffered dreadfully in economic terms during the past 30 years. There is now an unprecedented opportunity for social and economic development. I am particularly interested in the inland waterways body because the restoration of the Ulster Canal was written into the legislation and I hope it will move on that rapidly.</P>
    <P>It is also important for Government to recognise the contribution that has been and continues to be made by local authority members on both sides of the Border. They have established their own groups over the past 20 years and have done tremendous work. It is encouraging that there is cross-community involvement in the North as Unionist dominated councils also participate. Government should recognise and support their work because that would greatly benefit the island and the Border counties in particular. There is still much to be done but all of us can be proud of the implementation of the Agreement. We have progressed much further this week and with the goodwill of all the parties involved, particularly those in Northern Ireland, the support of the Irish and British Governments and the endorsement they received in the two referenda in 1998, we can look forward with confidence to the future.</P>

      <P>The proceedings of the House on this, the first day of the last month of the millennium, will be remembered for this debate rather than the budget debate which will follow, although it will attract much more publicity. However, this is an historic event and I am very privileged and moved, after almost 35 years as a Member of the Oireachtas, to contribute to the debate. I have seen great change and I have been privileged to be involved as a Minister during that time. I am glad that the Taoiseach acknowledged that the original proposals of the Lemass consti<Col N="46" /> tutional committee in 1966 were central to the provisions of the Good Friday Agreement and the basis for the future. I was privileged to serve on it as a young man because Lemass invited young men onto the committee on the basis that the future was in our hands.</P>
      <P>Consent has remained a constant theme throughout the evolution of the process over those years. It was constantly put forward as a policy position here in terms of agreement between North and South, within the North and between both Governments. Indeed, it was central to a policy document that I presented in 1975 on behalf of my party, which was misunderstood, and perhaps misinterpreted, but that is history. Consent was also an element of relations with the British Government and House of Commons. I pay tribute to Deputy Currie's constant commitment as a member of the SDLP and Fine Gael. In 1960 there was no consent nor was there a facility to discuss Northern Ireland issues in the House of Commons. The Speaker's Convention prevented any discussion on those issues and our preoccupation in Jack Lynch's Government, in which I served as Minister for Foreign Affairs, was to open the debate so that the issues could be discussed on the basis of the potential that existed if all the democratic representatives got together.</P>
      <P>That is happening now and the experience we have had over the past number of years pursuing the policy of consent is a clear indication to those who will operate the new institutions that they have no need to fear or be distrustful of what can be achieved together through consent. For example, the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body, of which I am privileged to be co-chairman, replaced the Speaker's Convention and espouses one view. Those who laboured through the difficult times should be remembered, including John Hume who has sacrificed his health and spent his life trying to reach this day. I concur with Deputy O'Hanlon that the SDLP deserves special tribute. David Trimble, who has emerged from a difficult position having regard to some entrenched positions within his party, deserves our recognition, respect, constant appreciation and support.</P>
      <P>Recognition must be paid formally to Gerry Adams because I know from experience that he has tried to bring the republican IRA/Sinn Féin movement along the political path. I refer as far back as the hunger strikes and the dirty protest. I was involved in discussions with the former Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Peter Carrington, and Gerry Adams was instrumental in having that protest called off. Unfortunately, an entrenched attitude on the part of some authorities in the prison service brought all that to nought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The future we look to involves consent and the world will open up to our fellow Irishmen through participation in Europe <i>via</i> the North-South bodies, co-operation in economic development in areas, such as agriculture and tourism and, particularly, the fact that beyond Britain and <Col N="47" /> Ireland, there is a bigger world still and both countries have an opportunity to make a contribution to harmony, peace and justice under this new principle which has been adopted.</P>

      <P>I welcome this opportunity to pay tribute to all those who, over the last number of years, have worked so hard to break down barriers and make the establishment of a new Executive possible. Fine Gael was the first party in this House to realise that peace on this island could only be brought about through discussion and recognition of the rights of all people in the land. Former Taoisigh, Liam Cosgrave, Garret FitzGerald and Deputy John Bruton played a role and I pay tribute to them. I also pay a special tribute to Senator George Mitchell, David Trimble and Gerry Adams, all of whom displayed tremendous patience and courage over the past number of weeks. I wish David Trimble, as First Minister, and Seamas Mallon, as Deputy First Minister, and their colleagues every success.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach and Prime Minister Blair together with all the Ministers and back-up staff have demonstrated the ability to understand the problems and eventually find solutions that have led us thus far. I congratulate all of them, especially the Taoiseach. As he stated earlier, everyone involved has had to take their courage in both hands. David Trimble had to overcome serious problems within his party and I fully understand why people have serious reservations as they can clearly recall how many of their loved ones were murdered over the past 30 years. One lady in my constituency recently reminded me that her brother died in his place of worship.</P>
      <P>Likewise, Gerry Adams had and has a major problem to bring people with him and join his party into democratic politics. Much of the Good Friday Agreement has been implemented. Many prisoners from both sides of the divide have been released; the Executive is up and running; many other issues are being dealt with and the IRA has agreed to appoint a person to address decommissioning. According to the Agreement, decommissioning by both sides is to take place by May 2000. If people are committed to democracy and the building of trust, decommissioning must begin now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As one who was involved in farm organisations and the Irish Meat Industries Association, I have developed many friendships in farming and industry over the years. My own co-operative, Cavan-Monaghan, Golden Vale, Lakeland Dairies, Kerry Co-operative, AIBP, which is owned by Larry Goodman, Monaghan Mushrooms and many other companies serve both sides of the Border, which demonstrates that when a common goal is shared, people can work together. Farming <Col N="48" /> organisations, women's groups and industrial and tourism groups have worked together over the years. The first time I felt that I was not free to continue open involvement was when I entered full-time politics in this House. I welcome the change the new structures will bring.</P>
    <P>Cross-Border bodies are important and they will bring great progress to the Border areas which have suffered most over the past 30 years. They will bring progress in agriculture, tourism, waterways and other areas. I look forward to the cross-Border body being located in County Monaghan because it has the longest stretch of Border of all the counties in the area and it is suited to that type of structure.</P>
    <P>As Deputy O'Hanlon said, the Ulster Canal must be addressed. The Blackwater River was addressed in more difficult times and the Ulster Canal provides an obvious opportunity. However, I am critical of the Taoiseach and the Government on one issue. If they are committed to a cross-Border structure, they must ensure that major secondary cross-Border roads are restructured and reopened. I refer in particular to the Dundalk to Castleblaney road, which goes through South Armagh, the Dundalk to Sligo road, which goes through Carrickmacross, and the Belfast to Galway road, which passes through Monaghan, Clones and Cavan. None of those roads were included in the national plan but they must be addressed if the Government is to show commitment to cross-Border activities.</P>

      <P>Watching events in Stormont this week, most of us felt emotional at the historic coming together of all sections of the community there in a partnership representing the interests of all the people and different shades of political opinion in Northern Ireland. We are witnessing the termination of not only the past 30 years of unrelenting violence and suffering, but also, I hope, a lasting solution to what has been historically known as the Irish question which has endured and bedevilled us for many centuries.</P>
      <P>This week we are witnessing the successful culmination of the efforts of many people over the past 30 years, extending from the Administrations of Liam Cosgrave to the Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern. During those years many efforts were made, starting with the Sunningdale Agreement in 1974 when there was, for a period, a power sharing and partnership Administration in Northern Ireland. It is historic that one of the members of that Administration, Deputy Currie, spoke earlier. Perhaps the greatest weakness of that experiment was that republicans were not represented and the inclusion of a Council of Ireland was a step too far at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next major milestone was the Anglo-Irish Agreement in 1985 which gave us a direct <Col N="49" /> involvement and say in Northern Ireland affairs. For the first time, there were Irish civil servants in Maryfield. In 1994, there was the Downing Street Declaration during Deputy Albert Reynolds's term of office, which was followed by the Framework Document in 1995 when Deputy John Bruton and his Government were in power. A major landmark on the road to this week's momentous and historic decision was the referendum in May 1998 when the Good Friday Agreement and its provisions were supported by 85 per cent of the population of the island. Since then it probably has been a matter of politicians responding to the wishes of the public.</P>
    <P>There is a significant and meaningful change in the mindset of all political parties in Northern Ireland. Every party has given ground. There has been compromise on all sides and the result is that, for the first time in 25 years, there is devolved government in Northern Ireland with participation by all shades of political opinion. Deputy John Bruton and the Fine Gael Party have always extolled the virtues of pluralism as the solution to the problems in the North. The happenings there this week are a vindication of that position. In the coming weeks, I hope the various parts will fall into place. We look forward to the establishment of all the ancillary bodies, including the British-Irish Council, the North-South Ministerial Council and the Irish Federation.</P>
    <P>I compliment everyone in Northern Ireland, here, in the UK, President Clinton and particularly Senator Mitchell for their efforts and support for the process. I also congratulate all those who have been appointed and taken responsibility for various Departments and committees in the North this week. I am extremely happy and proud that former Senator Bríd Rodgers, who is from my townland, Bunbeg in the Donegal Gaeltacht, has been given responsibility for the Department of Agriculture in Northern Ireland. This is historic. On the eve of a new millennium, are we being too hopeful in looking forward to a century of peace, co-operation and understanding on this island?</P>

I probably will never forget when the Ministers designate were sworn into the new Government. It was a great day for democracy, the people of Northern Ireland and people everywhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I watched, I thought the new Government would be well served by its Ministers. All are capable people. They come from different backgrounds but they all want the exercise to work. A few months ago the ten people involved would not even sit in the same room together. A huge transformation has taken place and this will apply to the public in Northern Ireland in time. My second thought was of all the people who made it possible and one name in particular stood out, that of Mr. John Hume. I congratulate all those <Col N="50" /> involved over the years in the process. It has been a wonderful week in Irish politics.</P>

      <P>This debate is taking place at a time of unique opportunity and promise in Ireland and it is a great honour and privilege to take part in this discussion. Some 18 months after the referenda in which the people voiced their overwhelming support for the new beginning offered by the Good Friday Agreement and as a result of a considerable amount of painstaking and dedicated work to secure its full implementation, we are within 24 hours of the institutions under the Agreement receiving their powers.</P>
      <P>As we speak, for the first time in history, an inclusive Executive representative of all political traditions in the North stands ready to hold office. The Ministers designate have all waited a long time for the arrival of real politics in Northern Ireland. Tomorrow, that wait will end and the Executive will meet for the first time to begin the difficult task of government.</P>
      <P>In the North-South institutions, including the Ministerial Council, the implementation bodies and the areas for enhanced co-operation, we are putting in place structures through which representatives from both Administrations on this island will be able to work together in close and friendly co-operation for the benefit of all the people. I am confident they will become a powerful force for the advancement of the concerns of all the people and that, in doing so, they will threaten the interests of none. In the British-Irish Council, a framework is being created through which the people of these islands will be able to come together to discuss matters of concern to us all, using our diversity as a creative force and celebrating all that we hold in common. Alongside these momentous institutional developments, tomorrow will also bring historical constitutional change.</P>
      <P>When the Government meets following the exchange of notifications which will bring the British-Irish Agreement into force, it will issue a declaration to bring into effect the amendments to our Constitution for which people voted in such large numbers in May 1998. The Constitution, for the first time, will express our wish in harmony and friendship to unite all the people who share the territory of Ireland in all the diversity of our identities and traditions. Placing people rather than territory at the heart of our Constitution, the amendments will recognise that the people have no interest in achieving a united Ireland through any means other than the consent of the people. These changes to the Constitution will be mirrored by changes to British constitutional legislation which will also come into effect tomorrow. All these changes, institutional and constitutional, are profound and radical.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="51" /> Each member of the Government will be called on to play his or her part in ensuring the success of the new arrangements. Within these institutional developments, the establishment of the North-South implementation bodies will cement co-operation between the two parts of the island. In the context of my Department, the introduction of the Special EU Programmes Body is particularly significant. Essentially, this body will take over the central management of Community initiatives, that is, INTERREG and peace, for the remainder of the period of the current round of Structural Funding. It will be closely involved in the negotiation of these programmes under the next round and in their central management thereafter, along with the cross-Border aspects of Leader and the successor to EQUAL. The body will have some additional individual tasks in relation to the current round of funding, and a wider remit at the detailed level of implementation in the next round.</P>
    <P>Its remit will be wider than the programmes and initiatives mentioned as it will also be responsible for monitoring and promoting implementation of North-South co-operative actions through the medium of the Common Chapter which is included in the respective North-South plans covering the period 2000 to 2006.</P>
    <P>The body will, in a very real way, place current institutional developments in these islands in an EU context and build on the very extensive co-operation between North, South and the EU, which has developed in the course of the current round of EU Structural Funding under the existing INTERREG and peace initiatives. The functions of the body are set out in greater detail in the British-Irish Agreement Act, 1999.</P>
    <P>It was a privilege to take part in this debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan" hpid="Mr. C. Lenihan Mr. C. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend Deputy Currie on his role in the early stages of the civil rights movement and in the politics of this island in the past 20 or 30 years. He has almost become an institution in his own right and certainly has been a political phenomenon in that he has the unique record of having been elected to two assemblies on this island. As a republican and Nationalist, I look forward to the day when we will have one assembly on the island of Ireland. I recognise it may not be in the short to medium term, but certainly in the long term we will have a united parliament for the whole island of Ireland. I make no apologies for saying that. I suspect this is an ambition that many on the other side of the House hold dear as well. James Connolly, who is most often quoted in this respect, said &ldquo;Ireland without her people means nothing to me&rdquo;. I share that sentiment. I believe the spirit of the Agreement and the spirit of the specific changes that were made to Articles 2 and 3 are exactly in that spirit, that the people of Ireland must be united through consent and without the use of violence to achieve political ends. That is a real and tan<Col N="52" /> gible achievement when one looks at the broader canvas and sweep of Irish history.</P>
      <P>Some people say it is an 800 year history. Some say it is 300 years. Yet more people say it is a 25 to 30 year history. I do not think that matters any more. The point is that a very big milestone has been achieved with the implementation of this Agreement, with the all-Ireland referendum that has endorsed it, and with the courage that David Trimble has displayed in bringing his people to accept this Agreement. This Agreement was never going to be a good one for the Unionist community to accept or adhere to. Acceptance of equality is difficult in some quarters of the Unionist community. The mere acceptance of the idea that they must share power is very difficult. I commend David Trimble on the leadership he has shown. It has been a remarkable achievement on his part. I hope he lasts long. I hope he is not toppled or threatened by what I call the &ldquo;Ulster says &lsquo;no' constituency&rdquo;. It would be fair to say the &ldquo;Ulster says &lsquo;no' constituency&rdquo; consists not just of Unionists. There are nay-sayers and pessimists in the Nationalist community as well in regard to this Agreement.</P>
      <P>We should pay tribute too to the paramilitary organisations. It is not fashionable to praise what are essentially illegal paramilitary organisations. However, the mainstream of those organisations, the loyalist paramilitaries and the IRA, have kept faith in terms of maintaining their ceasefires over a very difficult period in this process. It is remarkable that Martin McGuinness has taken up a position in a government in Northern Ireland. It was Martin McGuinness and many other young people of that time who took arms against the British state in 1969. It is a truly remarkable and very positive development that we see people like him and of that generation who grew up during the events of 1969 now taking their places in government and that they believe that if there is a road to Irish unity it is through government and participation in the political process. That is a lesson that was never lost on Deputy Currie. He knew about taking the constitutional road many years ago. It must be very satisfying for Deputy Currie and others like him that people are increasingly taking the view he took 20 or 30 years ago on how things should develop on the island of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is fashionable to sound positive and optimistic notes about these historic moments in the peace process. However, we need to be very cautious. Garret FitzGerald complained after the implementation of the Anglo-Irish Agreement that the British had been less than faithful in terms of their implementation of that Agreement. We in this House and those North of the Border will need to monitor the implementation of this. Merely forming the Executive does not automatically mean it will be fully implemented as an agreement. There is a danger of shifting political situations across the Irish Sea in Britain, shifting priorities, with different personalities coming in and out. We have to be extremely careful to <Col N="53" /> ensure the British honour and fully implement this Agreement as it should be implemented. We have made the first move as a Government in that we will soon implement the changes to Articles 2 and 3. We have all jumped together in that respect. We have to be extremely careful and ensure this Agreement is fully implemented in an honourable way.</P>
    <P>I was very pleased with the allocation of ministerial portfolios. It was a great tribute to the SDLP that it managed to get so many fine portfolios in the new Administration. I look forward to the early introduction of the cross-Border bodies which, I believe, will have the dynamic to grow and improve themselves. As a Nationalist republican, I believe we are on the road to Irish unity, although it may not be the unity of which Connolly and Pearse dreamed.</P>

      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to contribute to this debate. This is a historic week for Ireland. The Ministers are in place, and it is wonderful that there will be a devolved government in Northern Ireland in the next few weeks.</P>
      <P>I am delighted all parties have signed up to this Agreement. I have always said that, while we welcome help from Britain and America, the only people who can resolve this problem are the people of Northern Ireland and its politicians. When they went to England and were put into a room without outside interference, they worked out an agreement. That agreement is now in place, and we hope it will work.</P>
      <P>I hope we will never see another bomb on this island. I hope the punishment beatings will stop, and I hope the people who are buried in unknown graves throughout this State will be identified and that their families will be able to bury their bodies in a dignified way.</P>
      <P>I compliment people who are never complimented, people like Séamus Mallon who has given all his life to achieving peace in Northern Ireland. Such people are forgotten. We are always hearing about John Hume and David Trimble, the people in the front line. What about the people who have supported the SDLP and the democratic parties in Northern Ireland over the years? These are the people who should be thanked now, who should be honoured. They are the people in the background who supported democracy in Northern Ireland over the years by peaceful means, and they have paid a price for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am delighted to hear Deputy Lenihan say he is a republican. I am a republican and delighted to be so. I come from a very strong republican background. We are all republicans in this State. We all have the same beliefs. Through the years people believed that if one did not support Fianna Fáil, one was not a republican. My people died for this country. They fought and paid a heavy price, but we believed in democracy. It is wonderful to see someone like Deputy Currie, who was a Minister in the last Executive in <Col N="54" /> Northern Ireland, sitting in this Parliament where he was also a Minister. We do not know what will happen in the future, but perhaps he will be a Minister in an all-Ireland parliament.</P>
    <P>What is happening in Northern Ireland this week is wonderful for the country. I hope we never see another bomb or another life lost here in the name of Ireland. Too many lives have been lost. Too many people have paid a dear price. I understand the views of Unionists and of people who lost family members.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 7, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>As I indicated to the Deputy in the House on 20 October, the Cabinet Committee on European Affairs has effectively taken over the work of the Ministers' and Secretaries General group and as a consequence, it was this former committee, chaired on this occasion by the Tánaiste, which met on 23 November. Its main focus was the items likely to arise at the Helsinki European Council but other ongoing EU issues were reviewed also.</P>
      <P>I met with Lord Russell-Johnston, the President of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, on 24 November. His visit followed quickly on the assumption by Ireland of the Presidency of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe. Lord Russell-Johnston said that he looked forward to the programme of events planned during the Irish Presidency, including a European Conference on Social Cohesion and a conference on Human Rights, as well as a session of the Parliamentary Assembly.</P>
      <P>We discussed a number of conflicts and potential conflicts in Europe, and the actions which the Council of Europe is taking to alleviate human rights problems. I outlined the findings from my visit to Kosovo. We also had a brief discussion on budgetary matters in the Council and I agreed with him that important international projects must be adequately resourced. I said that we would do our utmost during our Presidency of the Council of Ministers to bring forward discussion in a constructive way with a view to the alleviation of the Council of Europe's budgetary difficulties.</P>
      <P>I met with Commission Vice-President Kinnock in Dublin on Friday last, 26 November. I expressed my support for the Commission's reform process and indicated that I was looking forward to the comprehensive reform strategy programme which will be brought forward next February. I arranged to keep in contact with Vice-President Kinnock's cabinet through our permanent representation in Brussels on Commission reform generally. We also briefly reviewed the current state of the Northern Ireland peace process, as Mr. Kinnock had just come from Belfast and has maintained a long standing interest throughout his successive positions and appointments in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I outlined in my reply to the House last week, I met with a number of my EU colleagues in Istanbul and discussed the forthcoming EU Council in Helsinki. I met yesterday morning with <Col N="56" /> Finnish Prime Minister Lipponen as part of his tour of capitals prior to the Helsinki Summit. I also hope to have my usual pre-summit meeting with Prime Minister Blair immediately in advance of Helsinki. The agenda for Helsinki will not be finalised until Prime Minister Lipponen has completed his tour of capitals but, based on our discussions yesterday morning, our discussions will most likely centre on enlargement including the question of Turkey's candidature; follow up to the Trumpf-Piris report on the development of work of the Council; economic policy co-ordination and employment guidelines; follow up the Cologne Council's decisions on the EU's peacekeeping and crisis management capacity, both civil and military and discussions on the arrangements for the conduct of the Intergovernmental Conference and its scope.</P>
    <P>The Helsinki Summit is not expected to discuss any individual proposals for actual Treaty amendments &ndash; that will be a matter for the next Presidency to take up, based on what is agreed at Helsinki. The Intergovernmental Conference will certainly cover the so-called Amsterdam leftovers &ndash; the items at Article 1 of the Protocol to the Amsterdam Treaty, the size of the Commission, the reweighting of votes and the extension of qualified majority noting, QMV, but the other areas to be examined beyond these have yet to be decided. The European Council will also discuss current international issues. I would expect in this context that there will be a discussion of the situation in Chechnya.</P>
    <P>As regards visits to accession countries, last year I visited Estonia and I recently visited Hungary and Slovenia. I received the Polish Prime Minister, Mr. Jerzy Buzek, in Dublin in November last year and held an extensive bilateral meeting with Polish President Kwasneivski in Istanbul two weeks ago. As the Deputies will be aware, the President has, in October, completed a very successful State visit to the Czech Republic and, depending on my other commitments, I hope to visit that country in the latter part of next year although no final arrangements have been made in this regard. Given the very extensive demands next year due to the Intergovernmental Conference, the EU-Africa, UN and ASEM summits, the opportunity for bilateral visits will be curtailed but I am very eager to visit all of the accession countries and will keep the matter under review. Finally, apart from my visits, officials in my Department and the Department of Foreign Affairs are in regular direct contact with their counterparts in the accession countries, and taken with reports from our ambassadors, I am kept fully informed on domestic developments in each of the countries and on the progress of the accession negotiations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach in favour of Turkey becoming a full EU member in principle?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is possible and if Turkey can comply with the regulations. I will report to <Col N="57" /> Deputy Bruton what was said to me by Prime Minister Lipponen yesterday. There is some move in the Greek situation. There is already a move in most countries. Prime Minister Sinitis is making some moves. In the case of Turkey it will depend not only on the financial criteria but also on the human rights situation. The Turkish Prime Minister Ecevit recently outlined the intentions, plans and reforms for his Government. We have had numerous sessions on this matter to date which have not reached a successful conclusion but Prime Minister Lipponen said yesterday there is some movement. There is no certainty yet that Turkey will be considered to be the &ldquo;pre-ins&rdquo;. At all the previous meetings, while there were lengthy discussions and at times it looked as if progress would be made, effectively no progress has been made. He is hopeful that this time there will be progress. From an Irish position, if they abide by the Coperhagen criteria, the statements of the Cologne Summit and agree to the human rights reform programmes and the issues laid down, though I think this will take some time, then there would be an agreement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>How realistic is all of this? Is it not the case that Ireland is now committed to the development of a European military crisis management arrangement in which Ireland will be politically, if not militarily, involved? If this is set up will all EU members be involved? In that context, how realistic is it for the EU to have a land boundary with Syria, Armenia and Iraq in view of the many difficulties that exist across those boundaries, which land boundary would be one which, under any military crisis management arrangements, the EU would be obliged to defend? How realistic is to think in terms of the EU reach extending that far?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose all of these things are extending. If one had asked a number of years ago if a European Council would ever be discussing enlargement involving so many countries, I think the answer would have no, that it did not seem possible. I can only tell the Deputy what I think will happen at Helsinki. I imagine the &ldquo;ins&rdquo; and the &ldquo;pre-ins&rdquo; will be accepted. I am not so sure about Turkey yet but I am giving the Deputy the up to date &mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>What does the Taoiseach think about the problem I have put before him? Does he want the EU defence to extend to the boundary with Syria?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not jumping to simple things; we are talking about the enlargement process.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach would want to see where he was going before he starts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will explain where we are going. If we can get over the next decade we might then consider Syria and some of the other <Col N="58" /> countries referred to by the Deputy, but nobody is talking about them at present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach should not trivialise what I am saying. These are serious questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>A programme is being discussed at Helsinki which is likely to start in 2003 and is likely to go on for approximately ten years. Turkey is the least likely country to be considered in that period. The Deputy should not be concerned with Syria.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a border between Turkey and Syria.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody is talking about enlargement in that context. Syria is not on the agenda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that there is a border between Turkey and Syria?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course. The Deputy asked how realistic was the prospect of enlargement. I believe the European Council will agree to the accession of the pre-in countries. I am not certain about what will happen over Turkey. The main issues there concern human rights and civil liberties. There are difficulties over religious issues and Turkey itself has a complex system which will take time to address. The EU is anxious to deal with Turkey. The weight of opinion across the member states is in favour of seeing the Turkish issue resolved. There is also much outside pressure. For example, the US is a strong advocate of Turkish membership.</P>
      <P>On the question of boundaries, about a month ago on Question Time I said that President Prodi has indicated in the review of the Union's future development that it should decide where the lines of Europe start and end. That examination has not even started.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach mentioned that the discussions in Helsinki will follow on from the discussions on defence in Cologne. Is it not the case that during these discussions a German Commissioner, Mr. Verheugen, first mentioned a European defence union or EDU? Will the Government consider the integration of the Western European Union into the EU in the next EU treaty and will that be under discussion? Would the Government find such an integration acceptable if the common defence provisions were made optional, for example, by way of a protocol? Would it insist that before it would even consider such an integration, the Western <Col N="59" /> European Union must renounce its nuclear weapons policies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We have already made clear that the Western European Union will go out of existence and many of the issues it dealt with will be transferred to the EU. The big exception is issues under Article 5, to which I am totally opposed. They include mutual defence policies, which I oppose. I will object to them. I do not believe an effort will be made to deal with them, but I suspect some countries will continue to press them from time to time. I do not have a difficulty with the rest of the Western European Union, which is compatible with the Petersberg Tasks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the nuclear weapons policies of the Western European Union or of a proposed European defence union? Would these have to be renounced before the Taoiseach would find it acceptable?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Rory O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We are moving away from the subject matter of the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>This is part of any new treaty arrangements under discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe it will arise, but if it did arise in Intergovernmental Conference discussions we will adhere to our traditional position when considering any treaty arrangements. These discussions may deal beyond the issues I mentioned. Following the Amsterdam Treaty it was likely that an Intergovernmental Conference would be held prior to and after enlargement. It would appear that we will have no objections to what is agreed at Helsinki, given that the Intergovernmental Conference will start earlier than next March at the employment summit in Lisbon. Work will be completed by December. Other issues may appear on the agenda but I do not believe the issues raised by the Deputy will arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In his reply to seven questions does the Taoiseach not find it extraordinary that he has chosen, for whatever reason, not to address the issue that concerned the Heads of Government of Britain and France during their recent summit in London? It was a follow up to the St. Malo declaration by the Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, to the effect that Britain saw the necessity for some kind of defence capability within the aegis of the EU, a defence and security capability that would be able to operate in a crisis, in areas such as Kosovo and beyond. We know that such crises will not go away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that the two Governments will present a proposal at the Helsinki summit, which I will attend in part, to the effect that the EU will consider the establishment of either a 40,000 or a 60,000 strong rapid deployment capability within the framework of the EU? Has <Col N="60" /> he been comprehensively briefed on it by the Department of Defence, the Department of Foreign Affairs and his own Department? Is there any possibility that he might have a position on it? Will he talk about it at the summit?</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware, from my officials and from newspaper reports, of what happened at the summit last week. I was not asked any questions here on the matter and that is why I did not comment. The French and the British are considering something similar to KFOR, namely a readily available task force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>No. They propose that the EU should have it, not them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct, although they have not made it yet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not that the French, British or Germans would have this force but that the EU would.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly. The concern is to have a defence capability under the Petersberg Tasks on a permanent basis to overcome prolonged time delays. That is the basis of the proposal. The two Governments are also concerned with other issues, which they maintain are within the Petersberg Tasks, to allow for flexibility and a co-ordinated administrative effort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>What is our position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We must await the proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the briefings?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Prime Minister Blair's office has contacted us to say he wishes to discuss this with me when we will be dealing with other matters later this week. I look forward to his views. The attempt to create KFOR resulted in great administrative and military difficulties. There is a belief that these could be streamlined.</P>
      <P>However, I wonder about other aspects. It appears the French have desires to create a major air capacity where capacity is at present used by the US. I have only heard vague reports about that. When the French Minister for European Affairs and French officials recently visited Dublin they did not mention it. I will await what is said on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy John Bruton and I have had experiences similar to those of the Taoiseach &ndash; Deputy Bruton's are identical &ndash; on the question of briefing on forthcoming European summits. The expertise in the Department of Foreign Affairs is such that the Taoiseach gets briefing on everything, including on matters that might not arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>They are against everything.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="61" />
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I put it to the Taoiseach that he has on his desk, or it is available to him, a comprehensive briefing on the exact nature of the British and French proposals and what the possible positions of the Irish might be in anticipation of what may be said. Given this, it is disingenuous for the Taoiseach to say he has not heard the proposal. That is a debating point and by his reaction I believe he has conceded it.</P>
      <P>Given that this is a debate which has started within the European Union, it is a debate on which there are different points of view and it will not go away. Unlike the catastrophe over PfP and that debate, will the Taoiseach and the Government initiate debate and tell the rest of the people what precisely is being discussed and, more importantly, what is the formal Government position? I know there is a draft position outlined in the Taoiseach's speaking notes because I know the system. Can he not come forward and, without a commitment on the final decision he will make, because it is far too premature for that, tell us at least what is the briefing position, what are the options and what perhaps at this stage might be his likely preference?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course I am briefed. I did not say that I was not. Other than people trying to drum up PfP in some politically motivated way and in total defiance of their own views, I do not consider that there was a catastrophe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate was a catastrophe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>People were just trying to turn it into a thing which would whip up a few votes for themselves by appealing to the lowest common denominator, as with any serious issue. That is my view of that issue, but it is over and unfortunately those people who had views on it did not really try to attempt to debate it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Nor did he.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The view on this issue is that nobody is quite certain of the reaction of the French. I think I know Prime Minister Blair's viewpoint. He had to take on an enormous responsibility to try to get the KFOR mission up and running and, although it was meant to be a NATO mission before it moved to a UN mandate, there were an enormous amount of difficulties. He and the French would like to attempt to streamline that. They are acting at this stage outside of what is on the agenda for the EU. The official position is that there is not a proposal at present before the European Council incorporating a mutual defence guarantee into the EU <Col N="62" /> Treaty or any proposal as the basis of the French&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy asked for the briefing which I get from the Department of Foreign Affairs because he said he knows the system. I want to give him that.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to answer, if I may, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, because he asked me about the briefing note and, as he said he knows the system, I just want to give him what the system will tell him. The current debate on European security and defence, which is being conducted on the basis of the Treaty of Amsterdam and the outcome of the European Council, has a clear focus on the Petersberg Tasks of peacekeeping and crisis management and not on the collective defence guarantees, and both the Treaty of Amsterdam and the Cologne decisions reiterate that the specific character of the security and defence policy of certain member states shall not be prejudiced and that provision takes account of our policy of military neutrality and that of other states who are not in an alliance or who are not members of NATO or the Western European Union. That is the official position.</P>
      <P>However, I will wait. I raised these matters yesterday with the Finnish Prime Minister, Mr. Lipponen. Mr. Blair wants to outline his proposal to me and I will listen to what he has to say.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Taoiseach referred to people trying to whip up a few votes for themselves in this area, did he have his own party in mind when it promised a referendum on PfP which it had no intention of having?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to that is &ldquo;no&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have had the Deputy's party in mind as the leading candidate for whipping up votes on this issue. To clarify what exactly is the Government's policy on the defence of Europe, in what respect does the Taoiseach disagree with the position taken by the late Seán Lemass, which was to the effect that if European political union was created, he, Seán Lemass, would have been willing to envisage Ireland taking part in the defence of that political union? <Col N="63" /> Does the Taoiseach agree or disagree with the position taken by Seán Lemass on that matter?</P>
      <P>Is it not the case that the Petersberg Tasks include, in effect, peace enforcement? How does the Taoiseach theoretically and practically distinguish peace enforcement from war-making? What is the difference? If Ireland, in the context of the EU, is willing to undertake duties including Petersberg Tasks' peace enforcement, is it in effect the case that Ireland is not only willing to take part in European defence but may in fact be willing to take part in military operations of a peace enforcement character even outside the EU's boundaries?</P>

      <P>Deputy Bruton asked me about the position taken by Seán Lemass. At the time Seán Lemass spoke on these issues Ireland was not a member of the European Community. It was during the early stage of discussions. What he said was that if we went into the European Community we would have to take responsibilities and if there were peacekeeping missions, we would have to involve ourselves in those missions. I do not believe he ever envisaged us moving outside the European boundaries to participate in any kind of conflict resolution. I do not think that was ever envisaged and I do not believe it is now either. Perhaps what has changed now is that there is a view that the European Community would involve itself internally in countries rather than country to country, which was the position for a long time. That has happened in Kosovo and it will happen in other places too where fundamental rights are not being adhered to.</P>
      <P>The Irish position on these matters is that we are following a policy of military neutrality. We are not in an alliance and we are not members of NATO or the Western European Union. I see PfP as an entirely different thing. I see it as an area where we co-operate. We co-operate in KFOR and SFOR. We also co-operate in other areas with NATO people but under a UN mandate. The line for us here is how a UN mandate works and I would have grave reservations, as I have stated many times in Europe, here and in other places, if we are moving to a situation where there will be an entirely independent set-up apart from NATO. Already there is concern about that. Some countries want that but is not what I want.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We were the first country to send people to many locations. We sent our people to East Timor. We have had people in the most dangerous position for 26 years in the Middle East. We are involved in the transport unit of a very difficult mission with the KFOR operation in Kosovo, but that is under a UN mandate and not any other mandate. If it is to the advancement of Europe &ndash; which I think it will be &ndash; then the co-ordination of, and co-operation with, those military missions will <Col N="65" /> develop. There may well be a military committee and the Foreign and Defence Ministers have already met to organise that. That is the way it will develop but it must be done under the Petersberg Tasks. There is an enormous difference between the Petersberg Tasks and aggressive tasks. That is a distinction which I think&mdash;</P>

      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree that basing any policy on the subjective motivation of the policy makers is so elastic as to be meaningless? Is it not the case that every war in history was undertaken by people who had some sense of victimisation before they attacked? Even Hitler succeeded in having a guard killed on the border with Danzig in order to justify his attack on Poland in the Second World War. People will always claim their motivations are perfect, but surely any defence policy has to be based on something more robust than motivation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a question. A distinction between the Petersberg Tasks and war-making has to be based on something more robust than motivation which is inherently elastic and capable of being manipulated. Will the Taoiseach tell me why he is against the idea of Europe having a defence capacity of its own, independent of NATO? What is the Taoiseach's affection for NATO that he wants the Americans to defend Europe rather than Europeans? Surely we cannot rely on Jesse Helms and his like to provide defence for Europe into the next millennium. Is the defence of Europe to be perpetually dependent on the vagaries of Tennessee politics? Do we want to hand the whole thing over to the Americans, lock, stock and barrel? I do not have that level of confidence in the Americans.</P>

Two of those prime players, France and Britain, have tabled a joint paper which would have been inconceivable given the transatlantic London-Washington alliance that existed since 1940. The security debate was characterised by Tony Blair's speech in St. Malo a year ago and was reiterated and enlarged upon at the Anglo-French summit last week. Does the Taoiseach accept this debate will be a dominant component of the Helsinki summit, either on the margins or across the dinner table, and that it will not go away? Does he believe, or does the Fianna Fáil <Col N="67" /> Party have a view, that if we do not choose to engage in that debate and put our own shape and contribution on it, as one of the four neutral member states &ndash; of which I am proud Ireland is one, along with Austria, Sweden and Finland &ndash; we will remain with the choice that Irish troops serving with the UN mandate under KFOR or SFOR will be under the vagaries of an American general?

We are trying to find out what is the Government's position, if any, on a debate that, I accept, is changing by the week. We should have that debate in the House and elsewhere. The Taoiseach should engage in reality and lead that debate in order to open up the discussion.

      <P>Deputy Quinn obviously read last week that the French and the British issued a paper and he thinks that started the debate. However, this debate has been going on for as long as I have been on the European Council. The main issues for the Helsinki Council meeting are EU enlargement &ndash; which has taken up most of the time &ndash; as well as taxation and employment. It looks as if this issue will be discussed either at the summit lunch or dinner. The Deputy's view that this matter will be a major part of the summit debate is incorrect. The Intergovernmental Conference must also come under one of those topics and, therefore, the security debate <Col N="68" /> will not be the major issue. To put the matter in context, it will not be a major part of the initiative for this debate.</P>

I agree with him that the situation must be better organised, and I said so 15 minutes ago. Mr. Blair had to stay up half the night trying to organise that. He thought there was a structure to do that but there was not. From an Irish perspective, I am still very happy with the UN position. We should not go into an area that does not have the UN mandate. I do not want to see us moving into an alliance with either NATO or the Western European Union. That is my position. People might not like it, Deputy Bruton hates it, but that is my position.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, a full affidavit setting out the grounds for the appeal to the High Court against the Information Commissioner's decision on this matter has been lodged with the High Court. This deals in detail with matters relating to the application of both the Freedom of Information Act and the Education Act. Given that the matter is now before the court, it would be inappropriate and unpro<Col N="72" /> ductive for the House to seek to rehearse the legal arguments which will be considered.</P>
      <P>As I have stated on a number of occasions, the basic reason for appealing the commissioner's decision is that I believe the impact of publishing the league tables which have been sought would be damaging to the achievement of important educational goals. The most important of these is that we have a school system, all parts of which value and work with all students, not just the academically gifted. League tables would establish an artificial basis for comparing schools which would, inevitably, limit school choice and unduly skew activities within schools towards achievement on a narrow range of programmes. I am advised that we have strong grounds for believing the provisions of the Acts support a refusal to make available information on the basis of such concerns.</P>
      <P>Schools, and the communities from which they draw their students, differ greatly across a wide range of social and economic factors. League tables, in my view, do not tell us in any meaningful way about the achievement of schools, they do not compare like with like and they may discourage schools from seeking to work with children who are weaker academically, have special educational needs or who come from disadvantaged backgrounds. Overall, I believe that league tables can have a damaging effect on students and schools and undermine the possibility of making schools more responsive and accountable.</P>
      <P>However, our education system must, of course, be accountable. This includes giving parents the right to membership of school boards of management. It also involves collaborative reviews of schools that take account of all relevant factors and are designed to help schools identify and rectify problems. Whole school evaluation and school development planning are built on these principles. League tables are a distraction from the achievement of real accountability and result in unfair and inaccurate labelling of schools.</P>

      <P>The report of the working group which I set up last year to examine the rights, roles, duties and responsibilities of principals in primary schools was recently presented to me. The report was wide ranging and its recommendations recognise the importance of implementation being pursued in the context of annual discussions and the relevant industrial relations fora. There is a range of supports in place to assist principals in carrying out their functions. The middle management structures of schools developed in recent years enable the principal to delegate a number of functions to other teachers. In particular, many schools have access to secretarial and caretaking services, and I have recently announced substantial improvements in the level of assistance in these areas.</P>
      <P>In recognition of the need to improve the funding of secretaries and caretakers, I recently announced that an additional £2.7 million has been made available to extend support to another 650 schools, with a total enrolment of 90,000 children in the coming year. This represents a significant advance and one which was provided for even before I received the report of the working group. There are various recommendations which impact on the terms and conditions of teachers which should, as envisaged in the report, be pursued through the relevant negotiating fora, particularly as cross-sectoral impacts must be considered.</P>
      <P>This Government has demonstrated that it is committed to significantly improving the funding of primary schools. We have already reduced class sizes and removed a large part of the fundraising burden faced by schools. As a result of the spending included in the Book of Estimates published last week, the next school year will see the largest ever increase in indirect funding of primary schools, bringing to 58 per cent the total increase in only three years. These improvements have benefited all schools and helped address important concerns of principals.</P>
      <P>I recognise the need for further supports for our primary schools and for principals in fulfilling their roles. However, these can only be introduced in the context of the full range of issues facing primary education and normal industrial relations procedures. I have recently held discussions on these issues and on the implementation of the working group with the partners, particularly the INTO.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for his information but I have a difficulty about the language used in his reply. Phrases such as &ldquo;so many schools&rdquo; or &ldquo;so many pupils&rdquo; will have access to a secretarial service does not mean much unless he is speaking about the three tiers of provision. This structure divides schools into those with less than 100 pupils, 100 to 300 pupils, and more than 300 pupils. There is not a secretarial service for schools in the bottom tier. In the middle tier there is £1.50 per student which would provide £1,500 per year for secretarial and <Col N="77" /> administrative assistants. There is also the top tier about which there is a specific recommendation in the report.</P>

      <P>I will publish the report. I thought it was published in the sense that we recently launched it with all the partners. It would cost much more than £5 million to do what we need to do. I have begun the implementation process. I acknowledge the Deputy's comments on the historic deficit in terms of administrative supports for schools and principals. We made a significant move at the beginning of this school year in terms of securing additional funding and we are working on the situation. The Minister for Finance is particularly sympathetic to the issue of administrative supports for all schools and we are pursuing this issue. We are in discussions with the INTO and we will speak to the other partners about the implementation of the recommendations in the report.</P>

      <P>No, it was sent to me in November, but we would have been aware of the issues. We made a move prior to the report being presented to me in terms of secretaries and caretakers. This was a significant advance on what existed. There was nothing there for years but we are progressing this issue. It is not for me to comment on decisions which others may or may not take over the weekend. However, given our track record on primary education since we took office, we cannot do everything. Rome was not built in a day. We have brought about a major reduction in class sizes and appointed additional teachers, there has been a significant increase in capitation &ndash; 58 per cent, significant funding for library books, a massive capital programme for school buildings and so forth. All of this has taken place in less than two budgets. We have made good progress and, sooner rather than later, we will make progress on this issue in consultation with the partners.</P>

      <Quest>the target he has set for class size over the next five years at secondary level.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will know this is a complex issue and that simplistic approaches are not in the best interests of our schools and students. Analysis conducted by my Department indicates a very varied pattern of class size across the second level sector. In general, senior cycle classes are appreciably smaller than those at junior cycle and the pattern across subjects can vary significantly. It is in the nature of some subjects that they attract a relatively small cohort while core subjects typically account for larger classes. The Deputy will also be aware that there is a large number of relatively small classes.</P>
      <P>At the root of the class size issue are factors such as subject range, school timetabling and individual school policy. While resources are undoubtedly also a factor there is no necessary link between these and class size. This is illustrated by the fact that schools with broadly similar enrolment profiles and staffing allocations can have quite different mixes of class sizes. To set targets for class size and to insist upon these being achieved could have quite arbitrary and unintended consequences for the education being delivered to students in individual schools. In effect, we would be curtailing local planning and insisting upon a uniform model of delivery.</P>
      <P>Let me be quite clear that in taking this approach I am not suggesting our schools at second level have no need for additional resources. On the contrary, I am on record as stating I want to see more teachers in our second level schools. This year has already seen the first provision of additional teachers for some years. Staffing has been improved by more than 500 posts. The average class size has been reduced to 22.3, with 20.4 being the average at senior cycle. The national pupil-teacher ratio is 15.1: 1.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our priority must be to ensure that the investment which we make in education operates to the benefit of our students. It was with this in mind that I recently established a technical group under the chairmanship of Dr. Seamus McGuinness to review the whole area of allo<Col N="79" /> cation and redeployment at second level. It is my intention that the work of this group will provide a valuable underpinning for the framing of allocation policy in the future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>We have different statistics and have conducted a detailed analysis of class sizes across the board. Deputies may be interested to know that at leaving certificate level, 9.5 per cent of classes have more than 30 pupils, in contrast with the 21.2 per cent of leaving certificate classes which have less than 15 pupils, which amounts to twice the percentage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the point. Citing simplistic figures is not the correct approach. We need to be more sophisticated in how we allocate resources in the forthcoming year. We need to combine what we want to achieve educationally by the allocation of additional resources with the maintenance by schools of local autonomy in terms of what they want to provide, curriculum choice, and so on. We need to ensure resources are targeted at the disadvantaged. I have no difficulty in making the statistics available to Deputies as they are interesting.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be useful. I wish to ascertain the Minister's train of thought. I will put the question differently. I am sure he is aware Europeans spend 60 per cent more per secondary pupil and our class size is 30 per cent more. At this time when we have resources, will the Minister provide them so we will be closer to the European norm of class size and support services. Is that the direction he is taking? Is he willing to set some five year targets as milestones on the way to achieving that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not prepared to set targets in that form. That is not the correct approach. I am prepared to allocate resources in a way which would help to achieve our educational objectives. Our key objectives at second level are to increase the school completion rate, provide students with the maximum curriculum choice and ensure schools have strategies to allocate resources in an effective manner.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">

It will give indepth consideration to this issue and will report in five to six months, if not sooner. This will provide the framework for future allocation policies. We will also consult with the partners. We often trot out average class size figures and the national notional figure of 15:1 but this can be meaningless in different schools.</P>

      <P>Primary school principals, who are usually fairly restrained people, have taken partial industrial action and if the matter is not resolved they will seek a mandate at their conference next Easter for more widespread action. Does the Minister agree the changes in the curriculum and the responsibilities placed on principals puts them in an impossible position? A principal of a school with up to ten teachers is a full-time teacher. We have gone over some of this already. As the Estimates have been prepared, will the Minister indicate how much of the problem he is in a position to deal with? Is he in a position to change the figure from eight to six or will there be a special arrangement for the third tier?

I felt people should have waited for the publication of the report and the beginning of a process. I can confirm we have begun that process and the issues identified by the Deputy will be dealt with and negotiated in that context.

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>For many years before my appointment as Minister for Education and Science, there were neglected demands for funding to be made available for the appointment of escorts on special school transport services. From the outset, I have accepted, together with my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, the validity of concerns expressed by parents and school authorities at the dangers to which special needs children can be exposed when travelling unaccompanied on these services.</P>
      <P>In an effort to address this issue, I secured funding of £3.4 million over a two year period to extend the escort scheme to every special transport route in the country. This allocation was additional to the £150,000 already spent annually on the pilot escort scheme which has been in place on 34 special transport services for some years. As part of this development, I secured approval to increase the payment per escort from £3,200 per annum, which applied under the pilot scheme, to £4,995. I secured these resources on the basis of the valid concerns expressed to me by both parents and school authorities and my deep concerns about the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="82" /> I also took the view, which I still hold, that the most appropriate people to operate the scheme are the schools which cater for the children in question on a daily basis and know the children's needs and behaviours. This is in line with the arrangements under the pilot scheme. I assure the House that I appreciate the extra work involved for schools in participating in this scheme. I also recognise the concerns and reservations which some individual schools have expressed at taking on responsibility for the escort scheme. While I appreciate that these concerns are validly held, the pilot escort service which has operated for a number of years has not presented the difficulties which are now being raised by some schools.</P>
    <P>While I am somewhat disappointed at the inflexible stance which certain schools are adopting in relation to this matter, I wish to take this opportunity to acknowledge the commitment shown by those schools which are going ahead and appointing their escorts. I have already had discussions with the national association of boards of management in special education in relation to concerns raised by some schools. I am pleased the association has been extremely positive in welcoming the funding made available and has expressed its wish that the schools involved should participate in the scheme.</P>
    <P>Officials of my Department are in ongoing discussions with the association in an effort to resolve outstanding difficulties. I assure the House that my Department is making every effort to facilitate a resolution of this matter. I hope that substantial progress can be made so that escorts will be put in place on the remaining services as soon as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister put in place guidelines and procedures for the appointment of these escorts? Who will be liable if a case is taken against these escorts? What consultation, if any, did the Minister have with these bodies prior to the allocation of the £3.4 million? Is he aware that bus operators are threatening strike action because of the implications of not having these escorts in place? People fear that pupils could open the door and fall from buses travelling at 50 miles per hour. The Minister is not willing to implement this service irrespective of the allegations of abuse and so on at present. What discussions has the Minister's Department had with Bus Éireann on this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course I am interested in implementing this service. For ten or 15 years, everyone involved thought it a great scandal that children with special needs were allowed on buses without escorts. I agree it was a scandal, the money was not sufficient and the problem should have been dealt with much earlier. I suspect if I merely extended the pilot scheme there would not have been an outcry. If I said I was extending the pilot scheme to another 150 schools, there would probably have been 300 applications. <Col N="83" /> There would have been no objections and everyone would have participated.</P>
      <P>Prior to last year's budget I discussed this issue with the Minister for Finance. He believed that the resources for this service should be made available, and he did so. The Department is not in a position to administer this scheme in each school on every route, nor would it be desirable. Neither is it desirable that bus operators should administer the scheme. The schools are closest to the families and the children, and they know the children best. I am conscious of the issues raised by the Deputy. For example, in many cases the grants exceed the amount required in terms of the number of hours an escort will work. The schools concerned have been advised to use the additional resources for administrative support in order to get the scheme up and running. None of these issues emerged under the pilot scheme. That scheme was limited to one in 20, therefore, one could assume that people were satisfied with the basic template established. As a result of the extra funding, we were able to extend the template to all schools. I hope to resolve any outstanding issues and assure people that the problem is not as great as they might believe.</P>

What amount of money was returned to the Department and why has the Minister not yet resolved the issue? Children attending school are being abused continually by other pupils on the buses.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 29 and 30 together.</P>
      <P>My Department already devotes a considerable amount of resources to addressing the problem of educational disadvantage across the education system. One of my concerns with the present support system is that it lacks the necessary flexibility to target individual pupils or small pockets of disadvantage within the school system. My objective is to develop a more flexible response system which will continue to support schools with large concentrations of disadvantaged pupils but will also be responsive to the needs of individual or small groups of disadvantaged pupils throughout the country.</P>
      <P>Issues such as class sizes, staffing and funding can all play a role in our efforts to combat educational disadvantage. However, it is equally important that resources are properly targeted and that the component elements of any support package are specifically tailored to address the needs of the particular school or individual pupil involved. We need an approach which is fully responsive to the variety of needs which exist within our schools, whether such needs arise in inner city areas, towns or isolated rural settings. The needs of the children should dictate our approach, irrespective of their location or circumstances. These children have a right to expect that they be given every opportunity to derive maximum benefit from our educational system. I assure the House that it is my intention that they get this support.</P>
      <P>I will shortly be bringing forward a range of measures to complement existing support services and to ensure that no child suffering educational disadvantage will be neglected in the future.</P>

      <P>Has the Minister decided that in future no new primary or secondary schools will be designated disadvantaged? Is he aware that many schools throughout the country are preparing submissions on the basis and expectation that disadvantaged status is still in place? Will he agree there is a danger that schools are embarking on a fool's errand in this regard? If he does not continue with more designations, are there anomalies whereby people are just outside the scheme? Yet he is allocating home-school-community liaison teachers to those schools with the designation. There needs to be more clarity in this area.</P>

      <P>I have told them not to apply because it will not happen in accordance with the old scheme. We need a more fundamental and sophisticated approach to disadvantage and we will be bringing forward proposals in that regard. As I have stated, we need to concentrate the focus on children who are disadvantaged rather than on schools. We need to put the onus on schools to develop strategies and plans to tackle disadvantage themselves and allocate funding in accordance with that. We must target funding to areas of greatest disadvantage. Rather than a one size fits all approach, we will be looking at a more varied approach with different levels of allocation and response to disadvantage in different school communities.</P>

        <b>:</b> Does the Minister accept that the whole system of disadvantaged schools should be done away with? It causes a ripple effect. If a school is disadvantaged the one beside it is automatically further disadvantaged because it does not have the same pupil-teacher ratio. It can happen that a boys' school in a town is disadvantaged but the girls' school is not, although 80 per cent of parents would be common to both schools. If the Minister is saying it should be done away with, he will have my full support. I agree we should support schools that are disadvantaged but it should not become a status symbol to be disadvantaged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree but it would be difficult to take away supports that are already in place in some schools. What we are talking about is creating additional resources. However, I agree with the Deputy's philosophy.</P>

What mechanisms are there to look after such students?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>We are looking at the labels used but have not come to any conclusions yet. Even though we provide additional support in terms of home-school liaison and so on and remedial teaching for children under 15 years, the education welfare board, which will be established under the education welfare Bill, will be a fundamental pillar in terms of addressing the issues of those under 15 years who are in trouble in schools. That legislation will place significant obligations on everyone involved, most importantly the welfare officers who will have to intervene practically on behalf of the child to ensure he or she is provided with a programme of education or training that allows the child to fulfil his or her right to primary education and to education that leads to a qualification or certification.</P>

What resources does the Minister intend to put in place to ensure children can be identified at an early stage when they are failing in school for either educational or psychological reasons? Having a psychological service is one obvious way but what plans has the Minister to ensure disadvantage does not build on disadvantage in terms of such children?</P>

I made a commitment to establish that service when I came into office and have done so. We are currently recruiting additional psychologists. We will be ahead of the target set by the steering committee in regard to the establishment of that service and the number of psychologists we have to appoint. That is a key factor in terms of assessments and so on. Another is additional supports, such as remedial teaching and home-school liaison and also early education. The National Development Plan has made substantial funding available to me over the next few years to develop a solid policy on early education which is essential in dealing with educational disadvantage from the earliest years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated previously in reply <Col N="88" /> to a similar question in October, significant progress is being made by schools on the implementation of relationships and sexuality education. However, as I stated then, I believe that we need to continue our efforts to ensure that all children have access to an RSE programme that enables them learn about their own development and about their friendships and relationships with others. I will repeat what I indicated previously.</P>
      <P>I asked late last year for information on the level of implementation of RSE in schools. Responses indicated that, at that time, 24 per cent of respondent primary schools were already implementing an RSE programme and 57 per cent indicated their intention to teach RSE in some or all classes during the last school year. Sixty seven per cent of respondent post-primary schools are implementing RSE in some or all classes and 78 per cent indicated their intention to teach RSE in some or all classes during the last school year.</P>
      <P>The first step for schools in introducing RSE is to develop a school policy that involves school management, parents and teachers in a collaborative process. Information seminars have been held for parents at school level and for boards of management-management authorities. Policy development seminars and whole school staff seminars have also been held. In this regard, 67 per cent of primary schools and 68 per cent of post-primary schools established RSE policy committees last year. The implementation of an RSE programme in schools follows from this process.</P>
      <P>The process of policy formulation through partnership is a relatively new experience for many school communities. Many schools have found this process to be a valuable and rewarding experience in so far as it gave them an opportunity to discuss a vision for their children's education, enunciate a school ethos and debate the issues involved. I recognise that schools are at different stages in implementing the programme. The information on progress collected from the survey will enable effective targeting of supports. In this regard, the RSE training support service, with whom I am in regular contact, continues to monitor the implementation of RSE in schools and acts as a support to schools in this work.</P>
      <P>Senior cycle resource materials were issued to schools some time ago and it is hoped to issue the remaining materials for fifth and sixth classes at primary level before the end of this year or early in the next. I intend, early in the new year, to follow up with another questionnaire about the level of implementation.</P>
      <P>Given the nature of the process involved it is not possible to say when the overall programme will be completed. However, I am satisfied that significant progress has already been made and that this progress will continue.</P>

      <P>What strategy does the Minister propose to take if there is an inordinate delay on the part of any school in completing its pre<Col N="89" /> liminary examination in respect of establishing school policy? In light of other events taking place today, does he agree that in some circumstances this could be seen as a delaying tactic? Does the further agree that it is a pre-condition designed to obstruct the rights of children to information which could make them secure?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the Minister's ideological presumption that no other strategy will succeed, I presumed we were discussing the rights of the child, in an educational context, to have access to a programme dealing with relationships and sexuality. I see no need to hold a seminar to grant people their rights. The programme will either be put in place in schools or it will not.</P>
      <P>Let us be clear on the facts, a number of which, I admit, I may have missed. Last year a programme introduced by the Government was in operation in 24 per cent of schools. What is the current figure? Has it increased significantly? What plans has the Minister formulated to ensure the programme, which in terms of policy has already been approved, is implemented? It is fine to refer to partnership but we could be discussing this matter until the cows come home. Some people have been using that tactic to block every progressive initiative since the foundation of the State.</P>

I respectfully suggest that we have made significant progress during the past 12 months by steadily and progressively moving this issue forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A further survey will be carried out in January and we can return to this matter when the statistics become available. I take the Deputy's point that the programme may have to be reviewed at that stage, but the support team has informed me that it is satisfied with its rate of progress. The <Col N="90" /> solution is not as simple as introducing other subjects and saying &ldquo;Teach that now, will you?&rdquo;  Seminars and in-service training programmes must be put in place. The programme involves a substantive content and it must be delivered properly and professionally.</P>

      <P>Research commissioned by my Department in recent years through the Economic and Social Research Institute and the Educational Research Centre, St. Patrick's, Drumcondra, has shown that boys under-achieve relative to girls in the junior and leaving certificate examinations. At the request of the equality committee in my Department, the equality studies department in UCD has been engaged, since 1998, in a detailed, two phase quantitative analysis of performance of boys and girls in the junior certificate examinations &ndash; 1992 to 1996 &ndash; in all subjects, but with particular reference to mathematics. The first phase analysis has just been completed. The second phase of the work will involve an analysis of classroom interaction in the teaching of mathematics. I await the outcome of this study.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="91" /> Arising from earlier ESRI research in 1996, my Department commissioned further research by Dr. Emer Smyth of the ESRI on academic and personal development among pupils in second level schools. The research publication Do Schools Differ states that, as well as confirming the better academic performance of girls, that academic achievement for boys and girls is improved further when there is an enhanced learning environment within schools.</P>
    <P>The NCCA has an ongoing commitment to monitoring performance in the certificate examinations on a yearly basis. The evidence from the longitudinal study on performance in the 1996 leaving certificate examination, of the cohort who sat the junior certificate examination in 1994, indicates that achievement is a complex issue that varies between subjects, levels within subjects and between the two examinations.</P>
    <P>I previously expressed concern at levels of general under-performance in some subjects in the leaving certificate at ordinary level and I have requested the NCCA to pay particular attention to the needs of ordinary level candidates in the preparation and revision of syllabuses. I have asked schools to pay particular attention to the need to set specific attainment targets for all pupils in the context of school development planning.</P>
    <P>A common feature of under-achievement is early school leaving, particularly by boys before and after the junior certificate. The national development plan includes funding of £75 million for a school completion initiative to address this issue.</P>

      <P>In light of this information, does the Minister believe there should be a differential in the resources available to boys and girls <Col N="92" /> schools? Discrepancies appear at a very early stage and, in primary schools, basic literacy problems are far higher among boys than among girls. With his new approach of allocating money towards the needs of individual pupils, does the Minister foresee that additional resources will be given to boys' schools to tackle this problem?</P>

      <P>Is the Minister of State aware that the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation, through the Sports Council, has informed the vocational education committees that the focus for the distribution of the £1 million in funding should lie in the direction of sport and disadvantage and not on youth clubs and youth services? Does he agree the youth and sports grant is becoming merely a sports grant? Does he further agree, as Minister of State with responsibility for youth affairs, that the Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Sport and <Col N="93" /> Recreation, Deputy Flood, has access to more funding for the provision of youth services?</P>

      <P>I do not agree with that assertion. I am aware of the correspondence to which Deputy Naughten refers, namely, a letter from the chief executive of the new Sports Council which was transmitted to the vocational education committees some time ago. I do not agree with his view because some of this money is particularly for the youth section. Discussions took place between officials in my Department and the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation. Unfortunately, those discussions failed to resolve the problem and the Minster for Tourism, Sport and Recreation and I must address it. We have already held preliminary talks and will shortly conclude our discussion. I am sure we can resolve this matter. If we need help from Fine Gael, we will ask for it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my privilege to present the third budget of this Administration. At the mid-point of our time in office, and with two budgets remaining, it is timely to review the progress made and set a new vision and strategy for the future. Our broad budgetary objectives are similar to previous years. We need to sustain economic growth; reward work and enterprise by reducing the tax burden; promote a fairer society, with opportunities for all; and prepare for the future. While these broad objectives remain, as a society we need a new vision &ndash; a new set of goals. For two decades we grappled with the problems of emigration, unemployment and a crippling debt crisis &ndash; in short, the problems of economic failure.</P>
      <P>All this has changed. Rapid economic growth has transformed our society and this improvement is most evident in employment. In the past two years, the numbers at work increased by 150,000. Unemployment has fallen and is heading towards 5 per cent compared to 10 per cent when the Government was formed. Living standards continue to improve. These are clear indicators that our policies are working. Tribute is due to all who helped to bring about this transformation. In particular, I stress the role social partnership has played. The continuation of social partnership is a major element of our economic strategy and a key consideration in framing this budget.</P>
      <P>As a society we now face a new set of problems. Instead of unemployment many sectors face labour shortages. Unless addressed, these shortages will hinder future economic progress. We also need to raise the capabilities of our workforce. Progress is becoming more dependent on having a highly skilled workforce. The cost of child care has also risen dramatically. This places an enormous burden on people trying to raise a family and work outside the home. Despite increased prosperity and greater opportunities, there is a growing sense that improvements in the quality of life are not keeping pace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In our towns and cities congestion is increasing &ndash; undermining the quality of life for many of our citizens. House prices have risen rapidly. This risks putting home ownership beyond the reach of many young people and generating a new set of social problems. We must provide a first class infrastructure &ndash; better transport, roads and housing to improve the quality of life for all our citizens. Today's budget measures complement this longer-term goal. They must be seen in con<Col N="95" /><Col N="96" /> junction with last month's national development plan, which targeted more than £40 billion to develop the economy over the next seven years. This is a real indication of our commitment to tackle infrastructural problems.</P>
    <P>We must also ensure all our people share in the growing prosperity. I know some people can get left behind amid increasing overall affluence. Sean Lemass reportedly said that &ldquo;a rising tide lifts all boats&rdquo;. However, we should not forget those with only small and vulnerable boats &ndash; or none at all. Despite the reduction in unemployment &ndash; and the improved social conditions this brings &ndash; we must redouble our efforts to tackle disadvantage and promote social inclusion. We must also ensure our elderly population share in our increased wealth. The Estimates Volume I published recently outlines our plans to tackle our most pressing social priorities. I will add further to these expenditure allocations. Our vision for the future must include a modern and efficient public service. Here also new thinking is required.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Preparing for the Future</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>Strong economic growth has greatly improved the public finances. With a substantial budgetary surplus, there is scope for both higher expenditure and greater tax relief, but here again we must have a vision for the future. We must take care that what we are doing today does not create difficulties in a few years. One does not have to be a practitioner of the &ldquo;dismal science&rdquo; of economics to appreciate that economic conditions will not always be as favourable as they are today. We must ensure that we can maintain a sound budgetary position even when conditions deteriorate. Looking further ahead, we must ensure that we can maintain satisfactory levels of public services and pensions as the population ages in the coming decades.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Public Service Pay</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>We need to get away from the old system of public service pay determination which is based on rigid analogues and internal relativities. Is it not ironic that the new dynamic, buzzing, technology-driven, &ldquo;up and at them&rdquo; Ireland of the 1990s is handicapped with a public service pay determination system of rigidities more in tune with the Ireland of the 1940s and 1950s?</P>
    <P>We need a new approach which supports the modernisation of the public service, respects the unavoidable limits on public spending and meets the reasonable aspirations of public servants. The best way of doing this is to have a pay system which, instead of compensating people for agreeing to change, focuses on rewarding them for the outputs and outcomes delivered as a result of change. Only in that way can we expect to deliver good services efficiently to the public within an appropriate overall expenditure burden.</P>
    <P>The post-budget current expenditure projections I am publishing today do not include any provision in respect of further pay increases for <Col N="97" /> public servants when the Partnership 2000 pay agreement expires in the public service. Discussions on a possible successor agreement are currently under way between the social partners. Public service pay will be a vital element in these discussions. The Government is anxious to continue with the social partnership process which has played such a major role in the transformation of our economy. However, I am not exaggerating when I say the chances of negotiating a new programme will be determined in very large measure by the progress made on public service pay. As things stand, the Exchequer pay and pensions bill is projected to increase from £4,440 million in 1995 to £6,633 million in 2000, an increase of 50 per cent in only five years.</P>
    <P>
      <i>National Development Plan</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>The national development plan is a key element in the Government's strategy for sustained economic and social development. The investment of £40.6 billion is designed to ensure that Ireland remains competitive and that economic growth is shared more equally at regional level and throughout society. The largest share of plan investment is devoted to economic and social infrastructure. This reflects the Government's determination to tackle infrastructural bottlenecks. Accordingly, very significant additional capital resources are provided in 2000 in areas such as roads, sanitary services, public transport, housing and health.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to the full implementation of the plan over seven years. Implementation will be comprehensively monitored. Particular attention will be paid to the efficient and timely delivery of the major investment in infrastructure provided for in the plan.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Public Private Partnerships</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>The Government is committed to using public private partnerships in addressing infrastructural investment needs with the aims of maximising value for money and improved delivery of infrastructure projects. In the national development plan, public private partnerships are particularly focused on the economic infrastructure programme. Provision is included for £1.85 billion of funding. Precise designation of projects or parts of projects for public private partnerships purposes will be decided as the plan is implemented. If the aims of public private partnership are successfully met, the plan figure of £1.85 billion will be increased.</P>
    <P>CAPITAL EXPENDITURE</P>
    <P>Exchequer capital spending in 2000 will be at an all time high. The provision for capital spending next year is 26 per cent up on the projected 1999 outturn. This is the third successive year in which the Government has increased substantially the resources for voted capital expenditure. Between 1996 and 2000, voted capital expenditure has increased by 125 per cent. Housing has been a particular priority. Exchequer capital <Col N="98" /> expenditure on local authority and social housing has increased by 160 per cent since 1996. The Exchequer spending will be supplemented by expenditure from the local government fund and other sources bringing total spending on roads next year to £622 million; on water and sewerage projects, which are essential to the provision of land for housing, to £413 million; and on local authority, social and affordable housing, to £718 million.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Pensions pre-funding</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>Last July, I announced the Government's decision to begin to make provision for the increased social welfare and public service pension costs associated with the ageing of the population in the decades ahead. The Government decided to set aside 1 per cent of GNP annually for this purpose, together with a major tranche of the proceeds of the Telecom Éireann flotation. This is a prudent measure, designed to secure the ability of future Governments to maintain and improve public services as our population ages. Detailed legislative and other arrangements are currently being worked out. I intend to bring forward the legislation early in the new year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Review of 1999</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>For 1999, economic and employment growth was greater than forecast at this time last year. The general Government surplus will be 1.4 per cent of GDP. This includes a Central Fund outturn of £3,453 million. This forecast outturn includes provision for an additional £68 million contribution to the EU budget and an increase of £307 million in the assets of the capital services redemption account going into 2000.</P>
    <P>While the 1999 surplus will be applied to reducing our debt burden, the nominal debt level increased in 1999 due to a securities exchange programme carried out to ensure that Irish Government bonds remain competitive in the euro environment. This increase in the nominal debt level will be offset by reduced debt service payments for some years ahead due to the lower interest coupons on the new bonds. Even with this nominal increase in our debt level, our debt/GDP ratio continued to fall in 1999 and is forecast to be around 47 per cent at year end.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Economic Outlook 2000-2002</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>I am publishing today our updated stability programme which contains economic and budgetary projections out to 2002. We expect GNP growth over the next three years to average about 5.75 per cent, with inflation averaging below 2.5 per cent a year. Average annual employment growth of 2.5 per cent is expected with unemployment to fall to about 4.5 per cent of the labour force by 2002. The budget is projected to remain in substantial surplus throughout the period.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Budget Targets for 2000</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>Taking account of the measures I am announcing today, the budget targets for the year 2000 are <Col N="99" /> as follows: a general Government surplus of 1.2 per cent of GDP; an Exchequer surplus of £1,608 million; a current budget surplus of £4,558 million; and a capital budget deficit of £2,950 million. These targets take account of the pension pre-funding provisions.</P>
    <P>SOCIAL INCLUSION</P>
    <P>Partnership 2000 indicated that social inclusion would be pursued as a strategic objective in its own right and that the national anti-poverty strategy would be a central feature of the partnership. The wide range of targeted initiatives taken and relevant programmes developed over the period of the partnership, underpinned by an allocation of resources almost double what was promised, confirms this Government's commitment to tackling poverty and disadvantage.</P>
    <P>Today's budget will consolidate this progress and advance matters considerably in other respects. The policy is to ensure that the more vulnerable sections in our community share in the benefits of our successful economy. The needs of disadvantaged individuals and communities continue to pose a collective challenge for us and we will be rightly judged as a caring society by the adequacy of our response. In line with my previous budgets, the needs of the elderly, disadvantaged families and children, the disabled, carers and those who need to be assisted on the path to greater economic and financial independence were of particular importance in formulating my financial proposals, as was the need to expand programmes targeted on disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>SOCIAL WELFARE </P>
    <P>The social welfare improvements I am about to announce will cost almost £400 million in a full year, compared to £215 million in the 1997 budget. This is by far the largest social welfare package ever in our history, and many of the increases will be payable earlier than previously.</P>
    <P>Next year, total spending by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs will be almost £5.4 billion, or 20 per cent above the 1997 level. I am also announcing other social inclusion measures which will bring total additional social inclusion current spending to £485 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Earlier Date of Payment</i>
    </P>
    <P>In my first budget I stated my intention, over the term of office of this Government, to bring forward the implementation date for budget welfare increases to coincide with the start of the tax year in early April. The weekly payment increases which I am about to announce will take effect from the first week of May next, or four weeks earlier than this year, and I will complete the process in 2001.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Pensioners</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>The priority which the Government accords to older people was illustrated by the increases <Col N="100" /> given to pensioners in my first two budgets. They remain a priority. On this occasion, I am increasing the full personal rate of old age and related pensions by a further £7 per week. When the increase in the qualified adult payment is taken into account, a contributory old age pensioner couple both aged over 66 will receive £160.60 per week from next May, compared with £133.40 in 1997.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Weekly Welfare Payments and Qualified Adult Allowances</i>In general, other personal social welfare rates will be increased by £4 per week. For some time now, the qualified adult allowance has been set at roughly 60 per cent of the personal rate. I propose to move this to 70 per cent over three years, commencing next year. As a result, qualified adult allowances will be increased next year by a minimum of £3.80 per week, with substantially higher increases for those currently below 60 per cent of the personal rate. These rises are well ahead of the corresponding increases in recent years.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Child Income Supports</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>The Government appreciates that child benefit is an important financial support for families with dependent children and a key instrument in combating child poverty. The child benefit rate for first and second children is being increased by £8 per month and by £10 per month for third and subsequent children. These increases will raise monthly payments to £197 for families with four children. In addition, a £20 increase in the back to school clothing and footwear allowance is being granted.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Work Incentive Measures</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>I am taking a number of steps to further improve work incentives and to ease remaining unemployment traps. First, to ensure that the financial incentive for work is maintained for low-income families, I am increasing the weekly income threshold for the family income supplement by £13, which will increase by almost £8 per week the average FIS payment. Second, a tapered withdrawal arrangement of rent and mortgage supplement will be introduced for those returning to work and improved conditions will apply to those attending training courses and to part-time workers. Third, improvements and extensions are being made to the tapering arrangements for withdrawal of the qualified adult allowance where that person has earnings from employment. An additional 5,000 places are being provided on the back to work allowance scheme.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Bereavement Grant</i>
    </P>
    <P>We are all aware of the particular grief that families experience on the death of a spouse and parent. In special recognition of the difficulties arising for widows and widowers with children in the immediate aftermath of such loss, I am intro<Col N="101" /> ducing, from today, a special additional grant payment of £1,000.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Carers and Carer's Benefit</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>The Government recognises the significant contribution which carers make in our society and I propose to develop the supports available in this area. I am introducing a new insurance-based carer's benefit for people who leave employment to look after persons in need of full-time care and attention. This new benefit will be payable for a period of 12 months to those who meet the qualifying contribution conditions. Legislation will be introduced to protect fully the person's employment rights over the period.</P>
    <P>Last year I introduced an annual payment of £200 towards the cost of respite care. This is being increased to £300 from next June. The free schemes relating to electricity and the television licence are being extended to recipients of the carer's allowance.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Older People-Centenarian's Bounty</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>As well as the substantial rate improvements to which I have already referred, other measures are being taken which will benefit older people. These are a reform of the capital assessment arrangements applying to social assistance pensions and an extension of the free schemes to all persons aged 75 years and over. I have also decided to increase the centenarian's bounty for the year 2000 from £500 to £2,000.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Pre-1953 Social Insurance Contributions</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>Certain people fail to qualify for social welfare old age pensions, as insurance contributions they paid prior to 1953 are not taken fully into account in assessing title to pensions. It is intended that the Social Welfare Bill will contain measures to address this issue.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Other Social Welfare Improvements</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>A range of other social welfare improvements are set out in the<i> Summary</i>. My colleague, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, will announce the full details.</P>
    <P>OTHER SOCIAL INCLUSION</P>
    <P>
      <i>Health Measures</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>The Government is particularly conscious of the need to put in place the modern health service that the public has a right to expect. The extent to which the Government has increased spending on the health services bears repeating. Having reached just £3 billion by 1998, the<i> Estimates Volume</i> published recently provided over £4 billion for the Health and Children Vote in the year 2000 and after my budget this figure will be £4.2 billion. Thus, the level of health spending has increased by over one third in two years.</P>
    <P>The <i>Estimates Volume</i> already allows for substantial extra funds next year across a range of key areas, including £35 million more for services for older people; £23 million to child welfare ser<Col N="102" /> vices; over £10 million more each for physical disability, mental handicap and dental services and almost £8 million for mental health; and £25 million to commence a group C meningitis vaccination programme. We have also allocated over £23 million to deal with hospital waiting lists and another £11.5 million to commission new acute hospital units.</P>
    <P>These existing allocations also allow for the further increase in the income guidelines for medical card eligibility, which, as I announced last year, are being doubled over three years for persons aged 70 years or over.</P>
    <P>I propose today to add a further £64.9 million to these allocations to support the development of the health service in the year 2000. The additions, which have a full-year cost of some £105 million, include £12 million for the initial phase of the cardiovascular strategy announced earlier this year; an extra £7 million for physical disability, plus £2.25 million to ensure that all carers of children in receipt of domiciliary care allowance will receive a respite grant; and additional allocations for palliative care, mental health, child welfare and dental services.</P>
    <P>Other measures are included in the <i>Summary</i>.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Mental Handicap</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>Since taking up office, the Government has clearly indicated its commitment to the ongoing development of services to persons with an intellectual disability and their families. The development of these services has been one of the priorities of the Minister for Health and Children. The overall level of additional funding, £53 million up to the end of 1999, which he has already allocated to these services, is concrete evidence of his commitment to this disadvantaged group.</P>
    <P>However, more needs to be done if we are to meet the needs of this group and their carers. I share with the Minister a concern to be of practical assistance to both individuals with an intellectual disability and their families by further enhancing the overall level of residential, day and respite services throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I am, therefore, very pleased to inform the House that an additional £28 million, with a full year cost of £35 million, is being allocated to the services for persons with an intellectual disability.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Local Development</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>Provision for local development has been increased substantially in 2000 to £33 million from just under £17 million in 1999. This has been provided to augment the valuable work currently undertaken by the area based partnership companies and community groups throughout the country in implementing local action plans drawn up specifically to counter social exclusion and address the needs of people living in disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Environment and Local Government</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>I am providing an additional £5.7 million of capital next year to increase the maximum grant <Col N="103" /> under the disabled persons grant scheme and under the essential repairs grant scheme. This brings the total provision for next year to £18.4 million. In addition, I am providing an extra £1 million of capital for the task force for the elderly, increasing the provision in 2000 to £8 million.</P>
    <P>I am also providing an additional £5 million of capital over two years to fund hostel facilities in Dublin for homeless persons with drug and alcohol addiction problems. This brings the provision next year to £6.5 million.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Education and Science</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>This Government has shown an unmatched commitment to investment in our education system at all levels. We recognise the central role of education in both economic and social progress and have already provided for a major increase in education funding in the Estimates. Next year alone will see an increase of £385 million over the 1999 Estimates provision. The gross spend provided in the Estimates for education in 1997 was £2,301 million. Next year, the equivalent sum will be £3,244 million, or 41 per cent higher. On the current side, I am today providing an extra £17 million in programme spending on top of the allocation in the <i>Estimates Volume.</i></P>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>Of the £17 million, £3.5 million in 2000 and £10 million in a full year is for a number of targeted initiatives which will enhance the quality of the education services and improve equality of access for those who are disadvantaged. This is on top of education measures to promote social inclusion which have already been included in the <i>Estimates Volume. </i>I am also providing for significant additional administrative support and caretaking services in schools.</P>
    <P>An unprecedented increase of 75 per cent in capital funding is being made available for education services next year. This will see the largest school building and renovation programme in our history getting under way. Details are given in the <i>Summary.</i></P>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>TRAINING FUND</P>
    <P>I turn now to the issue of training.</P>
    <P>The labour market in Ireland is changing dramatically. Unemployment is below 5 per cent and is predicted to fall further. Competitive pressures are increasing and Irish companies have to respond, domestically and in the global marketplace. In this new environment, employers have to redouble their effort to raise the skills of their existing workforce and to attract qualified staff. Similarly, for those currently in employment, the concept of a job for life is becoming obsolete. The State and employers need to work together to meet this challenge and to share the cost of so doing if Ireland's current prosperity is to continue.</P>
    <P>We need a new funding structure to achieve the goal of improving skills and facilitating lifelong learning. I am therefore initiating a significant reform of the way training is funded. Central to <Col N="104" /> these reform proposals is the establishment of a new national training fund. The fund will be resourced through a national training levy payable by all Class A and H employers. The levy will be charged at a rate of 0.7 per cent on the same income base as employers' PRSI. This will yield about £120 million in a full year. There will be no additional financial imposition on employers. The introduction of the levy will be balanced by a corresponding reduction of 0.7 per cent in employers Class A and H PRSI contribution rates. Existing sectoral and apprenticeship levies paid to FÁS will be abolished.</P>
    <P>The levy will be collected by the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and will be paid into the national training fund which will be under the control of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. The fund will be dedicated to a range of training measures to upskill staff and give prospective employees relevant skills in response to the needs of business.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Structure of PRSI and Levies System</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>I am very conscious of the need to keep tax and levy systems as simple as possible. The PRSI regime has become complex over time, adding to overall administration costs in the economy. I intend to review the structure of the system with a view to its simplification.</P>
    <P>DECENTRALISATION</P>
    <P>Since 1987, 4,000 Civil Service jobs have been transferred from Dublin to provincial locations. The Government considers that the time has now come to start a further round of decentralisations which will involve, for the first time, the semi-State sector. The Government intends that the next round of decentralisations will be more radical than those to date. We intend to transfer the maximum possible number of public service jobs from Dublin. In pursuit of this policy, we will transfer almost complete Departments of State and other public bodies to provincial centres.</P>
    <P>CHILD CARE</P>
    <P>Earlier this year, the Government set up an interdepartmental committee to examine the important question of child care. The Government has considered the report of the committee and has accepted their recommendation that the most urgent task is to increase the number of child care places. I have decided to implement a major package of measures recommended by the committee to increase the supply of child care places significantly. These measures will cost over £46 million in a full year.  The measures are £23 million to expand the small equal opportunities childcare programme; £10 million for a grant scheme for child care service providers, caring for up to 20 children, towards the capital upgrading of premises; £2 million per annum for local child care network initiatives; £5 million to provide grants to schools that set up and run after-school child care services; £5 million for community <Col N="105" /> based groups to develop community out-of-school hours services and £1.4 million for the establishment of an advisory service by health boards.</P>
    <P>In last year's budget, I introduced a number of tax reliefs to encourage the provision of cre±che facilities. As I will announce later, I am enhancing some of these provisions again this year.</P>
    <P>TAXATION</P>
    <P>I will now deal with taxation matters.</P>
    <P>PERSONAL TAXATION</P>
    <P>
      <i>Total cost of personal tax changes</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>The total full year cost of the changes to the personal income tax rate structure that I am about to announce is £942 million, and a breakdown of the cost of the individual components is set out in the <i>Summary.</i></P>
    <P>
      <i>Introduction</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>Last year I announced the new tax credits system. That initiative was generally regarded as the most radical innovation ever in Irish personal taxation. This year I am proposing what can be regarded as an even more radical and fundamental change to the system.</P>
    <P>The net effect of this further initiative will be &ndash; over this and the next two budgets &ndash; to reduce the percentage of taxpayers on the top rate of income tax to 17 per cent, or to 12 per cent if the exempt cases on the tax file are also included. In simple language, the full effect of this initiative, if implemented in one move, would be to leave only 17 per cent paying tax at the top rate.</P>
    <P>To appreciate the magnitude of this move, it is well to note that 46 per cent of taxpayers would be paying tax at the top rate from 6 April next before today's budget changes. This will be reduced to 37 per cent for the next tax year as a result of this budget. I am setting out in the <i>Summary </i>the relevant numbers of taxpayers involved.</P>
    <P>Last year's radical income tax reform was designed to improve equity, to reduce the burden of tax on employment and to enable the removal of a substantial number of income taxpayers from the tax net altogether.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has given up on that idea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>This year I intend to build on this reform &ndash; to assist earners, reduce the level of tax for all taxpayers, exclude more on low income from the tax net and remove a large number of middle income earners on the average industrial wage from the top rate of tax.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Individualisation of Standard Rate Band</i>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>One of the main problems we have is the low level of income at which single people become liable at the top tax rate. At present, single persons pay the top rate of tax on earnings less than the average industrial wage. One of the main difficulties with the present band structure is that <Col N="106" /> the single person's tax band is doubled for all married couples. I am, therefore, proposing the radical change of moving to individualisation of the standard rate band over this and the next two budgets. This will ultimately involve each individual having his or her own standard rate band. As I have stated earlier, the effect of this change on completion will be to reduce the percentage of taxpayers on the top rate of income tax to 17 per cent.</P>
    <P>This year I am proposing to widen the standard rate tax band for a single person by £3,000 from £14,000 to £17,000 per annum. The tax band for two income married couples will be set at double this individual band, that is £34,000 per annum with transferability of the individual bands between spouses up to a maximum band of £28,000 per annum for either spouse. I propose to leave the married band for one income couples unchanged at £28,000 per annum.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>It should be noted that as the distribution of income earners is in the shape of a pyramid, the Exchequer cost for each thousand pound widening of the band lessens as one goes up the income scales. To illustrate this point, today's announcement of the standard rate band widening costs £310 million; whereas the full move would have cost £839 million.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Changes in Allowances</i>
      </P>
      <P>
        <i>
        </i>I am also making the following changes to the personal allowances.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The basic single and married personal allowances, which applied since last year at the standard rate of income tax, are being increased by £500 single and £1,000 married per annum, bringing them to £4,700 single and £9,400 married. When the PAYE allowance of £1,000 per annum is included, these changes will result in standard-rated personal allowances for single persons on PAYE or £5,700 per annum. This will remove nearly 40,000 taxpayers from the net.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Tax Rates</i>
      </P>
      <P>
        <i>
        </i>I have always made it clear, both in and out of Government, that I regard high marginal tax rates on income as an unacceptable feature of the tax system which, in the end, not only reduces the incentive to work but also adds to the attraction to some persons of not paying their due taxes.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, there can be no doubt where the Government stands on the issue of tax rates. We draw our mandate from the will of the people who clearly favoured the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats prescription on taxation at the last general election. As I have stated in my previous budgets, I will fulfil the taxation commitments set out in the programme for Government over the lifetime of this Administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="107" /> This year I am proposing a further cut in the standard rate of 2 per cent from 24 per cent to 22 per cent and a 2 per cent cut in the top rate from 46 per cent to 44 per cent. These rate cuts benefit practically all 1.2 million taxpayers in the State. These tax reductions mean that single persons on PAYE on the average industrial wage will see their income tax cut next year by nearly £20 per week; and a married couple with both spouses on the average industrial wage will gain almost £40 per week.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Tax Credits</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>My last budget announced the move to a tax credit system, beginning by standard rating the basic single and married personal allowances and the PAYE allowances. This year I am happy to announce that the full tax credit system will be put in place for the income tax year commencing 6 April 2001. Changes to certain personal allowances are necessary to accommodate the transition to tax credits. These changes affect the age allowance, widowed person's allowances, the blind person's allowance, the dependent relatives allowance and the incapacitated child's allowance. In order to standard rate these allowances, while ensuring no loss to those on the higher tax rate, it is proposed to double them in all cases from their current levels. These changes are set out in the <i>Summary.</i></P>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>Last year it was not possible to standard-rate in full the lone-parent's additional allowance of £4,200 per annum. As a result, £3,150 per annum of this remained at the taxpayer's marginal rate of tax. In order to facilitate the completion of the move to tax credits, it is proposed to standard-rate this remaining element of the lone-parent's allowance and, so as to ensure no loss to those lone-parent taxpayers on the higher rate of tax, to increase the current single income tax band which applies to lone-parents by £3,150. As a consequence, the standard rate tax band which applies in the case of lone parents, including widows with children, will be £20,150 per annum for the next income tax year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Deduction at Source</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>The move to tax credits will make the system more transparent and ultimately easier to follow. To simplify matters further, I am proposing that medical insurance relief and mortgage interest relief should no longer appear on the taxpayer's tax free allowances form but instead should be deducted at source and netted off against the premium or interest paid by the taxpayer concerned. I have asked the Revenue Commissioners to move to this deduction at source from 6 April 2001 and to make the necessary arrangements with mortgage lenders and health insurers.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Changes to Mortgage Interest Relief</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>In view of these new arrangements for deduction of tax relief at source from 2001 and to simplify the existing system, I propose to amend <Col N="108" /> the current provisions relating to mortgage interest tax relief. At present the maximum level of interest which can be taken into account for this relief is £2,500 single, £3,600 widowed and £5,000 married per annum.</P>
    <P>First-time mortgage holders are allowed to claim 100 per cent relief at the standard rate of income tax on interest paid up to these limits. I do not propose to change these rules, except to increase the widowed limit to the married limit of £5,000. Non-first-time buyers are entitled to claim relief on only 80 per cent of the interest but, even then, this is subject to a further deduction of £100 for single and widowed and £200 for married persons. Thus, the maximum amount of interest on which a single non-first-time buyer can claim tax relief is £1,900 per annum while the maximum for a married couple is £3,800 per annum.</P>
    <P>I propose to abolish the 80 per cent rule and the <i>de minimis</i> deduction for non-first-time buyers. They will be replaced by a simple ceiling on interest of £2,000 single and £4,000 married, with widowed at the married rate of £4,000, all of which will continue at the standard rate of income tax. There will be no losers from these changes and, indeed, there will be a considerable number of gainers. The total cost in a full year is £33 million.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Tax Relief for the Elderly</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>I have just announced an effective doubling of the age allowance for those aged 65 and over on the standard rate of income tax. I also propose to increase the threshold at which any person aged 65 or over enters the tax net from £6,500 per annum for single and widowed persons to £7,500 per annum and from £13,000 per annum to £15,000 per annum for married couples. This means that in my three budgets I have increased the income tax exemption limits for the elderly by up to two thirds. The increases I have just announced will remove almost 10,000 elderly persons from the income tax net.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The second Bacon report on housing last March recommended that the rent relief for under 55s be increased to take account of the recent trends in rents across the country. Accordingly, the rent relief allowance for those under 55 will be increased by 50 per cent from 6 April next from £500 single, £750 widowed and £1,000 married to £750 single, £1,125 widowed and £1,500 married per annum. The cost of this increase is estimated at £7 million in a full year.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Over 55s</i>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>In addition, I propose to standard-rate the rent relief for those aged 55 and over, which is currently available at the taxpayer's marginal rate, while ensuring, at the same time, that no person <Col N="109" /> claiming the relief at the higher rate of income tax will lose out. Consequently, the rental relief for those aged 55 and over will be doubled from 6 April next to £2,000 single, £3,000 widowed and £4,000 married per annum, and will be applied at the standard rate of income tax. Since 80 per cent of those on the relief are standard rate taxpayers, this amounts in effect to a doubling of the relief for four out of five claimants. The cost of this measure is just under £1 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Health Levy</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>As in previous years, the threshold for the payment of the health levy will be increased by £500 from £11,250 to £11,750 per annum, or from £217 per week to £226 per week.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Capital Allowances for Child Care Facilities</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>Last year I introduced a number of tax measures aimed at encouraging the increased supply of child care facilities. I propose this year to allow full 100 per cent cent capital allowances in year one for capital expenditure incurred on the construction or refurbishment or conversion of premises for the provision of child care. This effectively accelerates the capital allowances I brought in for child care premises last year which were claimable over a seven year period. The accelerated allowance will be available for qualifying expenditure incurred on or after today. The relief applies to all child care facilities, whether provided by employers or commercial child care operators and the reliefs can be used by owners of the facilities or by investors who wish to invest by way of leasing arrangements, subject to the normal tax rules which apply to such investors.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Profit Sharing/Gain-Sharing</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>A significant number of new and enhanced tax incentives were introduced in the recent past to help promote profit sharing schemes in the private sector. Various calls are being made in the context of the Partnership 2000 successor negotiations for the Government to introduce further profit and gain-sharing tax incentives to assist initiatives in this area which would apply across the public and private sectors. No clear picture has so far emerged of what form these initiatives might take or how they would operate in terms of proposed incentives. The Government is prepared to look at this issue provided that any such incentives are properly focused and justified, offer benefits to as wide a range of employees as possible, do not open the door for what may be costly tax planning schemes and do not result in substantial tax resources being taken up in relieving the remuneration of the few at the expense of the tax burden on the many.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Effects of Changes</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>This year's tax changes will remove 125,000 taxpayers from the top rate of tax and reduce the percentage of taxpayers who would otherwise have been on the top rate of tax in the 2000-01 <Col N="110" /> income tax year from 46 per cent to 37 per cent. The changes mean that all taxpayers up to and at average industrial earnings will pay tax at the standard rate. Examples of how the new system will work are set out in the summary. This new band structure is a fundamental change to the system. It will improve considerably the position of single taxpayers on middle incomes. For certain two income families, the doubling of the band will increase the reward for both spouses working.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Real Tax Reform</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>For many years, the phrase tax reform has been bandied about, but for most of that time, all we did was tinker at the edges of the existing system. However, the fundamental changes initiated by this Administration can be described as real tax reform. Last year's move to tax credits; this year's launch of a three year strategy on individualisation of the standard rate band; and our continuation of reductions in both tax rates will finally give us tax reform.</P>
    <P>These strategic taxation changes are a conscious attempt to remove taxpayers on average earnings from very high tax rates, which is very costly to achieve with the current structure. This real tax reform package is Exchequer costly. Neither is it possible to uniformly benefit all tax payers during the transition reform period. However, once completed and when the new overall structure is put in place, it will be relatively easy and less costly to focus and target.</P>
    <P>BUSINESS AND OTHER TAXES</P>
    <P>
      <i>Corporation Tax</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>The Finance Act, 1999, set out the schedule of corporation tax reductions designed to achieve a single rate of 12.5 per cent on trading income by 1 January 2003. The standard rate of corporation tax which will apply from 1 January 2000 will be 24 per cent on trading income as provided for in that Act. To assist small and medium-sized firms, I have now decided that the 12.5 per cent rate will apply from 1 January 2000 to the trading income of a company where that trading income does not exceed £50,000 per annum.</P>

The short span of that extension caused some disappointment and misplaced concern. I have decided to extend the current tax relief for a period of five years to April 2005, subject to one modification which is necessary to meet the terms of the EU Commission's approval of this relief as a State aid.</P>

      </P>
      <P>
        <i>
        </i>At present, there are two different systems in operation for taxing the investment returns accruing to policyholders of life assurance companies and investors in collective funds. In the case of the domestic sector, the tax is levied at the standard income tax rate on an annual basis on the investment returns at the level of the company or fund and the policyholder or unit holder subsequently receives the net proceeds tax free when the investment is terminated. In the case of life assurance companies and collective funds in the IFSC, there is no such annual tax. In the light of changing circumstances I have now decided to apply a common system across the board on the lines of the present arrangements now applying in the case of the IFSC. The new system, which will include an exit tax on the investment returns received by the resident investor, will apply from 1 January 2001. The details are set out in the summary.</P>

        <i>Mining Tax</i>
      </P>
      <P>
        <i>
        </i>Earlier this year I indicated that I would consider the case for taxing profits from the mining sector at the standard rate of corporation tax rather than at the 25 per cent rate which applies to non-trading income. The Government has undertaken to conduct a consultancy study on comparative tax and royalty regimes with a view to encouraging further exploration and mining. Consequently, I have deferred a final decision on this issue until the findings of this study are available.</P>

        <i>Capital Gains Tax</i>
      </P>
      <P>
        <i>
        </i>In my first budget, I reduced the rate of capital gains tax from 40 per cent to 20 per cent in the case of disposals of most categories of assets. The rate change affected four months of the 1997-98 tax year yield, and the entire yield for 1998-99. Instead of reducing the yield the figures are as follows: 1997 &ndash; £132 million; 1998 &ndash; £193 million and 1999 &ndash; an estimated £343 million. Need I say more?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The one category of asset that was left after my first budget at the 40 per cent capital gains tax rate was development land. However, to encourage landowners to sell land for housing, as recommended in the Bacon report, this rate was since reduced to 20 per cent for the disposal of land zoned for residential use or with residential planning permission. This now leaves only one type of asset still liable at the 40 per cent rate, that is disposals of development land for non-residential purposes such as for example road-building, or the construction of factories or offices. I have decided, therefore, for simplification reasons to apply the 20 per cent <Col N="112" /> rate to this remaining type of asset in the case of disposals occurring after today.</P>
      <P>In addition, where the holders of development land are taxed under the corporation tax or income tax codes instead of the capital gains tax code, the rate of tax that will apply in their case on the sale of land for residential purposes will be reduced to 20 per cent. I am introducing this incentive rate for such situations to increase the supply of land for housing. Further details are contained in the summary. I am increasing the limit for the capital gains tax retirement relief for businesses sold outside the immediate family from £250,000 to £375,000 to encourage the transfer of business assets to younger entrepreneurs.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Capital Acquisitions Tax</i>
      </P>
      <P>
        <i>
        </i>I have made it clear for some time that I intended to make substantial changes to the capital acquisitions tax system. This tax has increasingly shifted its focus from real wealth to becoming a tax on gifts and inheritances taken by persons of more modest circumstances who would not normally be regarded as wealthy or well off. Recent budgets have made major changes in the amount of capital acquisitions tax applying to business and agricultural assets &ndash; giving up to 90 per cent relief in both situations.</P>
      <P>It is hardly equitable that no capital acquisitions tax may be due on the transfer of a farm or business with a valuation of up to £1.9 million, yet a significant tax liability can arise on the inheritance of a modest three bedroomed house in our capital city.</P>
      <P>The burden of the tax on the inheritance of the family home on those beneficiaries who are subject to the low thresholds has become an issue of considerable concern and worry to persons who may have limited resources to pay a significant tax demand on inheriting what is in effect their family residence. This situation applies in the case of brothers and sisters sharing the family home, aunts and nieces in similar circumstances and those in family and personal relationships who, under the tax law, are treated as strangers. I propose to address these difficulties.</P>
      <P>The Irish capital acquisitions tax code is based on the domicile of the disponer as well as on the location of the assets comprised in a gift or inheritance. Many other countries base similar taxes on the rules of tax residence which is a much more common concept. One result of this present Irish tax arrangement is that it is possible for an Irish resident who has lived here all his or her life to avoid any liability on any gift or inheritance irrespective of its magnitude, provided the disponer is non-Irish domiciled and the assets given are foreign, for example, property located abroad or foreign currency assets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I propose to change the basis for determining liability to gift and inheritance tax from domicile to residence in order to bring it into line with the income tax and capital gains tax codes which have always been based on the concept of residence. Accordingly, as and from today, a liability to capi<Col N="113" /> tal acquisitions tax will arise where either the disponer or the beneficiary of a gift or inheritance is resident or ordinarily resident in the State. A liability will also arise, as before, where the assets in the gift or inheritance are situated in the State &ndash; regardless of the residence status of the disponer or the beneficiary. Further details are set out in the summary.</P>
    <P>I have also decided to radically restructure the rates and the thresholds for all three classes of beneficiaries and to increase the threshold for probate tax. On or after today the following rules will apply.</P>
    <P>
      <i>CAT on the Family Home</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>The family home will be exempt from capital acquisitions tax where it is either the disponer's principal private residence and/or the principal private residence of the beneficiary and the beneficiary has continuously resided in the house for at least the previous three years and does not have an interest in any other residential property. It will be a condition of the relief that the beneficiary does not dispose of the residence within the subsequent six years.</P>
    <P>
      <i>New Thresholds</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>I am increasing the particular thresholds as follows: Class I &ndash; applicable to gifts and inheritances from parents &ndash; from £192,900 to £300,000; Class II &ndash; applicable to gifts and inheritances from brothers, sisters, aunts and uncles &ndash; from £25,720 to £30,000; Class III &ndash; applicable to all other situations &ndash; from £12,860 to £15,000 and the probate tax exemption threshold from £11,250 to £40,000.</P>
    <P>There will be a new single capital acquisitions tax rate of 20 per cent instead of the current rates of 20 per cent, 30 per cent and 40 per cent and it will apply uniformly to both gifts and inheritances, instead of the present situation where gift tax is three-quarters of the rate applicable to inheritances. The total cost of these changes is estimated at £46 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Farmer Tax Issues</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>Turning to farmer taxation, I am increasing the current expenditure limit for capital allowances under the farm pollution control allowance scheme from £30,000 to £40,000 per annum and extending the operation of the scheme until 5 April 2003. I am also continuing for a further three years the two-thirds stamp duty relief on the transfer of land to young trained farmers which is due to run out on 31 December next.</P>
    <P>The flat rate of VAT which may be charged by unregistered farmers on their sales to registered traders will be increased from 4 per cent to 4.2 per cent from 1 March 2000 at a cost to the Exchequer of £3.6 million in 2000 and just over £5 million in a full year. The associated VAT rate for livestock will also be increased to 4.2 per cent from the same date.</P>
    <P>

      <i>Capital Allowances for Multi-Storey Car Parks</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>In order to encourage the construction of multi-storey car parks outside the Dublin and Cork Corporation areas, I am proposing the continuation of the present scheme of capital allowances for such projects for another two years to the end of December 2002, where 15 per cent of the total cost of the project has been incurred by 30 September 2000.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Capital Allowances for Business Cars</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>In line with the policy followed over several years, the car value threshold for business cars is being increased from £16,000 to £16,500 for the capital allowances for new cars and for the allowable expenses for all cars arising in the course of a business.</P>
    <P>
      <i>New Pension arrangements for the Self-employed and others</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>I want to take this opportunity to record the great interest that has been generated in response to the new pension arrangements for the self-employed and proprietary directors which I introduced in the last Finance Act. These changes have fundamentally altered the situation facing the self-employed person and proprietary directors at retirement. These consumers now have a choice at retirement as regards their pension product, thereby eliminating the forced purchase of an annuity. As I have indicated previously, I am not finished with this area yet and I intend to address some further anomalies in the pensions area for the next Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>MISCELLANEOUS TAX ITEMS</P>
    <P>
      <i>Revenue Powers</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>The faith of the taxpayer in the effectiveness of the tax system in identifying, pursuing and dealing with tax evasion has been tested by recent events. The Government is only too aware of the need to maintain confidence in the efficacy of the tax system in dealing with those who seek to evade their tax responsibilities.</P>
    <P>The Government has already acted decisively in this regard. The Finance Act, 1999, contained major and extensive powers to allow access by Revenue to records in financial institutions and to third party information on taxpayers generally, and gave Revenue greater powers in requiring the provision of information directly by the taxpayer. The scope of these new powers is perhaps not generally appreciated. These powers are already being used by Revenue.</P>
    <P>The Government has also acted in pursuing vigorously the various inquiries into certain companies' affairs using the powers under the Companies Acts. The relevant reports have been provided to Revenue, which is actively following these up. Revenue is also following up matters arising from the McCracken tribunal report. We established the inquiry by the Committee of Public Accounts into the DIRT affair. We have made it clear that the corporate governance provisions of company law will be strictly enforced to <Col N="115" /> achieve much greater compliance levels with regard to meeting the filing and return requirements laid down by law.</P>
    <P>I have acted already to provide the Revenue Commissioners with more resources in the specialised areas and skills involved in pursuing complex tax investigations. I understand that the Revenue Commissioners are at present reviewing the staffing of their Office and I will be prepared to consider requests which the commissioners, based on their experience and estimate of needs, may put to me in this regard.</P>
    <P>There is an ongoing determination on the Government's part to tackle this issue and to see those culpable dealt with to the fullest extent. The new powers given to Revenue, applied forcefully and targeted on serious tax evasion, will produce results and ensure that public confidence in the professional organisation into which Revenue has developed over the past ten years can be justifiably reinforced and sustained.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Tax Consolidation Acts</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>In recent years substantial consolidation of various taxes has been effected. I aim, however, to build on this significant record and I have asked Revenue to turn its attention to the remaining areas of tax law not yet consolidated, that is, capital acquisitions tax and VAT, and to prepare a programme of work to consolidate tax law in these areas.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Travel Tax</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>Ireland applies a travel tax on passenger tickets of £5 per ticket on travel by air or sea to locations outside of the island of Ireland. There are some limited exemptions from the tax. It does not apply to journeys within the State. The EU Commission has challenged the tax before the European Court of Justice on the grounds that its non-application to domestic journeys or to Northern Ireland is discriminatory under the EU Treaty in that it favours domestic journeys compared with overseas cross-frontier trips. Rather than extend this tax, I propose to abolish it with effect from 1 January 2000, at a cost of approximately £20 million to the Exchequer. I would expect that the operators will use this development to keep access transport costs low to benefit both business and tourist traffic to Ireland.</P>

      <P>This measure will also assist the elderly in visiting friends and family, including any holidays to the south of France. Concerns about the effects on health of smoking intensify day by day. It is necessary to send out a clear message about the Government's concern about the substantial health damage caused by tobacco consumption and to help persuade consumers of the very serious health risks they run. I propose accordingly to increase the excise duty on ciga<Col N="116" /> rettes from midnight by 50p per packet of 20, inclusive of VAT, with corresponding increases in other tobacco products. This will raise £132 million in a full year and add 0.75 per cent to the consumer price index.</P>
      <P>In line with the announcement earlier this year by my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, that the tobacco industry should be seen to pay for the health effects of tobacco usage, I am proposing that the revenue equivalent to this tax increase will be paid by the Revenue Commissioners by way of appropriation-in-aid to the Department of Health and Children to help fund the increasing cost of health provision in this State &ndash; a cost to which cigarette smoking adds significantly. I do not propose to seek additional revenue from any other excises. I have decided to cut the excise duty on kerosene which is mainly used as home heating oil, from £37.30 to £25 per thousand litres in view of the large price gap for this product with Northern Ireland and the trade distortion which that gap has given rise to in Border areas.</P>
      <P>Last year, I indicated that it was intended to take up the issue of green tax policy with the social partners in the context of the successor to Partnership 2000 with a view to putting in place an agreed policy in this area in view of the impact of tax increases on inflation and those on low incomes. My Department will raise this issue in the course of the negotiations which have just recently begun. For many years, the Government has given a tax concession for diesel fuel used in buses and trains. I propose to modify the existing excise duty rebate on diesel fuel, which is available to CIE and certain other bus operators, by stipulating that this concession will only be available where low-sulphur diesel is used.</P>

Surprisingly, the working group has not been successful so far in resolving the issues involved. To ensure that the initiative in this area is not lost, I have directed my Department to consult with the Dublin Transportation Office and other relevant agencies on the practical measures required to impose a straightforward tax on persons using any employer-provided car parking spaces in the inner city area of Dublin.</P>

      <P>The Action Programme for the Millennium, published last month by the Government parties, reaffirmed the 4 per cent ceiling on the average annual increase in net current spending. In 2000, the annual average increase in net current spending over the 1997 outturn will be marginally more than 4 per cent. This does not <Col N="117" /> include a provision for a new pay round or for other spending measures which might arise from a new national agreement. Adhering to the 4 per cent target in 2000 and in subsequent years will represent a considerable challenge which the Government is determined to meet.</P>

    <P>(a)This table shows the effects of the implementation of the Budget day measures on the pre-Budgetary position shown in the White Paper on Receipts and Expenditure.</P>
    <P>(b)The Budget Measures have an impact on the economy with changes in consumption and investment patterns etc. leading to additional tax buoyancy. It is estimated that this buoyancy will result in an additional £276.8 million accruing to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>(c)The net total of non-Budget day revisions (both increases and decreases) to the Estimates. The main change results from the delayed receipt of European Social Fund payments in respect of 1999 into the Exchequer in 2000.</P>
    <P>(d)The full Department of Social, Community and Family expenditure in respect of the social welfare package in this Budget is £398.4 million. In the year 2000, the total gross cost of the package is £231.34 million of which £138.06 million is funded from the Exchequer and £93.28 million is met from the Social Insurance Fund.</P>
    <P>(e)Departmental balances are those amounts issued from the Central Fund for Departmental spending in one year which remain unspent at year-end and are carried forward to be used in the next year. They have no effect on Departmental spending which is governed by the allocation in the Estimates for Public Services.</P>

    <P>Notes to Table 1</P>
    <P>Note that figures may not add due to rounding.</P>
    <P>Note 1.The projections reflect:</P>
    <P>(a)the impact of the measures announced in the Budget 2000;</P>
    <P>under the expenditure heading, an overall net current expenditure envelope of 4% per annum for 2000 to 2002;</P>
    <P>unchanged interest rates;</P>
    <P>(b)under the taxation heading a technical provision for further possible changes in both 2001 and 2002 in personal taxes costing 444 million euros in a full year &ndash; the level of tax changes in these years will be subject to review in the light of emerging economic conditions;</P>
    <P>(c)a provision for the cost of reducing Corporation Tax rates by 4 percentage points in each of the years 2001 and 2002.</P>
    <P>(d)a decrease in Capital Services Redemption Account assets of 152 million euros and 63 million euros in 2001 and 2002; respectively.</P>
    <P>Note 2.Appropriations-in-Aid are Departmental receipts which, with the approval of the Dáil, may be retained by a Department or Office to offset expenses instead of being paid into the Exchequer Account of the Central Fund. Details of gross voted Departmental expenditures are contained in the Estimates for Public Services. PRSI receipts accrue to the Social Insurance Fund.</P>
    <P>Note 3.Departmental balances are those amounts issued from the Exchequer Account of the Central Fund for Departmental spending in one year which remain unspent at year-end and are carried forward to be used in the next year.</P>
    <P>Note 4.The Government has decided to set aside 1% of GNP annually for the pre-funding of part of the future cost of social welfare and public service pensions. In addition, part of the 1999 receipts from the sale of Telecom Eireann and all of the 2000 receipts will be dedicated to this purpose.</P>
    <P>Note 5.The 2000 figure excludes the repayment of a loan of 127 million euros by the Insurance Compensation Fund which the Exchequre will repay to the Central Bank. This loan was advanced by the Central Bank to the Exchequer in 1985 for on-lending to the Insurance Compensation Fund for a 15 year term.</P>
    <P>Note 6.This is a contingency provision against all budgetary costs which cannot be quantified at this stage.</P>
    <P>Note 7.The 1999 outturn estimates are identical to the White Paper figures except in the Tax Revenue figure which is 2.2m euros higher due to the additional Excise receipts as a consequence of the Budget changes.</P>
    <P>Note 8.The figures for GDP and GGB values are the ESA 95 equivalent.</P>
    <P>
      <b>Measurement of Expenditure Increases</b>
    </P>
    <P>Current Departmental Expenditure</P>
    <P>With the introduction of the new Local Government Fund in 1999, 303 millions euros is included in the 2000 Estimates which is not included in 1998 and earlier years. To allow a proper assessment of the annual average increase in current expenditure, 303 million euros must be removed from the 2000 figures.</P>

    <P>(a)As shown in the White Paper on Receipts and Expenditure.</P>
    <P>(b)Departmental expenditure is net of Appropriations-in-Aid. These are Departmental receipts which with the agreement of the Dáil may be retained by a Department or Office to offset expenses instead of being paid into the Exchequer Account of the Central Fund.</P>
    <P>(c)Departmental balances are those amounts issued from the Exchequer Account of the Central Fund for Departmental spending in one year which remain unspent at year-end and are carried forward to be used in the next year.</P>
    <P>(d)Certain ESF grants expected in 1999 will not be received until 2000, giving a saving on Education, Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Health. The estimate for Enterprise, Trade and Employment also takes account of extra receipts from the new Training Fund. The estimate for Health and Children takes account of 168 million euros additional receipts as a result of the changes in Excise Duty on tobacco.</P>
    <P>(e)The above projections make no provision for the cost of any post-Partnership 2000 pay agreement or for other spending measures which might arise from a new National Agreement.</P>

    <P>(a)The above figures for 2001 and 2002 are NPC projections of the post-Budget 2000 figures (as set out in Table 5). These NPC projections are consistent with the Exchequer Capital expenditure portion of the allocations in the National Development Plan 2000-2006.</P>

    <P Just="Center">Explanation of net difference between Exchequer Surplus and General Government Surplus</P>
    <P>The Exchequer Surplus is the traditional domestic budgetary aggregate which measures Central Government's net surplus or borrowing position. It is the difference between total receipts into and total expenditure out of the Exchequer Account of the Central Fund.</P>
    <P>The General Government Balance (GGB) measures fiscal performance of all arms of Government, i.e. Central Government, Local Authorities, Health Boards, Vocational Education Committees, non-commercial State sponsored bodies, as well as Funds such as the Social Insurance Fund which are managed by Central Government Departments. It thus provides a more accurate assessment of the underlying fiscal performance. However, it does not reflect the position of commercial State sponsored bodies as these agencies are classified as being outside the General Government Sector.</P>
    <P>The GGB is calculated in accordance with ESA95, a consistent standard, developed by the EU to facilitate budgetary comparisons between EU member States in accordance with their obligations under the Maastricht Treaty.</P>
    <P>Details of the variation between the Exchequer and the General Government measures are set out in the table below.</P>

    <P>(a)This adjustment reflects the requirement, under ESA rules, that changes in the assets of the Capital Services Redemption Account and capital gains or losses on foreign exchange contracts, swaps, etc, should be excluded from the interest to be recorded for the purposes of calculating the General Government Surplus.</P>
    <P>(b)Equity and loan transactions are excluded from the General Government Surplus on the basis that they affect the composition but not the level of assets and liabilities. The proceeds from the sale of shares in Telecom Éireann, and the expected receipts in 2000, do not affect the General Government Surplus as this is treated as a financial transaction under ESA conventions and is not counted as income of the Government Sector.</P>
    <P>(c)Transfers between units within the General Government Sector do not affect the General Government Surplus.</P>
    <P>(d)This adjustment is required in respect of certain property transactions recorded on an accruals basis in calculating the General Government Surplus.</P>
    <P>(e)The adjustment for pre-funding of future pensions liabilities is made because the Temporary Holding Fund (which is due to be established in 1999) is part of the General Government Sector and transactions within the Sector do not impact on the GGB. Legislation is due to be introduced in 2000, which will dissolve the Temporary Holding Fund, and the balance in the Fund will be paid into two permanent Funds which will be established &ndash; a Social Welfare Reserve Fund and a Public Service Pensions Fund. It is expected that the Social Welfare Reserve Fund (two-thirds of the provision) will be part of the General Government Sector whereas the Public Service Pension Fund (one-third of the total) will be outside the Sector. The figure quoted above for 2000 includes an adjustment of 1.27 billion euros (one-third of the 3.8 billion euros) which is the transfer to the Public Service Pension Fund. It also includes the impact of one-third of the provision for pre-funding in 2000 (2.3 billion euros).</P>

    <P>(a)This table shows the effects of the implementation of the Budget day measures on the pre-Budgetary position shown in the White Paper on Receipts and Expenditure.</P>
    <P>(b)The Budget Measures have an impact on the economy with changes in consumption and investment patterns etc. leading to additional tax buoyancy. It is estimated that this buoyancy will result in an additional 351 million euros accruing to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>(c)The net total of non-Budget day revisions (both increases and decreases) to the Estimates. The main change results from the receipt of European Social Fund payments in respect of 1999, which will not be received into the Exchequer until 2000.</P>
    <P>(d)The full Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs expenditure in respect of the social welfare package in this Budget is 506 million euros. In the year 2000, the total gross cost of the package is 294 million euros of which 175 million euros is Exchequer cost related and 118 million euros is Social Insurance Fund.</P>
    <P>(e)Departmental balances are those amounts issued from the Central Fund for departmental spending in one year which remain unspent at year-end and are carried forward to be used in the next year. They have no effect on departmental spending which is governed by the allocation in the Estimates for Public Services.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will return to that point when I analyse the budget. The Government is now well into the second part of its period of office. It is the third of a possible four budgets being presented by the Minister. The Government has now served almost as much time in office as its predecessor, the rainbow Government, and has little real achievement to show for it. The Government in which I had the honour to serve &ndash; with Deputy John Bruton as Taoiseach and Deputy Quinn as Minister for Finance &ndash; left the country in great shape with unprecedented growth rates, rapidly declining unemployment, low inflation and a big balance of payments surplus. When we left office the economy was boom<Col N="133" /> ing and there was little doubt but that it would continue to grow.</P>
      <P>For the foreseeable future Governments will continue to have unprecedented resources at their disposal. The issue for Governments is no longer whether they will have money to spend, but how effectively they will use the financial resources at their disposal. The Government has the resources required to build a new Ireland, to raise the standard of living of all our people, to lift everyone out of poverty, to provide proper inclusive health care and education services, and to provide the physical infrastructure of a modern economy.</P>
      <P>In the past, Governments could explain away their failure by claiming they suffered from a lack of resources. This excuse is now redundant and Governments in future &ndash; and this Government in particular &ndash; will be measured not by what they give but by how they use resources to create a fairer more inclusive nation where growth and prosperity are sustained and where the fruits of economic growth are used to enhance and improve the quality of life of all our people. The issues now are the competence and effectiveness of the Government and I will judge the budget on that basis.</P>
      <P>I now turn to the only radical element in the budget which concerns the income tax proposals. Fine Gael published its income tax proposals last September and, initially, I would like to measure them against what the Minister has done today. We said it was illogical to tax the minimum wage and that if policy makers decided that people needed £170 a week to live on, it was folly to take back a quarter of it by way of income tax. We advocated this very strongly and I thought we had impressed the Minister with the strength of our argument. We thought, when our proposals were supported by the Congress of Trade Unions, that the Minister would use the bulk of the resources at his disposal to take people completely out of the tax net. Instead, he failed at the first fence and has just moved the amount of money exempt from tax per week from £100 to £110. That is a long way from the minimum wage, which the Minister will introduce in a few months. It will take another £65 or £66 to remove the minimum wage from the tax net. That is a basic and fundamental flaw in this budget. The resources which should have been dedicated to people on very low incomes have been dissipated elsewhere.</P>

      <P>Fine Gael's second proposal was to extend the standard rate band to £17,500, just above the average wage, and to double that to £35,000 for married persons. The Minister has brought forward a more radical proposal than that. He has extended the range of the standard rate band to £17,000, but he has decided to individualise it. The current Attorney General once said that the choice facing his party was to be radical or redundant. This is radical, but it is also <Col N="134" /> possibly redundant because I cannot see how it is constitutional.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot see how this squares with the findings in the Murphy case. It is socially divisive, blindingly unfair and discriminates against one income families where a mother stays at home to look after her children.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>The tax system should reflect the real cost of a second spouse going to work. That option was open to the Minister by increasing the PAYE allowance. However, the provision that one family will pay the higher rate of tax when it exceeds an income of £28,000, but another family will only pay the higher rate of tax when it exceeds an income of £34,000, is socially divisive, blindingly unfair and probably unconstitutional. I would like to see the advice.</P>
      <P>That is the present position. However, the Minister went on to say that he will individualise the standard rate band at £28,000 over the next three years. Therefore, when we bring it forward, the one income family will go on the higher rate band when it passes £28,000 but, when this is fully implemented and fully individualised, the two income family will not go on the higher rate band until it reaches a gross income of £56,000. This is where we are going in three years' time.</P>
      <P>One might say there is not much difference between £28,000 and £34,000 and that it takes into account the cost of a second spouse going to work. However, if we take it forward to the full implementation of the Minister's plan we see that, under the policy the Minister has now stated, the differential after the third budget will no longer be £6,000 but the difference between £28,000 and £56,000. That is unfair and will be difficult to stand up in court. More importantly, allowing the transfer of the individual standardised bands between spouses is separating in order to bring together again, and the Minister is not being clear-cut about it. The Minister will have a major legal difficulty with this.</P>
      <P>He might say that he will not standardise it at £28,000 but will increase the £28,000 level to £35,000. However, because he is individualising it, if he standardises it at £35,000 he will have to double it for couples who are both earning to £70,000. This proposal is a very radical one but it will be very unfair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a major departure from what I understood to be the principles on which Fianna Fáil was founded and those frequently expressed by its founding father, Éamon de Valera. I thought it was the party of the family and the party which supported the woman who stayed at home to mind her children. I did not think it would involve <Col N="135" /> itself in a socially divisive policy, designed to fuel the labour force by forcing women out to work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe in a taxation policy that encourages extra women to participate in the labour force. However, the Minister is going beyond that. It will become impossible for the one income family to survive if the current situation continues, with increasing house prices and the other asset inflation in the economy. The Government's policy is not to encourage women to go to work but to drive them into the labour force. The Minister is doing that in circumstances where he still has not made any adequate provision for child care.</P>

      <P>This is certainly radical but it deserves to be redundant. It is anti-family and I do not think it will stand up. The Minister can put a spin on its effect over one year. However, when the figures are projected forward and the individualisation is taken to the ultimate, I cannot see how he can justify, in terms of social policy, that where two families have the same expenses and the same number of children, one will pay the higher tax rate of 44 per cent at £28,000 and the other will not pay the higher rate until it reaches £56,000. I cannot understand how the Minister can present that as a socially acceptable policy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>The income tax element of the package in the proposal is very big. The Minister has dedicated £940 million to income tax reform, which I welcome.</P>
      <P>We, on this side of the House, are committed to social partnership. The present social partnership agreement, Partnership 2000, was negotiated by the people I mentioned previously, with the assistance of other Ministers in the rainbow Government. We would like to see a new social partnership negotiated. There is a trade-off at social partnership level between moderate wage increases and a generous tax package. The Minister had the resources at his disposal and spent almost £1 billion. However, he will get into great difficulty with his radical proposal, which will be an issue for social partnership.</P>
      <P>The Minister has gone too far. He could have achieved the labour force effects he desires by significantly increasing the PAYE allowance. Fine Gael proposed an increase to £3,600, which would be translated into an earned income tax credit. That would reflect the difference in costs between two spouses working and one. The Minister's proposal is certainly radical but it is socially divisive and we will be debating it for a long time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has insisted again that the tax rates are important and has taken 2 per cent off <Col N="136" /> both the top and standard rates. A more radical view of rates would be to introduce a 35 per cent rate and a progressive tax system. The difficulty with the tax system is not only the level of income at which persons are taxed at the higher rate, but the jump between the standard and higher rates. The jump is too steep. There is a 22 point jump between 24 per cent and 46 per cent. The Minister is maintaining that jump with the new rates of 22 per cent and 44 per cent. He has also failed in this regard.</P>
    <P>I hope this is sufficient to lever a partnership agreement because much of our prosperity is based on partnership. I also hope the Minister does not get tied up in a series of court cases, from which we will not be able to extricate ourselves for years. We have serious doubts on this side of the House about his principal proposal to individualise the standard rate band, so that a couple will no longer be treated as a couple but as two individuals who work.</P>
    <P>There is a basic change of philosophy here. This feeds into one of the undesirable features of the Celtic tiger, which is the increasing individualism in society. The sense of community and parish spirit is going. The Minister is now intruding between married couples. This will lead to conflict in many families with spouses saying &ldquo;Our neighbour is out working &ndash; why are you not?&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This is a serious issue of social policy which will be very divisive within families. From a philosophical, logical or taxation base the Minister has gone down a dangerous road. When he says he is moving towards tax credits I presume he is doing so based on a 22 per cent rate rather than a 24 per cent rate. This means that, instead of £1,000 of tax credits being worth £240, they will be worth £220, so the Minister is slipping a few pounds back by the date on which he is moving to tax credits. We will be watching for other such sleight of hand proposals.</P>
    <P>I am glad that in the socially sensitive allowances, such as the blind person's allowance and the incapacitated person's allowance, the Minister is reflecting the full marginal tax rate by doubling the allowances before establishing the tax credit. I advocated this measure last year and I welcome it.</P>
    <P>I am surprised that a budget which was signalled as containing revolutionary proposals on child care has been so meagre in its provisions on this issue. The increase in child benefit will be £8 per month for the first two children. This is an extremely low increase &ndash; it is only £2 per week.</P>

      <P>In his own family situation the Minister is still familiar with Pampers, Huggies and Comfies &ndash; items I left behind some years ago. One of my researchers told me that the basic pack of Pampers costs £7.99, so the Minister's £8 will enable the average family with one child to buy an extra pack of Pampers, Huggies or Comfies each month. This is a major step in child care.</P>

      <P>The Minister's proposals on child care are so meagre that the £46 million he is dedicating to this issue includes £20 million which was already in the Book of Estimates. When one removes this figure the Minister is doing virtually nothing for the care of children in this budget. His tax measures will force more women out to work so we will have more children in need of proper, affordable child care. However, at the same time, he is giving £2 per week in child benefit for the first two children and £2.50 per week for subsequent children, but doing very little on the supply side.</P>
      <P>The Minister is a great believer in capital allowances and the market economy. Capital allowances might build holiday homes in seaside resorts but they will not necessarily build child care facilities in housing estates where they are needed, whether or not they get 100 per cent accelerated allowances. There is a fundamental flaw in the budget because it is geared for individuals, for materialism, it is devoid of social values, anti-family and anti-children. The proof of that assertion is in these proposals.</P>
      <P>I am glad that the Minister accepted Fine Gael's proposals on inheritance tax almost in their entirety. We will comment on this during debate on the Finance Bill because I do not think it is tenable to place a time limit on the person who benefits and the period of their residence in the family home. This will lead to chaos. Anyone involved with taxation will understand the concept of principal primary residence. It is sufficient for the person to be there immediately before the disponer dies and to bear the onus of proof that the residence was their principal primary residence at the time of the death of the disponer. However, in general terms we welcome the proposals on inheritance tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The social welfare provisions in the budget represent a failure. I would like to establish a principle to which we on this side of the House will subscribe when we return to Government. We do not think that increases in social welfare benefits should be measured against the consumer price index but against the average increase in wages. That is a fairer measure. The budget increases fall far short of what is desirable and amount to about 6 per cent. I thought that, for the millennium, the Minister would at least take the contributory old age pension to £100 per week, but he fell well short of that mark. People on UA or UB will get a fairly small increase. There is no change in the carer's allowance or the criteria by which one qualifies for such an allowance. The Minister is introducing a new concept of a carer's benefit but he did not spell out the detail. We will listen to the proposal fairly and adjudicate on it in due course. However, in terms of children, pensioners, widows, the disabled and carers the budget falls far short of what we were expecting and what would be acceptable in circumstances <Col N="138" /> where the Exchequer is awash with money. The Minister had the resources, so why is he so hard on the poor, on pensioners and on carers? Why has this anti-social budget been extended into the area of social welfare? We were expecting an all out war on poverty but the Minister has announced fairly meagre increases for everyone on social welfare. In the case of the low paid he has moved another £10 of their weekly income out of the tax net. This budget is skewed in the wrong direction and this day will be remembered in Irish social history because there has been a major new departure by a Fianna Fáil Government.</P>

      <P>There is little change in excise duties and I welcome the abolition of the travel tax. The 50p increase in the cost of a packet of 20 cigarettes was well signalled and is justified, but is a departure from policy. We expect the receipts from this extra imposition to be used for health purposes. We have no tradition of earmarked taxes and I see no provision in the Budget Statement that this 50p is earmarked and will not just be subsumed into the general figures. I want this money ringfenced and I want the Minister for Health and Children to be accountable to the House for receipts and expenditure under this heading. If we are moving towards earmarked taxes then the proceeds should be dedicated.</P>
      <P>The 2 per cent health levy brings in an enormous amount of money but it is not used for the health services &ndash; it is gathered into the general Exchequer. I do not want this to happen with this 50p increase in excise duty on cigarettes. Deputy Cowen said he wanted this money to fund his programme against cardiovascular disease. This is important as this disease is the biggest killer, but cancer is the second biggest killer. I left a fully developed cancer policy in the Department which had begun to be implemented and money was voted for that implementation. Every day in the newspapers I read that cancer services are totally out of line with the European norm. It seems that as soon as the new Minister took office, the anti-cancer health policy was jettisoned. If any connection is imprinted on the public's mind concerning health it is that between cigarettes and cancer. If the Minister is using this money for the treatment of cardiovascular disease, he should also use it for the cancer programme. We should earmark this money so that we get real progress on these two killer diseases and improvements in the health services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are not any provisions in the budget to deal with hospital waiting lists.I cannot understand why this Government, with all its resources, continues to preside over such a divisive health <Col N="139" /> policy. Approximately 40 per cent of the population is insured. They have one health service which is as good as that anywhere in the world. The other 60% avail of the public health services and have one of the worst health services in the world. Yet, both services are, by and large, delivered in the same institutions by the same people. That is a real social division in circumstances where there are 37,500 people on waiting lists. The Minister did not provide any resources for waiting lists. He did not make any proposal to ensure a person will not have to wait two and a half years for a hip operation, that an old person will not have to wait two years to have a cataract removed and that one will not have to wait for a heart operation until one dies on the waiting list. People have died on waiting lists. I cannot understand a Government with unlimited resources not applying them to the basic needs of people. What is more basic than health care? A person has no quality of life if he is wracked with pain, waiting for a hip operation. A person has no quality of life if he has rheumatism in his hands and needs a home help to turn on the gas because he is afraid he will be burned. A person has no quality of life if he cannot see the television because he is old and has a cataract in the right eye and is getting another in the left. He goes to the doctor who says it can be removed in two and a half years. That is a great consolation if one is 78 years old. This is a socially divisive Government whose flaws are well disguised by the prosperity of the economy. However, people are not foolish.</P>

      <P>A great social revolution commenced here when my cityman, Donogh O'Malley, introduced free education. However, free education is not effective for about 20 per cent of children who cannot cope in normal schools. Any wise Government investing in the resources of <Col N="140" /> this country would target that 20 per cent and look after them with extreme care, while educating them in the mainstream. Not only would they benefit enormously but they would have an enormous contribution to make when their nurtured talents could be applied to social and economic life. Very little attention has been paid in this budget to social objectives, the disadvantaged and the needs of children who require extra attention from remedial teachers. We have a Minister for teachers but it is about time we had a Minister for Education.</P>
      <P>On the macro presentation of the budget, the Minister is clearly running a surplus. He and his successors for the next ten to 15 years will run surpluses without any great effort. The Minister referred to the danger of inflation. He projected that inflation rates at the year end will be plus 3 per cent, which is about double the European average. The Minister plans to spend a billion pounds a year more than the upper limit advised by the ESRI. There is huge asset inflation, not only in the price of houses, with which we are all familiar. The price of land is crazy. Any piece of bog or snipe grass is attracting enormous sums of money. This inflation is transferring to the building industry which cannot employ people to work on sites unless they pay huge wages. Inflation is also being fuelled by the fall of the Irish pound, in common with other euro currencies, against sterling. Inflation can be imported from the United Kingdom. I do not wish to overemphasise the point but there is a danger of overheating in the economy. There is a minority economic view from people outside our shores that our economy is overheating. The Minister must be prudent and continuously monitor what is going on.</P>
      <P>One of the novel features of the figures presented by the Minister in the Book of Estimates to which he referred today is the new pension fund, which, I presume will be debated in due course. It is a real marker of how prosperous the country is and how many resources there are in the Exchequer when a Minister can put aside £630 million next year for a pension fund and still show a surplus. Members do not appreciate the level of resources available to this Minister &ndash;  £630 million is plucked out without debate or discussion.</P>

      <P>There is one plank of Government policy which is now totally askew &ndash; its privatisation programme. The events surrounding Eircom in recent days have been disturbing. That ICC now only has one willing purchaser, the Bank of Ireland, is disturbing. That the TSB-ACC merger and flotation is at risk because of industrial relations problems is disturbing. The public has little confidence in the Government's privatisation programme and it will be reluctant to purchase shares if and when the Government decides to float Aer Rianta, Aer Lingus or Coillte.</P>
      <P>This Government has no vision of the future of Ireland. There is no overall picture, just a series of disconnected decisions and once-off projects. There is no underpinning social policy. This Government is reactive rather than proactive. Every week the Government must manage crises of its own making. Procrastination is the key note. The immigration issue became chaotic before the Government acted and the action it has taken is ineffective. The lack of taxis in Dublin is a farce and the proposal of the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, will not apply until next Christmas. The bulk of people who go out to enjoy themselves this Christmas will walk home. Nothing is planned or managed and action is not taken until situations become chaotic.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet looks more like an accident and emergency unit than the Government of the country. Even the little things go wrong. The millennium candles promised by the Government are found to be undeliverable, they will not fit in through the letter boxes. Mr. Haughey, fair dues to him, at least delivered the tooth brushes. The new millennium pound coin will not fit in parking meters in Dublin. People will park their cars, take out their money, it will not fit in the parking meter and, while they try to get old money for new money, like new lamps for old, they will be clamped and towed away. This is planning.</P>
      <P>The spatial plan, which is fundamental to the national plan, will not be available until the end of 2002, despite the dedication to this task of half a principal officer in the Department of the Environment and Local Government. This half a principal officer will take three years to deliver the plan. How can there be a national plan which ignores where people live? A spatial plan is not a very complicated concept &ndash; we need to find out which areas will grow as a result of Government policy, where will people live, where will they work and how will they move from home to work. This is what a spatial plan is about. Yet a national plan is designed with no spatial plan in sight. What type of people are in Government? This brings me back to the fundamental point that the Government has no social policy, it does not care about people. It is running an economy, not a nation and different values apply to running an economy. The lurch goes on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is lucky to be in office in times of plenty. If it was judged on its lack of <Col N="142" /> competence and effectiveness, it would have been hunted out of office long ago. Traffic is chaotic and the Government fails to take effective action; house prices are beyond the reach of most young couples and the Government fails to take effective action; public transport, whether by bus, train or DART is totally inadequate and the Government fails to take effective action; the health services continue to decline and the Government fails to take effective action; people never worked harder or longer and their quality of life continues to deteriorate and the Government fails to take effective action. This Government is on the slide and this budget will not arrest the slide.</P>

      <P>Two years ago he got off the leash and wreaked havoc. We all regretted it, as did the Taoiseach. Last year he got him back again, but now we all have lost him. Now, sadly, he is wreaking havoc and back to his old habits.</P>
      <P>I will deal in some detail in a few moments with the income tax changes announced today. There are times when the figures speak for themselves. These figures are taken from the budget documentation the Minister has circulated. A single person taxed under PAYE, earning £13,000, will gain £266 or 2.5 per cent of their income as a result of today's changes. A single person on £40,000 will gain £1,421 or 5.9 per cent, and for someone earning £50,000 the figures rises to £1,621 or 5.5 per cent. I see how the Minister for Finance might stand over these figures, but how can the Taoiseach stand over them? This is about as outrageous as it gets. We are taking the wealth of this country, earned by all of us, and giving it back to those who need it least. We are giving it back to those who are already wealthy. In my view that is an utter disgrace</P>
      <P>I am married and earn a fairly decent income. My wife also earns a decent income. We have no children. Under the provisions of this budget, we stand to gain approximately £2,444. If we had children, we would gain £997. Will someone explain to me the logic in this? We will gain £1,500 more because we have no children. If the Taoiseach can explain this to a married couple with one earner, he will be doing a very good job. I would not like to try to explain it. I will return to this issue later in my contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Prior to today, I thought this would be a difficult speech to make. Journalists, colleagues and friends have been saying that they would not like to be in my position opposing a budget in these economic circumstances. Needless to say, I welcome the solidarity but the sympathy is unnecessary because the presumption is basically wrong. It is also an interesting presumption, however innocent it might seem. The presumption is that in times of plenty it is impossible for the Minister to get it wrong. The presumption is that just <Col N="143" /> because the Minister has a lot of money to spend he is bound to spend it wisely and well. The suggestion is that in times of plenty there are no choices to be made. Of course, the presumption that underpins this is that we are really all the same. I reject this point of view. In the 1980s, we had very little scope for choice and very little room for manoeuvre. Now that times are so much better there is far more scope for choice. The choices may appear less stark but they are no less important.</P>
    <P>I have taken the view for some time that this piece of theatre we call the Budget Statement is little short of farcical. However, it is rapidly becoming more than that &ndash; it is becoming a real problem in that it masks the real decisions being made. A few months ago, in the middle of summer, the Minister made an important decision &ndash; a decision more important than any decision made by a Minister for Finance for many years which is likely to have repercussions well into the next century. He decided to set aside money now to cater for pension liabilities which may or may not arise in 20 or perhaps 30 years' time. Last week, we found out the true measure of that decision. The Minister is to set aside £2,999 million this year. Most, but not all of that comes from the privatisation of Telecom Éireann. As Deputy Noonan said, the Minister decided last week to add a further £582 million to that in 1999 from general taxation. Next year, the Minister will siphon off £633 million of taxpayers' money together with approximately £1,150 million from Eircom. By any standards, these figures are staggering. The Minister is setting aside in one year more money than he intends to spend on the entire national roads programme for the next seven years. He is setting aside in this one year the equivalent of £1,500 for every man, woman and child. I supported the Minister in principle when he made the decision and I still do. However, I am becoming more and more worried about how he is going about it.</P>
    <P>A few weeks ago there was a demonstration outside this House by a relatively broad-based group called Share the Wealth. They were looking for a slice of the £6 billion surplus which the Minister had. In the intervening weeks Members have received representations from a wide range of groups looking for a few crumbs from the Minister's table. Now we know where the £6 billion has gone &ndash; some £1.250 billion went back into Eircom to discharge the State's outstanding liabilities, another £1 billion went to early discharge of the national debt and almost £4 billion has been set aside not to be used for another 30 years. In essence, a large slice of our new found wealth is being swept away &ndash; it is a case of &ldquo;now you see it, now you don't&rdquo;. Not a single penny of that £6 billion will be used to improve the living standards of our people. The Exchequer has never been more flush but none of us is any better off as a result.</P>
    <P>The Minister has much explaining to do. I <Col N="144" /> would like to hear him explain to the 34 people who were waiting on trolleys last Wednesday for beds in the accident and emergency unit of Beaumont Hospital why they could not have a bed. I would like to hear him explain why there are 16 casualty consultants in this country when everyone acknowledges we need twice as many. I recently received a letter from a principal of a national school in my constituency &ndash; I am sure most Members have received similar letters &ndash; demanding to know why he could not have a remedial teacher in a school of 250 pupils. A few months ago I visited a day care centre for people with Alzheimer's that operates in a prefabricated building by virtue of voluntary help and a CE scheme. We have all received similar representations from groups such as the Irish Wheelchair Association, the CRC and so on. How can all this unmet need sit alongside a budget surplus of such enormous measure that no-one can get their head around the figures? It does not mean much to people to tell them that the current budget surplus for next year is £4,836 million but they certainly know what it means to be told that their child cannot get an orthodontic appointment for two years. It is of little consolation to know that the Minister is awash with money if one cannot afford a house. I do not want to mislead anyone. None of these issues can be solved by money alone but none of them can be solved without money.</P>
    <P>I started my contribution by rejecting the notion that all political parties were the same. I addressed this issue as recently as a few weeks ago. Some points bear repeating. I differ, as does my party, on a number of important respects on what passes for Government policy. I do not agree with the policy that the Government should run what it calls a substantial surplus as measured by GDP. I readily agree that we do not need to borrow for capital or any other purpose and are not likely to need to do so for the foreseeable future. I indicated a few weeks ago that I saw scope for further investment in services of about £500 million this year over and above that proposed by Government. Such additional investment, which should be in health and social welfare, is needed to make up for decades of under-investment and it is affordable in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>I do not agree that we should be looking to reduce spending on services as a proportion of national income. We already spend proportionately less on services such as health than many of our neighbours and it is unconscionable in current circumstances that we should look to reduce spending even further, as we are as is made clear from the budget documentation today, not least because so many of our essential services are in dire need of investment. Nor do I agree with the Government's stated limit of 4 per cent increase on net supply services. Spending increases should be limited to what we can afford. Nominal GNP will rise by at least 9 per cent next year and tax revenues are predicted to increase by something <Col N="145" /> in the region of 12 per cent. In those circumstances, a limit of 4 per cent is unnecessarily low.</P>
    <P>A curious consensus has grown up in the past few years. Almost everyone agrees that we need to invest more in infrastructure. Whereas two or three years ago it would have been difficult to find an economist who would argue in favour of more current spending, now rather more of them are willing to do so. Interestingly, there does not seem to be a consensus on current spending. We are willing to build hospitals but we are not willing to put the staff in to man them. Of course, there is a distinction between capital spending and recurring current expenditure but, in fact and in truth, one very often necessitates the other. Even the Department of Finance seems to have some difficulty in this regard.</P>
    <P>The national plan is instructive. As we know, it sets out a series of plans for infrastructural development, some of them ambitious, but the whole plan is circumscribed by an important rider. It states:</P>
    <P>Ultimately the overall NDP commitment will have to be kept to a level that respects the public expenditure ceiling set by the Government, takes account of the wider budgetary priorities and accords with the requirements of economic stability.</P>
    <P>This qualification, if we are to take it seriously, could tear the guts out of the whole plan. It is simply not possible to carry through the national plan while holding the increase in current spending to 4 per cent year on year. It cannot be done and the Government knows that.</P>
    <P>We know that the Minister is ambivalent about his spending target. On the one hand, he never ceases to assert the importance of the limit and, on the other, he has engaged in a series of sleights of hand to enable him to exceed the limit. This year is no exception in that he has transferred payments in respect of social welfare schemes into the social insurance fund so that they will no longer be counted as part of current expenditure. Either way he would do well to look at the needs of the economy and set limits &ndash; I believe in limits &ndash; that bear a closer relationship to reality.</P>
    <P>As regards the income tax package announced by the Minister, as he rightly pointed out, two years ago the Government was elected on foot of a manifesto that promised to cut income tax rates. I believed at the time that policy was profoundly unfair but, nonetheless, the Government got its mandate. In his first budget, the Minister set about implementing the policy. It proved to be as unfair and divisive in practice as we thought it was in theory, and many of those who originally supported the policy subsequently recanted. Needless to say, the Minister was not one of those who changed his mind. It, therefore, came as something of a surprise, I suppose a pleasant one, when he effectively reversed that last year by introducing a system of tax credits. In his third budget, the Minister has returned to type.</P>
    <P>We should remind ourselves why we moved <Col N="146" /> over to tax credits in the first place &ndash; the Taoiseach knows this well. We did it not just because it was fairer in year one but because it provided a fairer framework in which to introduce further reductions in future years. The tax credit is deducted after the liability is assessed and, therefore, it is possible and desirable to confer the same benefit on all taxpayers simply by adding to the tax credit. A few weeks ago, I expressed amazement in this House that the whole taxation argument was proceeding apace with all the arguments about rates and bands as if last year had never happened. Interestingly, the Minister interrupted me at the time to state that he agreed with me. Why then today has he reverted to the old argument about rates? He has always said he does not agree with high nominal rates of tax but surely he accepts the incontrovertible logic of what he did last year? He knows better than most people that last year was only the start of the process. For some reason he has lapsed back into his old ways. Could it be that he is bowing to the wishes of his <i>belle amie</i>, the Tanáiste, or that he was never much taken with tax credits in the first instance? It could, of course, be both.</P>
    <P>Let us say it up front A reduction in the higher rate benefits only those who are paying tax on a significant amount of their income at the higher rate. Nobody has argued that the better off should not benefit from a reduction in income tax. What we are saying is they should not benefit to a greater degree than anyone else. In fairness, the Minister has not totally abandoned tax credits. He has eliminated some of the remaining anomalies and that is good, but he has increased tax credits by what is by any standards a tiny amount.</P>
    <P>My first reaction when I heard about this notion of individualising the standard rate band was to say this could not possibly be right. Why is he doing this? The Murphy judgment jumps immediately to mind. Even if it is not caught by the Murphy judgment surely it will be caught by the provisions of the Constitution which values the position of someone who wants to stay at home to look after children. Why should we actively look to discriminate against married couples who decide that one of them should stay at home to look after the children? I believe in choice. I choose to go out to work as does my wife but others take a different view. Some married couples will choose to have both working, some will choose to have one person go out to work. Many will choose to have the mother stay at home and look after the children. Why should the State say to a married woman who wants to look after her children in the home that she should be discriminated against by the tax code if she does so? Why should we do that? This is a profoundly anti-family change in the taxation policy by a party which has claimed in the past to be pro-family.</P>
    <P>A few weeks ago I set out what the Labour Party would look to do in this budget. I proposed a package that would have been worth a little less than what the Minister has proposed &ndash; some<Col N="147" /> thing in the region of £800 million but it is close enough to allow for comparison. I argued that we should increase the tax credit by £500 for each single person and £1,000 for every married couple, whether there was one earner or two. It is interesting to note that our proposals have come out roughly the same for most people on middle incomes but they would have been vastly more advantageous for those on lower incomes. Most importantly, the proposal we made, which is relatively simple and straightforward, would have taken 750,000 people out of the income tax net altogether and would have meant that people earning less than £150 would not pay income tax. That would have been a vastly more socially acceptable and desirable outcome than what the Minister did today.</P>
    <P>There is still some scope for income tax reduction in the future. However, it would be wrong to give the impression that this scope is unlimited. A poll conducted by <i>The Irish Times</i> a month ago indicated that a majority of Irish people are willing to pay for good quality public services, even if that means forgoing income tax cuts. There is a clear message in this for politicians. If we get it right and if we make the critical link between investment spending and better services, we can reasonably expect public support.</P>
    <P>We should continue down the road of tax credits until all income below the minimum wage is exempted from income tax. If we go beyond that point, and we should be slow to do so, we should consider the notion of refundable tax credits. In effect, this means that, if a particular worker is not paying enough tax to benefit from a further reduction in tax, he or she would receive a cash payment. That would lead to the effective integration of FIS and the income tax system.</P>
    <P>I will return to the other tax proposals later but I wish to deal now with the social welfare proposals. For many of us, the budget is just a bit of theatre. Any reduction in tax is welcome but it is not vital. However, there are many hundreds of thousands of people for whom today is very important. There are hundreds of thousands of people who depend entirely on the State for their livelihoods. At a time when the newspapers are full of the hyperbole of the Celtic tiger, the State still insists that widows can live on just over £77 per week. Whatever the chances of someone eking out a living in the short-term on that amount of money, it is simply not possible to do so in the long-term on such a contemptible allowance. It should be a source of embarrassment to every Member that we would ask anyone to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>For many years the social insurance fund was in deficit, so much so that many of us had come to regard it as just another form of taxation. However, things have changed. <Col N="148" /> Two years ago the fund moved into surplus and the estimate before today was that it would show a surplus of no less than £577 million next year. It is important that we understand what this means. In effect, it means that the Minister could have afforded to do pretty much what he wanted. He could have chosen to increase old age pensions to £100 per week, raised everything else in line with the expected increase in wages and he would still have had money to spare. He could also have raised the adult dependant allowance by the same amount as the main pension and brought back the payment date to April.</P>
      <P>All of this would have been affordable within the social insurance fund with no additional call on the taxpayer, at least for non-means tested benefits. However, the Minister chose not to do it. He chose to hold off on the final increase in old age pensions to £100 per week, presumably in the hope of getting another bite at the cherry before the next election. In doing so, he is seriously underestimating the judgment of senior citizens. I accept that the £7 per week increase is large but it is still only a fraction of what could have been afforded in the current economic climate.</P>
      <P>The Minister has effectively reduced the projected take from PRSI. That is a mistake. Our rates of social insurance are not high by European standards. On the contrary they are quite low by the standards of most of our neighbours. I understand they amount to approximately 50 per cent of the rates that apply in Italy and Germany. For much of the 1980s, it was argued that our rates of PRSI were a work disincentive. It may well have been true then but it is hardly true now. The major problem which employers or potential employers now have is not the rate of social insurance or the likely level of the minimum wage, it is simply the fact that they cannot find workers.</P>
      <P>We need to consider where the real problem exists, namely, in the rate of payments and benefits which issue from the social insurance fund. Many of these are far too low by international standards. We cannot stand over average payments of £80 per week when the nation's wealth is climbing to levels above the EU average.</P>
      <P>The time has come to do two things. First, we must reconsider the absolute value of current payments. In the 1980s we asked the Commission on Social Welfare to do this and we have only now met some of its recommendations. It is time to establish a new commission to which one brief should be given, namely, to propose rates that will eliminate absolute poverty. I accept that employment is the best way to do this but we must equally acknowledge that there are many people who cannot or who will not work again. It is unconscionable that these people should be condemned to absolute poverty for the rest of their lives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having set absolute rates, we should commit ourselves to maintaining the value of those payments relative to the rest of society. The best way <Col N="149" /> of doing this is to link social welfare increases to increases in wages and not to inflation, as was frequently the case in the past.</P>
    <P>Today, the Minister has increased the main social welfare payments by £4 per week. A person might be able to buy a pint and a half of beer with that amount but they could hardly afford to buy a packet of 20 cigarettes. The increase may well be ahead of inflation but it is less than the expected rise in wages and a good deal less than the wage demands now being made in the context of a successor agreement to Partnership 2000. The blunt reality is that, with the exception of old age pensioners, everyone in the State who depends on social welfare payments will be relatively less well off this time next year than they are now. For many years we did not have the resources to take action in this regard. Now we that we do, the Minister has refused the fence.</P>
    <P>In last year's budget the Minister passed on the issue of child care. We gave him grief about this at the time but, with the benefit of hindsight, perhaps this was not such a bad thing. Had he not passed on it he might have been tempted to deliver on his manifesto commitment to introduce a tax free allowance for child care costs which would have been a thoroughly bad development.</P>
    <P>Before considering the detail of what the Government has proposed, we should stand back for a moment and take stock. We need to start by considering what we hope to achieve and a little honesty is called for in that regard. For many years, successive Governments paid lip-service to this issue and did little or nothing. They did this for one reason and one reason only, namely, the labour market. With unemployment standing at more than 300,000, the last thing we wanted to do was actively encourage married women and lone parents to make themselves available for work. Now, of course, the demands of the labour market have changed and there is a demand from some quarters for measures which will actively encourage mothers to enter the workforce.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that action on this issue should be driven exclusively by the demands of the labour market. People are entitled to make their own choices. The State should support children and their parents. It is for parents to choose whether one or both of them work. The State should facilitate choice, it should not seek to make the choice which only parents can make for themselves.</P>
    <P>I accept that for many people there is no real choice, not least because of the dire shortage of good quality, affordable child care. The primary problem &ndash; I agree with the Minister in this regard &ndash; is one of supply. We need to give all the incentives required to increase supply and to ensure that it is up to scratch. This will not be easy because many of those in the sector currently operate in the black market. Incentives such as the capital allowances announced by the Minister are all very well, but we know from experience that incentives of this kind are less <Col N="150" /> than fully effective when dealing with facilities which do not have a guaranteed profit into the future. The private sector is more than happy to build apartment blocks but it seems less than enamoured of projects such as park-and-ride facilities, where returns are less secure.</P>
    <P>There will be a need for direct grant-aid to allow existing providers to improve facilities, to bring new people into the business and to bring new facilities on stream. In addition, we must use public money to allow local authorities to provide child care facilities whether they be playgroups, crèches, pre-school facilities or whatever. Obviously, the thrust of direct public provision should be in areas where the private sector does not deliver. However, I do not believe that local authorities or voluntary groups should be confined to those areas.</P>
    <P>Much of the child care sector operates in the black market. People must understand that this has to change, not least because we have to be in a position to ensure the quality of the services provided to our children. Providers should be given time, advice and assistance, including financial assistance, in order to help them to comply with regulations, but comply they must. Families must be given choice. It follows that direct payments to parents should be made irrespective of whether they decide to work and the easiest way to do so is through child benefit. A number of weeks ago I met the representative group, Childcare 2000, which is in favour of an increase in child benefit matched by parental care payments. It is an innovative idea, which has many attractions. The Minister has adopted part of the proposal but has ditched entirely the notion of providing direct assistance to parents in order to pay for child care. I remind the Minister where this came from &ndash; two years ago he actively sought support for a manifesto which guaranteed direct payments to taxpayers for child care. Where has that commitment gone? Many people were entitled to expect to receive assistance for rapidly increasing child care costs in the budget. They will get no more than the increase in child benefit, which is approximately £2 per week per child. Does the Minister seriously believe that will help people to pay for child care?</P>
    <P>That is bad enough but I have even more difficulty understanding how the supply measures will make any impact. A total of £46 million will be provided and, as Deputy Noonan said, most of that had already been announced in the Estimates. Health boards will receive £2 million while child care task forces will be allocated £5 million. These are small amounts when one considers the resources available to the Minister and the fact that there are hundreds of thousands of children whose parents wish to avail of child care facilities. He must know in his heart and soul that he has failed those who looked to him to make a real impact on this issue and he will regret that in the weeks and months ahead.</P>
    <P>The Minister's capital budget next year must be seen in the context of the national develop<Col N="151" /> ment plan which he published a fortnight ago. It was launched with all the razzmatazz one would expect, with Ministers, officials and the social partners lined up in the impressive surroundings of Dublin Castle. The Taoiseach and other Ministers produced their bank of figures and projects and the press dutifully covered them for a few days at least. However, the hype disappeared almost immediately and it is interesting that the public never engaged with the process. I find fault with the plan in that it is not ambitious enough and does not blend together well.</P>
    <P>If one examines the total expenditure and the nature of some projects in it, one might reasonably have expected the public to take more interest but it did not engage in the process for one primary reason. Many people do not expect that the various projects will see the light of day. They have heard us speak about Luas for seven or eight years and it will be at least three years before the first tram rolls. The C-Ring in Dublin has been on the stocks for 20 or 30 years and it is still not complete. There are myriad other examples.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge that there are problems with the planning process and, shortly, we will know whether the Government is serious about addressing them. However, there is also a serious problem in the way the Government has gone about that doing so and I refer, in particular, to public transport in Dublin. The only hard proposals in the plan are modest compared to the problem one has in moving from A to B in the city. The Government will authorise Iarnród Eireann to buy more rail carriages and lay more track and Dublin Bus will be allowed to acquire 50 buses annually for the duration of the NDP. However, extra buses and rail carriages do not make a plan. Virtually everything else in it is tentative. The north side Luas line seems to have been lost altogether, as it is not explicitly mentioned and one must look at a straight line on a map in one of the appendices to confirm that it still exists.</P>
    <P>There is a commitment to examine the feasibility of a link to the airport but there is no indication whether this will be by way of mainline rail, DART or Luas. The NDP does no more than state the obvious, namely that a rail link to the airport is good, something which any Dubliner could have pointed out 20 years ago. Similarly, there is a commitment to examine the possibility of linking the two primary railway stations in Dublin, Connolly and Hueston. Once again, no real indication is given as to how or when this might be done. The plan refers to the possibility of re-opening the Navan rail link. I have no problem with this proposal but it is not the product of a detailed plan. The only reason this proposal made it into the NDP is that there is already a disused railway in existence and given that the Government was desperately looking around for projects to fill the pages, it felt that it rated a mention, subject to a feasibility study.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="152" /> I do not want to seem unduly cynical. I genuinely hope that these projects begin soon because the quality of life of everyone who lives in Dublin depends on them, but the record so far gives no confidence that the Government has the determination or interest to make them happen. It is clear that the NDP was not the product of genuine planning. Nobody sat down with a map of Dublin to assess current and likely future needs, and that is necessary. The price tag must be forgotten about for once and the provision of projects must be outlined. If they cannot all be afforded at once, their delivery can be prioritised but at least we will be aware of what we are trying to achieve.</P>
    <P>I take public transport as an example because it is an issue with which many people will be familiar, but there are similar difficulties with other issues. The health section of the NDP is wonderful as it reads like a wish list to which any of us could subscribe, but after I read it I did not have any confidence that it would be implemented. There is a credibility gap borne out of previous experience and it arises partly because we have never previously been able to pay for our wish lists. The task for the Government and its successors is to bridge that gap and the mere establishment of a Cabinet sub-committee by the Taoiseach will not do the job.</P>
    <P>In 1997 Ireland signed up to the Kyoto agreement on greenhouse gas emissions, which is legally binding and very onerous. It obliges us to limit the increase in such emissions to 13 per cent above the 1990 level by 2008. The problem is that Ireland has already exceeded that and the ESRI has calculated that if nothing is done to tackle the problem, emissions in 2008 will be at least 37 per cent above 1990 level, which is well in excess of the Kyoto commitment. This issue has enormous implications for the energy sector, in particular, but it will also impact seriously on Ireland's capacity to sustain economic growth if something is not done about it soon.</P>
    <P>Thus far the Minister for Finance and his colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, have done nothing and the budget confirms that he intends to do nothing. The Government has at last begun to think about the issue. The Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise published a Green Paper on Sustainable Energy which stated, for example, that peat stations should be closed. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government recently published a discussion paper, which stated, for instance, that excise duty on petrol should be increased by at least 10 per cent per annum. Strangely, these publications have attracted virtually no comment.</P>
    <P>Debate is all very well but decisions are needed soon. Until recently, the Government did not take this issue seriously. When it woke up to the implications of our commitment it then sought to take refuge in the possibility that Ireland could trade emissions with other countries but the EU will require us to meet at least 50 per cent of our <Col N="153" /> commitment through domestic action. This needs to be addressed now. For example, it will take the ESB several years to convert to gas if it is decided to take such a measure. This is not an esoteric, arcane side issue as it is central to our capacity to sustain economic growth into the next century. It is no exaggeration to say that the Government is playing with fire and it must get its act together soon.</P>
    <P>I refer to the principle of capital acquisitions tax. The tax base in Ireland has been too narrow for too long. The primary result is that VAT and income tax rates have been higher than the EU average, notwithstanding the fact that the overall tax burden is lower. The reason is that our level of capital taxes is, and always has been, relatively low.</P>
    <P>I believe in capital taxes. They are largely paid by the better off and by people who can afford to pay. They are often paid on windfall or unearned income such as gifts, unearned gains or inheritances. If I earn £20,000 a year by the sweat of my brow, I will now pay 44 per cent tax on every additional penny I earn. Why then should I be entitled to inherit several times that from a maiden aunt and not pay a penny in tax? There is also a powerful argument in terms of equity. CAT is one of those taxes which, despite all the attention it attracts, few people pay. However, it has a distinct redistributive effect and it should only be tampered with if there is good reason to do so.</P>
    <P>I told the Minister in the House a few weeks ago that I would not support him if he took a knife to CAT in the way that he did to CGT in 1997. I also indicated at that time that I would support any move intended to ensure that people already living in the family home and intending to stay there did not have to sell the house in order to pay the tax. It is a case of one up and one down. I support the measure the Minister has introduced in relation to the family home, although it is more generous than I would have allowed. Nevertheless, the broad thrust of the measure is reasonable. If a person is living in a house and intends to stay there, it is reasonable that they should not be obliged to sell it or mortgage themselves to the hilt to stay in a house in which they have always lived.</P>
    <P>However, I do not support the rest of the proposal. It is unreasonable to increase the thresholds by 50 per cent or more so that a person who inherits £300,000 in addition to the family home from their parents will not pay a penny in tax. How can that be fair? One can inherit a house worth up to £350,000 &ndash; which is not difficult to find in Dublin these days &ndash; and also inherit a further £300,000 without paying tax. This is not fair at a time when one pays 44 per cent on any additional income over £30,000. The Minister has torn the guts out of CAT as he tore them out of CGT a few years and it is a move I do not support.</P>
    <P>There are good elements in the budget and items which will be popular &ndash; it would be churl<Col N="154" /> ish and stupid to say otherwise. Even the most unimaginative and incompetent of Governments could not fail to get some things right given the resources and opportunities available to the Government. However, there are also plenty of elements which the Minister has done badly or not at all. If I was to crystallise my comments I would say to the Minister and the Taoiseach that the Government and the Department of Finance are used to saying no. They are geared up to say no and, as a result, the Minister for Finance and the Department have failed to grasp the measure of the opportunity now available to the country. We are the first generation of Irish people to hold the destiny of our country in our hands. By their failure to understand that, they have failed us all.</P>

      <P>In the context of the budget, it is important to consider the effects of the policies being adopted by the Government. The World Trade Organisation is meeting in Seattle today and many people are considering economics in the most global terms. It is important to also do so in the House. After each 3.6 seconds spent speaking about the budget, someone dies of hunger on this free trading planet of ours. Three quarters of these deaths are of children under the age of five. As the Minister toasts himself and his free trade policies, 24,000 people die every day from hunger or hunger related causes.</P>
      <P>The World Trade Organisation is also toasting itself, although it seems to be hotter over there because of the protests. In its structure and agreed policy positions the WTO does not operate in the best interests of the consumer or even in the interests of the nation state. The WTO is a tool of the corporate world. The Seattle Round offers the prospect of rolling back international agreements on environmental protection and food safety in the name of what is laughingly referred to as free trade. In the face of this onslaught, the Minister for Finance and the Government by their silence have confirmed their impotence or perhaps it is stupidity or lack of concern. The Government's policies and those of the EU and the WTO enrich the few and impoverish the many and, in doing so, destroy the earth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Depending on the agency to whom one speaks, there are approximately 2,000 homeless people in the greater Dublin area, which includes parts of Kildare, Meath and Wicklow. They are trying to get warm in doorways close to Leinster House. In spite of Government smugness, this society fares badly in many respects in comparison to several of our partner countries even in the developed world. This may not be the case in terms of the economic statistics of GNP and GDP which are increasing at present. However, given the effect of increasing economic prosperity, one cannot be <Col N="155" /> immune to how superficial reliance solely on economic indicators can be.</P>
    <P>If the Minister had chosen to couch his financial report and plan for the nation in relation to social indicators, he would reveal a society that in terms of equity, justice and being at peace with itself is destroying community life, wasting finite resources and neglecting the growing number of marginalised people in Ireland. The most recent statistics continue to make disturbing reading. The 1999 UN Human Development Report reiterated the statistic that among industrialised countries, Ireland rates second from the bottom in the percentage of its population living in poverty.</P>
    <P>This indicator was reached by examining the number of people who are likely to die before they reach the age of 60, by measuring the level of functional illiteracy, by recording the number of people who rely on income that is less than half the average income and by counting those who have been unemployed for over one year. In each of these respects, Ireland performs significantly worse than any of its European neighbours.</P>
    <P>That Ireland is a country of consistent and persistent levels of poverty is confirmed by other recent reports. EUROSTAT, the statistical agency of the European Union, released a report this year on redistribution, measuring the gaps which exist in each member country between the top 20 per cent and the bottom 20 per cent of the population in the share of national income. In no European country was this difference more marked than in Ireland. Those who are affected by economic inequality represent the most marginalised of our society. What Government can take pride in reports which indicate that between one quarter and one third of children are at risk of poverty? The situation of people with disabilities has scarcely improved during this era of growth in gross national product. The ability to house and be housed has become a faded dream for the vast bulk of our population.</P>
    <P>Not only has house purchasing become compromised for would-be home owners, a more significant phenomenon is the growing incidence of homelessness on our streets. The Cork Simon Community reported that for the first six months of 1999, they had received as many requests for nightly accommodation as for the whole of 1998, a practical doubling of a problem that is worsening in every Irish town and city.</P>
    <P>Government policies, formed on indifference and inaction on the question of immigration, have placed inordinate pressures on State agencies and have confined asylum seekers and refugees to a guaranteed poverty status, due to the Government's unwillingness to make use of the economic potential of those who are seeking the opportunity to become residents of our country.</P>
    <P>The Green Party is strongly committed to the principles of social and environmental justice. However, it is difficult to see that this Govern<Col N="156" /> ment, given its policy direction to date, is as committed to these principles. Our commitment is based on our belief that social justice springs from a commitment to sustainability. Sustainability has become a term more talked about than understood, much less practised. This Government has shown less understanding of the term than most. Sustainability is not about sustaining growth in consumption. It is about hard assessments about the nature and quality of wealth, about how resources can be best utilised for long-term use. We are talking here of generations, not simply the term of a Government.</P>
    <P>Social justice is the ultimate goal of pursuing sustainable policies. The Government's unwillingness to promote sustainability has helped worsen social exclusion and has made it more difficult to achieve social justice in Irish society. A continuing commitment to &ldquo;short-termism&rdquo; and to policies that benefit the few at the expense of the many, is hardly the best starting point from which to promote sustainability.</P>
    <P>It may surprise many that the Green Party sees sustainability in social and economic terms, as much as in environmental terms. In many respects achieving environmentally sustainable policies should be that much easier. However, even on these terms the Government has been failing miserably. Our international obligations in relation to the Kyoto Agreement on carbon emissions have been breached well ahead of schedule. That is nothing to be proud of, yet this Government still shows no willingness to introduce measures to tackle our growing fossil fuel dependency. Given a golden opportunity to institute real taxation reform by transferring taxes from labour to resources, the Minister for Finance continues to effectively show two fingers the issue.</P>
    <P>As with other areas of environmental policy, the Government has been showing perfect consistency. There are growing mountains of waste, increasing deterioration of water quality and never-ending traffic gridlock, yet we see no incentives or any use of tax instruments to solve the problem. This Government wishes to avoid undertaking environmental policy initiatives. It is a Government which is only too willing to penalise those who, individually and voluntarily, seek to promote and protect local environments. One need only think of the attempts to impose a £20 charge on people who have an interest in local planning applications to understand that point.</P>
    <P>It could be that the Government does not necessarily care about its inactivity in these areas. It could be that the problems of social exclusion are of peripheral interest to it. We live in a period characterised by what the economist, John Kenneth Galbraith, described as the politics of contentment. Maybe the Government is unconcerned that as few as 28 per cent of the registered electorate participated in the recent Dublin South-Central by-election and that the majority of those who did not participate were those most marginalised within our society. The impression is clear that as long as those who participate are <Col N="157" /> being satisfied by policies that are selfish and are helping to produce a selfish society, the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, does not really care.</P>
    <P>I turn now to some of the main points the Green Party would like to have seen in this budget. Our policy goal is to remove more of those on low salaries from the tax net. Increasing personal allowances achieves this. A higher than usual increase in the PAYE allowance allows those households dependent on second incomes additional relief. There has been some movement in this direction, and we welcome it.</P>
    <P>A second policy goal must be to delay as long as possible entry to the highest rate of tax. This is done by increasing the standard rate band, which we have proposed. However, we are also further proposing the introduction of a 10 per cent starting rate on the first £1,000 of taxable income and an intermediate tax rate of 33 per cent on the £1,000 of taxable income after passing through the standard rate tax band. These measures would assist progressiveness in the tax system to the extent that a single person on a salary of £23,500 per annum would not pay tax at the higher rate. Discretionary tax reliefs work against progressiveness and have long been seen as an anomaly within the tax system. The Green Party is calling for a 10 per cent discounting of all discretionary tax reliefs, with the exception of mortgage interest relief and, given this exception, the anomaly in respect of those in rental properties must be addressed by giving them a similar level of relief. Ultimately, a ceiling must be put on the amount of rent that can be extracted from people by the rackrenting property owners in this city and country. If that requires a change in the Constitution, the Green Party would support such a change.</P>
    <P>A proposal to tax child benefit has to be seen in the context of this benefit being doubled. That would be the rationale explained in our social welfare section. Costings are in a full year and transition year format, in keeping with the promise of the Minister for Finance to bring the financial and calendar years together. Even a doubling of child benefit would not address the crisis in child care to any extent. Tax concessions will not address it either. Addressing the problem has to be about investment in community infrastructure and child care provisions, such as grants for crèches. This must not just be a priority but has to be acted on immediately.</P>
    <P>Let me turn to the suggested employee PRSI and levy changes. Although ostensibly an insurance fund, PRSI is in reality a flat-rate tax. Changes in this area could be more beneficial for workers, especially lower paid workers, than cuts in tax rates. The Green Party is proposing three measures to help alleviate this burden: first, increasing the amount at which one is exempted from PRSI payments from £100 to £120 a week; second, reducing the employee PRSI rate by 1.5 per cent, a far greater benefit than a similar tax cut and, third, increasing the payment level at which payment of the health levy is exempt to <Col N="158" /> £12,500. We would propose a slight clawback by increasing the ceiling at which employee's PRSI is to be paid.</P>
    <P>Employer's PRSI changes that we propose relate to the aspect of the PRSI system that operates most negatively as an incentive towards work. It is in effect a tax on employment. As part of our policy of reducing tax on labour and replacing such taxes with taxes from other sources, such as consumption, the Green Party is proposing the following measures to reduce the liability of employers for PRSI. First, a reduction in the standard rate of employer's PRSI to 10 per cent; second, a change in the reduced rate to 7.5 per cent and, third, an increase in the reduced rate ceiling. As a clawback, we would propose increasing the upper ceiling for the payment of employer's PRSI to wages up to £40,000 per annum.</P>
    <P>With regard to our social welfare section, given the increasing disparity created by the wage increases and capital benefits enjoyed by others, the benchmarking of social welfare payments must now become a priority. Target figures set by the report of the Commission on Social Welfare over ten years ago have still to be reached. The Green Party believes that minimum social welfare payments should be at least 50 per cent of average household income. In this regard we have three proposals. To achieve this, we propose social welfare increases of 10 per cent. A similar increase is needed next year to achieve 50 per cent of average household income. The effect of this increase will be to move the old age contributory pension to beyond £100 a week, with the non-contributory pension poised to do likewise next year, two years ahead of the Government's scheduled target of 2003.</P>
    <P>Our proposal to double child benefit and subject the benefit to tax assessment would give full benefit to those who are not in the tax net. Even those paying tax at the higher rate would receive at least a 6 per cent increase in benefit. This additional payment should also be of great assistance to those in need of child care. All payments are a full-year cost because the Green Party believes that the staggered increases of social welfare payments is demeaning to social welfare recipients and all increases should be made on 1 January. Waiting until May while the Government congratulates itself for doing so is a disgrace and a further indicator of the difference in the attitude taken to different people in our society, with the marginalised generally coming off worst.</P>
    <P>The existence of low rates of corporation tax has been a major factor in attracting foreign direct investment, leading to charges of unfair tax competition from other EU countries. However, given the high rates of economic growth we have been achieving we may need to accept that we could have undersold ourselves. The Green Party believes the agreement for a single rate of corporation tax at 12.5 per cent is further evidence of this trend. We agree with the Economic and <Col N="159" /> Social Research Institute in its medium term economic review that a higher rate should be sought. A rate of 17.5 per cent would be more proportionate. To achieve this rate would result in a slower rate of decrease. In this regard we have three proposals. First, we propose a 2 per cent rather than a 4 per cent rate cut and as this decrease has been anticipated in the costings prepared for the budget the slower rate of decrease will result in additional revenue. Second, to achieve a 17.5 per cent rate we believe there is scope to change the 10 per cent rate to a 12.5 per cent rate. Third, the 25 per cent rate for small to medium sized businesses should be reduced to 20 per cent to allow such businesses to maintain their competitive advantage.</P>
    <P>Banking taxes need to be reviewed in the light of the enormous profits which banks enjoy, not to mention the information emanating from the Committee on Public Accounts and on a daily basis from tribunals. In this regard the Green Party proposes a 5 per cent social solidarity levy on the profits of banks and financial institutions which we estimate to be about £2 billion per year. At the other end of the scale, we believe the recommendations of the working group on the taxation of credit unions should be implemented in full, as accepted by the Irish League of Credit Unions. It is only right that the credit unions maintain something of a competitive advantage given that they remain the only financial institution to be committed to local investment.</P>
    <P>I come to the eco-tax proposals which are a huge disappointment in this budget. The Green Party is committed to facilitating the transfer of taxation on labour to taxation on resources while maintaining tax receipts as a percentage of GNP. We repeat our proposals which we have made again and again. Our chief proposal is a call for the introduction of a carbon tax on the industrial use of energy. Other environmental taxes would be levied on the use of pesticides and packaging such as plastic bags. It is disgraceful that the Government proposes to give away £622 million for more roads while the use of liquid petroleum gas in buses is not to be assisted, not an extra metre of railway track is to be built &ndash; and has not been since the foundation of the State &ndash; and nothing is to be done to address the issue of carbon tax or the transfer of tax from labour to consumption.</P>
    <P>We propose, as we have before, that motor tax be abolished and the necessary revenue be collected in the form of a tax on motor fuel. We hope the Government will listen to this proposal and implement it quickly. This would link the taxation of motor vehicles to their usage. This measure need not make motoring more costly because the fewer journeys made by car the cheaper motoring would be. We support any Government proposal to impose a large increase on the price of cigarettes on the proviso that the revenue raised will go directly to the health service. We welcome that provision.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="160" /> I outlined these measures, particularly the replacement of motor tax with a levy on motor fuel, to a taxi driver yesterday and found him quite supportive of them. This may seem surprising but taxi drivers in general support the motor tax measure because they feel that the large number of single occupancy cars prevents them from doing their work so that everyone is frustrated and less happy. The Government has chosen to do absolutely nothing on this issue and is being criminally irresponsible in this regard.</P>
    <P>Our policy in relation to property and capital taxes is to pursue a number of objectives. Taxes can have a dampening effect on profiteering in the housing market. To this end we propose two windfall taxes on the increase in values of rezoned land and on house profits which exceed amounts stated on certificates of reasonable value. We have three proposals on this matter. First, we propose a residential property tax on second homes used for holiday purposes. Second, the effects of hyperinflation on home buyers need to be alleviated. Increasing the exemption level from stamp duty to houses valued up to £150,000 would help. Third, in considering capital taxes two policy goals need to be examined. The threshold of property exempted from capital acquisitions tax needs to be increased to £250,000 and under capital gains tax, the swingeing rate cut from 40 per cent needs to be redressed by beginning a clawback with a 5 per cent increase.</P>
    <P>In our overall budget surplus reconciliation the Green Party fully accepts the need for a retained budget surplus of £2.5 billion. Taken from our tax and social welfare proposals, we believe that close on £375 million would be available which would give the Government latitude in the continuing negotiations for a replacement agreement for Partnership 2000.</P>
    <P>The urgent issue which needs to be addressed, not in May or even in January but now, is homelessness. Priority must be given to the setting up of a national agency to solve the growing problem of homelessness. We propose that a new agency be set up, to be called Dídean, the Irish word for shelter, which would have the overall responsibility of co-ordination and supervision for solving the homelessness crisis. Dídean would need to have responsibility for the provision of all services to homeless people, including rescue, hostels, analysis, addiction treatment, education, training and employment placement. Dídean would have the power to avail of services being provided by other State agencies, for example, health boards and FÁS and to co-ordinate these services for the homeless. I welcome the provision in the budget for hostel accommodation but more hostel accommodation is urgently needed. The Government's timespan of two years does not demonstrate a sense of urgency. Our proposal would enable homeless people to be brought off the streets into a healthier environment where their needs could be analysed and an assistance programme set in train for them. Finally, Dídean should be accountable to the <Col N="161" /> Oireachtas and should report to an Oireachtas committee every year on the current situation, progress made and present objectives and plans. This would at least ensure that homelessness is kept high on the political agenda.</P>
    <P>What comfort is there in this budget for people with disabilities, carers, those dependent on public transport, long distance commuters and families unable to find child care facilities? The comfort for them is very little. The Government has offered crumbs from the rich man's table whose top rate of tax is to be cut. The ultimate question is how much the Government will have available to it if, a matter that has not been mentioned so far, the forecasted spending on Partnership for Peace interoperability with NATO, to which this country has signed up, comes to pass. The Minister, Deputy McCreevy, seems unaware that that will become a reality.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, and the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, who were absent from the budget debate were, I believe, signing this country into Partnership for Peace. Partnership for Peace in budgetary terms is the biggest blank cheque ever given by Ireland to the arms trade and there is enough in that cheque to blow any goodies in the budget from here to the Cayman Islands. The Government has to address what money will be owed by Ireland before we begin to discuss what the budget actually means.</P>

      <P>(1) THAT the duty of excise on the issue of passenger tickets imposed by section 65(2) of the Finance Act, 1982 (No. 14 of 1982) shall not be charged or levied on or after 1 January, 2000.</P>
      <P>(2) IT is hereby declared that it is expedient in the public interest that this Resolution shall have statutory effect under the provisions of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1927 (No. 7 of 1927).</P>
      <P>The resolution provides for the abolition of the excise duty on tickets issued for travel overseas by air or sea with effect from 1 January 2000. This tax was first imposed with effect from 1 September 1982 and the annual yield has increased steadily over time to approximately £19 million this year. However, with the improvement in Government revenues and in recognition of the abolition duty free sales for intra-EU travel with effect from 1 July 1999, it is an opportune time to abolish this tax. This is a positive measure in support of the business and tourism sectors and will be of considerable benefit to regional airports and to air and sea transport operators.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This foreign travel tax should be abolished immediately. People travelling this Christmas to meet members of their families who are abroad should not have to pay this tax. Many people will travel this Christmas and many will travel abroad to celebrate the millennium with members of their families who are abroad. They should not have to pay the tax.</P>
      <P>This tax is wrong and it was wrong on the day it was introduced. We can now afford to abolish it and we will have to do so as a result of EU rules. The date by which it is removed should be 1 December. We should not wait until 1 January.</P>
      <P>We cannot put down an amendment to change the date because the procedure does not allow us to put down any amendments. We have no choice, therefore, but to oppose it on the basis that we believe a new resolution should be introduced tomorrow with the words &ldquo;with immediate effect&rdquo; substituted for the words &ldquo;or after 1 January, 2000.&rdquo;  Unless the Taoiseach is willing to accept an oral amendment to that effect we have no choice but to oppose it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are also opposing this tax symbolically because of our opposition to the philosophy of the budget. It seems that the Minister believes that people who are not paid for things do not count.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposal before the House is that this tax be abolished with effect from January at a time when the Government has more money than any previous Administration ever had. It has so much money it is trying to hide it from itself let alone from the public at large. There is a contingency fund of approximately £500 million going into this budget as well as a projected surplus. The only reason contingency funds were projected in the past was to maintain some degree of budget equilibrium and overall income equilibrium between one year and another. There is absolutely no reason that this tax could not be abolished with effect from midnight tonight. There is certainly no financial reasons and I am sure, given the competitive market in the travel area, that the people with responsibility for collecting this tax would be quite happy to avail of that. Certainly those people who tonight will be collecting the extra 50p on packets of cigarettes, which were bought into the shops prior to this, would be quite happy to charge the extra 50p at midnight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For that reason, the Labour Party is opposed <Col N="164" /> to this resolution. We will call a division in respect of it. If it must go, and it is being abolished because of an EU interpretation which the Minister for Finance has already indicated as being the reason for its abolition, then it should go tonight because there is no financial reason, from the point of view of available moneys, that it should stay for four more weeks. For both those reasons, one&mdash;</P>

      <P>I join my colleagues in opposing this for a couple of reasons. First, as other Deputies have said, it seems to me entirely illogical that this tax would be continued until 1 January. It is quite clear that it contravenes EU rules. It is clear that the Government is being forced to introduce this change because otherwise it would be penalised by the European Court. It seems to me that it is a very bad day when we recognise that we are imposing an unlawful tax but then say that we will continue to impose it for another month. This House has a duty to uphold legal rules by which the State is bound. I appeal to the Taoiseach to amend the resolution. When responding will the Taoiseach indicate the additional income from which the State will benefit over the next 31 days for which the tax will continue to apply?</P>
      <P>I found Deputy Callely's intervention intriguing. He is a man who does not want to tax the people who want to leave the country but he is quite happy to make it difficult for people who want to enter the country.</P>

It is right because this resolution is foolishly drawn up. Under European law it is possibly illegal for us to continue with this tax. It is right for us to vote against it for that reason, but it is also right that at the first opportunity Opposition Members have to vote they should indicate their disapproval for the view now taken by the Government that any spouse &ndash; be it a man or woman &ndash; who decides to remain within the <Col N="168" /> home to bring up the family should be financially penalised for so doing.</P>

        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> I support the lifting of the £5 travel tax. I will not be voting against it because that is game playing. I am appalled at the attitude of the Government and some of the Opposition parties. I remember when the tax was introduced in the 1980s and at the time I was a member of the administrative council of the national executive of the Labour Party. It was an appalling measure, a knee-jerk reaction to the crisis in which the Irish capitalist economy then found itself. The travel tax was in the same category as many other measures introduced then, including water charges and various forms of double taxation which hit ordinary people. In the context of the 1980s, the travel tax was the ultimate insult for tens of thousands of our people, the youth in particular, who were forced into emigration and exile because of the dismal failure of the economy. Their parting gift for the Governments of the day &ndash; and a number presided over the measure &ndash; was to pay £5 tax as they were kicked out to make a living abroad.</P>
      <P>I listened carefully to the Minister for Finance when he gave the rationale for getting rid of the tax and it certainly was not done in a generous spirit. It was done because the EU required the abolition of the tax on the basis of equality between people of different nationalities within the EU. Otherwise this State would have had to levy the tax on people travelling within the State as well as those travelling to destinations outside the EU. The distinct impression I got from the Minister's comments was that he would not have the neck to impose a £5 travel tax on people travelling within the country and, therefore, the easiest thing was to get rid of it. In fact, the tax should never have been imposed in the first place.</P>

      <P>I support the proposal to have this tax abolished immediately. It would have been a warm gesture on the Minister's part to transfer it in total to the fuel allowance for the elderly, which has not been increased for 13 or 14 years. By abolishing the travel tax today instead of on 1 January, the Minister could have given the benefit to the elderly immediately. It is unfair that the Minister forgot about the elderly in today's budget. The Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs told us such a measure would cost millions of pounds, but £20 million could have been made available by abolishing the travel tax a month early, and that could have been transferred to the elderly.</P>

      <P>Before the House votes on this resolution, I am seeking a point of clarification arising from what Deputy Farrelly said. He <Col N="170" /> said he would like to support the proposal to oppose the elimination of this tax on travel. I am not aware that there is any such proposal that Deputy Farrelly can support. No such proposal is before the House and none has been made. Can the Deputy, or anyone else, explain how he is opposing a proposal from the Minister for Finance to abolish a tax on travel from this country &ndash; which everyone in the House has opposed for almost 20 years &ndash; while, in his own words, supporting a proposal which is not before the House? I do not understand that. The Acting Chairman has had some considerable experience in the House also. I have heard some specious arguments from the Opposition that they are not actually opposed to the proposal but they will use the vote to highlight some other matters, even those that have no relevance whatsoever to the motion in the name of the Minister. Whatever other reasons may be used to vote in a certain way, Deputy Joe Higgins put it very well when he said it was game playing. If the Opposition is going to vote against this motion, they should do so in the full knowledge that they are against the elimination of a travel tax.</P>

      <P>It is matter of being logical, not just today but five minutes ago. We have just heard from the Minister that there is a European basis for removing the £5 tax. I suppose the European Union was concentrating only on movement between Dublin and places such as the Aran Islands, and was not worried about European citizens moving around Europe, which is its usual concern. That is a little illogical, unless we hear a very clear statement in the final summary that the Taoiseach has told the Minister that the £5 on arrivals &ndash; and, God knows, we have heard enough about departures and arrivals over the past month or two &ndash; is now as dead as a dodo.

      <P>It is very clear. If the Minister wants to dance on the head of a pin, the resolution before the House can be changed only by the Government. The Taoiseach can stand up and say that everybody is playing games and that he is going to call their bluff. He can say he has listened very carefully and that he proposes to <Col N="173" /> amend the resolution, that it will be exactly the same as the increased tax on cigarettes and that he will do it from midnight tonight.

    <P>This resolution provides for excise duty increases on tobacco products with effect from midnight tonight which, when VAT is included, amounts to 50p on a packet of 20 cigarettes with <i>pro rata</i> increases on other tobacco products. This increase is expected to yield £2.8 million this year and £132 million in a full year. It will increase the CPI by an estimated 0.756 per cent.</P>
    <P>The Government remains very concerned about the level of smoking, particularly the increase in smoking among the young and the direct cost to the Exchequer because of the adverse health effects. Therefore, the Government has decided that, with effect from 1 January <Col N="177" /> 2000, an amount equivalent to the extra yield from this increase will be paid by the Revenue Commissioners by way of appropriation-in-aid to the Department of Health and Children to help fund the increasing cost of health provision, in particular the national cardiovascular health strategy. It is expected that the significant increase of 50p will reduce projected cigarette consumption below what it otherwise would have been, particularly among young smokers who may be more price sensitive than others.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The contrast between this year's tax on cigarettes and last year's says all that needs to be said about the level of conviction and principle in the Government. Last year this Government of conviction, with an interest in health, increased the tax on cigarettes by 5 p. We said it was not enough, but this Government had no convictions whatever about health or the effect of tobacco. In the past 12 months there has been agitation on this issue. Deputy Shatter produced a report for the Joint Committee on Health and Children on tobacco use and its effects with particular reference to taxation. This Government, reactive as ever, absent of all principle but concerned to go with the flow, switched from last year's position of anything more than 5p being far too much to an equally principled position this year that anything less than a 50p increase would be too little. This Government does not know where it stands on any fundamental question. It changes its policy to suit the way the wind is blowing.</P>
      <P>This is emblematic of the Government's underlying approach to all economic and social questions. It has no fundamental economic and social view. It has no view of what the country should look like and it has no sense of direction. Just as it completely reversed the income tax policy of the previous year's budget last year, this year it completely reversed the cigarette tax policy of last year. It has no anchor, centre or direction. It is simply a group of people gathered around a table, happy to be drawing above average salaries, to have their photograph taken, to appear at any openings or closings to which they are invited and very proud of being Ministers and being called &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; but with no idea of what a Minister is supposed to do. A Minister is supposed to be someone who ultimately takes political responsibility for setting a country's direction. A Minister who changes direction every 12 months is not really a Minister because they do not have a sense of direction, which is what is fundamentally required of them. This Government does not have a sense of direction. This is not particularly inherent in Fianna Fáil. Many past Fianna Fáil Governments have had a sense of direction &ndash; usually one I did not like but a sense of direction just the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is impossible to dislike this Government because its approach is &ldquo;whatever it is you're having yourself, I'll have that too.&rdquo;  If people want no increase in tax on cigarettes tax this year, that is fine. If, next year, people want a big increase in tax on cigarettes, it will also go along with that. The Government is easygoing, accommodating, inoffensive and useless. It is a useless Govern<Col N="178" /> ment in the sense of governing. It is simply presiding over an economy and trimming to take account of needs as they arise.</P>
    <P>I support this year's approach to cigarette taxation. I was opposed to last year's approach. Last year I said the 5p tax increase on a packet of cigarettes was insufficient. This year I welcome the 50p increase in tax on cigarettes because it is sufficient and proper. I support it because it is clear cigarettes damage the health, not only of the smoker but those who live and work with them. The evidence of the deleterious effects of smoking and passive smoking on health is mounting. It is clear that cigarette manufacturers have known for a long time that cigarette smoking is addictive and have targeted young people to promote the addiction from an early age. It is a matter of considerable worry that there is an increase in the number of young people smoking. In their 20s and 30s, when they eventually get sense, they must go through the trauma of withdrawal from the addiction.</P>
    <P>It is a chemical addiction. It is a physical craving for cigarettes deliberately promoted and created by the cigarette companies to make money. This is all about making money on the back of addiction. We listened to Deputy O'Donoghue promote his policy of zero-tolerance of drug pushers. He is referring to people pushing drugs which in some cases are only moderately addictive but are deemed under current law to be illegal. Last year and the previous year, he had maximum tolerance of people promoting another severely addictive drug, namely, the cigarette. I understand it is more difficult to give up cigarettes than to give up heroin in terms of the withdrawal symptoms. The chemical barrier to be overcome is as great or greater for someone trying to give up cigarettes as for someone trying to give up heroin. The inevitability of death is just as great. Perhaps people die more quickly from heroin addiction. This is probably due to its illegality as much as to the substance itself, given the lack of quality control for needles and so on. Perhaps this aggravates the speed with which people die from heroin addiction. However, people also die from cigarette smoking. It is a matter of the gravest concern that this product continues to be widely available to young people.</P>
    <P>There have been many proposals as to what should be done with the tax yield from the 50p increase in the cost of a packet of cigarettes. I draw the Taoiseach's attention to the fact that it is predicted that 23 million people will die in Africa from AIDS. Some 23 per cent of pregnant women in South Africa, one of the most developed countries in the continent, are HIV positive, whereas less than 1 per cent of pregnant women in 1990 were HIV positive. Many businesses in east Africa must provide a large sum of money in their annual budgets to pay for the funerals of their workers. One tea company in Kenya must now pay five times as much in funeral benefit as a result of its workers dying from AIDS. We in this country have lived in an aura of victimhood since the famine. Some one million people died on this island within two years and we believe the world ignored this. <Col N="179" /> Many people throughout the world were not aware of what was happening. There was no Sky television in 1847. We now know that 23 million people will die from AIDS in Africa. We also know that treatment for AIDS is available which will cost as much as an average South African worker earns per week. In other words, in order to prevent themselves from dying, an average South African worker infected with AIDS must spend as much on retroviral treatment as he earns in the week and have nothing left. The surplus money we possess should go towards reducing the cost of AIDS treatment in Africa, not in Ireland, because this is a prosperous country. We should use this money to help the poorest of the poor. I recall the speeches made on the pro-life issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have mixed views on my eighteenth budget debate. This is the first year in which my region has escaped petrol taxation. The benefits of the lower cost of that product in the Border area can be appreciated by anyone who wishes to open his eyes. As a Dundalk man, in previous years I would have had much to say about the continued onslaught on the cigarette industry because at one stage Carrolls employed 900 people. Today that number has decreased to 57. It has been evident for many years that the bell has been tolling for that industry and I understand the reasons for this. The increase of 50p per packet of cigarettes is excessive but I have no real problem with it. I have, however, a problem with the hypocrisy shown in this House, not just by the present Government but by all Governments, my own included, towards the total exclusion of the drinks industry. There is a benign protectionist attitude to the drug which kills more people and wreaks havoc in more families than any other drug, that is, alcohol. There is not a family that has not had severe alcoholism visited on them. Almost 90 per cent of social problems are identified with the drug we all refuse to acknowledge, namely, alcohol. The extent of teenage drinking is dreadful. Official figures suggest that children begin drinking at 12 years of age. The lives of many teenagers are destroyed as a result of drinking. Many young girls become pregnant and are deserted by the offending partner who walks away into the night, having visited a public house before having his fun. People in public life refuse to acknowledge this fact.</P>

      <P>I am contrasting the hypocrisy of penalising the use of one drug, and rightly so, while being protectionist towards another drug which destroys more families than cigarette smoking. Because of the acceptance of drink, which permeates society at every level, including in this House, we will continue to be patronising because of the money involved and because of the fact that it is not considered politically correct to home in to try to save young people from the excesses of alcohol. I am not advocating prohibition but I am saying that we should get wise and recognise that our young people deserve better. I am asking for a degree of honesty in this House when debating drugs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this measure. Notwithstanding what the previous speaker said, I think cigarette smoking is a particular problem because, apart from its effects on smokers, it has a direct impact on people through passive smoking. It is important to put disincentives in place to ensure people's health is protected.</P>
      <P>In this instance, I am highly critical of the approach being adopted in relation to any serious effort being made to reduce the level of cigarette smoking in Ireland.</P>
      <P>There is a high level of smoking in Ireland. Deputy Shatter did an excellent job in preparing a strategy for the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children, outlining a package of measures that could be introduced and developed by the Minister for Health and Children to ensure that smoking was combated and that there was real progress made in reducing the level of smoking. Sadly there is no indication that the Minister has the slightest intention or interest in the strategy or in developing it through his Department.</P>
      <P>This measure could be read not as an anti-smoking one but as an easy route to get funding to pay for the cardiovascular strategy that was announced some time ago by the Minister and obviously needs to be resourced. If this is simply a way of getting extra money into the health budget it will not have the impact on smoking that is required nor will it have a reductive impact on the number of people smoking. We must have a targeted approach and ensure the work that is done is effective. We have seen too many health promotion campaigns that have missed their target and have been a waste of money. There is always the likelihood that the people who pay attention to the campaign are those who do not need the advice, the anxious healthy as they are known in the trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is clear that among young people there is a serious and growing phenomenon of smoking and that must be addressed by the Government. Those with medical cards are not assisted to give up smoking. Nicotine patches, one of the few aids that have proved their worth, are not available. Those who are poor cannot access the kind of preventive measure that would make an outstanding difference to their lives. This budgetary measure will impact on the poor in a particular fashion. It will have a major impact on those who are on low incomes and are addicted to smoking. The classic example is taken of the lone mother <Col N="181" /> isolated at home with a young baby. The only pleasure she has in life is her cigarettes. One in three young mothers suffer from depression to some degree. For many of them smoking is a means of getting through a stressful, difficult and often lonely time. This measure will not change their lives, if anything it will make it worse.</P>
    <P>Looking at the budget in general, one thing you should not be is a woman. You should not be poor and you should certainly not have children. If you are a woman, poor and have children the message from this budget is you do not matter. The whole thrust of this budget is driven by the market. It is about forcing women out to work, away from their families and children and forcing people on social welfare into the workforce whether or not they are able to work. An increase of £4 in social welfare is incredible &ndash;</P>

      <P>I have great respect for the Chair but if he had listened to the rest of my sentence he would have understood the significance of what I was saying. For someone on social welfare who is addicted to smoking an extra 50p on a packet of 20 cigarettes is a huge amount of money. Those in this House who smoke may not feel price is the biggest factor but it is for those on social welfare. It is not always easy for people to kick the habit. It is a serious and deep-seated addiction. We must recognise that. Most of the £4 increase will be gobbled up in differential rent increases. That is how local authorities and the system works, give with one hand and take back with the other. We all know we will have people coming to us in our clinics, some smoking and others not, saying that whatever miserly increase they got in the budget is going on differential rents.</P>
      <P>This was an opportunity for the Minister for Health and Children to do something real about what is a grave cause of sickness and death. There are 37,500 people on waiting lists. Many of them have cardiac problems caused by smoking. There is a high cost involved as a result of smoking. We are all aware of that but the Minister added thousands of people to the waiting lists by not preventing the nurses' strike.</P>

      <P>(1)THAT in this Resolution&ndash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;kerosene&rdquo; means hydrocarbon (heavy) oil of which more than 50 per cent by volume distils at a temperature not exceeding 240º Celsius;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;the Order of 1975&rdquo; means the imposition of Duties (No. 221)(Excise Duties) Order, 1975 (S.I. No. 307 of 1975);</P>
      <P>&ldquo;the Order of 1987&rdquo; means the Imposition of Duties (No. 285)(Excise Duties) Order, 1987 (S.I. No. 19 of 1987);</P>
      <P>&ldquo;tax warehouse&rdquo; has the meaning assigned to it by section 103 of the Finance Act, 1992 (No. 9 of 1992).</P>
      <P>(2)THAT the amount of any rebate allowed under paragraph 12(3) of the Order of 1975 shall, in respect of any kerosene, which is imported or delivered from a tax warehouse on or after 2 December, 1999, be the amount of excise duty chargeable less an amount calculated at the rate of £2.50 per hectolitre in lieu of the rate specified in paragraph 5(8) of the Order of 1987.</P>
      <P>(3)IT is hereby declared that it is expedient in the public interest that this Resolution shall have statutory effect under the provisions of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1927 (No. 7 of 1927).</P>
      <P>This resolution provides for a reduction in the rebate of excise duty for kerosene which, when VAT is included, amounts to almost 1.4p on a litre with effect from midnight. The decrease is expected to cost the Exchequer approximately £0.9 million for this year and almost £11 million in a full year. The effect on the CPI is a reduction of 0.01 per cent.</P>

      <P>This resolution deals with petrol derivatives and there is at present a problem for motorists. We have a free market for petrol and petrol products. The cost of a litre of petrol of the same brand varies from the city to rural areas. There can be as much as 12.5 to 15 per cent of a price differential between the cost of petrol in Dublin and the west. While I welcome this reduction can the Minister explain how this measure is included in the cost of living index? Why is the Government not investigating the cost <Col N="183" /> of petrol nationwide to see how these differentials could be eliminated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to address this issue in the context of the section on environmental taxes to which the Minister for Finance referred. I would have thought that two years or more after the Kyoto Summit this Government would have brought forward firm proposals for the introduction of green taxes and for a shift from personal taxation and taxation on employment to environmental taxation. Instead what we have is a reference to the matter being raised by the Minister for Finance with the social partners in the context of Partnership 2000, quite a remarkable position for the Government to take.</P>
      <P>I find it difficult to believe that the Government, which has responsibility for taxation and fiscal matters, is somehow going to raise, by way of negotiation with the social partners, its position on environmental taxes, given that two years ago, by way of international agreement at Kyoto, it made certain commitments which have not been met.</P>
      <P>Since the Kyoto Summit, this country, which committed itself to targets that allowed for an increase in the level of emissions agreed at that summit, has failed to meet those targets. We have fallen well behind the commitments we made at Kyoto. In addition, we are facing an embarrassing situation in view of the fact that the European Commission is taking the Government to court over its failure to deal with air pollution, the quality of water and other environmental problems.</P>
      <P>Given that this budget has been introduced at a time when the Government has considerable resources available to it, has there ever been a better opportunity to shift from personal taxation to green taxation? The case in favour of such a move was eloquently made last March by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. I quote:</P>
      <P>My own view is that once-off policy choices, necessary to meet the immediate target will not be sufficient to prepare us for the ongoing challenge . I am firmly of the view that we should utilise the fiscal system to assist meeting environmental objectives and securing more sustainable patterns of production and consumption.</P>
      <P>. the use of economic instruments like taxation or emissions trading can make more apparent the true cost of resource use or of pollution. Equally, these can provide an effective incentive, both to potential polluters and to consumers, to change their behaviour and maximise the efficiency of their energy or resource use.</P>
      <P>The Minister made these comments in a speech to the ESB. Clearly he did not make the same speech to his Cabinet colleagues or, if he did, they did not pay him any heed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is nothing in the budget which reflects any move on the part of the Government to <Col N="184" /> address, by way of fiscal measures, the commitments this country made at Kyoto. The only provision made in the budget in this regard is the reduction in excise duty on kerosene. I have no doubt this will be welcomed by householders who are obliged to pay for heating oil. However, there remains the question of energy efficiency. If the excise duty on kerosene is reduced in this way, we will move away from the targets that have been set. Such an action also runs contrary to the high-brow comments made by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government and other Government spokespersons in relation to energy efficiency, reducing emissions and honouring the commitments entered into at Kyoto.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>How is it possible that this resolution will have effect from 2 December when Financial Resolution No. 1 will not have effect until 1 January 2000? That distinction must be explained.</P>
      <P>Financial Resolution No. 3 refers to the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1927, which allows a resolution of this House, while it sits in Committee of Finance as we are now doing, to have the same effect as if it were passed through all Stages of legislation to become law. The Provisional Collection of Taxes Act does not specify that it is not possible to introduce such resolutions to have immediate effect and it does not require them to take effect from 1 January or any other date. The Act is quite open in terms of the date from which a provision should take effect. I presume that a tax could be reduced retrospectively if that is what the House desired. I would be grateful if the Minister would explain the reason for this distinction.</P>
      <P>I support Deputy Gilmore's comments. Ireland faces comparatively few economic problems. However, among those problems are the housing shortage, the labour shortage and our obligations under the Kyoto Accords. The Accords require us to, in effect, reduce our emissions of greenhouse gases. The Government, which indicated that it would do so in last year's budget, has an obligation to produce a comprehensive plan indicating how it intends, under each of the headings of the different producers of greenhouse gases &ndash; agriculture, transport, housing, etc. &ndash; to reduce emissions in each of the years between now and the date by which we must complete these reductions. It must produce a plan which shows the methods &ndash; a combination of taxes and other restraints &ndash; by which it proposes to reach the targets set at Kyoto.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House should take the commitments made at Kyoto seriously. I do not believe the Government is taking them seriously, in the same way it does not take tax policy seriously. A Government that can change its income tax policy and its cigarette taxation policy so freely is not one I would expect to take the commitments it made at Kyoto seriously. It is clear that the Government does not take those commitments seriously because all it has produced is an isolated measure which has <Col N="185" /> no policy context and which gives no indication of the destination at which the Government intends to arrive.</P>
    <P>In the midst of the best period in its history, this is probably the worst Government the country has ever had. It is a Government with limitless opportunities and the most limited vision; a Government of mediocrities holding office at a time of historic opportunity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>How will consumers benefit from this proposal which comes into effect from tomorrow? Who is responsible for ensuring that they benefit from the proposed reduction? If we consider Financial Resolution No. 1, which does not come into not come into effect for one month, I have no doubt that a system will be put in place to prevent the £5 reduction being passed on to consumers. The provisions in Financial Resolution No. 2 were revealed in the evening newspapers two weeks ago and the people who purchased £20 million worth of cigarettes will make £1 million as a result of the passage of this resolution. A number of individuals, friends of certain people, were informed about the provisions in Financial Resolution No. 2 and were given the opportunity to purchases huge numbers of cigarettes which they will now sell at an enormous profit to those who smoke.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister indicate who has responsibility for informing ordinary punters who use kerosene and who order a delivery on Friday, Saturday or next week that the reduction proposed in Financial Resolution No. 3 will be passed on to them? The consumer price index, to which Deputy Carey referred, never reflects, in real terms, the reductions that are introduced.</P>
      <P>Deputy Carey also referred to the price of petrol and other products used to power motor vehicles.  I carried out a survey on 26 or 27 petrol stations in the midlands two years ago and the price differed by between 12 and 37 pence per gallon. I am sure that if one travelled to Cork or Kerry it would be the same because those who control and import these products can decide to increase or decrease prices in two specific counties or regions while doing the opposite in two other areas without any loss given that they have a monopoly. The Minister for Finance is pretending that the price of kerosene home heating oil has been reduced. Government Members will not be able to tell us tomorrow or in two weeks that people will be able to buy home heating oil more cheaply.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer to the excise duty that will apply to cigarettes from midnight. It could result in unfair trading because the duty only applies to cigarettes from bonded warehouses. Large retailers will have a considerable advantage over small retailers who have little or no stock on hand. I welcome the increase and every retail outlet should be subject to the increase. A huge amount of wholesalers have considerable stock and they will be at an advantage as Christmas, <Col N="186" /> which is a peak time for sales, approaches. The Minister should examine this because the price of 200 cigarettes will increase by £5 and the excise duty should affect retailers as opposed to bonded warehouses.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy Farrelly. We should concern ourselves with the consumer at the end of the day and if the Government wanted to do something tangible with regard to home heating oil, which would impact directly on the consumer, it should have reduced VAT on such oil. Deputy Farrelly is correct with regard to excise duty and the saving of £10 million per year. Home heating oil will cost less but the reduction only applies to the family in which only one person works. This is discriminatory and biased.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>: Deputy Bruton and others referred to the excise duties on cigarettes and fuels or other bonded goods, such as drink. Traditionally, the increases apply from budget night because these products can be hoarded. One Member referred to products which were in transit. There are reasonably sophisticated controls on the volumes of product which can be taken out of bonding during the lead-up to the budget. That does not mean that some individuals cannot benefit but a great deal of trouble is taken to regulate the sales of these products.</P>
      <P>The abolition of the travel tax is welcome. The EU issue was raised but that only applied to air travel. The abolition of the tax also applies to sea travel and five million people travel to and from Ireland using this mode of transport. A considerable number of trips are booked for Christmas and people in the industry requested time to make the adjustment which is why the change will only take effect from 31 December. Many people will have booked their trips for Christmas and paid the travel tax. Others will be in the process of booking and it would be impractical for people in the industry to regulate the imposition of the tax. It is a substantial reduction which will amount to £20 million next year.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Kyoto commitments and kerosene, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government will introduce measures. He will contribute to the budget debate and elaborate on his views then. Deputy Finucane referred to the question of VAT on kerosene. The reduction is 0.01 per cent of the CPI but the problem is that in Ireland that VAT is charged at 12 per cent in addition to excise duty while in the North and Britain, VAT is charged at 5 per cent but there is no excise duty which ties in with Deputy McGahon's reference to smugglers. There is a serious problem in the Border area but this measure will at least contribute to equalising the position.</P>

The revised programme for Government states that the eco auditing has been most successful and that it is being done in every area of policy. Was an eco audit carried out on this policy measure?

      <P>I understand that smuggling is one of the principal means of finance for subversive organisations. I am aware that one particular brigade of the IRA has been maintained in existence almost entirely from the proceeds of smuggling. It was one of the most deadly IRA brigades in terms of the number of people killed during the Troubles. If the Real IRA is not to raise its head, smuggling must be dealt with and an approximation of taxes across the Border is an important consideration in terms of denying the life blood of subversive organisations.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister indicate whether, in addition to eco audits, smuggling incentive audits could be included in future tax policy proposals? This would minimise the extent of divergence in tax and thereby minimise the potentially large amounts of revenue which could go to the Real IRA and other organisations involved in subversion. The south Armagh brigade of the IRA has been maintained in existence by smuggling and in particular by individuals who are able within their property to transfer diesel and other items across the Border.</P>

      <P>I accept the Deputy's point that it is a major problem. This is the reason for the measure. It is not possible to put an exact figure on it, but it is well known that there are advertisements in the Northern counties which relate to selling smuggled fuel. The term &ldquo;smuggling incentive audit&rdquo; could be misunderstood if it was not expressed properly. The Customs and Excise authorities will carry out their audits but this area is not easily audited.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>(1)THAT in this Resolution&ndash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;the Principal Act&rdquo; means the Value-Added Tax Act, 1972 (No. 22 of 1972);</P>
      <P>&ldquo;the Act of 1999&rdquo; means the Finance Act, 1999 (No. 2 of 1999).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)THAT the rate of value-added tax on the <Col N="190" /> supply of livestock and live greyhounds and the hire of horses be increased from 4 per cent. to 4.2 per cent. of the amount on which tax is chargeable in relation to the supply of such goods and services, and that, accordingly, subsection (1) (substituted by the Finance Act, 1992 (No. 9 of 1992)) of section 11 of the Principal Act be amended by the substitution in paragraph (f) of &ldquo;4.2 per cent.&rdquo; for &ldquo;4 per cent.&rdquo; (inserted by the Act of 1999).</P>
    <P>(3)THAT the rate of flat-rate addition to the consideration in respect of the supply of agricultural produce or an agricultural service by a flat-rate farmer be increased from 4 per cent. to 4.2 per cent., and that, accordingly, section 12A (inserted by the Value-Added Tax (Amendment) Act, 1978 (No. 34 of 1978)) of the Principal Act be amended by the substitution in subsection (1) of &ldquo;4.2 per cent.&rdquo; for &ldquo;4 per cent.&rdquo; (inserted by the Act of 1999).</P>
    <P>(4)THAT this Resolution shall have effect as on and from the 1st day of March, 2000.</P>
    <P>(5)IT is hereby declared that it is expedient in the public interest that this Resolution shall have statutory effect under the provisions of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1927 (No. 7 of 1927).</P>
    <P>This resolution provides for an increase from 4 per cent to 4.2 per cent in the level of the flat rate farmers refund together with a similar change in the VAT rate on livestock, live greyhounds and the hire of horses. The increase will come into effect on 1 March 2000. The change will cost £3.56 million in 2000 and £5.34 million in a full year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In this prosperous economy, the farming community is probably the only one whose income is not rising. There is evidence that, in a number of farming sectors, income is falling dramatically. The farming community has been transformed in terms of its means of support from 20 years ago where it earned its living principally from what it produced to a position where it is gaining its income principally from cheques in the post.</P>
      <P>The increase from 4 per cent to 4.2 per cent is an insufficient recognition of the income needs of the farming community. A larger provision should have been made to allow an increase in livestock and other agricultural prices to the farming community. This would allow it to move to some degree towards being able to meet its living expenses from what it produces rather than being in the position of having to wait for cheques in the post.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much has been made of the difficulties in the pig meat sector at present, but the livestock sector has also gone though a long period of bad prices. Few people now earn a living from quality livestock production. People keep livestock to qualify for headage and not to make a living from it. There is a considerable prospect that the milk quota available to farmers will progressively <Col N="191" /> reduce in total and become concentrated in fewer hands. This is because it is impossible for smaller producers to make a living from current prices even in milk production which traditionally was the one area where a farmer with a middle to low acreage could make a reasonable living. This sector is now suffering a progressive decline in income levels.</P>
    <P>There are relatively few instruments available to the Government to influence farm incomes. The main thing the Government can do is beg on farmers' behalf in Brussels. The idea that Irish Ministers are judged by their effectiveness as beggars at the European table probably is not the most pleasing image one would wish to have of the activities of a sovereign Government. However, as far as agriculture is concerned, that is effectively to what Ministers for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development are reduced. However, this is one of the few areas in which the Minister can do something to affect farm income by means of a larger increase in the rebate for value-added tax.</P>
    <P>Why is the Government being so measly in this area when it has such an opportunity to directly assist the agricultural community at this time of great difficulty for it? The farming community perhaps has not helped its case because some of its representatives acquired a capacity to shed tears even when things were going well. Some people ceased to take them seriously.</P>
    <P>Now that things are quite bad for many in the farming community, the &ldquo;crying wolf&rdquo; syndrome is working to their disadvantage. As somebody who represents a significant number of farmers and who, until comparatively recently, was involved in the industry, I can assure the House that this is an industry which is going through a decline in confidence and income. There is a sense of resignation among farmers, a sense of lost pride, a sense of quiet desperation. The anger is gone and there is now an atmosphere of resignation. While I do not pretend for one moment that anything the Government could have done in this budget in the matter of VAT rebates or anything else would transform the situation, it would at least have been a recognition that it is as serious as it is. I am sorry the Minister has not gone further in this provision. We will not oppose it, inadequate as it is, but we would urge that a larger and more generous provision might be made in light of the considerations before the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party will not oppose this provision either. I concur with much of what Deputy Bruton has expressed tonight about the plight of the farming sector. There has been an ongoing haemorrhage from farming that will accelerate over the next five years. Many people want us to mask the truth. However, we must be honest, if not with ourselves, with everybody else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are in a difficult situation. In five to seven years' time, we will be down to about 65,000 full-time farmers. That is a hard fact. There are 30,000 active dairy farmers who, with the exception of <Col N="192" /> about 7,000 or 8,000 of them, are just eking a living.</P>
    <P>Beef fatteners are virtually a thing of the past. Beef fatteners right across the midlands have moved into alternative enterprises. Their departure is as big a blow as the loss of trade with Libya and Iran because they provided very effective competition at the marts.</P>
    <P>What can one say about the pig sector? The Leas-Cheann Comhairle knows as much about it as anybody else. That is one sector that is looking for major help in some form. As Deputy Bruton said, we have ceded control to Europe in the context of decisions we could make in relation to a very important sector, the agricultural sector. When I spoke about this six months ago I was told I must be a Euro-skeptic. I am not, but I do not like to see everything taken away in relation to a vital national interest. That, effectively, is what has been done, because we have this begging-bowl mentality, and it is a sad reflection on a sovereign country when it has to go cap in hand all the time. The pig sector requires a huge level of inputs where variable costs, particularly in bad times, equate to the gross output, leaving nothing to service fixed overheads or anything else. A measure such as this, where the Government still retains control of excise matters, matters to do with raising revenue and dealing with taxation measures, provided an opportunity to take some of the £1.6 billion surplus that will be left tonight and give a bit more by way of a flat VAT rate addition back to those farmers. The only reason it exists is that very few farmers, apart from farmers who are incorporated into a company, are in a position to be VAT registered, and virtually all the inputs that farmers use attract VAT and this is a means of compensating them. It is effectively Exchequer neutral, for want of a better word. It will cost £5 million. I am eager to know whether the Minister is in a position to indicate to the House how many farmers are registered for VAT. It is an indication of whether they have reached the eligibility threshold in this area. We could have done something for the pig sector by means of this measure. We will have to look at the possibility of interest subsidies or a direct payment, some £50 million of a repayable loan to the pig sector, to try to help them out of their difficulties and to make a living on the land.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will take advantage of this last bastion of internal control to help farmers by giving them a VAT rebate on their inputs, particularly those who are in a critical situation. For that reason we will not oppose this measure. We would have hoped for a larger increase, particularly in view of the bountiful resources at our disposal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to be able to say a few words about farming. During the past hour or two I had an opportunity to study the figures, and I can guarantee that when the details of this budget have been absorbed by the farming community tomorrow, they will be on the look out for a few Ministers. This has been a bad day for agriculture. I will tell the House why.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was £942 million pumped out today. I <Col N="193" /> agree with the distribution of most of it, although I have my own concerns about part of it. Some people should have got more, but I will come back to that on another day. I have calculated that, out of the £942 million, farmers got exactly £3.9 million at a time when farming is on its knees. What does the Government think of the 150,000 farming families?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is worse than that. I am sick to the teeth of listening to Ministers and Ministers of State advising the agricultural industry that whatever else we do, we look after young farmers coming into the industry. I, Deputy Penrose and many others have spoken about this during the past year and in the run-up to this budget. I have here a copy of a document, the National Development Plan Priorities, by Macra na Feirme, the best young people, boys and girls in this country who are the most likely to become farmers. They are the trained people here. They looked for an increase in the installation aid grant. In 1984 the Government at the time and the European Commission saw fit to introduce what is called an installation aid grant which is given when a young person takes over a farm. The price at that stage was pegged at £5,600. I was at the table in Brussels on that occasion. That is a long time ago. If it was deemed on that occasion to be £5,600, how much should it be in 1999? There is not a word about an increase, nor will there be. We will be pressing the Government to give an increase in the Finance Bill.</P>
      <P>Any young farmer who reads today's budget speech will know that the Government has decided that farming is finished. This is a Government for good news. The Taoiseach or a Minister will be there if good news is being announced but they will not be seen talking about agriculture because they have no imagination and no ideas for the future. There is no shortage of skeptics but while the sun shines and no matter what any Government does, many thousands of Irish men and women will make a dignified living from the land.</P>
      <P>In my 20 years in Dáil Éireann I doubt if I have ever seen such a disgraceful performance by any Government for any sector. I do not know why this is. Farming has been bypassed by several other aspects of the budget. Most farmers have lost patience with the Government. They have tried every means possible over the last year or two but to no avail. I accept that there are structural problems which would face any Government but in areas where we have control we do not exercise it.</P>
      <P>Another failure in the budget is not apparent until one examines it closely. Until this evening the farmers were criticising the Government but the Minister should wait until farmers' wives read the budget speech and see the new measures for personal taxation. The budget says to every farmer's wife that her input to the farm does not count. Because she is not working in the so-called labour force the taxation system is geared against her. How dare any Government do that?</P>

      <P>I will return to value added tax. Here is a vehicle which would ensure that income would be diverted directly back to farming. The increase from 4 per cent to 4.2 per cent hardly keeps pace with inflation. This is a sop and has nothing to do with the real problems in the agriculture industry. It is worth £3.6 million to 150,000 farming families. It will mean only a couple of pence each. Taken together with installation aid and the disappointment regarding a measure on milk quotas which would have given a young person a chance to start out in farming, this is hopeless.</P>
      <P>The experience suffered by the farming community today is nothing short of disgraceful. I understand that the farm leaders' view of the budget is very negative, and so it should be.</P>

      <P>&mdash;to people in the farming community. The difficulty with what is being proposed is that this percentage VAT rebate is mathematically calculated. It depends on the amount of VAT paid by unregistered farmers and it is a mathematical calculation. There is an enormous number of Government schemes, grants, capital grants, farmyard pollution grants, installation aid schemes and so on which are being given as direct aids to farmers. There is also the farm assist scheme whereby the means test for social welfare payments to farmers is much more liberal than for unemployed people. That scheme was introduced by this Government.</P>

I find it difficult to accept Members of <Col N="195" /> the Opposition who allowed schemes such as installation aid to lapse and despite repeated calls from the farming community and from commentators on all sides refused to revive it. Their spokesman on agriculture, Deputy Connaughton, now citicises the Government who revived the scheme, for not giving more. This is an echo of Deputy Bruton's argument regarding the travel tax. He had the opportunity when he was Taoiseach to abolish the travel tax. There was nothing to stop him from doing so yet when the Government decided to abolish it he criticised us for not doing so three weeks sooner.</P>

      <P>There are enormous structural problems in the farming industry, as Deputy Connaughton concedes. I do not know to what extent we can shore up the situation by artificial Government life support mechanisms but in so far as we can, we are doing so and we are doing considerably more than our predecessors in Government. Tinkering with VAT rebates which are calculated on a mathematical basis is a most inappropriate vehicle for this. We are giving aid directly and we will continue our efforts in that regard because we need to do so. It is ludicrous to suggest that one should give a VAT rebate of £5 million or £6 million based on an inaccurate calculation. That is a ludicrously inappropriate way to to things.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been critical of the process of dealing with VAT for farmers, not because I do not believe sections of the farming community need support but because it is entirely inappropriate to give income support to farmers through the VAT system. This does not happen anywhere else and it should not happen here.</P>
      <P>We are not talking about £5 million. We are talking about £100 million. Can the Minister of State tell us exactly how much VAT refund is involved in this scheme? The Minister of State should have these figures because this is not the first time I have raised this issue. I have raised it on every budget night for the past 18 years. Can the Minister of State tell us the total number of claimants of the refund? Can he tell us the average refund and the average throughput on which it is based? Of what is 4.2 per cent a percentage? We must get some idea of the extent to which the scheme is being used and who is benefitting from it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is it true that this scheme applies to no other small business sector in the country? I believe it <Col N="196" /> is confined entirely to the farming community. How can that be justified on an equity basis? We should be seeking in our tax and social welfare systems to have equity. The Minister mentioned the scheme &ndash; I criticised it at the time &ndash; which changed the criteria for social welfare recipients as between farming and the rest of the community. When he introduced the relaxed unemployment conditions for payments to farmers, those conditions should have applied right across the board.</P>
    <P>Those who live in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway, urban areas of Donegal or non-farming families living in rural areas have the same problems as farmers trying to survive on social welfare. Why should they not have the same relaxed conditions to qualify for unemployment assistance as anybody else? If we are about building a fair society then we should apply the rules across the board equally. I am not surprised at what we have here because, in tax terms, this budget, so far as I can see, has been one of the most regressive we have seen in many a long day. However, as others have dealt with that issue earlier, I do not propose to propose to dwell on it in any detail.</P>
    <P>What is the objective basis for having this refund? What is the reason for increasing it? It seems an unfair way of assisting one section of the business community as against the other. I have no problem whatsoever with giving whatever assistance is necessary to maintain farming at viable and sustainable levels, sustainable not only in terms of income but in terms of the communities which depend on it and the environment which is crucial in rural areas.</P>
    <P>I am informed that the water from about 60 per cent of the water schemes is undrinkable because of the pollution arising from the way farming is carried out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to record my anger at the comments made by the Minister of State who said farm assist was introduced as a major help to farmers. Farm assist, in the words of the Minister, Deputy Walsh, has not worked and will not work because it is not an equitable system. We suggested that if it had come under the family income supplement it would have worked and would have helped. However, the £20 million which was promised to farmers last year in the Finance Bill remains in the kitty because the scheme did not work. The figures are there to prove it. Those are not my words but the Minister's words.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="197" /> Farmers are outside the gates of Leinster House tonight because they have not got returns. A means that could be used, irrespective of what Deputy De Rossa said, and is being used in other European countries is increased VAT to help maintain income. This is one way but other ways could have been found to provide £5 million out of a massive budget surplus to alleviate the problems of the hard pressed pig farmers who were hit through a catastrophe, not of their own making and outside their control. To overcome such a catastrophe, the Government should take the necessary steps to prevent people being forced out of business.</P>
    <P>The change from 4 per cent to 4.2 per cent will do little for many hard pressed farmers in my constituency where TB is rampant. A few weeks ago a farmer showed me his dockets for 23 animals which he sold to the abattoir and for which he got a return of £2,300 and some odd pence. A VAT increase of 0.2 per cent would not do much for that farmer. The Government cannot ignore farming any longer as it did today.</P>
    <P>Farmers' wives are playing their role in trying to maintain farm families and so far as any benefits today are concerned, they have been ignored. I would like to see younger farmers than myself being given some assistance because they are not being given opportunities to take up farming and survive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy De Rossa on the VAT issue because £23.33 per farm household will not do anything for the farming crisis. That is how generous the Government has been in the budget. It has been throwing money around like confetti, yet all it can give to every farm household is £23. As my colleagues have said, the changes in the tax system announced today will be of no benefit to farming communities and farm families and will probably be a disadvantage to many. The only people who benefit from the budget are the wealthy and there are not many farmers in that position. A great deal of resources need to be put into farming to upgrade farms throughout the country. We should be talking about computerisation of farms. We should have looked seriously at corporation tax with a view to bringing farmers in under the 20 per cent rate so they could invest in their own farms. They are the only members of the self-employed who are ineligible for this scheme and consideration should be given to including them. I endorse the comments of my other colleagues.</P>

This is welcome in the farming community because it identifies with the problem which arose in agriculture last year because of the higher input costs arising from weather conditions. A sum of £41.5 million was spent on agriculture last year to deal with the difficult weather conditions. This measure was identified as being fair and forthcoming on the part of the Ministers for Finance and Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and the Taoiseach. This Government has dealt more adequately in the past year to two years with agricultural problems than any Government in the history of the State. While agriculture is buoyant at present, it is a multi-purpose business with several commodities. We are aware of the difficulties in the pig industry and we have tried to assist them.</P>

      <P>Yes, but it identifies with the compensation issue where prices have substantially improved. This gesture will put £3 million into farmers' pockets to assist them in the flat rate system.</P>
      <P>Pollution was mentioned. Anyone carrying out work to combat pollution will qualify for a flat rate system of grants for inputs, the cost of equipment and other aspects. There is a generous allowance for farmers here, where there is a £20,000 write off in the first year, which is very welcome. Ground water is becoming more polluted and this will help alleviate that. We are conscious of pollution control. The mix of the VAT refund and the £20,000 write off in the first year will help.</P>
      <P>Nobody can dismiss what we have done. It is very welcome. I am shocked and appalled that Deputy Naughten, who claims to represent the farming community, is so out of touch. He is not living in the real world.</P>

      <P>Anybody who does not recognise that there is a difficulty in farming is not at the races. Nobody wants to preach doom and gloom but this provision will not do anything to alleviate the crisis in farming. The family farms we are trying to sustain in rural Ireland are the backbone of the economy. We should not allow them to <Col N="199" /> wither away and see people go into towns and villages looking for jobs they are incapable of filling. This Resolution will do nothing for these people who will go out of production and nobody will be available to produce the food we all need.</P>
      <P>We should not rubbish this issue by preaching about what we did. The Minister of State has the responsibility and he knows the problems. He should address them. He knows there is nothing in the budget to bring sustenance to any farmer.</P>

      <P>Deputies on all sides of the House are concerned about the general situation in farming. However, this is not the measure to deal with that, despite Deputy Connaughton's suggestion that it could be used as such. It is governed by EU law. Other member states use it. There are restrictions on what can be done. It is strictly a compensation measure. Rather than letting it slip for some years it has been increased from 4 per cent to 4.2 per cent. That is calculated by the Revenue Commissioners on the basis of the inputs.</P>
      <P>Deputy De Rossa's question was interesting and relevant. He considers that it is inappropriate to apply support in this way via the VAT scheme. It is not intended as income support, but it is an administrative compensation for the inputs which could be claimed otherwise and could work out to be even bigger. There is an estimated claim for it and that is what this is based on.</P>
      <P>Approximately 109,000 farmers are involved but as 4,000 are registered 105,000 are covered. The sum involved is £103 million in 1999, which is being kept up to date with a further £5.3 million in the full year. That brings the total to £108.3 million. Instead of letting it lapse or slip it is being kept up to date and that is the basis for the increase. It is done by the Revenue Commissioners, hence the need for this Resolution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The measure applies to other states. It is applied to farmers because they produce food which is zero rated. I assume the Deputy does not want to put VAT on food and once that decision is made there must be a mechanism to compen<Col N="200" /> sate for the inputs from back VAT that is not being claimed.</P>
    <P>The simplest way to proceed with the measure is by agreement, which is what is happening. The Revenue Commissioners and farmers are happy with it. If they wish to proceed by registration they can do so.</P>
    <P>There are problems but they must be tackled otherwise. Deputy Crawford said the measure amounted to very little. It looks very small but it is worked out accurately in relation to the kind of refund which is necessary to compensate. Any differences of opinion can be discussed, but I do not believe there is any challenge. It relates to the calculation over the previous three years of the change in the cost of the inputs and it is compensation for the VAT content of the inputs. It comes to £5.3 million overall.</P>
    <P>With regard to the rate increase, the relevant EU law provides that member states may apply to farmers a flat rate tending to offset the value added tax charged on purchase of goods and services made by the flat rate farmers. However, the directive specifically rules out over compensation in that the flat rate may not be used to obtain for flat rate farmers refunds greater than the value added tax on inputs. It cannot be used as an indirect subsidy, for example, to compensate farmers for changes arising from CAP or GATT reforms. That is the basis of it. There is no obligation to provide full compensation but it is being provided. However, the Government cannot provide any more than that level of compensation.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 to 10, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The Attorney General sought a report on the organisational questions arising from the events surrounding the case in question. The DPP's report was made public as soon as the director made a decision on a possible retrial.</P>
      <P>The report contained five specific recommendations for improvements in procedures. The Chief State Solicitor's office has implemented the first four. The fifth suggested a review of the procedure whereby one solicitor prepares the book of evidence and a different solicitor attends court at the trial. This will be considered in the context of the transfer of criminal prosecution work from the CSSO to the DPP.</P>
      <P>In my reply to questions on 19 October last about the Nally Group report on the public prosecution system, I informed the House that the Government had accepted the Group's key conclusions and recommendations and had agreed to implement immediately the recommendation to transfer the criminal division of the CSSO, as well as the State solicitor service, to the DPP.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The process to implement that recommendation is under way. A group comprising the Department of Finance, the office of the Attorney General, including the CSSO, and the office of the DPP has been set up to oversee the transfer. The group is considering the staffing levels and structures necessary in the enhanced prosecution service. The objective is to implement the <Col N="202" /> changes without delay and I understand that it is intended to advertise the new post of solicitor to the DPP shortly. The staffing position in the CSSO is being examined in parallel.</P>
    <P>The Nally report also contained a number of recommendations designed to improve the information and communication capabilities of the prosecution system and these will also be implemented.</P>
    <P>Following a review of the Chief State Solicitor's office in 1996 there were a number of changes, including the introduction of new technology and a re-organisation within the office. However, these have not addressed the problems fully. The workload of the office has continued to expand at an unprecedented level, not least arising from the hearing loss cases and the need to service tribunals.</P>
    <P>The Attorney General is particularly conscious of the difficulties faced by the Chief State Solicitor's office especially as regards staffing levels and recruitment. I want to assure the House of his and the Government's concern and determination to address the difficulties of the office as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>Other developments such as the more proactive approach to the management of personal injury claims against the State envisaged by the establishment of a State claims agency will also reduce the burden on the CSSO by reducing the volume of litigation.</P>

      <P>I launched the Government's strategy for the development of the International Financial Services Industry in Ireland last March. <Col N="203" /> The strategy sets out a vision for the development of the International Financial Services Industry in Ireland, building on the success of the IFSC.

Following the strategy's publication, I spoke at a seminar in Dublin Castle on 18 June for industry members and the public sector.</P>
      <P>While the implementation of individual commitments remains a matter for each responsible Department or agency, a public sector group chaired by my Department is co-ordinating and monitoring progress. In addition, the IFSC clearing house group and working groups bring together industry representatives with the different Government Departments and agencies to implement the strategy and address other relevant issues.</P>
      <P>A progress report on the implementation of the strategy is being prepared by the IFSC clearing house group. I expect that this will be completed by the end of this year and submitted to Government early in the new year. I believe that this will show good progress with the priority actions outlined in the strategy and this is reflected in the continued growth and development of the centre.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 and 14 together.</P>
      <P>My Department's strategy statement covering the period 1998-2001 was laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas on 1 May 1998. The major goals for the Department set out therein may be summarised as follows: facilitating the efficient functioning of Government; working to achieve a lasting peace in Northern Ireland; developing a strategic focus for this country's interests and image at international level; working with the social partners to develop and implement national programmes of economic and social development; and the ongoing development of an efficient public service. Work is ongoing on the basis of divisional business plans to achieve these goals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of the overall strategic planning process in my Department, a series of presentations of the business plans to the management advisory committee is currently under way. This will assist in the process of prioritising the work of the Department and the associated resources <Col N="204" /> required. In addition, work is currently under way on a progress report on the strategy statement, as required under section 4 of the Public Service Management Act, 1997. It is anticipated that this work will be completed early in the new year and that copies of the progress report will be laid before both Houses for their information.</P>
    <P>On a related point, the strategic management initiative division of my Department is charged with the ongoing development of an efficient public service which delivers excellent services and in which authority, responsibility and accountability are clearly set out at all levels. The SMI is now moving from design to implementation, and a number of key priorities have been identified for current and future work. These are: deepening the quality customer service initiative; the regulatory reform action programme; freedom of information; new financial management systems; human resource management issues, including performance management and recruitment; and gender equality.</P>
    <P>I am happy with the progress which is being made with regard to all of these areas.</P>
    <P>In addition, my Department has undertaken a comprehensive programme of financial management reform during 1999. This programme includes the implementation of the reforms set out in the strategic management initiative and approved by the Government during 1999, an examination of how greater value for money can be obtained from administrative expenditure, and an assessment of how information technology can be better deployed to improve the service provided by the finance unit. Professional advice has been engaged to assist with the reform process.</P>
    <P>In response to the legislative priorities of my Department for 2000, drafting on a Bill to place the National Economic and Social Council and the National Economic and Social Forum on a statutory footing is at an advanced stage. It is expected that this Bill will be published early in 2000.</P>
    <P>Overall, I consider that my Department has made a significant contribution to moving the agenda forward in relation to the key areas set out in the Department's strategy statement and I am very satisfied with its performance in this regard.</P>

      <P>All Members of the House are aware that we have increased expenditure on a whole range of Government programmes and in particular our capital programmes. As already announced in the national development plan further increases are planned in the programmes and this will allow the Government to further accelerate and bring forward proposals for completion earlier than planned. It is my intention over the life of the Government to deal with as many of the issues brought to my attention by these Deputies as expeditiously as possible.</P>
      <P>This House is well aware of the priority that my Government has given to county roads, water and sewerage treatment, education, tourism and rural development and the additional resources that we have provided for them. Many of the priorities indicated by the Deputies are already priorities for their respective local authorities and indeed some of them are included in the review of the programme for Government and the national development plan.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 19, 20 and 21 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="206" /> As I indicated to the House on 17 November, the negotiations on a new social partnership agreement, which have been under way since 9 November, are subject to confidentiality strictures to protect the negotiating positions of all sides. I can say however that the discussions so far have focused on the broad positions and priorities of the different social partners with a view to identifying an agenda for discussion later on in the negotiations. I am confident that the budget statement this afternoon will inject further momentum into the process, as well as serving to define in a clearer way the macro-economic context within which, for the first year at least, a new agreement will need to be set.</P>
    <P>The National Centre for Partnership, established under Partnership 2000, has undertaken a significant amount of work in the past six months, as agreed by the board. The work undertaken falls into a number of broad categories.</P>
    <P>In the public sector, Working Together &ndash; a training programme for partnership in the public sector, has been developed by the NCP and this training programme is now being delivered within organisations across the civil and wider public service.</P>
    <P>For the private sector, a 13 module training programme and a supporting video has been developed jointly by the NCP, IBEC and ICTU as a very substantial contribution to enterprise level partnership. A business plan for the joint delivery of this programme in early 2000 is being implemented at present.</P>
    <P>The NCP has also been working closely with a number of private and public sector bodies to facilitate the promotion of the concept and implementation of partnership.</P>
    <P>In the private sector, the NCP has conducted a series of regional seminars on the topic of partnership at enterprise level. Both IBEC and ICTU have been active participants in the seminars and the feedback has been positive.</P>
    <P>In September, I also opened an inaugural annual conference on partnership at the enterprise level organised by the NCP. The conference featured contributions at policy level from speakers from Ireland, the UK and Sweden, as well as inputs from practitioners in the areas of partnership.</P>
    <P>In the public service, the development of a database is in hand to monitor the progress being made in the partnership groups in each sector. The intention is to set a best practice standard to assist management and staff to deliver an enhanced working environment and efficient service to the public. It is also intended to use this database to promote more research and development into the partnership process in the public service.</P>
    <P>In addition to the ongoing work of the NCP an evaluation of the progress made on partnership in both the public and private sectors and the associated role of the NCP is currently under way in my Department. It is expected that the consultants engaged to carry out this evaluation will sub<Col N="207" /> mit their report in December. This will form a useful backdrop and context to assist discussions on future action on partnership, post-partnership 2000</P>
    <P>On Wednesday, 24 November I addressed a conference for public sector union officials and activists on the theme of social partnership in Ireland. The aim was to review the future developments of partnership and chapter 10 of Partnership 2000. It was a well attended conference and the National Centre for Partnership will be following up with practical support on the ground on the outcome of the conference.</P>
    <P>In my address to the conference I stressed the importance of our public service being organised and equipped to contribute effectively in order to sustain and enhance the success of social partnership in recent years. We must be flexible and able to respond to the changing environment. Partnership, as the vehicle to modernise our public service, will play a vital part in this process.</P>
    <P>I also referred to the problem we still have of how to reward genuine improvements in performance in the public service. In this context I referred to gainsharing as part of an overall reward-recognition strategy for the public service. The social partners will be addressing this important issue in the context of the negotiations on a new social partnership agreement.</P>

      <P>The CSO included a range of questions on crime and victimisation in the September to November 1998 quarterly national household survey; and published the results on Tuesday, 23 November 1999.</P>
      <P>The CSO's report contains estimates of the level of incidence of crime over a 12 month period and also includes statistics on how people perceive crime and safety in Ireland today. The report showed that crime had affected one in every eight households over the course of the previous year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The CSO survey results are not directly comparable with the crime figures published each year by the Garda Síochána. This is because there are fundamental differences in how the two sets <Col N="208" /> of figures are compiled and classified. While the Garda report provides a very detailed breakdown of indictable and non-indictable offences, the CSO survey gives a more aggregated view of the level of crime. The survey results show that not all crimes are reported to the gardaí. For example, almost 95 per cent of vehicle thefts were reported to the Gardaí whereas the level of reporting of vandalism was under 40 per cent. For most other types of crime, about 60 per cent of incidents are reported. The most common reason for not reporting a crime was that it was not serious enough or there was no financial loss.</P>
    <P>These findings are consistent with the results of the ESRI's 1982 survey of crime in Ireland, and with international experience of comparing crime surveys with police statistics.</P>

      <P>The area based partnerships are funded at present as part of the EU aided Operational Programme for Local Urban and Rural Development 1994-99 co-ordinated by the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation. My colleague Minister of State, Deputy Flood, in a recent statement to the House accepted that the present programmes under this operational programme have made significant achievements in combating disadvantage. I would again state, as he did, that it is the Government's intention that the new national development plan will build on these successes.</P>
      <P>Under the new national development plan £302.4 million has been provided to support a wide range of youth services. The question of continued funding or mainstreaming of youth projects administered by area partnership companies will be progressed in the context of this plan. In the meantime, I understand that the board of ADM, which administers the partnership, has made allocations which will allow activities under current plans to continue into next year.</P>
      <P>Preliminary discussions have taken place between officials of my Department and the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation on the future role of partnerships in tackling educational disadvantage which would include projects for disadvantaged youth. However, these discussions will be continuing to ensure complementarity between the range of national programmes to tackle educational disadvantage and the issues being addressed at more local level by area partnership companies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Existing funding arrangements for schools includes provision for the purpose of providing secretarial and caretaking services in schools. The way in which this provision is made reflects the different management and ownership arrangements for primary and second-level schools and is consistent with the manner in which financial allocations are made to each type of school.</P>
      <P>My Department provides funding towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services in primary schools under two separate schemes. One scheme is the 1978-79 scheme for the employment of school secretaries and caretakers under which my Department meets the full cost of salary and employers' PRSI. This scheme is, however, being phased out as posts become vacant.</P>
      <P>Arising from the Programme for Economic and Social Progress, a second scheme was introduced in 1992 whereby my Department provides additional capitation grants for primary schools towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that I recently announced that, with effect from January next, all primary schools with 100 or more pupils will be eligible for a grant towards secretarial and caretaking services under this scheme. Costing £2.7 million, this improvement will benefit 650 schools serving 90,000 pupils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position in relation to second level is as follows: the allocation of caretaking and secretarial posts in the vocational education sector is made on a scheme wide basis and it is a matter for each committee to deploy the staff as it sees fit. Most schools in this sector have the services of a full-time caretaker and a secretary; community and comprehensive schools have a full-time secretary and caretaker and schools with an enrolment in excess of 500 pupils have two full-time secretaries; and secondary schools with enrolments of 200 or more pupils and not covered by the 1978 scheme, for school secretaries, are in <Col N="210" /> receipt of additional per capita grants towards the provision of caretaking and secretarial services.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that 1 remain committed to improvements in the provision of additional assistance to schools for caretaking and clerical services. The Government's unequalled commitment to education can be seen by the fact that, before today's budget, my Department's allocation for 2000 already stands 45 per cent higher than the figure provided in the 1997 budget. I am confident that, over the next year, we will be in a position to introduce further significant improvements in the area raised by the Deputy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>In May 1997 to coincide with the first examination in the leaving certificate applied, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment launched a promotional campaign in support of the new programme and its graduates. The promotional campaign, which is ongoing includes: an ongoing media campaign which includes exposure on television, national and local radio, and national and regional newspapers particularly in August when the results of the leaving certificate applied examinations are released; production and dissemination of promotional literature; an annual awards ceremony at which I have presented leaving certificate applied students selected from each school with their leaving certificates.</P>
      <P>Since the programme's introduction my Department has fully supported and promoted the leaving certificate applied programme. It has at every opportunity, promoted this innovative and exciting programme among employers in particular, fully recognising that one of the main aims of the programme is to comprehensively prepare students for the world of work. The NCCA liaises directly with bodies such as FÁS, IBEC and the Civil Service Commission as well as with individual employers to build up awareness, recognition and acceptance of the LCA. The aim is to establish the incorporation of the programme into selection and entry criteria for a broad range of employment positions.</P>
      <P>My Department has also established equivalence for the programme with the established leaving certificate, a factor that allows employers to understand the programme's, &ldquo;currency&rdquo; in relation to their own recruitment requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Among those employers who have agreed to accept the LCA for entry level are An Garda Siochána, local authorities, health boards and hospitals, the Civil Service Commission, major banks and a range of others businesses. I am confident that as those employers have come to <Col N="211" /> recognise the skills and qualities achieved through the LCA programme, other employers will wish to share in the benefits of employing LCA graduates. A destination study carried out by the NCCA found that 91 per cent of the graduates of the programme in 1998 proceeded to employment or farther education. The NCCA has also recently published a bulletin to update information on employment training and progression opportunities for holders of the leaving certificate applied.</P>
    <P>Schools offering the programme with the assistance of the national support services in Dublin and Shannon are active in promoting awareness of the programme among local employers. The inclusion of a considerable element of work preparation and work experience in the curriculum for the leaving certificate applied makes such promotion at local level both necessary and relevant.</P>

      <P>The issue of community access to ICT resources in schools is, in the first instance, a matter for individual school authorities. The considerable hardware and software resources made available to the school system by my Department under IT2000 has helped create an ICT resource infrastructure which, in many cases at local level, is made available by innovative schools to a range of community interests.</P>
      <P>The National Centre for Technology in Education, through the schools integration project, has put in place a number of regional and national pilot projects on ICT development in education involving parents and various community groups, including some refugees and asylum seekers. These pilot projects are funded by my Department in partnership with private enterprise and local agencies. It is envisaged that best practice models of community engagement which emerge from these ICT project initiatives will inform future advice to schools as part of the continuing expansion of ICT resources in the education system.</P>
      <P>Increasingly, large urban schools, both primary and post-primary, are providing afternoon and evening access to ICT resources by organising courses in ICT for local groups. Community, comprehensive and VEC schools and colleges continue to offer an expanding range of ICT programmes to the wider local community.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 38 and 44 together.</P>
      <P>I am grateful to the Deputy for giving me an opportunity to comment on this matter. For many years before my appointment as Minister for Education and Science there were neglected demands for funding to be made available for the appointment of escorts on special school transport services. From the outset, I have accepted the valid concerns of parents and school authorities at the dangers to which special needs children can be exposed when travelling unaccompanied on these services.</P>
      <P>In an effort to address this issue, I secured an allocation of £3.4 million to fund the extension of the escort service to all 585 special transport routes in the country. This allocation was additional to the £150,000 already spent annually on the pilot escort scheme which has been in place on 34 special transport routes for some years. Also, as part of this development, I secured approval to increase the payment per escort from the £3,200 per annum, which had applied under the pilot scheme, to £4,995 per escort. I secured these resources on the basis of valid concerns which had been expressed to me by both parents and schools.</P>
      <P>I also took the view, which I still hold, that the most appropriate people to operate the escort scheme are the school authorities which are catering for the children in question on a daily basis and know the children's' needs and behaviours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I assure the House that I appreciate the extra work involved for schools in participating in this scheme. I also recognise the concerns and reservations which some individual schools have expressed at taking on responsibility for the escort scheme. While I appreciate that these concerns are validly held, I would point out that the <Col N="213" /> pilot escort service which has operated on more than 30 special transport routes for a number of years has not presented the difficulties which are now being raised by some schools. While I am somewhat disappointed at the inflexible stance which certain schools appear to be adopting in relation to this matter, I also want to take this opportunity to acknowledge the commitment shown by those schools who have gone ahead and appointed their escorts.</P>
    <P>Nationally, my Department has issued a total of 585 escort grants at a rate of £4,995 per escort. The 585 routes involved serve a total of 156 individual schools. To date, a total of 54 schools involving 119 individual escorts have indicated that they are implementing the scheme. A total of 23 schools involving 134 escorts have indicated that they are not prepared to implement the scheme. I am arranging to provide the Deputy with details of both groups of schools.</P>
    <P>Officers of my Department are currently in discussion with the National Association of Boards of Management in Special Education in an effort to secure the agreement of all schools to implement the scheme as soon as possible. I can assure the House that my Department will make every effort to facilitate a resolution of this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not consider that the anti-social behaviour of a small minority of our young people justifies the Deputy's assertion regarding the younger generation. Nor do I consider that such behaviour can be attributed to a failure of the education system.</P>
      <P>Indeed, I would suggest that the vast majority of our young people are to be commended for the sense of responsibility and community awareness which they repeatedly demonstrate despite the enormous negative pressures to which they are exposed on a daily basis.</P>
      <P>The House will recognise that anti-social behaviour is by no means the sole preserve of our younger generation. It will also recognise that such behaviour among young people, where it does occur, can stem from a variety of factors, many of which are not amenable to correction solely through educational interventions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the Deputy is correct in so far as his question points to the important role which education can undoubtedly play in fostering positive attitudes and behaviours on the part of young people in our society. Both the primary and <Col N="214" /> second-level curricula already place significant emphasis on these areas through social, personal and health education programmes delivered in all schools. In addition, very significant resources are already deployed in supporting pupils who are disadvantaged within the education system.</P>
    <P>As far as children engaging in more serious forms of anti-social behaviour are concerned, I would draw attention to two very important pieces of legislation which are currently before the House and which in my view will have a very positive impact on those young people who engage in anti-social behaviour and who come into conflict with the law as a result.</P>
    <P>The first of these is the Education (Welfare) Bill which will bring about a fundamental change in our approach to the problem of non-school attendance and early school leaving. The House will recognise that non-attendance at school can often be an early indicator of emerging difficulties in the lives of young people.</P>
    <P>The second is the Children Bill, 1999 which will introduce a comprehensive range of measures aimed at deflecting children away from anti-social and criminal behaviour through a range of interventions aimed at addressing the fundamental problems underlying such behaviours. The House will have an opportunity to discuss both of these Bills in the near future.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Deputy's concern to give the people of the country a better quality of life, I would suggest that the social and economic progress which has been achieved under this Government and the manner in which the benefits are being spread across all strata of society provides ample evidence of achievement in this area.</P>

      <P>The group's report outlines a number of recommendations that have implications, not only for my Department, but also for schools, parents and publishers.

    <P>In this regard my Department, at primary and post-primary levels, has initiated an awareness raising campaign by disseminating the report, with an accompanying circular, to all primary and post-primary schools.

Circumstances vary from one school community to another and it would not be appropriate for me to set out a formal and detailed code of behaviour for all schools. However, my Department has issued guidelines to assist schools in discharging their responsibilities in this area. The guidelines outline the general principles to be followed in drawing up and implementing a code of behaviour in schools.</P>
      <P>The Education (Welfare) Bill, 1999 currently before the Houses will, when enacted, require schools for the first time to prepare codes of behaviour which specify the types of behaviour requiring disciplinary measures, the nature of these measures and the procedures to be followed by school authorities. This Bill will bring about a greater degree of uniformity in the way schools approach the issue of discipline generally in our schools.</P>
      <P>Work is under way in my Department on the drawing up of school procedures for dealing with pupil and parent grievances as provided for in the Education Act, 1998. The Act also provides for a statutory right of appeal against decisions of boards of management, including decisions concerning suspension and expulsion. This right of appeal will greatly strengthen the capacity to balance all rights and obligations in this difficult area.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the framework for the administration of our first and second-level schools is set out in the Education Act, 1998. Section 14 of that Act provides for the establishment of representative boards of management, to be agreed by representatives of parents, teachers, school managers and patrons. These boards will be responsible to the school patron for the administration of each school, within the parameters of national educational policy, as set out by the Minister for Education and Science.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is my view that it is important that students <Col N="217" /> should have knowledge of and, where appropriate, be involved in the operation of the school. As I indicated to the Deputy in my reply of 14 October the Education Act provides that students in recognised post-primary schools may establish a student council in their school, and that each board of management shall encourage such establishment and facilitate and give reasonable assistance to students in this venture.</P>
    <P>While it is not my function to establish school councils in individual schools, I am very anxious to ensure that student councils are established widely, so that as many students as possible may benefit from participation in councils and in the operation of their own schools. To this end, in line with the provisions of the Act, I will shortly be issuing draft guidelines on the establishment of student councils, in which I will set out proposals in this regard. I will finalise these guidelines, following consideration of any comments made by interested parties.</P>

      <P>In 1993, there were ten multi-denominational schools with a total enrolment of 2,200 pupils. By 1999, these figures had risen to 23 schools, with a combined an enrolment of 3,578 pupils.</P>
      <P>My Department maintains regular contact with Educate Together and, in this way, remains fully briefed as to the anticipated growth of multi-denominational schools. The most recent information obtained indicates that a further ten such schools are being planned for the future.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the major moves implemented in relation to the purchase of school sites and funding of school building projects will be of major benefit to multi-denominational schools. My Department provided Educate Together with funding of £26,000 in 1997 and £27,000 in 1998 to assist with their operational and administrative expenses. In addition, a grant of £7,500 has issued to the organisation in 1999. An application for increased funding has recently been submitted to my Department and is currently being considered by my officials. I hope to be able to respond to the submission in the near future.</P>

      <P>The programme of substance misuse prevention education for primary schools was developed by my Department in consultation with the partners in education and other relevant interests. This programme is called Walk Tall. The development took place in a small number of primary schools during the school years 1996-97 and 1997-98. On the basis of a positive evaluation of the programme the associated detailed educational resource materials were designed and printed before the end of 1998.</P>
      <P>It was decided to disseminate the programme to all primary schools over a two-year period beginning in early 1999. This dissemination process commenced earlier this year and the programme has now been introduced to approximately 950 primary schools.</P>
      <P>There is a support team of seven teacher trainers, including a national project officer involved in the dissemination process. The administration of the process is located in West Dublin Education Centre which works in co-operation with education centres throughout the country. The detailed educational resource materials are for each class level in primary schools and are provided free of charge to schools as the programme is introduced and after participation by the teaching staffs of the schools in one day training seminars. In addition to these training seminars, the provision of further longer training courses for teachers has begun. It is intended that these longer courses will be available to teachers an ongoing basis.</P>
      <P>Already, 15 of these longer courses have been, or are being, held this year. The costs of designing and printing the resource materials in quantities required amounted to £142,000 before the end of 1998. The farther funds provided for the dissemination in 1999 amounted to £500,000 and £500,000 is to be provided in 2000 to continue the dissemination process.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 47 and 105 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="219" /> A consultancy report, which was submitted to my Department in 1993, dealt with the factors which contribute to the cost of school text books. The main conclusion of the report was that book rental schemes are the most practical way of limiting the cost of school books to parents.</P>
    <P>The report, copies of which were sent to all schools, contains a number of useful suggestions, including a code of good practice for successful operation of book rental schemes. My Department endorses the recommendations and urges school authorities to put in place book rental schemes to the greatest extent possible.</P>
    <P>I appreciate, of come, that costs associated with the purchase of school books can place a financial burden on parents. To alleviate such burdens, my Department operates a grant scheme towards the cost of providing school text books for needy pupils in primary and post-primary schools. For the purposes of these grants, a needy pupil is a pupil from a family where there is genuine hardship because of unemployment, prolonged illness of a parent, large family size with inadequate means, singe parenthood or other family circumstances, such as alcoholism, which would indicate a similar degree of financial hardship.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="220" /> Principal teachers administer the book grant schemes in schools in a flexible way under the terms of the schemes based on their knowledge of particular circumstances in individual cases.</P>
    <P>Special grants are provided to schools at second level, which are categorised as disadvantaged, to assist them in the establishment of book loan-rental schemes. At primary level schools that opt for book rental schemes are allocated enhanced grants to encourage schools to participate in such schemes.</P>
    <P>In 1999, £4.463 million has been allocated at second level as aid towards the cost of providing school text books for needy pupils while an amount of £2.585 million has been disbursed at primary level.</P>

      <Quest>his views on the wide disparity of funding between the various education sectors where the pre-school and primary sectors receive the lowest level per pupil and the third level sector receives the highest level per pupil; the plans, if any, he has to continue this trend rather than equalising expenditure in each of the sectors in view of the recently published Estimates; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The cost of providing education at the different levels varies because of the nature and duration of the programmes &ndash; for example preschool programmes typically involve a significantly shorter period than standard primary school day. OECD data indicates that in all member countries third level education has the highest unit cost per student, followed by second level and the primary sector has the lowest unit cost.</P>
      <P>Since 1997 the spending on all levels of education has risen by unprecedented amounts. I have been particularly concerned to improve the position of funding for primary education. In the year 2000 funding for primary education will represent and increase of approximately one-third over the 1997 budget figure. This increase is particularly significant as primary pupil enrolments will have fallen by 32,000 or 7.2 per cent over the same period.</P>
      <P>I have also prioritised capital expenditure at all levels and the capital provision at primary level for 2000 shows an increase of 186 per cent on the 1997 estimate and allows the undertaking of the largest primary school building programme in our history. As a result classes are smaller, schools are better resourced and modernised, and it has been possible to increase the funding to support children with special needs by over 250 per cent.</P>

      <P>I am conscious of the serious supply pressure which exists in relation to student accommodation and, while I have had no discussions with property owners in relation to releasing property for this purpose, I would draw the Deputy's attention to the provisions of section 50 of the Finance Act, 1999. Section 50 was introduced specifically to relieve some of this pressure by providing a scheme of tax relief for the provision of rented residential accommodation in the third level sector.</P>
      <P>For the purposes of the scheme, properties qualifying for relief are areas approved by an eligible educational institution which are either on-campus or within an 8km radius of the main campus. A number of developers have made initial inquiries or submitted applications to educational institutions in respect of developments and to date four such applications have received approval from the educational institutions concerned. As relief will be available under the legislation for expenditure incurred up to 31 March 2003, the opportunity exists to create significant additional accommodation for third level students.</P>

      <P>To be fully recognised to teach at primary level, teachers must have undertaken a recognised primary teaching training course and possess a recognised primary teaching qualification.

    <P>The arrangements outlined above have been put in place for this school year as a short-term measure to overcome the difficulties caused by the shortage of fully qualified primary school teachers. It is expected that by paying such persons at the trained rate of pay, it will be attractive for them to teach in primary schools. While it is accepted that they are not qualified primary school teachers, in my view it is the best option in resolving the current difficulties in the short-term.</P>
    <P>In addition to the measure outlined above, last year I put in place arrangements for primary degree holders with a Higher Diploma in Education to be paid at the trained rate of pay in respect of any substitute work which such persons undertook. It is not a requirement for persons with such qualifications who are engaging in substitute work to possess a grade C in Irish as substitute work is normally of a much shorter duration than temporary work.</P>
    <P>There is no question, however, of granting full recognition to holders of a BA and a Higher Diploma in Education for primary teaching purposes.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 54 and 58 together.</P>
      <P>All post-primary schools in the country have access to the National Educational Psychological Service Agency. Approximately 700 primary schools also have access to the service. The management of the agency is currently drawing up a development plan for the phased expansion of its service. The Civil Service Commission has completed interviews for an additional 25 psychologists and has also completed the short-listing process for a further 25 psychologists. The successful applicants from the first competition will begin to take up their positions early in the new year. The interviews for the second group will also commence shortly. It is envisaged that all schools will have access to the psychological service by the end of a five-year developmental period beginning in 1999.</P>

      <P>Neither my Department nor the Higher Education Authority compiles student statistical information by reference to religious denomination and there are no plans to compile such information. The statistical information on the numbers of full-time students from Northern Ireland studying at third level institutions is set out on the accompanying table for the years 1993-94 to 1997-98, the five most recent years for which this data is available.</P>
      <P>I expect the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement will encourage and facilitate greater mobility of students of all denominations within the island of Ireland.</P>

      <P>The present provision for speech therapists involves a four year programme in the school of clinical speech and language studies at Trinity College Dublin. Graduates of the course are professionally recognised as speech and language therapists. The number of graduates from the course over the last three years was 1996-97, 19; 1997-98, 25; and 1998-99, 25.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the expert group, established in accordance with Labour Court Recommendation No. 15515 to examine issues relating to certain paramedic grades, including speech therapists, is expected to report to the Minister for Health and Children by the end of 1999. The group will include consideration of the adequacy of graduate output and training arrangements. In <Col N="226" /> the course of the group's work the employers acknowledged that there were recruitment difficulties with some of the paramedic grades and officials of the Department of Health and Children have met with the heads of the schools and are currently planning a manpower exercise to address these difficulties.</P>
    <P>The number of psychology graduates in 1997, the latest figures available is as follows; 168 graduated with a primary degree, and 53 graduated with a higher degree. Of the higher degree graduands, six graduated with an MA in educational psychology.</P>

This tuition is normally provided on contract and the provision is now being co-ordinated by the refugee language support unit, established in March 1999 in Trinity College with funding support from my Department. The unit's functions include co-ordinating the provision of English language training for all refugees, commissioning the development of English language proficiency benchmarks and assessment procedures for refugees, establishing a database to record and monitor the progress of those availing of training courses, and developing support for teachers of refugees in the forms of training and learning materials. The unit's functions are fulfilled in co-operation with the Refugee Agency, the Department of Education and Science, FÁS and refugee groups themselves. In addition, refugees and immigrants are among the groups catered for as part of the adult literacy programme provided by the vocational education committees.</P>

      <P>Since 1972 my Department has conducted a series of national reading surveys. The most recent of these surveys in 1993 and in 1998 focused on the reading achievements of pupils in fifth class. A national survey of the mathematics achievements of pupils in fourth class was conducted in May of this year and the data are being processed at present.</P>
      <P>It is my intention that national surveys should be more frequent and closely linked with international surveys thereby providing more timely and meaningful comparison which will be a real, benefit to all engaged in education.</P>
      <P>The vast majority of primary schools already engage in annual assessments of the reading and mathematics attainments of their pupils at the different class levels from first to sixth. This enables schools to monitor their pupils' performance and report to parents on their children's progress. Schools can also compare their performance against the national norms of standardised tests. The results of these tests are made available to inspectors on their visits to schools. Results are not used to compare schools at local level. Such comparisons would be meaningless because of the different composition of pupil enrolment in different schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="228" /> I will shortly be announcing a national reading initiative which will take place in the coming year. This announcement will also address the role of literacy testing and the stages at which it takes place in primary schools.</P>

      <P>The position generally is that the school transport scheme provides a basic service for children, primarily those residing in rural areas, who might otherwise have difficulty in attending their nearest school regularly. Accommodation on school transport is used to maximise the carrying capacity for eligible and fare paying pupils. No provision is made under the scheme for parents or guardians to accompany their children to school.</P>
      <P>With regard to urban areas, as schools are generally closer to pupil's homes, fewer pupils are eligible for transport under the terms of the scheme. Where pupils are eligible for transport and reside within range of public scheduled transport, they are issued with term tickets on these services. As in the case of rural services there is no provision for accompanying parents or guardians.</P>
      <P>The information sought by the Deputy regarding the percentages of children residing in rural and urban areas who qualify for school transport is not available. My Department has no plans at present to review the school transport scheme specifically in relation to urban areas.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that considerable co-operation and collaboration exists across <Col N="231" /> all aspects of third level education. These include initiatives funded under EU programmes such as INTERREG and the Special Support Programme for Peace and Reconciliation. Projects at Letterkenny, Dundalk and Sligo Institutes of Technology have benefited from co-funding arrangements under INTERREG. Two recent initiatives funded under the Special Support Programme for Peace and Reconciliation and co-funded by both administrations, north and south are: the Queen's University-Dublin City University joint initiative &ndash; the Centre for Cross Border Studies. This is a university based project set up to research and develop ideas for practical cross-border co-operation; the Letterkenny Institute of Technology-University of Ulster joint initiative &ndash; SME Innovative Growth which involves the development of business management skills with small-medium enterprises in the Border area of north west of northern and southern Ireland.</P>
      <P>It is my wish to actively promote inter-institutional co-operation at third level and indeed at all levels of the education sector within the framework of the Good Friday Agreement. This is reflected in the commitment in Chapter 9 of the National Development Plan &ndash; a Common Chapter in the respective plans, North and South. This recognises that the valuable linkages which have been developed, provide the basis to establish more closely integrated, coherent approaches in the future between both education sectors in the future. Among the types of activities which the Common Chapter identified for possible promotion are: inter-active approaches and at university and further education level, in areas such as R &amp; D support for SMES; and the development of lifelong learning.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware, in this context, that under the direction of the North-South Ministerial Council, both administrations intend, in our common interests, to take forward and enhance co-operation in these and other agreed areas in the future.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since my appointment as Minister for Education and Science I have taken a number of significant initiatives to address educational disadvantage at all levels in the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In December, 1998 I announced a major £57 million package of measures to address the issue <Col N="232" /> of educational disadvantage. The measures in question included the extension of the remedial teacher service to every first and second-level school in the country and the extension of the home-school-community liaison service to all first and second-level schools with disadvantaged status. Both of these developments were put in place from the commencement of the current school year.</P>
    <P>Also, in 1998 I introduced the eight to 15 year old early school leavers programme. This programme, which is currently operating in 14 disadvantaged areas, is testing models of response to the problem of early school leaving. The objective is to integrate successful models into mainstream policy and practice. A total of £3.68 million is being expended on this programme over the 1998-99 and 1999-2000 school years.</P>
    <P>In addition, I have recently introduced a new &ldquo;Stay in School&rdquo; initiative which will focus on developing programmes to encourage pupils to remain in second level schools. A total of £12.5 million will be expended on this initiative over the next three years and 58 schools have recently been selected to participate in the scheme.</P>
    <P>This year, provision was made for the allocation of 225 additional teachers to second level schools. This, together with the retention of 130 teachers who would otherwise have been redeployed, has enabled us to bring all disadvantaged second level schools into the home-school-community liaison scheme.</P>
    <P>Since January, 1999 the local contribution for capital works in respect of disadvantaged schools is capped at £10,000.</P>
    <P>While I will continue to make every effort to improve the level of resources made available to all schools, I am particularly anxious that children from disadvantaged backgrounds should be given every possible assistance to derive maximum benefit from the education system. I do not regard these objectives as mutually exclusive.</P>
    <P>One of my concerns with the present approach to addressing educational disadvantage is that it lacks the necessary flexibility to target individual pupils or small pockets of disadvantage within the system. The tendency has been to target available resources on schools with the greatest number of disadvantaged pupils. While such schools undoubtedly deserve our support, this approach has tended to ignore the needs of other schools which have lesser but nonetheless serious needs of their own.</P>
    <P>My objective is to develop a more flexible system which will continue to support schools with large concentrations of disadvantaged pupils but will also be responsive to the needs of schools with individual or small groups of disadvantaged pupils throughout the country.</P>

      <P>I propose taking Questions Nos. 68 and 86 together.</P>
      <P>In setting up the commission to inquire into child abuse the Government set out broad terms of reference which included the following: To establish as complete a picture as possible of the causes, nature and extent of physical and sexual abuse of children in institutions and in other places during the period from 1940, or such earlier date as the commission considers appropriate, to the present, including the antecedents, circumstances, factors and context of such abuse, the perspectives of the victims and the motives and perspectives of the persons responsible for committing abuse.</P>
      <P>The commission was asked, as a first step towards carrying out their inquiries, to consider their terms of reference and recommend any changes to them they considered necessary. On foot of this the commission recommended in an initial report to the Government on 7 September 1999 that the commission should conduct its investigative role by making findings of fact in relation to general allegations that abuse was prevalent in a particular institution at a particular time with consequential findings ascribing responsibility to, among others, the statutory or other bodies charged with the duty of regulating the institutions. The Government agreed in principle to this approach on 15 September.</P>
      <P>It is clear therefore that the commission will be in a position to conduct very wide ranging inquiries which would include inquiries into the state of knowledge of local authorities, health boards and Government Departments of the extent of child abuse in institutions and schools and the action taken by such authorities in discharge of their responsibilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The commission made its final report on its terms of reference and powers on 14 October 1999 after which the Government approved the drafting of a Bill placing the commission on a statutory basis and conferring on it sufficient powers and protections to enable it to conduct its <Col N="234" /> inquiries as effectively as possible. This Bill will be published within the next few weeks and I propose at that time to publish the reports of the commission. It is also my intention that the Bill will be debated in this House and Seanad Eireann as soon as possible after it is published so that the commission can proceed with its hearings and inquiries as early as possible next year.

      <P>I recently announced details of an additional round of allocations under the existing Schools IT 2000 programme. These grants amount to £9.77 million and are focused on a number of areas and, in particular special needs, guidance and staff support.</P>
      <P>To support the integration of ICTs into teaching and learning, every school recognised for grant purposes under the free education scheme will be provided with grant aid of £4 per pupil for the purchase of educational software. Schools may opt to spend some of the grant on hardware if this is more appropriate to local needs. The NCTE will, through the ScoilNet web site, provide all schools with wide-ranging advice on software purchase. The ScoilNet site will also include software reviews compiled by experienced teachers. Schools will ensure that an appropriate selection of software is made available for children with special needs enrolled in each school.</P>
      <P>To assist the integration of ICTs into the education of children served by remedial teachers and resource teachers for children with disabilities, a grant of £700 will be made available to support the work of each of the teachers concerned. The number of serving remedial teachers is 1,463 and the number of serving resource teachers for children with disabilities is 285. The grant may be used for the purchase of relevant hardware and/or software items e.g. literacy and numeracy software, for the remedial and resource teacher service.</P>
      <P>In 1998 I established a fund of £0.25 million to enable the provision of ICT equipment for individual special needs pupils. I propose to increase the fund to £0.5 million for 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the above, the special education section of my Department makes funding available for the acquisition of specialised equipment for children with special needs. In the current <Col N="235" /> year at total of £800,000 has been allocated under this heading.</P>
    <P>It is my intention to continue to target such support where an assessed level of need has been identified.</P>

      <P>The White Paper will set out Government policy on early childhood education and will provide a blueprint for the development of the sector for the future. Initial work on the preparation of the White Paper began last year, when I convened the National Forum for Early Childhood Education. This forum provided an opportunity for all those involved in the area of early childhood education to come together and to share their views on future policy for early childhood education. The report on the forum, which was compiled by an independent secretariat, was published in November 1998 and constitutes a major input to the White Paper preparation process.</P>
      <P>Officials in my Department have been working hard on the drafting of the White Paper, taking account of the latest national and international research-findings; provision by other Government Departments and agencies and non-Governmental organisations. In addition, the systems of provision in other developed countries have also been examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The White Paper will set out a range of proposals covering early education for children aged from birth to six years. These include the development of very young children in the home, <Col N="236" /> supports to parents concerning how best to help their children to learn, a wide range of supports for private providers and voluntary-community groups and a strategy to enhance the quality of infant education in primary schools.</P>
    <P>The principal aim will be to raise standards and improve quality of provision of early childhood education services. While quality of provision generally will be addressed, particular attention will be given to the needs of those most in need of assistance including children with special needs and children who are educationally disadvantaged.</P>
    <P>I am happy to advise the Deputy the White Paper will be published before Christmas.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that an additional £3.4 million has been made available, with effect from September 1999, over two <Col N="237" /> years, to extend the escort scheme to every special school transport route and to provide safety harnesses. My department has issued 585 escort grants to the management of the schools concerned.</P>
      <P>Grant payments for safety harnesses are processed on the basis of applications from individual schools. My Department will shortly be writing again to the schools involved in the special school transport scheme to advise of the funding available for harness provision.</P>
      <P>The loading on all school buses is determined by the relevant sections of the road traffic regulations (construction, equipment and use of vehicles) which are laid down by the Department of the Environment and Local Government. Under PSV regulations, the licensed carrying capacity of all vehicles engaged in school transport is based on a ratio of three pupils for every two adult seats. Great care is taken to ensure that loading does not exceed the maximum legal carrying capacity of the different bus types in use. Bus Éireann complies with these regulations and all other relevant safety legislation.</P>
      <P>I should emphasise that safety on school transport is of paramount importance to my Department and Bus Éireann, who operate the scheme on behalf of my Department.</P>

The extension of the schemes at that time did not include courses at postgraduate level and accordingly, there is no grant aid available for students pursuing postgraduate studies abroad, irrespective of whether or not that course is available in Ireland.</P>
      <P>I have no plans to extend the current arrangements and indeed, I should point out that any extension of the current arrangements to provide for students pursuing post-graduate courses in the United Kingdom and in the EU generally, could only be considered in the light of available resources and other competing demands within the education sector.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 75 and 97 together.</P>
      <P>I set up a working group in autumn 1997 to examine the potential problems caused by the weight of heavy school bags. The terms of reference of the working group were to consider the issue of heavy school bags and in particular; the extent of the problem: the factors which contribute to the problem; and possible implications of the problem, particularly for the health of pupils.</P>
      <P>The group was also asked to formulate proposals to alleviate problems associated with the weight of schoolbags. The group presented its report to me in July 1998.</P>
      <P>The group's report outlines a number of recommendations that have implications, not only for my Department, but also for schools, parents and publishers. One of the main recommendations relates to the need to heighten the awareness of the potential health hazards posed by excessively heavy schoolbags.</P>
      <P>In this regard my Department, at primary and post-primary levels, has initiated an awareness raising campaign by disseminating the report, with an accompanying circular, to all primary and post-primary schools. Furthermore, information leaflets and posters have also been distributed to all schools which will highlight the potential health hazard of heavy schoolbags and outline a range of local measures that can be adopted in order to alleviate the problem. It is a matter for each individual school to choose those measures that would be most suitable to its individual needs.</P>
      <P>The report also recommended that my Department should examine the feasibility of providing for appropriate storage facilities in future specifications for furniture manufacturers. Accordingly, the building unit of my Department will be examining the possibility of incorporating storage facilities in the provision of furniture in the future. The report further recommended that my Department should continue to afford schools the option of book storage in the case of new second level schools, which continues to be the case.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that I have introduced a major expansion of the remedial teaching service to first and second level schools. My priority was to ensure that all schools, who were without a remedial teaching service, would have access to one with effect from September 1999. This has resulted in a remedial teacher service now being available to all schools with a pupil teacher ratio of 10:1 or above. Schools with a pupil teacher ratio of below 10:1 are free to make a case for such support to my Department.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that this represents a huge on-going investment in remedial services. The caseloads assigned to the newly appointed remedial teachers who are operating on a shared basis are in line with the recommendations of the special education review committee.</P>
      <P>I am aware that there may be individual instances within the overall service where adjustments to caseloads may be required. I can assure the Deputy that the needs of such remedial clusters will be fully considered in the event of additional resources becoming available to improve existing services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Traditional definitions of illiteracy, as an absolute, are generally not found useful by researchers. Most recently, researchers have adopted various measures of functional literacy to determine the number of people with serious literacy problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an estimate from the National Survey of English Reading (1993) that about 6.5 per cent-9.5 per cent of pupils at 11 years of age have serious literacy difficulties. International surveys conducted by the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement <Col N="240" /> (IEA) in 1991 indicate literacy levels for Irish nine and 14-years olds of just above the international average. Further analysis of the data on the Irish 14-year olds indicated that between 6.5 per cent-8.5 per cent had serious literacy difficulties.</P>
    <P>The revised primary curriculum has been sent to all schools during this term. There is an increased emphasis in the English curriculum on raising literacy standards through the development of reading skills as part of a whole-language process. A significant programme of in-career development of teachers in regard to the introduction of this revised curriculum is well under way.</P>
    <P>The new leaving certificate English syllabus has a particular emphasis on literacy and follows on from the revised junior certificate syllabus. Greater attention is given to comprehension and composition thereby enhancing the development of literacy skills directly related to the three areas covered in the IALS study (1997).</P>
    <P>School development planning guidelines have been issued to schools at first and second levels.</P>
    <P>This initiative should ensure that there is a whole-school approach to literacy development and extension and a whole-school responsibility for raising standards in this area. An important focus of this whole-school planning will be to prevent reading difficulties and to identify and address the needs of pupils with literacy and other learning difficulties at the earliest possible time.</P>
    <P>The remedial teaching service has been increased and now comprises of 1,463 remedial teachers to cover all primary schools. There are over 500 remedial teachers in second level schools who support pupils with diagnosed literacy and other learning difficulties. The allocation of these teachers should have an impact in reducing the numbers of those with serious literacy difficulties. Revised guidelines on remedial education which are in the final stage of preparation will sharpen the focus of work in this area and tackle deficiencies identified in the survey of remedial education. The general improvements in the staffing of primary schools, coupled with the £6.5 million allocated to schools for the purchase of library books will be of major benefit in raising reading standards and in reducing literacy difficulties.</P>
    <P>A range of schemes is already in place in disadvantaged areas and these consist of the early start pre-school project, the Breaking the Cycle pilot project, the home-school community liaison scheme, the eight &ndash; 15 year old early school leavers initiative and the stay in school retention initiative at second level. All of these should have a positive effect on raising standards of literacy in these schools. It is planned to extend the provision of the psychological service to all schools and resource teaching services to schools where a need for such has been diagnosed.</P>
    <P>The results of the international adult literacy survey (1997) indicated that 24 per cent of Irish adults (aged 16-65) as a whole had very low liter<Col N="241" /> acy skills, and that 16 per cent of those adults between the ages of 16 to 25 years functioned at the lowest level, indicating serious literacy difficulties. Low literacy levels were strongly associated with low education levels, early school leaving, and were more prevalent among older adults and the unemployed.</P>
    <P>Provision for adult literacy has increased from a base of £0.850 million in 1997 when this Government took office, to £5.665 million in 1999. There will be a further increase to £7.825 million next year. The Government's Green Paper &ldquo;Adult Education in an Era of Lifelong Learning&rdquo; which was published late last year recommended that investment in this area should increase to at least £10 million per annum on a phased basis, and this will be further progressed in the context of the national development plan.</P>
    <P>A range of initiatives have been progressed as part of the expansion of the adult literacy service to date in co-operation with the VECS, the National Adult Literacy Agency, and training and employment interests. These include: establishment of an adult literacy development fund to support awareness, outreach, referral networks and flexible provision; a doubling of the numbers availing of the service to l0,000 and the development of innovatory approaches such as family learning programmes, distance learning, and services for specific groups such as travellers, those with special needs, refugees and immigrants etc; staff development initiatives, including the commissioning of programmes leading to national certification; piloting of literacy over the radio and an evaluation of this; development of a quality framework for the service; initial commissioning of a programme of TV literacy; development of an adult guidance service on a pilot basis.</P>
    <P>An interdepartmental committee on literacy for the unemployed has also been convened by my Department, which is working with the National Adult Literacy Agency, FÁS, the local employment service, the vocational education committees and the Departments of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Social, Community and Family Affairs on the development of an integrated strategy in this area. In that context, a number of joint literacy projects with the FÁS-funded community employment scheme are under way and are now being expanded to all FÁS regions.</P>

      <P>In requesting Government approval for the publication of the Education (Welfare) Bill, 1999, I did not set out in any detail the resources that would be required. In my view it would have been premature to decide on those matters in detail before the precise legislative scheme as passed by the Oireachtas was known.</P>
      <P>The enactment of the Education (Welfare) Bill is now at an advanced stage and I expect that it will be enacted early next year. Thereafter I propose to implement the enacted Bill in a phased, planned way as soon as practicable. To facilitate the implementation of the Bill next year the recently published estimate for my Department contained a sum of £250,000.</P>

They include the introduction of a maximum average class size of 30 in ordinary schools for the 1999-2000 school year.

      <P>On 22 June 1999 I wrote to the person concerned enclosing a copy of the statement referred to by the Deputy and informed him of my intention to bring it to the attention of Senator Pat Gallagher who had shown an interest in the case. On 6 July 1999 solicitors for the person concerned replied to my letter and outlined certain provisions which they requested should be made in advance of the release of the document. These provisions included releasing a statement by the person concerned at the same time giving his account of the meeting the subject of the earlier statement and clarification of certain contacts which solicitors claimed he had with, among others, the Department of Education from 1982 to 1992. There is disagreement between the var<Col N="244" /> ious accounts of the meeting and the further contacts which I would like, if possible, to clarify in advance of the release of the various statements to members of the Houses of the Oireachtas. Because of scheduling difficulties it has not been possible to arrange a meeting up to now with the solicitors concerned. However, a meeting has now been provisionally arranged for next week, subject to the availability of the solicitors and their clients, including the person concerned. I expect to be in a position after that meeting to make the statements available.</P>

      <P>Since 1997 the funding allocated to primary and secondary schools have been increased substantially in accordance with the Government's commitment to giving education a clear priority in the allocation of resources as set out in the policy document &ldquo;An Action Programme for the Millennium&rdquo;. However, the available data does not facilitate valid comparisons to be made between the levels of grants paid and the actual costs of running schools.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, the standard capitation grant at primary level was increased by £5 in 1998 and £10 in 1999 which brought the standard grant to £60 per pupil. This constitutes a 33% increase over the period. In addition, the grant will be increased by a further increase of £11 next year. In relation to voluntary secondary schools, the standard per capita grant was increased to £184 from £177 this year with a further increase of £8 planned for next year. In addition, schools also benefited from the IT 2000 initiative and the library books grant.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that these increases represent a meaningful response to demands for increased funding from schools. I am committed to improving further the funding position of primary and secondary schools in the context of forthcoming budgets and in light of available resources.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Nos. 85 and 118 together.</P>
      <P>Subsequent to the report of Sir Ron Dearing on the future of higher education, the UK authorities introduced a number of changes in the financial support arrangements for students pursuing courses at further and higher education institutions. This included the introduction of an annual tuition fee for students entering further and higher education institutions for the first time from the 1998-99 academic year and the replacement of maintenance grants by student loans to be phased in from that year also.</P>
      <P>All EU students, including Irish students, are eligible for grant assistance towards the tuition fee subject to the same conditions as apply to UK students. This means that students from lower income families will receive full grant assistance towards the cost of their tuition fees.</P>
      <P>Data available on the number of Irish students studying in the UK (including Northern Ireland) indicate that in 1998-99 there were 13,250 full-time higher education students from the Republic attending colleges of further and higher education in the UK. Of these 2,896 were first time entrants. The figure for 1999-2000 shows a decrease to 2,368 first time entrants, a drop of almost 600 students. My Department does not have figures available on the numbers of full-time further education students from the Republic attending colleges of further and higher education in the UK.</P>
      <P>There are a range of factors that influence student choices as to study at home or elsewhere such as in the UK. In this regard, I would point out that this Government has provided for a substantial increase in the number of further and higher education places over recent years.</P>
      <P>I have previously outlined my position that I do not intend to reintroduce tuition fees at third level. Accordingly, I have no plans to initiate a harmonisation of student financial support between the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom.</P>
      <P>With regard to the recognition of academic qualifications, the objects of the Qualifications (Education and Training) Act, 1999, enacted during the summer, include the promotion of recognition outside the State of awards made by bodies in the State and the recognition in the State of awards made by bodies outside the State. Once the Act is brought into operation, it will be a function of the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland to liaise with bodies outside the State which make education and training awards for the purposes of facilitating the recognition in the State of education and training awards made by those bodies and also facilitate recognition outside the State of education and training awards made in the State.</P>
      <P>There are also European Union directives on the general system for the recognition of higher education diplomas and professional education and training, which apply to all member states.</P>

      <P>My Department has responsibility for five residential facilities for juvenile offenders. Four of these centres cater for young male offenders and one caters for young female offenders. Details of the current operating capacity of each of these facilities and the number of children detained in each case are set out in the following tables.</P>
      <P>The Children Bill, 1999, will have significant implications for the future operation of the juvenile offender system and the custodial facilities operated under my Department. In particular, arising from the Bill, these facilities will be required to cater for children whose behaviour is seriously unruly or depraved and children who have serious therapeutic needs. In the past, the juvenile offender facilities have not been equipped to cater for such cases.</P>
      <P>In order to meet its obligations under the Children Bill, my Department has reviewed its overall provision for juvenile offenders and has embarked on a five year development plan. This plan envisages the phased development of up to 24 additional places for young male offenders and up to eight additional places for young female offenders over this period.</P>
      <P>The plan will be reviewed on an ongoing basis and adjusted if necessary to take account of wider developments under the Children Bill. In particular, the impact of the non-custodial interventions contained in the Bill on the number of children placed into custody.</P>

      <P>A range of measures are ill place to further the promotion of equality of access to third level education. The need for a holistic approach to promote equality rather than policies focused only on the third-level sector and on the transition from second to third level, is well established.</P>
      <P>In relation to measures specifically targeted at third level, the third level colleges have developed initiatives to tackle the problem of access for the disadvantaged to third level education, through targeted funding provided to the universities by the Higher Education Authority and funding from within the overall financial allocations to the institutes of technology. These initiatives involve links with second-level schools and local communities.</P>
      <P>The programmes in place assist some students to meet the points requirement for courses, enabling them to obtain a college place through the standard CAO entry procedure. The other aspect of the programmes is the special entry arrangements through which more flexible entry criteria are applied and various supports put in place for students entering by this method.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The disadvantaged fund was introduced in 1996 and is administered by the Higher Education Authority. Funds have been allocated as follows:<Col N="249" /></P>

    <P>A £6.9 million two-year funding initiative to tackle educational disadvantage in the third level sector was announced in the context of the 1999 budget. Of this funding, £3 million is being specifically allocated to promote access to third level amongst students from disadvantaged backgrounds including people with disabilities. £2.4 million of the funding initiative has permitted the higher, non-adjacent rate of grant to be paid to all eligible mature students under the student support schemes with effect from the 1999-2000 academic year. The balance of £1.5 million is being provided to address the issue of non-completion of courses in important parts of the third level system. My Department has had discussions with the access officers of the colleges, the Union of Students in Ireland, the Higher Education Authority and other interested bodies in relation to this funding and I will be announcing further details very soon.</P>
    <P>The national development plan, 2000-2006, establishes education as a key priority of Government. The plan provides for a third level access fund totalling £95 million. Building on the existing arrangements, the development of third level access is necessary to promote the participation of students with disabilities, students from disad<Col N="250" /> vantaged backgrounds and mature &ldquo;second chance&rdquo; students. The objective of this measure is to facilitate and improve access to the labour market for the beneficiaries whilst improving their long-term employability through enhancing their educational qualifications.</P>

      <P>My Department provides funding towards the cost of secretarial services in primary schools under two separate schemes. One scheme is the 1978 scheme for the employment of school secretaries under which my Department meets <Col N="251" /> the full cost of salary and employer's PRSI. This scheme is, however, being phased out as posts become vacant.</P>
      <P>In late 1985 two pension schemes for school secretaries in the 1978 scheme &ndash; a superannuation scheme and a spouses' and children's scheme &ndash; were introduced. Staff employed at that time were given an option to join these schemes, but all new appointees became compulsory members of the schemes.</P>
      <P>Arising from the Programme for Economic and Social Progress, a second scheme was introduced in 1992 whereby my Department provides additional per capita grants for primary and secondary schools towards the cost of secretarial services. These grants are paid as additions to the standard per capita grant. Through the discretion afforded by the per capita scheme, primary and secondary schools apply diverse arrangements for secretarial services. Secretaries employed by schools are employees of the individual schools and my Department does not have any role in determining the pay and conditions under which they are employed. These individualised arrangements preclude the introduction of a central superannuation scheme.</P>

      <P>The result dates for the certificate examinations are a function of the timing of the actual examinations and the time required for marking the scripts and processing the results.</P>
      <P>While my Department makes every effort to issue results as early as possible, it must be recognised that there are real constraints on making any significant improvement in respect of the junior certificate if the issue date of the leaving certificate is not to be affected. Given that there is a finite pool of suitably qualified examiners my Department ensures that the number of examiners engaged in the leaving certificate marking process is adequate to enable the result deadlines to be met. This is possible because the later issue of junior certificate results provides, where necessary, additional time to examiners undertaking the marking of the junior certificate.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the recent suggestion by the General Secretary of INTO that up to 500 more remedial teachers might be needed to improve the reading and writing skills of pupils; the steps, if any, he is taking to provide additional remedial teachers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The primary focus in education will always be the prevention of literacy and numeracy difficulties and the helping children within the class. Primary teachers are trained in relation to a variety of reading problems, including those which are accompanied by perceptual difficulties. The majority of pupils with remedial needs are helped within the scope of the normal teaching service. This has been clearly established as the most effective and important approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However it is acknowledged that remedial teachers constitute the main additional resource for addressing the problem of underachieving in primary schools. Remedial teachers are a particularly important resource in catering for children with less serious learning difficulties by directly <Col N="253" /> teaching individuals or small groups or, crucially, acting as a leader in the class and school approach to helping every child achieve high literacy and numeracy standards.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that I recently introduced a major expansion of the remedial teaching service to first and second level schools. My priority was to ensure that all schools which were without a remedial teaching service would have access to one with effect from September 1999. This has resulted in a remedial service being available to all schools with a pupil teacher ratio of 10:1 or above. Schools with a pupil teacher ratio of below 10:1 are free to make a case for such support to my Department. The Deputy will appreciate that this represents a huge ongoing investment in remedial services. As a result of this development there are now 1,463 remedial teachers in the primary system and a further 560 whole time equivalent remedial posts at second level.</P>
    <P>A comprehensive study of the remedial education service has been carried out over the past two years. This study highlighted the need for a much sharper focus on ensuring that the service is targeted on those who need it most. Arising from this study, I have published a comprehensive review of the remedial service which outlines very significant areas which need to be addressed to improve its impact in our schools. We must make sure that we are using the remedial service properly and in a whole school context. We cannot have a situation where we fail to address underlying problems by simply calling for the ongoing expansion of the number of remedial posts in the system. This is not to suggest that there are not schools with insufficient coverage, but if we believe that more resources is the answer to everything to do with remedial provision we will never address the remedial problems in our schools.</P>

      <P>The number of teaching days at primary level undertaken by untrained substitute teachers in the first six months of 1998 were 79,834. In the corresponding period in 1999 a total of 104,762 teaching days were taught by untrained substitute teachers.</P>
      <P>The information in relation to the number of untrained teachers employed in second level schools is not available. It is Department policy that, in as far as is possible second level teachers should teach the subjects in which they are qualified.</P>
      <P>Since coming into office, I have been concerned that there are untrained personnel working within the primary school system. I would take this opportunity to remind the Deputy that I have introduced a range of measures to boost substantially the supply of trained primary teachers. The intake of trainee primary teachers to the Colleges of Education in the 1998-99 session was one thousand and twenty eight and the projected intake in the 1999-2000 academic year is one thousand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Between the 1999 and 2000 academic years a total of 1,380 newly trained teachers are due to graduate from the colleges of education. This <Col N="255" /> includes 180 persons who will graduate prior to the end of the current school year. This represents a huge increase in the number of trained graduates as compared with 1995 when 291 graduated.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that I have approved a number of other initiatives to reduce the number of untrained personnel. B.Ed graduates of St. Mary's College, Belfast who have studied Irish to honours level as an academic subject as part of their teaching qualification are now recognised as fully qualified.</P>
    <P>Since September 1998, all primary degree holders who hold the higher diploma in education are paid as fully trained substitute teachers.</P>
    <P>Montessori trained teachers who successfully completed the course of three years duration at St. Nicholas, Dun Laoghaire, and the AMI which is recognised by the National Council for Educational Awards are also recognised as being fully qualified substitute teachers.</P>
    <P>My decision to recognise fully qualified teachers who trained outside the State to teach in certain categories of schools and classes without the necessity to hold an Irish language qualification is also contributing to an improvement in the supply of trained primary teachers.</P>
    <P>I am confident that these measures will reduce substantially the number of untrained teachers.</P>

      <P>My Department has a number of pilot programmes in place at present to test models of response to the problem of educational disadvantage. In addition, pilot programmes in the areas of teacher support and curriculum developments are also in place.</P>
      <P>The pilot programme currently in place include the following: the early start pre-school pilot programme; the support teacher pilot programme, the breaking the cycle of disadvantage pilot programme; the eight to 15 year old early school leavers pilot programme; the teachers employee assistance scheme and the junior cycle physical education pilot project; the schemes for the disposal of unwanted chemicals from second level schools; the adult education guidance service and the women's education initiative.</P>
      <P>The following is a brief outline for the current position of each programme. The early start pre-school programme has been evaluated and this evaluation will be taken into account when considering the future direction of the project.</P>
      <P>The support teacher pilot programme, which was formerly known as the teacher counsellor programme, was introduced in 1995. This programme is being monitored by my Department on an ongoing basis. I am currently considering the interim evaluation report on the operation of this project.</P>
      <P>The breaking the cycle pilot project was introduced in the autumn of 1996 and is scheduled to operate in the participating schools over a planned five year period. My Department is closely monitoring the operation of the scheme while the Education Research Centre is evaluating it. The future of the scheme as a model for addressing educational disadvantage in urban and rural settings will be considered in the light of the findings in the evaluation report which is due in the year 2001.</P>
      <P>The eight to 15 year old early school leavers initiative, which is operating in 14 project areas from September 1998 to June 2000, is currently testing models of response to the problem of early school leaving, with a view to identifying effective approaches to the problem, which could be replicated across the education system. The initiative is being evaluated by the Children's Research Centre, Trinity College and the final evaluation report is expected in September 1000. The question of expanding this initiative will be considered in light of the outcome of the evaluation of the present pilot phase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The employee assistance scheme for primary and post primary teachers was established during the 1997-98 school year and is due to conclude at the end of the current school year. The pilot scheme currently operates from three education centres and covers teachers in Dublin city and county, Cork city and county and counties Roscommon, Galway and Mayo. The operation of <Col N="257" /> the scheme is being reviewed and based on that review decisions will be taken on the future of the scheme.</P>
    <P>The junior cycle physical education pilot project aims to assist in the development of a new syllabus in physical education and to develop a related model of in-service. The project started in spring 1998. The field work is due to finish this December and a report is expected early in the new year. The project involved 60 teachers from 59 schools and the field work consisted of different schools teaching various areas of a draft syllabus, in-service training for the teachers concerned and evaluation of the process. Decisions concerning the introduction of the new syllabus into schools generally will be taken following the report on the pilot project.</P>
    <P>The pilot scheme for the disposal of unwanted chemicals from second level schools is another initiative. My Department in conjunction with curriculum development unit and the Health and Safety Authority arranged for a training programme to assist and advise all second level schools on the disposal and storage of unwanted chemicals. The programme was conducted in April and June 1998 for science teachers from all second level schools. It is envisaged that this training programme will have enabled schools to review their chemical stocks, to arrange for the safe storage of chemicals which will be required for future use and to arrange for the disposal of unwanted chemicals which can be disposed of safely in accordance with the guidelines already given. The curriculum development unit will update its database of unwanted chemicals held by schools in the context of this further work.</P>
    <P>My Department also established a pilot project in conjunction with the school management authorities and the Health and Safety Authority on the collection of unwanted chemicals which cannot be disposed of by schools themselves. A working group including representatives of my Department, the Health and Safety Authority and the school authorities was established to oversee this pilot project. The project was carried out in a number of community and comprehensive schools in the Dublin area. The results of the project are being evaluated at present and I expect them to be available shortly. On receipt of this evaluation my Department will consider how best all second level schools can be assisted in the disposal of unwanted and unidentified chemicals.</P>
    <P>A pilot adult guidance service is being developed by a working group, set up in September 1999 and representative of the relevant interests and expertise in association with the National Centre for Guidance in Education. The service will be piloted in a small number of urban and rural settings and will cover a selection of programmes in the adult literacy, VTOS, adult and community education fields. At present, applications are being received from local interests who wish to pilot the service in their areas. The question of mainstreaming must await the outcome of the piloting process and will <Col N="258" /> depend on the future availability of resources. However provision has been secured in the overall context of the national development plan for a rapid expansion in this area.</P>
    <P>Under the women's education initiative, which is 75% funded by the European Social Fund, 13 educational projects are being piloted during the calendar years 1998 and 1999. All have the empowerment of marginalised women as their objective. Decisions on the mainstreaming of any of these pilot programmes will be taken in the light of an evaluation of their success, the funding under the national development plan and emerging developments in the White Paper on Adult Education.</P>

      <P>The transition year programme was taken by 23,737 students in 502 second level schools during the school year, 1998-99. Estimated figures for the current year show that, while the number of schools offering the programme may have increased, the number of students remains stable. Every year, a notice is sent out to all schools inviting them to apply to offer the programme. The decision to offer the transition year and the decision to make it compulsory for all students in the year group or not are taken by the individual school.</P>
      <P>The transition year programme has three broad, interdependent aims. They are education for human maturity free from the pressure of the public examinations; the enhancement of students' study-skills, especially the development of a self-reliant, self-motivated approach to study; and to introduce students to the workplace and help them to reflect on that experience.</P>
      <P>I fully espouse these aims and consider that the transition year programme is indeed achieving them in a very large number of schools. This is borne out by evaluations of the programme carried out by my Department's inspectorate as well as by anecdotal evidence.</P>
      <P>The achievement of a high number of points in the leaving certificate examination is not a stated or covert aim of the transition year programme. The longitudinal study of students who sat the junior certificate examination in 1994 and the leaving certificate examination in 1997 was commissioned by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment and carried out by the Educational Research Centre, Drumcondra. It is due to be published shortly. Its finding that taking the transition year programme adds 46 &ldquo;raw&rdquo; points to students' leaving certificate results, or 26 points when certain other advantages are taken out, does not in itself constitute a reason for increasing the number of students taking the programme. It is an interesting finding, nevertheless, in that it proves that parents' fears that students will lose their study skills during transition year are unfounded, and that, on the contrary, the second stated aim of the programme, namely the enhancement of study skills, is being realised.</P>
      <P>Other findings of the same study may be more important than the increase in leaving certificate points. For example, the discovery that taking the transition year programme greatly enhances the prospects of pupils in disadvantaged contexts in the subsequent leaving certificate examination merits careful examination by my Department.</P>

      <P>The Universities Act, 1997, requires each university to prepare a statement of its equality policy addressing, <i>inter alia</i>, access of people who have a disability. Furthermore, the Higher Education Authority has, since 1996, provided targeted funding to the university sector for initiatives designed to promote access to, and participation in, higher education for students with disabilities. In 1999, this funding amounted to £539,000. Examples of initiatives funded to date, of particular relevance to deaf and hearing impaired students, include installation of loop systems, assistive technologies, counselling and other student support services, special alarm systems and staff training and awareness development.</P>
      <P>In addition, the special fund for students with disabilities has operated since 1994 under the aegis of my Department to provide funding to students with disabilities attending courses in third level institutions and, since 1998, post leaving certificate centres. The purpose of the special fund is to provide students with serious physical and-or sensory disabilities with grant assistance towards the cost of special equipment, special materials and technological aids, targeted transport services, personal assistants and sign language interpreters. In 1998, almost £100,000 was allocated to approximately 40 students with hearing impairments. The level of funding allocated to the special fund has increased substantially each year from £80,000 in 1994 to £250,000 in 1998. The arrangements for the 1999 special fund for students with disabilities are currently being finalised and I expect to make an announcement in this regard in the near future.</P>
      <P>The employment of sign language interpreters in the third level sector is a matter for each individual institution.</P>
      <P>The Higher Education Authority is examining a proposal from Trinity College Dublin to establish a centre for deaf studies and is consulting with various interests in the field in relation to the proposal. I understand that it expects to have this consultative process completed early in the new year. I further understand that the question of the availability of sign language interpreters will be considered in this context.</P>

    <P>Ón uair a ceapadh mé bhí imní orm go raibh pearsanra neamhoilte ag obair sa chóras bunscolaíochta. Ba mhaith liom an deis seo a ghlacadh chun a chur i gcuimhne don Teachta go bhfuil réimse beart tugtha isteach agam chun an soláthar bunmhúinteoirí oilte a mhéadú go suntasach. Tógadh míle agus fiche is a hocht bunmhúinteoir faoi oiliúint isteach sna coláistí oideachais sa seisiún 1998-99 agus meastar go nglacfar le míle bunmhúinteoir faoi oiliúint sa bhliain acadúil 1999-2000.</P>
    <P>Idir na blianta acadúla 1999 agus 2000 beidh iomlán de 1,380 múinteoir nua-oilte ar tí a gcuid a gcáilíochtaí a fháil ó na coláistí oideachais. Áirítear ansin 180 duine a gheobhaidh a gcuid cáilíocht roimh dheireadh na scoilbhliana reatha. Is ionann e sin agus méadú mór i líon na gcéimithe oilte i gcomparáid le 1995 nuair a bhain 291 duine cáilíochtaí amach.</P>
    <P>Cuireann sé áthas orm a chur in iúl don Teachta go bhfuil roinnt tionscnamh eile ceadaithe agam chun an líon pearsanra neamhoilte a laghdú. Aithnítear anois mar chéimithe láncháilithe céimithe B.Ed ó St. Mary's College, Béal Feirste, a bhfuil staidéar déanta acu ar an nGaeilge mar ábhar dá gcáilíocht mhúinteoireachta go leibhéal onóracha.</P>
    <P>Ó mhí Meán Fómhair 1998 i leith íoctar gach duine a bhfuil bunchéim acu agus a bhfuil ard-dioplóma san oideachas acu mar mhúinteoirí ionadaíocha lánoilte.</P>
    <P>Aithnítear freisin múinteoirí atá oilte mar mhúinteoirí Montessori agus a chríochnaigh, go rathúil, an cúrsa trí bliana i St. Nicholas, Dún Laoghaire agus an AMI atá aitheanta ag Comhairle Náisiúnta na gCáilíochtaí Oireachais mar mhúinteoirí ionadaíocha lánoilte.</P>
    <P>Tá an cinneadh a thóg mé aitheantas iomlán a thabhairt do mhúinteoirí lánoilte a fuair a gcuid oiliúna lasmuigh den Stát chun gur féidir leo múineadh i gcatagóirí áirithe scoileanna agus ran<Col N="262" /> ganna gan cáilíocht sa Ghaeilge a bheith riachtanach ag cuidiú le soláthar bunmhúinteoirí oilte a chur ar fáil.</P>

      <P>The freedom of the universities to make awards was underpinned in the Universities Act, 1997, where section 13(2)(a) sets out that one of the functions of a university is to award degrees and other qualifications.</P>
      <P>Trinity College Dublin allows bachelors of the university of at least three years standing to proceed to the degree of master in arts. The awards that Trinity College make on this basis, are limited to master in arts. All other masters degrees are awarded only to those who have satisfactorily completed a postgraduate degree programme, either taught or by research. I understand that relatively few have availed of the opportunity to purchase the master in arts award. I also understand that there is no additional recognition to holders of such an award as a result of the receipt of such an award.</P>
      <P>I would expect that in the development of a framework of qualifications, the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland would not add any additional recognition to holders of such masters awards over the degree that they attained at least three years previously and, accordingly, I do not consider that there is an inequality here.</P>

      <P>I am convinced that pre-school education plays a vital role in the development and educational attainment of children. In my view, it has a number of significant benefits &ndash; for the children concerned, for families and for society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Quality early education can have a very positive impact on the future educational and social development of individual children. It can also produce considerable benefits in relation to, and, in my view, is an essential part of, our efforts to encourage long-term educational participation, to <Col N="263" /> break the cycle of disadvantage and to move towards greater equity in society.</P>
    <P>The economic benefits of early childhood education &ndash; in terms of savings on social welfare and health programmes, higher levels of achievement, better social integraton and improved employment prospects &ndash; are also widely recognised.</P>
    <P>My Department's involvement in the area of pre-school education is currently confined to the provision of infant classes in national schools, support for the early start pre-school pilot programme, the Rutland Street pre-school project, and pre-schools for traveller children, and provision for children with special needs.</P>
    <P>The most recent figures available to my Department indicate that on 1 January 1998, there were 540 children aged three and under, and 26,075 children aged four receiving full-time education in national schools.</P>
    <P>The early start pre-school pilot programme, which includes 40 schools, caters for a maximum of 1,680 children between the ages of three and four years of age. The Rutland Street pre-school project currently has an enrolment of 92 pupils. At present there are 56 pre-schools for travellers with approximately 540 traveller children attending. Finally, my Department is currently supporting pilot pre-school provision for autistic children in three locations. These pre-school classes can cater for a maximum of 24 children.</P>
    <P>The forthcoming White Paper on Early Childhood Education will set out Government policy on early childhood education, including in the various areas outlined in the previous paragraph, and will provide a blueprint for the development of the sector for the future. Work on the White Paper is complete, and I hope to be in a position to publish it before Christmas.</P>

      <P>My policy on the teaching of Irish in schools is that which has applied since the foundation of the State. Irish is an important element of the school curricula at both first and second levels. All pupils are required to study the language unless granted an exemption on clearly specified grounds from doing so.</P>
      <P>We in this country are the proud inheritors of a language which predates the introduction of English and is the vehicle for the transmission down through the ages of a rich vein of Gaelic culture, tradition and literature. The ability to speak the language is seen as our most distinctive badge of national identity. There are no plans to modify the position of Irish in the education system.</P>

      <P>Mixed ability grouping is by far the most common system of organisation. One of the principles of the revised primary curriculum recently issued to schools is that provision must be made for individual differences among children. These differences could include differences in style and pace of learning, as well as developmental differences and differences in ability and attainment. The curriculum documents are written to take account of these differences. Class-teaching, group-teaching and individual teaching are all advocated. The availability of supplementary <Col N="265" /> teaching from support teachers such as remedial and resource teachers for those who need it, is envisaged. Sections of the curriculum related to school planning take particular account of differences in ability. Assessment and evaluation of progress is strongly advocated as an essential link in the cycle of planning, teaching, learning and evaluating. Particular emphasis is placed on diagnostic assessment, whereby the difficulties being experienced by individual pupils can be clearly identified and appropriate measures taken to address them.</P>
      <P>At second level, the preferred manner of organising educational experiences within the classroom is by means of mixed ability teaching. This is often used in smaller schools that wish to offer a wide range of subjects. However some schools consider it necessary and desirable to establish homogeneous class groups to meet the individual needs of some pupils. As at primary level the availability of supplementary help through remedial-resource teachers is also utilised in small group or one-to-one situations on occasion.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the recently published UN human development report which suggested that almost 23% of Irish people were functionally illiterate; and the steps, if any, he will take to deal with the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[25376/99]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The UN human development report draws its information from the OECD international adult literacy survey published in 1997. The aim of the survey was not to assess population in terms of literacy or illiteracy, but rather to identify five levels of literacy to cover demands at work, in the home and the community. The survey found that about 25% of the Irish population were found to score at the lowest level, Level 1, performing at best tasks which required the reader to locate a simple piece of information in a text, with no distracting information, and when the structure of the text assists the task. Low literacy levels were strongly associated with low education levels, early school leaving, and were more prevalent among older adults and the unemployed.</P>
      <P>Provision for adult literacy has increased from a base of £0.850 million in 1997 when this Government took office, to £5.665 million in 1999. There will be a further increase to £7.825 million next year. The Government's Green Paper, Adult Education in an Era of Lifelong Learning, which was published late last year recommended that investment in this area should increase to at least £10 million per annum on a phased basis, and this will be further progressed in the context of the national development plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A range of initiatives have been progressed as <Col N="266" /> part of the expansion of the adult literacy service to date in co-operation with the VECS, the National Adult Literacy Agency, and training and employment interests. These include the establishment of an adult literacy development fund to support awareness, outreach, referral networks and flexible provision; a doubling of the number availing of the service to 10,000 and the development of innovatory approaches such as family learning programmes, distance learning, and services for specific groups such as travellers, those with special needs, refugees and immigrants etc; staff development initiatives, including the commissioning of programmes leading to national certification; piloting of literacy over the radio and an evaluation of this; development of a quality framework for the service; initial commissioning of a programme of TV literacy; and development of an adult guidance service on a pilot basis.</P>
    <P>An interdepartmental committee on literacy for the unemployed has also been convened by my Department, which is working with the National Adult Literacy Agency, FÁS, the local employment service, the vocational education committees and the Departments of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Social, Community and Family Affairs on the development of an integrated strategy in this area. In that context, a number of joint literacy projects with the FÁS funded community employment scheme are under way and are now being expanded to all FÁS regions.</P>
    <P>These developments are being accompanied by curricular reforms within the school system, an increased focus on the development of literacy within the context of whole school planning, provision of guidelines school planning, in-career development courses for teacher in this area and in relation to learning difficulties, development of revised guidelines on remedial teaching, enhancement of staffing arrangements so that all schools will have access to a remedial service, an allocation of £6.5 million to schools for the purchase of library books, expansion of the school psychological service, and a range of targeted initiatives aimed at promoting a multi-agency community based approach to improving retention within the school system.</P>

      <P>The appointment of a primary school principal is a matter for the managerial authority of the school.</P>
      <P>The constitution of boards and rules of procedure for boards of management which boards adhere to in making appointments specifies that the established criteria of the selection board must take account of the provisions of the Employment Equality Act, 1977, and the code of practice of the Employment Equality Agency. The board must also ensure that the criteria do not lead to discrimination against any applicant on the grounds of gender or martial status.</P>
      <P>The percentage of female applicants for posts of principals in primary schools who were successful in obtaining posts has increased in recent years. In 1995 the percentage of female applicants who were successful was 20 per cent whereas in 1998, 25 per cent were successful.</P>
      <P>Gender balance in the inspectorate, both at recruitment and promotional grades, has been affected by the relatively small number of female inspectors recruited to the service prior to 1980. Five female inspectors were appointed to the primary inspectorate between 1980 and 1982. Three of these have been promoted to divisional inspector. In 1992 a further competition was held for primary district inspectors. Four inspectors were appointed from this competition between 1992 and 1994 of whom three were female. In 1998 12 inspectors were appointed to the primary inspectorate and five of those were female.</P>
      <P>Prior to 1980, at second level there were relatively few female inspectors. These worked mainly in the areas of home economics and physical education. Since then a further six female inspectors were recruited as part of a small intake of inspectors over the next 15 years. Currently there is one female assistant chief inspector and two female senior inspectors. In the two most recent recruitment drives a total of seven female inspectors have taken up duty as part of an additional group of 14 inspectors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, the gender balance in the primary inspectorate and post-primary inspectorate has been steadily improving since the early eighties. <Col N="268" /> It is the policy of the Department to continue this trend.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that a number of initiatives have been undertaken to identify the underlying causes of motor insurance costs in Ireland, including the high cost of insurance for young drivers. A major report on the economic evaluation of insurance costs completed by Deloitte &amp; Touche in 1996 indicated that there was no uniform market price for motor insurance due to factors such as differing assessments of claims histories by insurers, strategies towards niche markets, specialisation and segmentation of the market. Within these parameters, motor insurers quoted widely different premiums for similar risks and this is characteristic of a competitive market.</P>
      <P>It would appear that the implementation of EU legislation, opening up the EU market to competition from all European insurers, has had a beneficial effect on competition in the Irish market. More recently, the abolition of the cap on brokers commissions should introduce further competition into the market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While mature drivers with good safety records benefit from competition between insurers, in particular segments of the motor insurance market, the Deloitte &amp; Touche report found that young drivers were regarded as a high risk cate<Col N="269" /> gory. It is abundantly clear that the primary focus of initiatives aimed at reducing the cost of motor insurance to young drivers must be on reducing the frequency of accidents and the associated cost of claims. A number of initiatives are in place and are being taken to improve driving standards and safety awareness among all drivers including young drivers. The Irish Insurance Federation, in conjunction with the driving instructors register, has introduced a scheme of insurance premium discounts for the young driver on completion of a required number of driving lessons. The National Safety Council, in co-operation with the gardaí, continues to promote anti-speeding and anti-drink driving media campaigns including road safety educational programmes for secondary school students.</P>

      <P>The new opportunities for women programme, NOW, is a strand of the EMPLOYMENT community initiative which is funded by the European Social Fund and is administered by my Department. The total investment in 71 NOW projects since 1995 will amount to 20.3 million ecu, £15 million approximately, in European Social Funds and 2.1 million ecu, £1.6 million approximately, in European regional development funds. Under the terms of the EU initiative, funds will cease to be committed at the end of 1999 and final payment will take place during 2000.</P>
      <P>My Department has recently allocated a tranche of funds received from the European Commission to the EMPLOYMENT projects. This should relieve any urgent liquidity problems experienced by some promoters, particularly voluntary and community groups. My Department has made a further claim to the European Commission for the outstanding amounts and we expect to receive such funding early in the new year.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 129 and 130 together.</P>
      <P>I am glad to be able to inform the Deputy that there are more than 2.8 million CFLs in use in this country, in addition to other energy efficient forms of lighting. This is an average in excess of two per household. Another related development earlier this year was the introduction of new legislation requiring the energy labelling of certain types of household lighting.</P>
      <P>The distribution of free CFLs can be a valuable strategy in the right context, but it is a strategy that must be suited to market conditions. The promotional and targeted subsidy approach adopted by the Irish Energy Centre in partnership with the ESB and major lamp suppliers has proven to be highly successful as shown by the above figures for CFL use. The ESB is continually looking at ways to increase its demand side management activities including further promotion of CFLs.</P>
      <P>The success of energy efficiency marketing efforts to date and its potential to reduce demand and greenhouse gas emissions has already been recognised by the Government. The Green Paper on Sustainable Energy, which I published in September, recommended a substantial increase in our efforts to improve energy efficiency. These proposals have been followed through in the national development plan where £146 million has been allocated for energy efficiency and renewable energy measures over the period up to 2006. In terms of major investments by the Exchequer, the Estimates for next year provide for a threefold increase in funding for such programmes and I expect a major rate of increase to continue over the coming years. This is an indication of the Government's strong commitment to energy efficiency and to meeting our greenhouse gas obligations under the Kyoto Protocol.</P>

      <P>I am aware of recent complaints by some residents in north Dublin regarding aircraft noise.</P>
      <P>The works, referred to by the Deputy, are being carried out on the rapid exit taxiway at Dublin Airport. The construction of this taxiway, which is an essential element of the ongoing infrastructural improvements at the airport, requires closure of the main runway at night and the consequential use of the secondary runway. As a result, aircraft overfly Santry and Artane. Under normal atmospheric conditions, areas such as Baldoyle, Portmarnock and Howth would be unaffected by these operations.</P>
      <P>Work on the taxiway is scheduled for completion by the end of January 2000. Aer Rianta assures me, however, that every effort is being made to complete the works as soon as possible, subject to the constraints of weather and operational delays.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have previously stated in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 87 of 19 October 1999, I can advise the Deputy that, in relation to comments by members of the Defence Forces on political matters, Defence Force regulations prescribe as follows:</P>
      <P>The granting of interviews or the divulging of information by any officer or man of the Permanent Defence Force to members of the public on matters pertaining to the service or to the conduct thereof is forbidden.</P>
      <P>Comment, if any, in publications, lectures, broadcasts or talks, touching on questions of a political nature &ndash; whether national or international &ndash; shall avoid strictly any reference which might be construed as being of a controversial nature.</P>
      <P>There are no formal guidelines which apply specifically to senior officers. However, a tradition of strict political neutrality has governed senior public service managers since the foundation of the State and senior military officers have always been governed by that tradition. In recent years, there has been a growing public interest in defence and security issues. As a consequence, a more wide-ranging public debate has ensued. Given these changed circumstances, guidelines may now be appropriate. I share the Deputy's underlying concern that members of the Defence Forces should not make any comment whatsoever on matters of a political nature or on matters which are for decision by Government or which will come before either House of the Oireachtas for discussion or decision. The reason for this is simple. We live in a democracy and politicians are answerable to the people.</P>
      <P>I have arranged to have the current regulations reviewed so as to ensure that they meet present day requirements and that every member of the Defence Forces is fully familiar with, understands and adheres to their content. I have also initiated consultations with the chief of staff regarding any observations he may have in relation to the preparation of possible guidelines on the matter which may be issued for the information of every member of the Defence Forces.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question of any disciplinary action that may be taken the position is that this matter is under investigation by the military authorities and a decision on appropriate action, if any, will be made by the military authorities on conclusion of such investigation.</P>

      <P>The person named applied on five beef cows under the 1992 cattle headage and suckler cow premium schemes. At an inspection carried out on 16 October 1992, two beef cows and four other animals were presented. The person named was paid his full entitlement of £168 under the cattle headage scheme on the two cows presented. No headage was paid on the other four animals as they had not been listed on the application form. He was excluded from the suckler cow premium scheme as he did not keep on his holding the five cows applied for under the six month retention period.</P>
      <P>The person named applied on nine animals under the 1992 special beef premium scheme. As only bullocks were eligible under this scheme, and the person named applied on four female animals, he was excluded from the 1992 scheme.</P>
      <P>The person named applied on four cows under the 1993 cattle headage and suckler cow scheme. His entitlement under the cattle headage scheme was subject to a forage area restriction based on the 4.45 hectares forage area declared, and he received payment of £342.82 on 16 February 1994. As he had no suckler cow quota, he was not entitled to payment under the suckler cow premium scheme. He received his full entitlement of £105.46 under the 1993 special beef premium scheme.</P>
      <P>The person named applied under the 1996 cattle headage and suckler cow premium schemes. His applications were received on 5 July 1996 but as the closing date for receipt of applications was 31 May 1996, extended to 7 June 1996, he was not eligible to participate in the schemes.</P>
      <P>No other applications under the headage or premia schemes have been received from the person named.</P>

      <P>Regulation 22 requires an employer to prepare and issue a Form P45 (parts 2 and 3) to an employee on the date the employment ceases.

At this meeting my officials were presented with details of the financial difficulties that had arisen in the operation of the crèche and the staff side put forward a number of proposals for the resolution of these difficulties.</P>

      <P>The crèche in Mount Street opened in April 1992. The management of the crèche is the responsibility of a co-operative set up by the staff unions. While the State provides the premises and funds the services to the premises, the day-to-day running costs are met from the fees paid by users of the crèche.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume what the Deputy has in mind in the first part of the question is the introduction of a child tax allowance of £1,000 per child so as to reduce the tax bills of parents.</P>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners have informed me that if such an allowance was introduced and was confined to the children of PAYE taxpayers the cost to the Exchequer would be approximately £220 million in a full year if allowed at the marginal rate of tax. The corresponding cost would be £153 million if relief was confined to the standard rate of 24 per cent.</P>
      <P>If this allowance was extended to all taxpayers, the corresponding cost would be £271 million at the marginal rate of tax and £191 million at the standard rate.</P>
      <P>As regards the question of covenants by parents to their children who are under 18 years of age, there is no tax relief available on such covenants. This was the general position even before the tax relief on covenants was restricted in 1995 in the context of the introduction of free fees for third level publicly funded colleges.</P>
      <P>Tax relief on covenants between individuals is only available in the following circumstances: covenants to adults aged over 65 subject to a limit of 5% of the coventantor's total income; unrestricted tax relief can be claimed on covenants to permanently incapacitated persons. However, no relief is available on covenants from parents to their own minor incapacitated children; and unrestricted tax relief can be claimed on covenants which are part of a maintenance agreement between separated spouses.</P>

      <P>A wide range of public health issues arise in relation to infectious diseases and policy in this area is guided by the appropriate expert advice and by international best practice. My Department receives advice from expert committees in relation to certain infectious disease issues, including policy in relation to immunisation, bacterial meningitis, tuberculosis and CJD, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.</P>
      <P>The Infectious Diseases Regulations, 1981, specify those diseases which are statutorily notifiable and the powers and responsibilities of health boards in relation to their prevention and control. Immunisation is also an essential tool in combating infectious disease and the primary childhood immunisation programme provides for the immunisation of children free of charge against a range of serious infectious diseases.</P>
      <P>The National Disease Surveillance Centre was established in October 1998. Initially, it will be responsible for the surveillance of communicable diseases, such as meningitis, tuberculosis and foodborne diseases such as salmonella and e.coli O157. Its functions include collaboration with and supporting the health boards in the control of infectious disease, the development of guidelines and protocols and undertaking research.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The new drug payment scheme, with a threshold of £42 per month per individual or family unit, was introduced on 1 July 1999 and replaced the drug cost subsidisation scheme and drug refund scheme. The primary aim of the new drug payment scheme is to bring about important improvements over previous schemes and the scheme is designed to be more streamlined, user friendly and to significantly improve the cash flow situation for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, people who are unable, without undue hardship, to arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card. Eligibility <Col N="285" /> for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board to decide. In determining eligibility, the local health board will have regard to the financial circumstances and medical needs of the applicant. In this regard, income guidelines are used by health boards to assist in determining a person's eligibility. These guidelines are not statutorily binding and, even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, the person may still be awarded a medical card if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. Medical cards may also be issued to individual family members on this basis.</P>
    <P>A common list of reimbursable medicines has been introduced for the GMS scheme and the new drug payment scheme. The introduction of the common medicines list ensures equity between the general medical services and the new drug payment scheme in relation to the range of medicines paid for by the State under both schemes. The comprehensive range of the most modern therapies required to treat all conditions, which was available on the GMS, continues to be paid for under the new scheme. This common list is subject to ongoing review and amendment on a monthly basis as new products become available. Additions and deletions are notified on a monthly basis.</P>
    <P>In general, over the counter products, such as vitamin supplements and cosmetic type products are not available under the schemes. However, if a medical card holder is suffering undue hardship obtaining a medicine which is not covered under the common list, he or she may apply to the chief executive officer of the relevant health board for assistance in such instances.</P>
    <P>Representations have been received in my Department on behalf of kidney patients concerning items not included in the common list, notably, phosphate absorbents, vitamin supplements and high factor sun screens. I am pleased to be able to inform the Deputy that with effect from 1 December 1999, calcichew, a phosphate absorbent, will be reimbursable on the common list. On foot of correspondence from the Irish Kidney Association, officials from my Department met recently with representatives from the association and explained that there are no plans to include the other products in the common list.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 161 and 162 together.</P>
      <P>On the occasion of the publication of the spending Estimates for 2000, I announced the allocation of £3 million revenue funding and £3 million capital funding next year for the commencement of a programme for the development of renal dialysis services. This programme, which I would hope to see completed over three years at an estimated total cost of £20 million, will be aimed at achieving a structured enhancement of the capacity of the system to meet existing and anticipated growth in demand for renal services over the coming years.</P>
      <P>In particular, it is intended to: address existing infrastructural constraints that are limiting the ability of certain haemodialysis centres to meet demands for access to their services; ensure that regional dialysis centres are adequately resourced to give patients access to services close to their own home; provide for the availability of a consultant nephrology service in all regions with a view to widening the availability of alternative dialysis treatment programmes, such as CAPD and CCPD, for optimal and equitable individual patient choice; and address wider health and social needs of the renal population through supporting the Irish Kidney Association in its development of targeted programmes in these areas.</P>
      <P>The deployment of the £3 million revenue and £3 million capital that is being made available in 2000 will be primarily directed at addressing immediate requirements that are apparent from my Department's review of services in the area. In tandem with this, my Department will be engaging in further detailed consultations with all relevant interests and further examining the epidemiology of end-stage renal failure with a view to informing the most effective means of investing the further resources that will be made available in 2001 and 2002. Immediate requirements for the improvement of services for renal patients in the South Eastern Health Board will be taken into account in this overall context.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the motorised transport grant scheme is to provide financial assistance to people with disabilities who may need a car to obtain-retain employment or who are living in very isolated circumstances and have serious transport problems. This scheme is covered by circular 7/68 and modified in letters of 19 February and 15 March 1974.</P>
      <P>The assessment of entitlement to a motorised transport grant in any individual case is a matter for the relevant health board. Accordingly, the Deputy's question has been referred to the chief executive officer, South Eastern Health Board, with a request that he examine the query and reply directly to the Deputy as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <P>The National Cancer Registry is the body responsible for monitoring the incidence of cancer in the State. The board collects, classifies, records, stores and analyses information relating to the incidence and prevalence of cancer and related tumours. A health survey of the kind suggested by the Deputy would be a matter primarily for the National Cancer Registry.</P>
      <P>With regard to a possible link between power lines and cancer considerable research has been carried out internationally. The balance of scientific research to date has not conclusively established a causal link between electric and magnetic fields associated with power lines and cancer.</P>
      <P>Research is ongoing and the World Health Organisation in 1996 launched a five year research programme, the international EMF project, to assess the health and environmental aspects of electric and magnetic fields. This project is being carried out over a five year period and will bring together current knowledge and available resources of key international and national agencies and scientific institutions in order to arrive at scientifically sound recommendations for health risk assessments.</P>
      <P>Should conclusive evidence emerge of an unacceptable public health risk I would seek to have remedial measures put in place by the appropriate Government Departments and agencies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I advised the Deputy in my response of 18 November last, under the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, the health boards provide subventions to assist persons in meeting the costs of nursing home care; however, it was never intended that subventions would meet the full costs involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are three rates of subvention payable, £70, £95, £120, in accordance with three levels of dependency, medium, high, maximum which are eligible for subvention. It had been hoped to increase the rates of subvention this year but it has not been possible to do so as substantial additional funding in excess of £9 million has had to be provided to meet the rising costs of the scheme. The additional expenditure is due to a number of factors such as the increase in the number of people in receipt of subventions, their higher levels of dependency, resulting in more people receiving the higher rates of subventions, and the change in the regulations whereby the ability of adult sons and/or daughters over 21 years of age to contribute is no longer taken into account. The amount made available for the <Col N="290" /> scheme this year is £33 million. Any possible increase in the subvention rate next year will depend on budgetary circumstances and competing priorities at the time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 171 and 172 together.</P>
      <P>The long term illness scheme entitles persons to free drugs and medicines which are prescribed in respect of a specific schedule of illnesses. The illnesses covered by this scheme are: mental handicap, mental illness, for persons under 16 years only, phenylketonuria, cystic fibrosis, spina bifida, hydrocephalus, diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, haemophilia, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophies, parkinsonism and acute leukaemia.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The long term illness scheme has not been extended since 1975 and there are no plans to extend the scheme, having regard to the other schemes available to help people with the cost of drugs and medicines. For example, people who <Col N="293" /> are unable without undue hardship to arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card. Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board to decide. In determining eligibility for a medical card, the local health board has regard to the financial circumstances of the applicant. Income guidelines are used by health boards to assist in determining a person's eligibility. However, even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, the person may still be awarded a medical card if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. Medical cards may also be issued to individual family members on this basis.</P>
    <P>Non medical card holders can avail of the drug payment scheme, which was introduced on 1 July 1999 with a threshold of £42 per individual or family unit. The primary aim of the new scheme is to bring about improvements over previous schemes and it is designed to be user friendly and to significantly improve the cash flow for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.</P>

      <P>The Rotunda Hospital 1998 annual report identifies an increase in the number of pregnant women with the hepatitis C virus, HCV, presenting to the hospital since 1994, with a marked increase for the period 1997 to 1998. This coincides with a heightened awareness by the hospital of the increasing prevalence of hepatitis C amongst pregnant women.</P>
      <P>Women with identified risk factors for HCV or a history of jaundice are screened selectively at the Rotunda Hospital. The report indicates that a total of 128 infants at risk of HCV were born to 122 mothers in the Rotunda Hospital from 1994 to 1998. The Rotunda Hospital accounts for 64% of all such referrals in the Dublin area, 85% of whom acquired HCV through IV drug use. The health promotion unit in my Department implements a wide range of initiatives aimed at creating a greater awareness of the problems of drug misuse and preventing young people from turning to drug misuse in the first instance. It has worked closely with the Department of Education and Science on the development and dissemination of a substance abuse prevention programme in schools.</P>
      <P>In line with other European countries, Ireland is experiencing an increase in the numbers of hepatitis C infected women. The full impact of this on child health has not been determined. Further collaborative studies are ongoing to assess factors contributing to vertical transmission of hepatitis C and evaluate the role of interventions to its prevention. I can assure the Deputy that my Department is closely monitoring and evaluating all such developments in this area.</P>

      <P>Following the conclusion of the nurses' dispute, my Department has been working with health agencies to ensure that services to patients return to normal as soon as possible. My Department <Col N="295" /> has emphasised to agencies the importance of meeting their service plan targets by the end of this year and of using available resources to maximum effect.</P>
      <P>To ensure that service plan targets are met, and that any backlogs are addressed, my Department has put forward a number of approaches that could be adopted by agencies. These include optimising the use of theatres, streamlining discharge arrangements, maximising the use of step-down and convalescent facilities, and encouraging staff to participate fully in local plans to meet targets for the year. Agencies have also been informed that, where appropriate, it is open to them to utilise the services of private hospitals provided that spare capacity is available in these facilities. This is in the context of ensuring that resources are used to the maximum benefit of patients, and that waiting lists and waiting times are addressed in the most effective manner possible.</P>

      <P>The National Cancer Forum, which advises me on all aspects of cancer services, was requested by Comhairle na nOspideal to recommend an appropriate structure for consultant medical oncology services in the Southern Health Board area. The forum established a sub-group to consider the matter. The sub-group met individually with representatives of Cork University Hospital, the Mercy Hospital and the South Infirmary-Victoria Hospital to discuss the issues involved. The sub-group then held a collective discussion with <Col N="296" /> all three hospitals, at which agreement was reached on the most appropriate structuring of medical oncology services for the region.</P>
      <P>The National Cancer Forum will be communicating with Comhairle na nOspideal after the forum's next meeting on 15 December. I expect that comhairle will be in a position to make a decision on the structuring of the services following the communication from the forum and the submission of relevant applications from the three hospitals.</P>
      <P>I have provided funding for two consultant medical oncology posts in the 2000 Estimates, and I anticipate that, subject to comhairle's approval, the posts can be advertised and filled during 2000. I welcome the progress that has been made in relation to the structuring of the posts, and I am pleased that it was possible to achieve agreement on them at local level. I believe that the provision of these posts will represent a major step forward in the provision of oncology services in the Southern Health Board area.</P>

      <P>In common with other EU member states, Ireland is currently developing a formal laboratory accreditation scheme in consultation with the relevant statutory and professional interests. These are the National Accreditation Board, clinical pathologists, medical laboratory technicians and biochemists. The professional interests are represented by a joint working group, comprising representatives from the faculty of pathology, RCPI; the Academy of Medical Laboratory Science, and the Association of Clinical Biochemists.</P>
      <P>The objective of these discussions is to develop and implement a formal accreditation system for pathology laboratories. The arrangements for the scheme are now being finalised and I am providing a sum of £0.400 million in 2000 to meet start-up costs and to assist health agencies in the detailed preparatory work that will be required of them.</P>
      <P>With regard to the quality of cervical smear tests, the report of the Department of Health and Children cervical screening committee contained many recommendations on quality assurance in the context of the introduction of a national cervical screening programme. Phase one of the national programme will commence in early 2000 in the Mid-Western Health Board area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The expert advisory committee on cervical screening, which is overseeing the introduction of Phase one of the programme has also considered the issue of best practice in relation to cervical <Col N="297" /> screening. The committee is in the process of finalising comprehensive guidelines on quality assurance in all areas of cervical screening, including quality assurance in laboratories.</P>
    <P>These guidelines will make detailed recommendations on the reception of slides, laboratory preparation, reporting practice, management of smear results, assessment of adequacy of smears, staffing, training and continuing professional development, laboratory equipment and environment, quality control of smear reporting, accuracy, retention of slides and cytopathology laboratory processes. When finalised the guidelines will be made available to hospital laboratories for implementation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="298" /> Section 12 of the Food Safety Authority of Ireland Act, 1998 provides that &ldquo;in order to achieve the highest level of protection reasonably available in the interests of public health and consumer protection, the Authority shall promote, encourage and foster at all stages of food production, from primary production through to final use by the consumer, the establishment and maintenance of high standards of food hygiene and safety&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In pursuit of this function, the Food Safety Authority has undertaken a promotional campaign targeted at the fast food and convenience food sector, highlighting the legal obligations of food business owners, the need for training and the public health risks involved in this food sector. Safe Food To Go is a comprehensive booklet suitable for food business owners and food handlers, which focuses on fast food. The authority recently held a series of seminars for take-away restaurant owners at venues throughout the country at which the hygiene responsibilities of food handlers were outlined and supplies of the booklet distributed to over four hundred companies. The Food Safety Authority has also undertaken hygiene presentations at food fairs and industry exhibitions. The booklets are also being distributed by environmental health officers of the health boards. In total, the authority has distributed over 4,400 leaflets since it first came into print in September 1999 and distribution is continuing.</P>
    <P>The Government established the Food Safety Authority of Ireland as a statutory independent agency with responsibility, <i>inter alia</i>, for the promotion of food safety and I fully support its initiative in the fast food sector.</P>

      <P>I welcome the recently published trans-European survey in which over 700 Irish women participated. The study identified a number of important, very positive findings in relation to the Irish cancer services, as well as areas in which there is a general acceptance about the need for improvements. Among the key findings of the survey are: the majority of women were extremely satisfied or quite satisfied with the way in which their diagnosis was communicated, the time spent in the explanation, the openness of doctors and nurses, the opportunity to ask questions and the information provided; the majority of women were extremely satisfied or quite satisfied with the information received about their treatment and with the care they received in hospital; over one third of women surveyed received their diagnosis within a week of seeking medical attention, and within three weeks two thirds of women had been informed; levels of satisfaction with the overall care received in hospital and with medical and nursing staff were extremely high, 95 per cent.</P>
      <P>The survey identified a number of areas for improvement including the following findings: women are relatively uniformed about cancer prior to diagnosis; communication between hospitals and general practitioners could be improved; a significant proportion of women were dissatisfied with the interval between seeking medical attention and the communication of a diagnosis in the case of breast cancer and gynaecological cancer; while very satisfied with the information and care received, women were less satisfied with waiting times for treatment, particularly for radiotherapy.</P>
      <P>The findings of the survey are extremely useful and will be considered by the National Cancer Forum when advising me further about the development of cancer services. Since the implementation of the national cancer strategy commenced in 1997, this Government and the previous Government have allocated a total of £26 million in additional funding to cancer services. I will be allocating further substantial funding in 2000 in a way that will help to address the issues raised by the recent survey. This will include additional resources for the programmes of screening for breast cancer and cervical cancer, and such areas as diagnostic and treatment services for women with symptomatic breast disease.</P>
      <P>I am committed to developing further our cancer services so that all who need them will receive the best possible service in the most appropriate location.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Subject to the requirements of community rating, which ensure that premiums are not increased because of the insured person getting older, the setting of premium charges is a matter, in the first instance, for the insurers concerned. Premiums are set having regard to such business considerations as anticipated claims payments, administrative expenses, and the maintenance of adequate reserves. Health care costs are increasing at a rate ahead of general inflation as they include a range of unique factors, including increasing utilisation of services and high cost technologies.</P>
      <P>The Government considers that the private health insurance regulatory framework should enable the development of practices between insurers and service providers which address the standard, efficacy and cost effectiveness of the services being purchased. Current cost containment approaches include negotiation of scheduled professional fee payments, length of stay agreements and a shift towards day care activity. There are other measures, such as greater use of fixed price procedures and development of treatment protocols, which it may be possible for insurers and service providers to develop to ensure the optimum use of available resources. It is also considered that a greater emphasis on primary care in the development of insurance packages may, over time, be beneficial as regards early detection of disease and intervention or obviating the need for more costly hospital care.</P>
      <P>The health insurance regulatory framework should not impede such development, should not be inflationary and should safeguard the broad rights and interests of insured persons. This is the approach to be pursued by my Department on foot of the recently published White Paper on Private Health Insurance. Ultimately, in the competitive market in voluntary private health insurance, cost containment measures are essentially a matter for agreement between insurers and service providers, having regard to the need to provide a quality service at lowest possible cost for insured persons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Government is fully committed to ensuring that older people have access to health care. The Deputy will be aware that the Government decided, as part of the 1999 budget, that the income guidelines for entitlement to medical cards for persons aged 70 years or over should be doubled. This improvement, which is being introduced over a three year period, began on 1 March this year. The income guidelines for those aged <Col N="301" /> 70 to 79 and 80 years and over, which are already higher than the normal guidelines, have increased by one third and there will be similar increases in 2000 and 2001.</P>

      <P>Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board. Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.</P>
      <P>Income guidelines have been drawn up by the chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these are revised annually in line with the consumer price index. However, these guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that his or her medical needs or other circumstances would justify this.</P>
      <P>Any investments or savings that could or should generate an income are taken into account in assessing income for medical card purposes. Interest from savings is taken into account but after that it is general practice to disallow a modest amount of savings when assessing the amount of savings-assets which could be redeemed as an income.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy knows the Government has decided that the income guidelines for entitlement to medical cards for persons aged 70 years or over should be doubled.

I have increased waiting list funding <Col N="303" /> from the £8 million allocated by the previous Government in 1997 to £12 million in 1998 and to £20 million in 1999. I have indicated recently that funding under the waiting list initiative will be increased again in 2000.</P>

      <P>The road traffic Acts at present provide for preliminary roadside breath screening, or breathalysing, of a driver where a garda is of the opinion that the driver has consumed intoxicating liquor. I am considering, as part of the preparation of a new Road Traffic Bill and in accordance with the Government strategy for road safety 1998 to 2002, the possibility of a change in this legal requirement to provide for the selective application of random breath testing or screening of drivers. One variant of this could be for drivers involved in accidents to be subject to automatic testing for alcohol.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the meantime, the taking of breath speci<Col N="304" /> mens for evidential purposes, already provided for in the Road Traffic Act, 1994 and identified as a measure for action in the strategy, commenced in Garda stations at Pearse Street, Dublin and in Castlebar last month. The system will be progressively extended nationwide.</P>

      <P>I understand that the Deputy is referring to a scheme operated by Dublin Corporation whereby a person arranges to sell their house either to the corporation or on the open market and is then housed by the corporation in senior citizen's type accommodation.

    <P>The national fuel scheme, NFS, is a means <Col N="306" /> tested scheme to assist householders who are on long-term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs. A person who is already in receipt of a means tested payment and who fulfils the conditions of the scheme will normally qualify for the allowance.</P>
    <P>A person who is in receipt of a contributory pension can have a combined household income of up to £30 per week in excess of the relevant maximum contributory pension or capital of up to £22,400 and be eligible for a fuel allowance.</P>
    <P>Any change to the qualifying conditions of the scheme would have significant cost implications and could only be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Framework plans have been completed for areas totalling some 45,000 hectares of commonage to date. However, the process used in the <Col N="307" /> preparation of those plans, and their application to individual farmers, is more complex than originally anticipated. Commonage blocks finalised to date have yet to take account of lands in other commonages. Therefore, for practical purposes, no single commonage area is fully complete. In the interim the national commonage framework plan requiring 30 per cent destocking will continue in force.</P>

      <P>The advisory group on prison deaths made 57 recommendations in its report published in August 1991.</P>
      <P>In May 1996 the Minister for Justice established the national steering group on deaths in custody. One of the terms of reference of the steering group was to look at the recommendations contained in the report of the advisory group on prison deaths. The national steering group met on 14 occasions between June 1996 and February 1998 and published its report in May 1999. It found that of the 57 recommendations in the report of the advisory group on prison deaths, 34 were fully implemented, 15 were partially implemented and eight longer term recommendations were not fully implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the publication of the report of the national steering group in May 1999, work has continued on three fronts to further the implementation of the outstanding recommendations. These are in the prisons building programme, the recruitment of additional staff for both the probation and welfare service and the psychology service and the review of the prison medical services. In addition, 23 nurses have been recruited <Col N="308" /> to date with further recruitment due later this month.</P>
    <P>The national steering group on deaths in custody made a further 12 recommendations which are being pursued as a matter of urgency by the Director General of the Prison Service.</P>
    <P>At the invitation of the Minister, the national steering group on deaths in custody continues to meet on a regular basis to monitor the progress of its recommendations and to advise the Minister on any changes which it considers may be necessary to the recommendations. The group also acts as a co-ordinating group for the local suicide awareness groups in each institution and as such provides a forum for collating the reports of the local groups and to disseminate significant findings and lessons learned through the prison system. It has recently organised a forum for these groups to discuss its findings and agree appropriate actions to reduce the risk of death or self-injury to inmates of the institutions.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 204 and 205 together.</P>
      <P>Under the current prisons building programme an additional 1,207 prison places will have been built by the first quarter of 2000. Of these, 212 places are already operational. The 400 places at Cloverhill will be phased into operation over the next three to four months and the new women's prison at Mountjoy with 80 places will become fully operational before Christmas. The remaining 515 places in the midlands prison are on target for completion in March 2000.</P>
      <P>An additional 90 places will arise from the necessary replacement of one old, unsafe, unsuitable and inefficient cell block in each of two existing prisons, Limerick and Portlaoise.</P>

      <P>For example, the PULSE project, the new Garda computer system, continues to progress well, with a major suite of information systems having recently been made operationally ready. Moreover, I secured Government approval earlier this year to begin the replacement of the existing national Garda radio network with a new, integrated, digital system that, among many other benefits, will provide secure, encrypted radio communications for all members of the force.</P>
      <P>The Garda Síochána has also now been provided with an air support unit, comprising a fixed-wing aircraft and helicopter, and I have recently approved the purchase of a second helicopter to upgrade the capabilities of the unit. Furthermore, a high-speed patrol launch for use by the Garda water unit will soon be provided to ensure the effective policing of inland waterways.</P>
      <P>Other significant technology developments within the force include CCTV systems in Dublin and Tralee, with one for Cork planned; a variety of operational devices, such as the stinger system; a computerised automatic fingerprint identification system; and sophisticated speed and traffic detection equipment.</P>

      <P>There are currently 20 primary and six post-primary schools operating in the Dublin 15 area. I am aware that there is pressure on accommodation in some of these schools. This is due mainly to the general increase in pupil numbers arising from extensive housing developments in the area and in part to parents exercising choice in selecting schools for their children to attend.</P>
      <P>In the past five years two new schools have been established in Dublin 15, one each at primary and post-primary level. Plans are in hand, also, to provide a new primary school in the Littlepace-Castaheany area. In addition, extensions of accommodation are planned or in progress at a number of existing schools in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department reviews the primary and post- primary accommodation requirements of major <Col N="313" /> urban centres on a regular basis. As part of this process, the planning section of my Department meets with the relevant local authorities to establish the location and scale of proposed housing developments. Such a meeting is due to take place shortly with Fingal County Council to discuss future developments in north Dublin, including Dublin 15. In this way, every effort is made to monitor existing provision and to ensure that timely arrangements are made to extend capacity where necessary.</P>
    <P>I would be concerned to ensure that my Department retains the capacity to anticipate future school accommodation needs at a time of rapid development and demographic change. The Commission on School Accommodation is at present reviewing my Department's procedures for the planning of school provision at first and second level, and I will give careful consideration as to how these procedures should best be structured in the light of this review.</P>

      <P>My Department already devotes a very considerable amount of resources to addressing the problem of educational disadvantage across the education system.</P>
      <P>While the current disadvantaged areas scheme provides important support for many disadvantaged pupils it is based purely on pupil numbers and does not take account of different levels of need. In its review of educational disadvantage in Ireland, the Education Research Centre recommended that resources be better targeted. One of my concerns with the present support system is that it lacks the necessary flexibility to target individual pupils or small pockets of disadvantage within the school system.</P>
      <P>My objective is to develop a more flexible response system which will continue to support schools with large concentrations of disadvantaged pupils but will also be responsive to the needs of individual or small groups of disadvantaged pupils throughout the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 212 and 226 together.</P>
      <P>One of the most significant educational developments planned to take place over the next five years will be the implementation of a new science programme in all primary schools.</P>
      <P>In the revised curriculum, science holds equal standing with history and geography for all classes and is to be given an appropriate weekly time allocation.</P>
      <P>The implementation of the revised curriculum will be on a phased basis over four to five years and will be supported by a comprehensive programme of in-career professional development for teachers.</P>
      <P>In order to encourage schools to incorporate science in their curriculum, I have recently announced a new grants scheme for the teaching of science in primary schools.</P>
      <P>At second level concerns have been expressed on the uptake of physics and chemistry at leaving certificate. I have initiated a number of measures in response to these concerns. These measures which will be put in place over 1999-2000 and 2001 include: upgrading of resources in Science laboratories in second level schools; in-service training of teachers; development of new syllabuses and review of assessment procedures, including examinations.</P>
      <P>Funding for the programme has been estimated to be of the order of £15 million.</P>
      <P>New syllabi in chemistry and physics will be introduced in 2000 and syllabi in biology, agricultural science and physics and chemistry, combined, are being finalised. In addition a review of both science and the technology subjects at junior cycle and revised syllabi for construction studies and engineering together with a new syllabus for technology at leaving certificate are being prepared by the NCCA.</P>
      <P>At third level, the 1999 annual competitiveness report of the National Competitiveness Council notes that while we have a satisfactory ranking in terms of science and engineering graduates and the number of people active in research, the gap in the past has been in funding for research and the maintenance of a strong knowledge-based infrastructure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The work of the expert group on skills suggests that there may be a shortfall in the numbers of science technician students and a new accelerated programme for such technicians, based on the successful model of the national certificate in <Col N="315" /> manufacturing technology, will be introduced in January 2000. These programmes are important being based on a partnership between industry and institutes with industrial involvement in course design, selection and placement.</P>
    <P>Research plays a key role in determining the status and quality of higher education institutions and the contribution which they make to economic and social development.</P>
    <P>The Government has recognised the value and importance of research in our third level institutions. An unparalleled investment programme is under way under the £280 million scientific and technology education investment fund. Last July, I announced the allocation of funds under the joint public-private programme for research in third level institutions which involves a total investment of £220 million. The programme ensures that institutions have the means and incentives to formulate and implement research strategies to develop critical mass in areas of existing and emerging excellence within the institutions.</P>
    <P>The unprecedented investment provided for in the National Development Plan involves a total investment in research, technological development and innovation of £1.95 billion over the period of the plan. Within this provision, £550 million will be allocated towards RTDI in the education sector, which will boost human potential in research science and technology and will strengthen the research and science capability of our higher education institutions. The funding available to my Department is separate from the funding for RTDI available to my colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and which is outlined in the National Development Plan, 2000-06.</P>

    <P>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin): Individual school authorities are responsible for ensuring the safety and welfare of children and others in their care. My Department has issued guidelines advising schools of their responsibility under the health and safety legislation to provide a safe environment for all personnel present in the school. Schools are advised that they should identify possible hazards, assess the risks to health and safety and put appropriate safeguards in place. However, a balance must be struck between the need to provide a welcoming environment for children, their parents, school teachers and other staff while also ensuring that their safety is secured.</P>
    <P>It is also important, in considering security in <Col N="316" /> schools, to have regard to their wide diversity in terms of size, type of accommodation and location. In practical terms, therefore, individual school authorities are best placed to assess the detail of their own security. I am satisfied that schools are aware of their responsibilities in this area.</P>
    <P>In relation to new schools, design teams are asked to ensure that security considerations are reflected in the architectural planning of the building, particularly in relation to access.</P>

      <P>The Qualifications (Education and Training) Act, 1999 was enacted during the summer. An interdepartmental implementation group, comprising those Departments concerned with the operation of the Act, has been established to oversee its implementation. This group had its first meeting in September last and is to report to me in the near future on the necessary steps to bring the Act into operation. It is my intention to move with all possible expedition in bringing the Act into operation, while at the same time ensuring a smooth transition to the new certification system and the effective operation from the outset of the three new bodies to be established under the Act, the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland, the Further Education and Training Awards Council and the Higher Education and Training Awards Council.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the provisions of section 29(8) of the Act will enable me as Minister to give effect to the recommendations of the independent review group, chaired by Professor Dervilla Donnelly, of Waterford Institute of Technology. When the relevant sections of the Act are brought into operation it is my intention to direct the Higher Education and Training Awards Council and the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland to implement the recommendations of the report of the review group.</P>

    <P>Ag leibhéal na hArdteistiméireachta tá béim ar <Col N="318" /> obair phraiticiúil sna siollabais eolaíochta mar atá siad faoi láthair agus sna siollabais nua atá le cur i bhfeidhm go luath. Táim den tuairim gur maith an rud é sin, agus go bhfaigheann daltaí seilbh ar scileanna tábhachtacha trí obair phraiticiúil thurgnamhach a dhéanamh sa rang. Sa bhliain 1997 thug mo Roinnse faoi staidéar féideartheachta i measúnú praiticiúil san fhisic agus sa cheimic. Is oth liom a rá, áfach, nach bhféadfaí aon chonclúid a bhaint as na torthaí. Tugadh faoi staidéar eile ó shin agus tá torthaí an staidéir sin á scrúdú faoi láthair. Sular gcuirtear aon mhúnla faoi leith i bhfeidhm sna scoileanna caithfear a chinntiú go mbeidh an múnla sin fiúntach agus éifeachtach ó thaobh na dtorthaí de. Idir an dá linn, tá sé i gceist na siollabais nua san fhisic agus sa cheimic a chur ar siúl sna scoileanna i mí Meán Fómhair seo chugainn.</P>
    <P>Tá impleachtaí go leor i gceist le cinneadh a dhéanamh chun measúnú praiticiúil a chur ar bun ó thaobh acmhainní daonna agus acmhainní fisiciúla de. Tá clár curtha ar siúl chun feabhas a chur ar acmhainní saotharlainne agus tá sé i gceist go mbeadh bunús ceart i ngach scoil sa tír chun an eolaíocht a mhúineadh.</P>
    <P>Tá cúrsaí traenála ar siúl faoi láthair ar fud na tíre do mhúinteoirí eolaíochta chun a gcur ar a gcumas a bheith ábalta tabhairt faoin obair phraiticiúil sa tsaotharlann.</P>
    <P>Ag leibhéal an Teastais Shóisearaigh tá sé aitheanta anois go bhfuil réimse ró-chúng a d'ábaltachtaí á measúnú ag an gcóras mar atá sé faoi láthair, agus chomh maith leis sin nach bhfuil an measúnú a dhéantar ag teacht leis na haidhmeanna sna siollabais éagsúla, eolaíocht ach go háirithe. Tá brú mór ar an gcuraclam faoi láthair agus coimhlint idir na hábhair éagsúla ó thaobh ama de. Táthar ag tabhairt faoi phróiseas comhairleach leis na páirtnéirí éagsúla faoi láthair chun an fhadhb seo a leigheas.</P>

      <P>My Department provides funding towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking ser<Col N="320" /> vices in primary schools under two separate schemes. One scheme is the 1978-79 scheme for the employment of school secretaries and caretakers under which my Department meets the full cost of salary and employer's PRSI. This scheme is, however, being phased out as posts become vacant.</P>
      <P>Arising from the Programme for Economic and Social Progress, PESP, a second scheme was introduced in 1992 whereby my Department provides additional capitation grants for primary schools towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services. Under the PESP scheme, schools receive grants of £30 per pupil, based on their enrolments, which are paid as additions to the standard <i>per capita </i>grant.</P>
      <P>Since its introduction in 1992, the scheme of additional capitation grants to schools in respect of clerical and caretaking services has been expanded in line with undertakings given in the Programme for Economic and Social Progress. The scheme has been extended to include more schools by reducing the qualifying enrolment threshold to its current figure of 195 pupils, with an ultimate target of providing additional capitation grants for all primary schools with 100 pupils or more. I have now secured an additional allocation of £2.7 million and with effect from January next, all primary schools with 100 or more pupils will be eligible for a grant of £30 per pupil towards secretarial and caretaking services under this scheme.</P>
      <P>My Department has already included primary schools in the scheme which share the same campus or building and whose combined enrolment meets the qualifying threshold. However, in light of current resource constraints, I am not in a position to extend the scheme further to include schools other than those which satisfy the shared campus criteria.</P>

      <P>Earlier this year my Department considered an application from the school in question for the introduction of a transition year programme for a number of its pupils. The school <Col N="322" /> caters for pupils with physical and multiple disabilities, up to the age of 18 years.</P>
      <P>In certain circumstances, such as in the case of pupils studying for State examinations, my Department may sanction an additional year in a special school. However, it is generally the case that where suitable alternative educational provision is available, an additional year would not be sanctioned.</P>
      <P>The proposal put forward by the school centred on an additional year for five particular students who would normally have left at the end of the last school year. However, as there is a vocational training centre on the same campus and the programme being proposed for the pupils in question was similar to that available in the vocational training centre, it was decided that the introduction of a transition year programme as proposed would be a duplication of existing supports.</P>
      <P>I should point out, however, that three of the five pupils involved in the original application were subsequently granted an additional year in the school based on an assessment of their individual special educational needs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Funds are available to schools to initiate or further enhance information and communication technology development as follows:</P>
      <P>Schools IT 2000.</P>
      <P>In May 1998 all schools in the free education system at primary and post-primary levels received grants as follows: ordinary schools at first and second levels: £2,000 plus £5 per pupil; ordinary schools with one or more special classes received an additional grant of £1,500 plus £20 per head for each special class pupil; special schools received a grant of £3,000 plus £20 per pupil.</P>
      <P>These grants are available in the case of the establishment of new schools and-or special classes in ordinary national schools where the grant has not been issued already. Details of grants may be obtained from the Department of Education and Science, IT Unit, Tel. (01) 8734700.</P>
      <P>I recently announced details of an additional round of allocations under the schools IT 2000 programme. These grants amount to £9.77 million and are focused on a number of areas and, in particular, special needs, guidance and staff support.</P>
      <P>Career Guidance Service in Second Level Schools.</P>
      <P>The equipment needs of the career guidance service in each second level school recognised for grant purposes under the free education scheme, will be met through the provision of grant aid on the following basis: schools with up to 999 students: £1,500; schools with 1,000 or more students: £3,000.</P>
      <P>In addition, Qualifax and Ectis guidance software will be distributed to every school by the NCTE as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Software Grant for Primary and Second Level Schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to support the integration of ICTs into teaching and learning, every school recognised for grant purposes under the free education scheme, will be provided with grant aid of £4 per pupil for the purchase of educational software. Schools may opt to spend some of the grant on hardware if this is more appropriate to local needs. The NCTE will, through the ScoilNet web- site, provide all schools with wide-ranging advice <Col N="325" /> on software purchase. The ScoilNet site will also include software reviews compiled by experienced teachers.</P>
    <P>ICT Grant for the Remedial and Resource Teacher Service in Primary Schools.</P>
    <P>In order to assist the integration of ICTs into the education of children served by remedial teachers and resource teachers for children with disabilities, a grant of £700 will be made available to support the work of each of the teachers concerned. The grant may be used for the purchase of relevant hardware and-or software items e.g. literacy and numeracy software for the remedial and resource teacher service.</P>
    <P>ICT Grants to Meet the Needs of Individual Special Needs Pupils.</P>
    <P>In 1998 I established a fund of £0.25 million to enable the provision of ICT equipment for individual special needs pupils. I propose to increase the fund to £0.5 million in 1999. The additional funding will be used to fund equipment for individual special needs children into 2000.</P>
    <P>Staff Development in Primary and Second Level Schools.</P>
    <P>Every primary and second-level school recognised for grant purposes under the free education scheme, will be provided with grant aid of £3 per pupil for the purchase of ICT hardware and-or software to supplement and support the very extensive ICT skills development programme for teachers being delivered through the NCTE. The equipment purchased from this grant aid may, for example, be deployed in staff rooms or loaned to individual teachers who are undertaking formal ICT training courses.</P>
    <P>School Administration in Second Level Schools.</P>
    <P>In order to support the further development of computerised school administration systems in second level schools, a capital grant of £2 per student will be issued to every second level school subject to a minimum level of grant aid of £500 per school.</P>
    <P>In addition to the above, every second level school will be provided with a grant of £350 to be used towards support and other running costs related to computerised school administration systems.</P>
    <P>Continuation of School Integration Project.</P>
    <P>A limited number of additional projects under SIP will be funded. These originate from schools which were unsuccessful in their original SIP applications but have further developed their project proposals within the past 12 months with the assistance of the NCTE. Also included is a special additional project piloting the application of CAD software in a group of schools running the leaving certificate vocational programme.</P>
    <P>Guidelines on terms and conditions of all the above grants will be notified to every school by the National Centre for Technology in Education, NCTE, DCU, Glasnevin, Dublin 9. Tel. 1850 70 40 40.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="326" /> Other Department Funding for Information and Communication Technology Development in Schools.</P>
    <P>Funds are provided for equipping computer rooms where a new school is being built or where an existing school is being extended. In the case of vocational schools, where a computer room is equipped under this provision, a grant of 100% is paid for the equipment provided. Information may be obtained from the Department of Education and Science, Post-Primary Building Unit, Tullamore, County Offaly. Tel. (0506) 21363.</P>
    <P>Schools providing the restructured leaving certificate vocational programme, LCVP and-or the leaving certificate applied, LCA programme each receive grants for equipment, mainly computer equipment. The range of grant support is as follows: a once-off general equipment maximum grant of £13,000 for the purchase by schools of computer and communications equipment needed for the implementation of the restructured LCVP or the LCA or both; a once-off maximum grant of £4,000 for the purchase of equipment related to the teaching of the subjects selected by the school from the LCVP vocational subject groupings; a once-off maximum grant of £1,000 for start-up resources for schools providing the restructured LCVP; a once-off maximum grant of £4,000 for the purchase of equipment related to the teaching of the subject specialisms provided by the school under the LCA; an annual <i>per capita</i> resource grant of £125 per pupil for schools providing the LCA.</P>
    <P>Full details of the scheme are contained in the guidelines for schools &ndash; equipment grants for schools providing the restructured leaving certificate vocational programme and-or the leaving certificate applied, January 1997, which is available from the Department of Education and Science c/o Aileen Finucane EO, Post-Primary Administration 2, Hawkins House, Dublin 2. Tel. (01) 8892049.</P>
    <P>A scheme is in operation to provide 100% grants for equipment, mainly computers, for use by special needs pupils in mainstream second level schools. The rate of grant in respect of any pupil is the cost of the equipment, subject in general to a maximum grant of £3,000. In certain circumstances, where the nature of the equipment warrants it, a higher grant may be considered. Full details are available in Circular M11/95, available from the Department of Education and Science, Post-Primary Administration Section 2, c/o Aileen Finucane EO, Hawkins House, Dublin 2. Tel. (01) 8892049.</P>
    <P>Scientific and Technological Education (Investment) Fund.</P>
    <P>The sum of £2 million has been allocated under the scientific and technological education, investment, fund to meet the costs of furnishing and equipping laboratories in selected PLC centres for international teleservices and electronic technician courses. These courses are in new areas where emerging skill needs have been identified and are, therefore, eligible for assistance under <Col N="327" /> the fund which is not generally applicable to schools in the PLC sector. The equipment specification for these laboratories has a significant ICT component and expenditure is authorised by the further education section of my Department. Information is available from Liam Keenan HEO, Further Education Section, Department of Education and Science, Marlborough Street, Dublin 1. Tel. (01) 8892432.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is aware I have been concerned for some time about the number of large classes in the primary system, and have been examining ways to target additional teaching resources to those schools with the greatest need in this area. The new staffing schedule which issued in April last has been structured to ensure that all primary schools will operate to a maximum general class size of 30 pupils.</P>
      <P>However, as the Deputy knows, the staffing schedule has traditionally been applied on the basis of the previous year's enrolment figures, and this continues to be the case. Initially, the schools which will benefit from the new schedule are those whose enrolment in September 1998 qualifies them for an additional post in the 1999-2000 school year. Such schools will therefore be in a position to organise classes in such a way as to ensure that there are no longer any very large classes.</P>
      <P>The enrolment on 30 September 1998 of 323 pupils at St. Vincent de Paul national school gives the authorised staffing of a principal and 11 mainstream class teachers. This gives an average class size of 29.36 pupils which is within the maximum class size of 30 pupils. The enrolment at the school, which has been decreasing for a number of years has further decreased to 314 pupils on 30 September 1999.</P>
      <P>In addition the school has the services of a remedial teacher.</P>
      <P>Therefore there is no basis for the appointment of an additional teacher to the school for the current school year. My Department has not received any application from the board of management of St. Vincent de Paul national school for the provision of any extra classrooms.</P>

      <P>Under the terms of the free fees initiative, the Exchequer meets the tuition fees of eligible students who are attending approved third level courses.  Students who already hold an undergraduate degree and are pursuing a second undergraduate degree are not eligible under the initiative. Students who are repeating a year at the same level are generally not eligible for funding. Similarly, students who have pursued a <Col N="329" /> course of third level study which has attracted Exchequer funding, e.g. fees, maintenance, tax relief, subsidy towards course cost, and who have not secured a terminal qualification and subsequently resume third level studies, are not eligible for free fees for the equivalent period of time spent on the first course of study.</P>
      <P>As the student referred to by the Deputy already pursued part of a BA in languages and cultural studies at UCC, which is an approved course under the initiative, she is now liable for a half year's tuition fee in respect of the BA in physiotherapy at UCD. These conditions apply irrespective of the tuition costs of either course and it is not possible to allow the student the difference in the cost of the tuition fees between the two courses.</P>
      <P>My officials have been in contact with Kilkenny County Council regarding this case and I understand that the student in question, who holds a higher education grant was advised by local authority officials that, under the terms of the free fees initiative, as she was withdrawing from the course prior to 31 January 1999, she would be liable for half fees, in respect of any new course in the 1999-2000 academic year. In addition, as she had been paid the first instalment of her maintenance grant in respect of the 1998-99 academic year, she was advised that her grant would be resumed from the second instalment of the 1999-2000 academic year if she were to subsequently pursue an approved course. This is in accordance with the provisions of the higher education grants scheme which provides that students who have previously pursued an undergraduate course approved for the purposes of the scheme will not receive a grant until they have completed an equivalent period of study at his-her own expense.</P>

    <P>The special fund for students with disabilities has, since its establishment in 1994, operated on a discretionary basis. I would, of course, prefer to have an entitlement-based scheme. However, the financial and other resources associated with such a scheme would have to be clearly established and it has long been the case that policy development in the area of disability and specific learning <Col N="331" /> difficulties has been hampered by a lack of statistics.</P>
    <P>In this regard, two significant research reports which will be completed over the coming months will help to provide a basis for informing future policy development both within my own Department and in the third level sector generally.</P>
    <P>Over the past two years AHEAD has undertaken a survey of disability in mainstream second level education. My Department is supporting this research which will be published shortly. It is hoped that the report will provide for the first time a &ldquo;picture of disability&rdquo; at second level. This in turn will provide a strong basis for identifying the number of these students likely to move on to third level, and the provision required for their support in further study.</P>
    <P>Additionally the Higher Education Authority is commissioning a detailed survey of the provision for students with disabilities in the third level sector, a follow on to its 1994 survey. This survey, which will be completed early next year, will indicate how the sector has developed over the past five years and will provide a strong base line for future policy and systems development.</P>

      <P>As I informed the Deputy in reply to Parliamentary Questions No. 219 on 4 June 1998 and Nos. 898, 899 and 900 of 30 September 1998, my Department carried out an assessment of primary and post-primary accommodation needs in Naas during 1998.</P>
      <P>At primary level, temporary accommodation has been provided at existing schools in the Naas area to cater for immediate requirements. Architectural planning for a new 16 classroom school is under way and it is expected that, when this building becomes available, there will be sufficient accommodation available in the town to meet medium to long-term requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At second level, building projects are well under way in all three schools in Naas. It is envisaged that the accommodation thus provided will enable the schools to meet the immediate and long-term requirements of the area. I might add that the proposed extension at one of these schools has been revised to include 100 additional <Col N="332" /> places. This will enable the school in question to cater for 900 pupils in the long term.</P>
    <P>My Department will continue to monitor developments in Naas to ensure that any emerging additional demands are promptly addressed.</P>

      <P>The information requested by the Deputy is only available in my Department on an overall county basis.</P>
      <P>There are nine full-time resource teachers catering for children with special needs in ordinary primary schools in County Kildare. Four of these posts have been sanctioned in the current year. A further 13 primary schools in the county have been allocated part-time resource teacher support to cater for special needs children.</P>
      <P>As a result of the recent extension of the remedial teaching service to all primary and post-primary schools with a pupil-teacher ratio of 10:1 or above, a total of 92 primary schools in County Kildare now have access to the remedial teaching service. A total of 50 remedial teachers are deployed in primary schools in the county.</P>
      <P>Also, with effect from the beginning of the current school year, all second level schools in the free education scheme have been given ex-quota allocations in respect of remedial needs. These allocations have been notified to the authorities of the schools concerned.</P>
      <P>A total of 41 special needs assistants have been allocated to support children with special needs in schools in County Kildare. A total of 19 of these posts have been allocated in the current year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two special schools in County Kildare cater for pupils with moderate general learning disability. One special school in the county caters for pupils with a mild general learning disability. Two of these schools also have six special classes for pupils with a severe profound general learning <Col N="334" /> disability. All of these schools operate at the significantly reduced pupil-teacher ratios recommended by the special education review committee.</P>
    <P>There are also six special classes for pupils with autism and six special classes for pupils with a mild learning disability attached to mainstream primary schools in the county.</P>
    <P>My Department has also allocated additional resources to individual second level schools in County Kildare to cater for particular pupils with special needs attending these schools.</P>
    <P>My Department will continue to make special support services available where required by children with special educational needs throughout the country, including children in the County Kildare area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of the case referred to by the Deputy so it would not be appropriate for me to comment specifically on it. In general, however, schools have a moral and legal responsibility to make all reasonable efforts to ensure the safety and welfare of their pupils in the same way as a careful parent would.</P>
      <P>Under health and safety legislation, school management authorities are responsible for providing a safe environment for all personnel present in the school, including pupils. In a circular issued by my Department earlier this year entitled Guidelines on Violence in Schools, schools were advised of their duties in this area and of the need to take positive measures to prevent and minimise the risk of violence within the school environment. In particular, the attention of schools was drawn to the need for effective school policies on school discipline and bullying. The circular advises schools that these policies should be reviewed on a regular basis and suggests that the early identification and resolution of weaknesses in school policies generally lessens the threat of violence in the school. The Department has issued separate guidelines to assist schools in discharging their responsibilities in relation to bullying and discipline.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The circular draws attention to the need for a clearly defined procedure for dealing with reported assaults in schools and outlines the elements of such a procedure which may need to be adapted to the circumstances of each case. School policy in this matter should include a com<Col N="336" /> mitment by schools to be fully supportive of victims of violence within the school. The national educational psychological service is also available as a support service to schools in relation to individual students who encounter difficulties.</P>
