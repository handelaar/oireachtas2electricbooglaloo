      <P>I seek the Adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to discuss a matter of urgent public importance, the findings of the EPA report on water quality in Ireland which shows that one third of rivers are polluted and outlines the serious implications for the future supply of drinking water and the complete failure of the Ministers for the Environment and Local Government and Agriculture and Food to deal with this environmental disaster.</P>

It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that the following arrangements shall apply in relation to No. 32: the opening statement of a Minister or Minister of State and of the main spokespersons for the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party shall not exceed 30 minutes in each case; the statement of each other Member called upon shall not exceed ten minutes in each case; Members may share time; and a Minister or Minister of State shall be called upon to make a statement in reply which shall not exceed ten minutes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there a need to introduce legislation or is the Government seeking a derogation of the EU directive on the awarding of public service contracts? The Taoiseach when he was Minister for Finance signed the directive in 1992. The Taoiseach said yesterday that the Government would protect post offices throughout the country. However, the advertisement seeking tenders for the social welfare payments system appeared last February. Why did the Government not seek the advice it is now seeking on whether a tender must be put out when the advertisement was placed last February? Is the Government seeking a derogation from the EU directive which the Taoiseach signed as Minister for Finance in the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government in 1992? It is interesting that a Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government is trying to close down post offices now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Why was the advice of the Attorney General not sought before the indicative notice was placed in newspapers? The Government is trying to catch up on something which is causing it great difficulty around the country. It is now kicking the matter into touch by asking the Attorney General for further advice. The Government should have sought this advice in February. According to one article, the Government has already got advice from the Attorney General. Obviously, it is ignoring it and seeking another time-consuming hiatus.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Government considering introducing legislation under the postal section to refer to Article 6 of directive 92/50, which is the subject of this controversy, which would specify that An Post is required to provide under an administrative provision the service of social welfare payments? If such legislation was introduced, there would be no legal doubt about whether this was a matter for financial tendering or a social provision. I will not enter the controversy about how the Government has handled this but the fear of the closure of over 1,000 post offices was put on the public record by Ms Vera Hogan on behalf of the post offices, not by the Opposition parties. All of us want to maintain this provision and whatever level of incompetence rests with the Government, there is an avenue which could ensure and put beyond legal doubt the role of An Post. Has the Government considered the legislative measure I outlined, under Article 6, which provides for the derogation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Quinn is correct, that is the crucial article. The Attorney General has been examining this issue for some time and has explored a number of options, one of which is whether it is possible to consider that rural post offices are providing this service on social rather than financial grounds. If it falls under financial regulations, one would have to follow the EU tendering position; if it is a social provision, one could take a different course of action. The Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs has addressed those issues in a memorandum and the Attorney General is looking at the legal basis. I do not know at this stage whether it will require legislation but the Government's intention has been to avoid losing the base of rural and urban post offices.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This issue was signalled three years ago and the then Government's position was that nothing further could be done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that we stop playing games. There is a way to make this secure from any legal challenge. I invite the Government to introduce legislation, an option specified in Article 6, rather than an administrative regulation or order. To remove the uncertainty and address the issue, I ask the Taoiseach to include on the list of promised or desired legislation a Bill to clarify that the payment of social welfare moneys through An Post is a social rather than a financial service. That would put this beyond doubt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>If the indicative advertisement had not appeared, whatever its basis, concern and fear would not be expressed by people inside and outside this House who feel urban and rural post offices may close in various communities. The Government caused this scare by advertising before getting the advice it has now sought, and I welcome that it is correcting what it did last February. The Taoiseach signed the directive in 1992 and the legislation can be introduced. Instead of leaving this in limbo, why will he not introduce the necessary amending legislation to secure post offices as part of rural and urban communities for the future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The indicative pre-notice advertisement is an obligation under EU law. The postmasters' and postmisstresses' union highlighted this matter long before the advertisement. They raised the issue for precisely the reason suggested by Deputy Quinn. On the last occasion no advice was sought and the action taken by the current Minister is in line with Deputy Quinn's suggestion. The last Government gave a three year extension and indicated that the contract would then go and the post offices would close. That is the way it was left and that is why there was concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>That assumes An Post would not win the contract.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It assumes the contract would go to tender. That was clear when the costs were <Col N="331" /> examined the last time &ndash; 80p as against 7p, the file is clear on that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The contract does not end until later in the year and the Minister has done precisely what Deputy Quinn suggested. He has sought an examination of how he could, under EU law, make this a social provision &ndash; which is what the Government wants &ndash; rather than a financial provision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Equal Status Bill will, for the first time, provide protection against discrimination outside the field of employment. It deals with discrimination on the grounds of gender, marital status, family status, sexual orientation, religion, age, disability, race and membership of the traveller community and gives those who are discriminated against a statutory means of redress. It has a broad ranging scope covering provision of goods and services, disposal of premises and accommodation, education and registered clubs. This measure complements the Employment Equality Act, 1998, which prohibits discrimination on similar grounds in the workplace.</P>
      <P>Deputies will be aware of the fate of the Equal Status Bill, 1997. The Bill passed all Stages in both Houses of the Oireachtas. It was then referred to the Supreme Court by the President under Article 26 of the Constitution. The Employment Equality Bill, 1996, had already been referred to the Supreme Court and on 15 May 1997 the court found that Bill to be unconstitutional in three respects. As two technical provisions found unconstitutional in the Employment Equality Bill were also contained in the Equal Status Bill, it then became inevitable that the Supreme Court would also find the Equal Status Bill unconstitutional. The court gave its judgment on the Equal Status Bill on 19 June 1997. As expected, it found those two aspects of the Bill &ndash; vicarious liability of employers for criminal acts of employees and use of a certificate in a criminal trial &ndash; to be repugnant to the Constitution. The court declined to examine the Bill further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Preparation of the revised Equal Status Bill was necessarily a more complicated matter than was the development of the revised employment <Col N="336" /> equality legislation. The Employment Equality Bill was examined thoroughly by the Supreme Court, particularly as regards a range of key and controversial provisions, and was found constitutionally sound except for three aspects. It was, therefore, possible to bring forward a revised Employment Equality Bill in the latter part of 1997. That Bill was enacted in June 1998.</P>
    <P>In the case of the Equal Status Bill, however, the court did not examine the Bill as a whole and did not give its imprimatur to any aspect of the Bill. It was, therefore, necessary to obtain extensive legal advice before developing the revised Equal Status Bill. As this is a wide-ranging and complex measure, it was necessary to proceed thoroughly and carefully to ensure that the revised measure would pass the constitutional test. It must be emphasised that there has been no undue delay in bringing forward the revised legislation.</P>
    <P>There is now widespread acceptance of the principle of equal status legislation. Equal status legislation is among the commitments in the Good Friday Agreement. The enactment of an Equal Status Bill has been a fundamental element of the programmes of successive Governments and it was endorsed by the social partners in the Programme for Competitiveness and Work  and in Partnership 2000. The reports of the Second Commission on the Status of Women, the Task Force on the Travelling Community and the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities contained recommendations relating to anti-discrimination legislation.</P>
    <P>The enactment of equal status legislation is necessary to enable Ireland to ratify the UN convention on the elimination of all forms of racial discrimination. This convention has been ratified by 155 countries, including all other EU member states. The enactment of the Equal Status Bill is also necessary to enable us to lift a reservation on the UN convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women.</P>
    <P>At EU level, the fight against discrimination is also set to move beyond the traditional field of gender discrimination in the workplace. The Amsterdam Treaty gives the Community new powers to act on discrimination. Article 13 of the new treaty gives the Community a clear basis for acting to combat discrimination, both in employment and in non-workplace areas, on grounds of sex, race or ethnic origin, religion, disability, age and sexual orientation.</P>
    <P>The essential thrust of the present Bill is the same as that of the 1997 Bill. Changes have been made to rectify faults identified by the Supreme Court consequential on the court's finding on the Employment Equality Bill, in response to faults identified in legal advice and to correct technical points or remove anomalies. I will now set out the main changes.</P>
    <P>The 1997 Bill required service providers to make reasonable accommodation, including the provision of special treatment or facilities, for the needs of people with disabilities, unless such <Col N="337" /> reasonable accommodation would give rise to undue difficulty. The Supreme Court found the comparable requirement in the Employment Equality Bill, 1996, to be unconstitutional. The implications of this judgment were carefully examined before the revised Equal Status Bill was developed. The redrafted version follows the approach taken in the Employment Equality Act 1998, that is, the obligation to make reasonable accommodation is subject to a &ldquo;nominal cost&rdquo; threshold. This approach has been taken following extensive legal advice on the matter.</P>
    <P>As required by the Supreme Court judgment, vicarious liability of employers for acts of employees now applies in respect of civil proceedings only and the subsection which allowed for the use of a certificate as evidence of an offence has been deleted.</P>
    <P>The 1997 Bill provided for the establishment of the Equality Authority with a remit in both employment equality and equal status matters. As the Employment Equality Act, 1998, now includes provision for the establishment of the authority and for its functions in the employment equality area, the present Bill simply extends the functions of the authority to equal status matters.</P>
    <P>The drafting of section 3, which defines discrimination, has been substantially reworded in respect response to legal advice. There are a number of changes in the education area, including the deletion of the provision which allowed schools catering for persons of a particular nationality or national origin to restrict access in certain circumstances. This provision presented constitutional difficulties and, on further consideration, was deemed to be unnecessary.</P>
    <P>Provisions dealing with discrimination by firms, including partnerships, against members-partners have been deleted. These provisions were anomalous <i>vis-à-vis</i> the provisions of the Employment Equality Act, 1998, and were not required by the EU Directive on Self-Employed Activity.</P>
    <P>Registered clubs, which are found to be discriminatory, will forfeit their certificate of registration but will not be denied public funds or the use of publicly owned recreational facilities. The changes follow legal advice on the matter. Deputies will, doubtless, observe other changes in the Bill, but I do not propose to go into detail in relation to these at this point.</P>
    <P>In the past there were some misconceptions about the effect of the Bill on commercial interests. This Bill will prohibit discrimination on specified grounds only. It will not require traders to admit all-comers nor will it prevent business people from refusing service to someone because of bad behaviour or lack of hygiene. It will not give any protection whatsoever to trouble-makers or anti-social elements. I retained in this Bill the various &ldquo;safeguard&rdquo; measures which were included in the 1997 Bill to meet the legitimate concerns of vintners and other traders. These safeguards do not interfere with the Bill's central thrust of outlawing discrimination.</P>
    <P>I will now deal with the specific provisions of <Col N="338" /> the Bill. It is divided into five parts. Part I contains definitions and sets out what is meant by discrimination. Part II deals with discrimination in particular areas. Part III provides means of redress and compensation for persons who may have suffered discrimination. Part IV together with the Schedule extends the functions of the Equality Authority to equal status matters. Part V contains general and technical provisions.</P>
    <P>Part I defines terms used in the Bill. Deputies may wish to note the broad definition of disability in section 2. There is also a comprehensive definition of &ldquo;services&rdquo;, which includes services and facilities of any nature including access to and use of any place, banking or insurance services, facilities for entertainment, recreation or refreshment, culture activities, transport or travel and professional or trade services. It does not include services provided under a contract of service, services that are not generally available to the public or services covered by the Employment Equality Act.</P>
    <P>Section 3 sets out what is meant by discrimination. Discrimination occurs where, on discriminatory grounds that existed, exist, are believed to exist or are considered likely to come into existence, a person is treated less favourably than another person is, has been or would be treated. It also occurs where a person is treated less favourably because of his or her association with a person to whom the discriminatory grounds apply. A further form of discrimination occurs where a requirement to comply with a conditions has a disproportionately adverse effect on a particular category of persons and this requirement cannot be justified as being reasonable in all the circumstances of the case. This form of discrimination is commonly known as &ldquo;indirect discrimination&rdquo; although the term does not appear in the present Bill.</P>
    <P>The discriminatory grounds are gender, marital status, family status, sexual orientation, religion, age, disability, race, colour, nationality or national or ethnic origin, and membership of the traveller community. Victimisation of a person because of his or her involvement in proceedings under this Bill is also treated as a discriminatory ground.</P>
    <P>Section 4 contains particular provisions related to persons with disabilities. I have already referred to the Supreme Court's finding that the &ldquo;reasonable accommodation&rdquo; provisions of the Employment Equality Bill were unconstitutional and the consequent insertion in the Employment Equality Act of a &ldquo;nominal cost&rdquo; threshold for reasonable accommodation. This approach has been followed in the present Bill.</P>
    <P>Part II deals with discrimination in particular areas. Section 5 prohibits discrimination in the provision of goods and services. There are a number of exceptions for differences of treatment in certain circumstances in particular areas, such as insurance, sporting events and entertainment. Among these exclusions are reasonable differences of treatment in the area of insurance and <Col N="339" /> finance, which are based on actuarial or similar data. Examples of this would be the different treatment of persons under 25 in motor insurance and the different treatment of persons on age grounds in life assurance. Differences of treatment of persons on the grounds of gender, age, disability, nationality or national origin are permissible in sporting facilities and events. Thus, for example, the Bill recognises and allows for different events, such as women's or men's football teams, under 21 football teams &ndash; I assume that includes Westmeath &ndash; or games for people with a disability. As these examples show, the various exceptions reflect what most people would regard as acceptable and necessary differences of treatment.</P>
    <P>Discrimination in disposing of premises and provision of accommodation is also prohibited, subject again to a number of exclusions. Among the exemptions are disposals by will or gift, small premises where the accommodation provider continues to live on the premises, accommodation intended for use by persons of one gender and refuges and nursing homes.</P>
    <P>Educational establishments may not discriminate against students in matters such as admission or access to courses. There are a number of exemptions in the education area. For example, single gender schools are permissible. Denominational schools may refuse to admit non-co-religionists in certain circumstances. Education establishments may make reasonably necessary distinctions based on gender, age or disability in relation to sport. Differences of treatment are also warranted if the admission of a student with a disability would make impossible, or be seriously detrimental, to the education of other students.</P>
    <P>Sections 8 to 10 deal with discrimination by registered clubs. The approach taken in relation to such clubs differs from that taken in other areas. The Bill does not prohibit discrimination by clubs against members or potential members. Instead it seeks to discourage such discrimination by allowing a complainant to apply for a determination from the District Court that a registered club, that is, one which can sell intoxicating liquor, is a discriminating club. If the club is determined by the District Court to be a discriminating club, it will not be entitled to renew its certificate of registration until it has rectified the situation.</P>
    <P>A number of exemptions are provided in section 10 in relation to registered clubs. Clubs are not regarded as discriminating just because they cater for persons of a particular religion, age, nationality or ethnic origin. A club may provide separate, but equivalent, facilities for particular age groups or different sexes in certain circumstances. Relevant and reasonably justifiable differences of treatment in relation to sporting facilities or events based on gender, age, disability, national or national origin are permissible. Cer<Col N="340" /> tain positive action measures designed to promote greater equality are also exempted.</P>
    <P>In section 11, sexual harassment or harassment based on any of the discriminatory grounds is prohibited in the areas covered by the Bill. A person in authority in an educational establishment, a person providing services or accommodation or disposing of goods or premises may not sexually harass or harass a student or customer, etc. Furthermore, a person who is responsible for the operation of an educational establishment or a place at which goods, services or accommodation facilities are offered to the public may not allow a student, customer, etc., to suffer sexual harassment or harassment there. It will, however, be a defence for the person responsible to show that he or she took reasonably practicable steps to prevent such harassment. Section 12 prohibits any form of advertising which indicates an intention to discriminate, to sexually harass or to harass.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to some of the specific exemptions which apply to particular areas. There are also some general exemptions in sections 14 and 16. For example, actions which are required to be done by or under statute, court order, EU law or international obligations are exempt, as are bona fide positive action measures. A reasonable preferential charge for persons together with their children, married couples, persons in a specific age group or persons with a disability is permissible. Differential treatment is acceptable where it arises in the exercise of clinical judgment or because the person concerned is incapable of entering an enforceable contract or of giving informed consent.</P>
    <P>Section 15 deals with safeguards. It makes it clear that a service provider or similar person is not required to serve a customer if the service provider has reasonable grounds, other than discriminatory grounds, for the belief that provision of the service would create a substantial risk of criminal or disorderly conduct or behaviour or cause damage to property. It also provides that action taken in good faith for the sole purpose of complying with the Licensing Acts is not discrimination.</P>
    <P>Sections 17 to 19 make special provisions for the needs of persons with a disability in the area of transport accessibility and convenience in using public streets and pavements. They provide for regulations requiring that buses and trains and bus and train stations be readily accessible to persons with disabilities. In addition, road authorities must provide kerb ramps or similar features when constructing or altering public paths.</P>
    <P>I will now turn to the enforcement provisions under Part III of the Bill. Claims of discrimination or harassment may be referred to the Director of Equality Investigations, an independent official whose establishment is provided for in the Employment Equality Act, 1998. This office will provide a simple, inexpensive and speedy means of redress for victims of discrimination. As I have already said, the decision on <Col N="341" /> whether a club is a discriminating club is a matter for the District Court and I would emphasise that the Director of Equality Investigations will have no function in the matter of discriminating clubs.</P>
    <P>The procedures outlined in sections 21 to 39, which deal with cases referred to the director, correspond, subject to certain modifications and exceptions, to those applicable to cases referred to the director under the Employment Equality Act, 1998. I will mention some aspects of the redress procedures. A claim referred to the director under this Bill must be preceded by an initial notification to the respondent within two months of the alleged discrimination, or of its most recent occurrence. This requirement is intended to put the respondent on notice and give him or her the opportunity to take remedial action.</P>
    <P>There is a six month limit for referral of claims to the director, which may be extended in exceptional circumstances to 12 months. The director may at any time dismiss a claim in which the complainant has insufficient interest or which is made in bad faith or is trivial, vexatious or frivolous. The director may investigate a claim or, alternatively, seek to resolve the matter by mediation. Having investigated a claim, the director may award compensation and-or require that a particular course of action be taken. Compensation is limited to the maximum that could be awarded in a civil case in contract, currently £5,000.</P>
    <P>The director will have strong investigative powers to enter premises, to obtain relevant information, through interview or otherwise, and to ensure the imposition of sanctions in the event of failure or refusal by persons to co-operate with an investigation. Decisions of the director may be appealed to the Circuit Court within 42 days. The Equality Authority will have the power under section 24 to refer certain cases to the director. Such cases could involve discrimination against a group of persons or a situation where the person concerned is not in a position to bring a case themselves. The authority may also refer cases involving prohibited advertising, failure to provide kerb ramps and non-compliance with regulations on transport accessibility. It will also have the power to seek injunctions.</P>
    <P>Part IV, together with the Schedule, extends the functions of the Equality Authority, as set out in the Employment Equality Act, 1998, to include equal status matters. Part V deals with general matters, including expenses, regulations, vicarious liability, offences and commencement.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a core element of my Department's equality agenda. It is part of a wide ranging programme of measures aimed at the promotion of greater equality and the full participation of all groups in the economic, social and cultural life of this country. Its provisions and those of the Employment Equality Act, 1998, would give Ireland a comprehensive anti-discrimination code. I look forward to contributions by Deputies on this important legislation.</P>

      <P>Finally, after a two year wait, <Col N="342" /> the Equal Status Bill is being introduced. However, one might ask, with justification, why the delay? While the Minister explained that a great deal of legal advice had to be sought, the essential thrust of this measure is the same as that of the 1997 Bill and it could have been introduced much sooner. Nevertheless, I hope this revised Bill will meet Supreme Court requirements.</P>
      <P>The Minister described the Bill as a ground-breaking measure with the potential to affect many areas of Irish life. However, before any of us starts to congratulate ourselves on this anti-discrimination legislation, we should face reality. The Bill is being introduced at a time when Dublin Bus is purchasing 150 new buses which will not be accessible to people with disabilities and when wheelchair users still have difficulty booking taxis, despite the approval of a further 820 licences for wheelchair adapted taxis. It is being introduced at a time when no transport organisation, including State companies funded by taxpayers, provides disability transport units to ensure the transport needs of disabled people are met. It is being introduced at a time when the interdepartmental committee set up to look at the transport needs of disabled people has not operated for a year. It is being introduced at a time when the 1992 building regulations are being blatantly ignored and disregarded. It is being introduced at a time when many of our health centres are inaccessible. More importantly, it is being introduced in a week when once again, to our shame, we witnessed a protest march to the Dáil last Tuesday by people with disabilities seeking justice, fair play and transport for all.</P>
      <P>We must be realistic and admit that the revised Bill is being introduced against this background of discrimination, exclusion and inequity. I pay tribute to the former Minister, Mervyn Taylor, who introduced the first Equal Status Bill and who, in many ways, broke many barriers with his and his Government's determination to process equality legislation. It is regrettable that this Bill is necessary but there is no doubt that in our society, equality legislation is necessary. Sadly, we still harbour some prejudice and intolerance. In spite of many attempts to sweep it under the carpet, too many of our people experience discrimination and intolerance. The Bill, which I welcome, prohibits discrimination on the grounds of gender, marital status, family status, sexual orientation, religion, age, disability, race, colour, national and ethnic origins and membership of the travelling community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to pose some important questions. Does the substance of the Bill live up to its worthy aspirations? Is it about equality, justice and equal rights? Is it based on the principle that every individual has an equal right to participate in society? All of us believe that everyone should be seen to be of equal worth and entitlement but are they? Will the legislation succeed in breaking down the old barriers and outdated attitudes? It is by answering these questions that we will be able <Col N="343" /> answer the most far reaching question. Will this legislation create the reality to which we aspire?</P>
    <P>Yet in spite of all the equality legislation that has been introduced and all the promises and commitments that have been made in party manifestos and programmes for Government, we must, with some shame, admit that too many people still experience discrimination and that is an unpalatable reality. We must also admit that negative and hostile attitudes still flourish in society. This is the second attempt to introduce this type of legislation as the Equal Status Bill, 1997, was ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court on grounds that some of the sections in it were considered repugnant to the Constitution.</P>
    <P>Many of my comments will relate to people with disabilities. The Supreme Court decisions shocked and dismayed these people, in particular. The Irish Council for People with Disabilities stated that &ldquo;The Supreme Court ruling had taken disability back to the dark ages when property was more important than people.&rdquo;  It immediately initiated a campaign for a constitutional referendum to add a clause banning discrimination against people with disabilities. That was an understandable and reasonable reaction from a sector which weighed all its hopes for equality on this and other legislation.</P>
    <P>The review group on the Constitution proposed the addition of an anti-discrimination clause. It is for this reason that there is an onus, a moral obligation on us to get it right this time and I hope that, in a spirit of co-operation, we end up with a Bill that will truly promote equality and prohibit all forms of discrimination. While I acknowledge that many improvements were made to the 1997 Bill on Committee and Report Stages, nevertheless, I will propose further amendments which are necessary and vital to ensure that this Bill will provide and guarantee the protection and rights of all sections of society. However, I assure the Minister that my amendments and opinions will be offered in a spirit of co-operation and I hope he will give fair and reasonable consideration to them.</P>
    <P>On publishing the Bill, the Minister described it &ldquo;as a ground-breaking measure with the potential to affect many areas of Irish life&rdquo; and said that it would enable Ireland to ratify the UN Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination. He did not refer to important treaties, conventions and covenants, which could have an impact on the success of this legislation, especially as it applies to people with disabilities. The Amsterdam Treaty which came into force on the 1 May 1999 contains an important general non-discrimination clause. Unlike Irish legislation, the Amsterdam Treaty does not state that discrimination can occur if the costs are more than nominal costs. This general provision in Article 6 should have been used as a basis for equality legislation here. Both the Amsterdam Treaty and the Equal Status Bill aim <Col N="344" /> to ensure that there is social inclusion and, therefore, should have the same basis.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that much of the contents of the Bill does not adequately, if at all, reflect the recommendations of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities. Its report was debated and accepted by this House, yet, as with the National Disability Authority Bill, 1998, many of its recommendations have been ignored, diluted or, even worse, changed in this Bill. The definition of &ldquo;access&rdquo; is based on physical access only and the supply of information through an accessible medium is not mentioned. The Bill only recognises spoken or written language and this excludes those who cannot communicate through spoken or written language. To be effective the Bill should specifically provide for information in an accessible format and also Irish sign language.</P>
    <P>An unwelcome change in the Bill is that the onus lies on the individual with a disability to prove a case, which is unlike the previous Bill where the onus was on the service provider. This is a particularly important change when it is taken into account that the majority of people with disabilities come from backgrounds where they are marginalised, discriminated against and, as a result, have a great fear of bureaucracy and administration. However,the essence of the Bill is good and the changes which I will recommend will copperfasten the elimination of discrimination and social exclusion faced by many people. We must have the courage to confront the challenge of ensuring that a proper and strong Bill is passed into law.</P>
    <P>We are going back over old ground in this legislation. As with the National Disability Authority Bill, 1998, I have a problem with the definition of &ldquo;disability&rdquo; as used in this Bill. It is still very much a medical definition and the language used in it has caused distress to many people with disabilities and it is hurtful. In 1997, the USI expressed outrage at the definition and stated that the then Minister had revised the positive outlook for people with disabilities through the language used to define &ldquo;disability&rdquo; in the Bill. When words such as &ldquo;malfunction&rdquo; and &ldquo;malformation&rdquo; are used in a definition they conjure up a medieval image of people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>In any legislation, whether it is this Bill, the National Disability Authority Bill, 1998, or the Employment Equality Bill, 1997, we should be able to define sensitive conditions in a language that is positive and not demeaning. How can people hope to be treated as equal citizens when they are described as &ldquo;different&ldquo;? I hope the Minister will give serious consideration to amendments to this definition on Committee Stage. We depend too much on international and legalistic definitions, rather than on humane and sensitive terminology. The Minister stood firm during the National Disability Authority Bill, 1998, debate on the definition, but, nevertheless, there must be room for agreement.</P>
    <P>I welcome the inclusion of parents and other <Col N="345" /> close relatives in section 2, as they can often be discriminated against by virtue of having a disabled son or daughter or relative, but where are people who live in residential care or sheltered housing accommodation covered? Section 4 is contentious in that it seems to revolve around the medical module of disability. For the great majority of people, use of the word &ldquo;special&rdquo; conjures up an image of major cost and, therefore, could be used for ensuring that people with disability are excluded. Many people are angry with the philosophy and terminology used in this section. Put bluntly, it means that accommodation provision for people with disabilities is to be measured in terms of financial cost, without any definition of what is nominal.</P>
    <P>Neither is it clear in what circumstances the claim of nominal cost will apply. This section has been rewritten just to comply with the Supreme Court judgment, and is not based on what we want in reality. It still allows service providers to opt out and to continue to exclude people with disability from their services.</P>
    <P>The Bill also uses the term &ldquo;reasonable accommodation&rdquo; which is open to interpretation. What is reasonable accommodation? Who will decide on what is, or is not, reasonable? Take, for example, the owner of a night-club who may think the cost of a disability ramp is unreasonable and, therefore, will not ensure accessibility. This section must be tightened up and clearly copperfastened to ensure the term &ldquo;reasonable accommodation&rdquo; cannot be used as a cop out mechanism.</P>
    <P>There is another example of where the word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; is clearly preventing access. Section M of the Building Regulations Act states that any building erected after 1992 must be wheelchair accessible. However, if one is renovating a building which was built before 1992, one has only to make reasonable adjustments. If the Minister examined what people describe as reasonable access, he will find that inaccessibility still exists. Because of that word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo;, many buildings are still inaccessible to people with disabilities. If one takes a trip around any city or town with a wheelchair user the fear of exclusion quickly becomes a frightening reality.</P>
    <P>Section 4(4) is welcome in general terms, but it should not be included in the disability section. Due to its inclusion in that section, it further excludes and marginalises people with mental health disabilities. Why is this section confined to the disability section of the Bill? What about the harm that can be caused to persons who have excess alcohol, drug abusers, those who suffer from road or air rage, or others? Why was this section only written under the disability heading? In its present format, it is basically an insult to people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>Section 5(2)(<i>e</i>) raises a particular concern for me. It seems that insurance companies are exempt from what constitutes discrimination in respect of differences in the treatment of persons in relation to annuities, pensions, insurance poli<Col N="346" /> cies or any other matters related to the assessment of risk where the treatment&ndash;</P>
    <P>(i) is effected by reference to&ndash;</P>
    <P>(I) actuarial or statistical data obtained from a source on which it is reasonable to rely, or</P>
    <P>(II) other relevant underwriting or commercial factors,</P>
    <P>The wording of this section seems to make legal the current discriminatory practices by insurance companies against people with disabilities. This discrimination places a huge burden on such people. I know of people experiencing difficulties in obtaining car insurance. The cost of the car is not the problem, it is the cost of the insurance. In one case, a person with a disability was quoted an annual premium of £3,000 for car insurance. The Bill should help such people instead of copperfastening the rights of insurance companies.</P>
    <P>Serious questions must be posed on this section. Who decides on what is reasonable? What are the other relevant factors that are not mentioned? What is described as &ldquo;actuarial or statistical data&rdquo; has been and continues to be used by insurance companies in determining which customers they will insure, or what loading they will apply to customers. Any section that so facilitates this custom must be strictly examined and debated in full on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>There are many sections in the Bill on which I do not have time to comment at this stage. On Committee Stage I intend to discuss in more detail other sections, including section 17 which deals with the accessibility of transport. Those who are aware of the feelings of people with disabilities know that the question of mobility is one of their primary concerns. In the space of a year we have seen three protest marches to Leinster House by people with disabilities. We should ensure in this Bill that such people can become more mobile by having access to the same type of transport that we all enjoy.</P>
    <P>The Bill is welcome but it is important to ensure that, when enacted, the legislation will work and will have the desired effect. There is simply no point in passing flawed legislation. This is a second chance for us to get it right. We have had the benefit of the last debate on this matter so there can be no excuse for not framing the Bill as perfectly as is humanly possible. The concerns and reservations raised can be dealt with in a positive manner. I hope the Minister will consider the issues raised by me in a fair and co-operative way. We must, as a matter of priority, enact an Equal Status Bill that will truly promote equality and prohibit discrimination. The quality of life for so many people depends upon our deliberations. I hope that, together, we will serve them well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill, although, in common with Deputy Ahearn, I am concerned that it has taken almost two years to introduce it. <Col N="347" /> This followed a Cabinet decision in June 1997, when the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government came into power, to re-enact the Employment Equality Bill and the Equal Status Bill, which were declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ahearn referred to one example within the last six months where Dublin Bus purchased 150 buses which were inaccessible to people with disabilities. That, in itself, is an indication that it would have been better to have introduced the Bill at a much earlier stage. In that way, the legislation would have been in force when Dublin Bus made the decision to purchase a new fleet. The company would, thus, not have been permitted to buy buses to which people with wheelchairs cannot gain access. Dublin Bus has promised to change its ways in future, but the purpose of the Bill is to ensure that such discrimination does not take place.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the Bill, public and private bodies cannot discriminate in the nine categories referred to. The Dublin Bus case is a good example of why it would have been better to have reintroduced the Bill more swiftly. I published a Bill at the end of last year to encourage the Government to move more quickly. The Minister has indicated that the Supreme Court did not investigate the previous Equal Status Bill in any great detail. Nevertheless, it was not necessary to delay the legislation until now. The constitutional problems were not particularly severe in relation to the Equal Status Bill.</P>
      <P>The Bill is presented within the context of a broad international framework. The Good Friday agreement is one of the most important elements upon which the Bill is based. There is a commitment in that agreement to produce equal status legislation as well as a Human Rights Bill which is being worked on in committee at the moment. I regret that I cannot attend the committee today because it is sitting at the same time as this debate is taking place.</P>
      <P>There are also the UN's standard rules and a variety of international conventions, some of which the Minister referred to in his contribution. These include, for example, the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. The Amsterdam Treaty is clearly of central importance. There is also the Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of Human Rights, the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, the UN Convention on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the UN Declaration on the Rights of Disabled People of 1975, the UN Declaration on the Rights of Retarded Persons, which was the language used at the time, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the UN Standard Rules on the Equalisation of Opportunities for Persons with Disabilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Ahearn said, the Amsterdam Treaty provides a general framework for non-discrimination in Article 6, which states that without prejudice to the other provisions of this Treaty <Col N="348" /> and within the limits of the powers conferred by it upon the Community, the Council, acting unanimously on a proposal from the Commission and after consulting the European Parliament, may take appropriate action to combat discrimination based on sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation. There is no mention in that Article of &ldquo;nominal cost&rdquo;, a phrase which is included in this Bill and in the Employment Equality Act.</P>
    <P>The standard rules on the equalisation of opportunities for persons with disabilities are very important as a framework in which we set our legislation. These were adopted by the UN General Assembly on 20 December 1993. The main purpose of the rules is to show how society has to and can change to allow all its members to participate on an equal basis. There is more detailed guidance in the standard rules as to what is required than ever before. The rules cannot be enforced legally but it was hoped that they could be an accepted standard internationally when looking at the lives of people with disabilities. The Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities adopted those rules as a major reference guide during its discussions and included them in its final report.</P>
    <P>The rules cover all aspects of a person's life and show how states can make social, political and legal changes to ensure that people with disabilities can become full and equal citizens of their country. The rules also provide the basis for technical and economic co-operation among States, the UN and other international organisations. There are 22 such standard rules and Ireland was one of the signatories to them.</P>
    <P>That is the international context to this important Bill. I am disappointed by the reproduction of the term &ldquo;nominal cost&rdquo; from the Employment Equality Act in this Bill. The Minister knows we tried hard to have that amended during the debate on the Employment Equality Act. Section 4 of this Bill is very disappointing and, as Deputy Ahearn said, it concentrates on people with disabilities in a way that the other nine categories are not concentrated on. That concentration is very negative and I hope the Minister looks at it again.</P>
    <P>I refer particularly to section 4(2), which states that a refusal or failure to provide the special treatment or facilities to which subsection (1) refers shall not be deemed reasonable unless such provision would give rise to a cost, other than a nominal cost, to the provider of the service in question. Section 4(3) states that a refusal or failure to provide the special treatment or facilities to which subsection (1) refers does not constitute discrimination if, by virtue of another provision of this Act, a refusal or failure to provide the service in question to that person would not constitute discrimination. Where a person has a disability that in the circumstances could cause harm to the persons or to others, treating the person differently to the extent reasonably necessary to <Col N="349" /> prevent such harm does not constitute discrimination.</P>
    <P>The concept of undue difficulty is one with which the Supreme Court took issue and could be more positively dealt with. We are taking a step back rather than a step forward by including this section and I ask the Minister to look at it again. We are trying to improve the protection of these nine categories and this section does the opposite.</P>
    <P>We are experiencing a time of economic growth and there is a lot of wealth in the country, including in the coffers of the Minister for Finance. We are now at the important stage of defining what kind of society we want in the next millennium. We want a society that is based on citizenship and that is interactive. I believe the public would be very supportive of spending more funds on those suffering disadvantage, including those suffering a variety of disabilities.</P>
    <P>The nine grounds on which discrimination is outlawed in the Bill are comprehensive and proactive in promoting tolerance and respect for diversity. There is disturbing evidence that the potential for racist sentiment is not far below the surface, though most citizens empathise with the stranger in a strange land. There is also evidence of a selfishness that does not want to share but the Bill will help combat racism. There has been a steady stream of immigrants into Ireland in the recent past which can be divided into many categories: students, EU citizens, asylum seekers and non-EU citizens who have qualified for work permits. There is also the very welcome group of Kosovans who arrived recently. In some instances society has not reacted well to this influx and one can easily detect the emergence of sentiments such as those which fuelled the growth of the National Front in France and other far right groups in Europe. I hope this legislation will become one of the State's most effective tools in combatting this nascent racism. As a country with a long history of emigration we should be to the forefront in the campaign against racism and intolerance. We need only look at the experience of our previous generations of emigrants to see how soul destroying exclusion and intolerance can be. The ignorance and, in many cases, brutality visited on so many Irish emigrants is known to every Member.</P>
    <P>It is important that we use language sensitively to develop a society where racism cannot take root. We must talk sensitively about refugees and asylum seekers. I believe we need to grant the right to work, to education and to legal representation, though I recognise that there has been progress on this front. These people are entitled to a fair hearing and, above all, to respect. We have an important role as public representatives in leading public perception by using inclusive language and by reducing the tendency to set the needs of locals against the needs of asylum seekers or travellers, which often happens.</P>
    <P>What progress has been made in finding suitable premises for the Equality Authority? When can we expect to see the full implementation of <Col N="350" /> the Employment Equality Act and this Bill, when it passes? It is also important to have an information campaign for the public and for the targeted groups. It is important to convey the provisions and protections in the Bill to those at whom it is aimed.</P>
    <P>I welcome the progress made by the Garda in embracing different cultures and in setting up training programmes to deal with this matter. Last week I put down a Parliamentary Question on the relationship between the Garda and the gay and lesbian community and the response was very positive. There is now co-operation between representatives of gays and lesbians and the Garda. There are also education and training programmes to enable the Garda use new technology and a code of practice is also being introduced. Those are the kinds of measures we need to introduce.</P>
    <P>I hope the recommendations of the Commission on Travelling People will be implemented as soon as possible. There is still a lot of subtle discrimination against women. I refer to the matter of registered clubs. I am disappointed that the Minister said he has altered the relevant section in the Bill so that, while clubs found to be discriminatory will forfeit their registration, they will not be denied public funds or the use of publicly owned recreation facilities. The Minister said the changes follow legal advice on the matter.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to look at this again. I have met representatives of the Irish Ladies' Golfing Union and they have specific problems in that there are loopholes in the law. For example, different categories of members of golf clubs do not have full voting rights in relation to some issues such as how money is to be spent and how membership is to be organised. Such loopholes mean women can still be discriminated against even under this legislation. Also, members were not permitted to become full members of such clubs for many years, even though they were, in effect, full members. They are now being charged the full amount for new membership fees as if they were coming to the club for the first time.</P>
    <P>The Bill restricts rather than enhances the rights of people with disabilities. While referring to the Employment Equality Bill, I quoted dictionary definitions of &ldquo;nominal&rdquo;. These include &ldquo;token&rdquo;, &ldquo;small&rdquo;, &ldquo;minimal in comparison with real worth or what is expected&rdquo;, &ldquo;in name only&rdquo;. If this is the best wording that can be produced, the balance between social justice and constitutional property rights is badly skewed in favour of property rights. If the Minister is constrained to this extent we should acknowledge the Constitution's inadequacy to construct the society we wish to have in the next century and propose that the people amend it. I hope the necessary amendments will be passed on Committee Stage. If they are not, I cannot see how the promised disability Bill will be any more constitutional than this legislation or its forerunner. Given the consti<Col N="351" /> tutional restraints and the Minister's interpretation of them, a constitutional amendment will be necessary in order to restore a balance between social and property rights. If the Minister cannot accept amendments to this Bill, I hope he will consider a constitutional amendment.</P>
    <P>When equality legislation is qualified it is very easy to cross the boundary line between protecting against discrimination and providing for it. That boundary is crossed in section 4 of the Bill. I urge the Minister to re-examine this section.</P>
    <P>I agree with what Deputy Theresa Ahearn said about sensory disabilities, particularly Irish sign language, and the need for people to have comprehensible information and access. The inaccessibility of, for example, ATM machines and public telephones has been highlighted. The lack of access to these facilities is often unnoticed by those of us who do not use wheelchairs. Deputy Ahearn referred to demonstrations about the transport issue by people with disabilities. While there is a number of wheelchair accessible taxis they do not seem to be available for wheelchair-using passengers. I realise that taxis are owned by private companies and individuals, but this issue must be dealt with and the rights people with disabilities must be protected. The question of accessibility to all forms of public transport must be addressed.</P>
    <P>The country has a great deal of wealth at present. Spending on important infrastructrure has been growing steadily while spending on facilities for people with disabilities has grown only very slowly. We must adopt a rights based attitude to the provision of these facilities rather than be constrained by lack of funds. People must have access, by right, to what they need. People with disabilities should not be forced to take part in ongoing pressure groups progressing from one issue to the next.</P>
    <P>Ensuring that buildings and services throughout the country are accessible in time for the forthcoming Special Olympics will present a challenge. I hope we rise to that challenge and see the event as an opportunity to put such facilities in place. The Franklin D. Roosevelt prize was won largely on the basis of the recommendations in the report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities. These recommendations must be fully implemented.</P>
    <P>Local authorities and particularly vocational education committees have an important role in protecting the rights of people with disabilities. The local authority of which I am a member recently adopted a motion encouraging our council to implement the UN standard rules to which I referred earlier. Section M of the building regulations referred to by Deputy Ahearn is extremely important in terms of access. Progress will be made in providing accessibility only if designated staff are appointed in each local authority to ensure that regulations are properly implemented. Things which are no one's particular responsibility tend not to be done.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="352" /> Local authorities and vocational education committees play an important role in providing access to sporting facilities for females. In my area we have great difficulty ensuring that soccer pitches are provided for girls. On soccer pitches all over the country male teams of all ages and standards are given priority and girls play only when they are not being used by boys or men. I hope this legislation will force local authorities to give equality to girls and women in sport. The family and marital status aspects of the legislation should give rights to single people who often find it difficult to get public housing.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the need to dovetail this legislation with previous legislation, including the Employment Equality Act, the Amsterdam Treaty, the UN standard rules, various international conventions and human rights, immigration, refugee and consumer protection legislation. If this can be done and if we can overcome the constitutional obstacles, we can develop the kind of society we want. We must also show leadership and propagate tolerance. We must sow the seeds of tolerance and nourish and enrich the ground in which they grow. Public representatives, teachers, gardaí and members of public authorities play a role in this. When the legislative framework is in place we must promote the societal attitudes which go with it. This is not simply a matter of making speeches and preaching to people. We must also co-operate with people, persuade and advocate and confront issues such as the placing of halting sites and the allocation of scarce resources to the needs of minority groups. This takes leadership and patient negotiation. My last conversation with the late Deputy Pat Upton was on this issue. We spoke of how it was not sufficient to make speeches in the Oireachtas and of how one must also work with people and gradually persuade those who have negative attitudes towards equality. Local partnerships have done much work in this area. My own partnership, the Paul partnership in Limerick, includes a traveller development group.</P>
    <P>We live in a highly competitive world which, while encouraging people to do their best, often leaves people behind. We have an obligation to build a framework which ensures inclusion. If that entails extra costs and extra trouble to service providers, so be it. If it is impeded by clauses in the Constitution, that question must be addressed. If this legislation cannot be improved, it will not do what we want it to do. We need a rights based legislative framework and if we must change the Constitution to provide it, we must propose that to the people. I welcome the legislation and look forward to debating its further Stages.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully support the provisions of this ground-breaking measure which has the potential to affect many areas of Irish life. It replaces the Equal Status Bill, 1997, which the Supreme Court found unconstitutional. The thrust of this measure is the same as the 1997 Bill <Col N="353" /> but it has been appropriately amended to meet the requirements of the Supreme Court. The Bill represents a commitment to the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement. It is necessary to enable Ireland to ratify the UN Convention on the elimination of all forms of racial discrimination and to lift our reserve on the UN Convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides for the promotion of equality and the prohibition of discrimination, harassment and related behaviour in non-employment areas and for remedies and enforcement measures. It complements the Employment Equality Act, 1998, which outlaws discrimination in all areas relevant to employment. The specific grounds on which it prohibits discrimination are gender, marital and family status, sexual orientation, religion, age, disability, race, including colour, nationality, ethnic and national origin, and membership of the travelling community. The Bill outlaws direct and indirect discrimination on these grounds with regard to the provision of goods and services, accommodation, disposal of premises and education. All services generally available to the public are covered, including facilities for refreshments and entertainment, credit facilities and transport services.</P>
      <P>Complaints of discrimination, other than discrimination by registered clubs, may be referred to the office of the Director of Equality Investigations established under the Employment Equality Act, 1998. The director, having investigated a case, can award compensation of up to £5,000 or require the taking of a specific course of action. Decisions of the director in equal status cases may be appealed to the Circuit Court. Cases involving registered clubs will be heard by the District Court with an appeal to the Circuit Court. Under the Bill the remit of the Equality Authority will also include equal status measures.</P>
      <P>Section 3 defines discrimination for the purpose of the Bill. Discrimination shall be taken to occur where on one or other of the discriminatory grounds that exist at present, which previously existed but no longer exists or which may exist in the future, or which is imputed to a person, a person is treated less favourably than another person is, has been or would be treated. Discrimination also takes place where the requirement to comply with a condition has a substantially more adverse effect on a category of persons than on others and the obligation to comply with that condition cannot be justified as being reasonable in all the circumstances of the case.</P>
      <P>Section 5 prohibits discrimination in the disposal of goods or the provision of a service. It is irrelevant that the goods or service are provided for payment or only to a section of the public. There are exemptions for the disposal of goods by will or gift and for differences of treatment in certain circumstances in particular areas such as insurance, adopting-fostering, sporting events and entertainment and where privacy is a factor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 6 prohibits discrimination in land dis<Col N="354" /> positions, provision of accommodation and services and amenities related to accommodation. Section 7 prohibits discrimination by educational establishments against students in relation to admission, access to courses and facilities. Primary and post-primary schools will not be regarded as discriminatory just because they are single gender and a seminary may restrict admission to students of only one gender or religious belief. Differences of treatment by third level institutions as between EU nationals and students from third countries are exempt. An educational establishment may limit the access of a student with a disability if the student's disability is such that it would make it impossible or be seriously detrimental to the education of other students.</P>
    <P>Section 8 outlines the criteria and process by which a club is determined to be a discriminating club. A club is considered to be a discriminating club if it discriminates against a member or applicant for membership. Any person, including the Equality Authority, may seek a determination of the District Court that the club is a discriminating club. Such an application may be dismissed by the District Court if it is brought in bad faith or is frivolous, vexatious or trivial. The determination may be appealed to the Circuit Court within 42 days.</P>
    <P>Section 9 provides that in certain circumstances a club is not considered to be a discriminating club. A club whose principal purpose is to cater for persons of a particular religion, age, nationality or ethnic or national origin and which refuses membership to a person who does not belong to the relevant category is not considered discriminating. A club is not considered discriminating if it confines access to a membership benefit or privilege to persons of a particular gender or age group provided that it would not be practicable to do otherwise and provided that the same or equivalent benefit is provided separately to those excluded.</P>
    <P>I agree with the provisions of section 10 which provides that a certificate of registration under the Registration of Clubs Acts, 1904 to 1995, which would permit the sale of intoxicating liquor will not be granted or renewed for a discriminating club.</P>
    <P>Sexual harassment is covered by section 11. A person in authority in an educational establishment, a person providing services or accommodation, or disposing of goods or premises is prohibited from sexually harassing or harassing a student or customer as the case may be. Sexual harassment is defined as an unwelcome act of physical intimacy, an unwelcome request for sexual favours or an unwelcome act or conduct with sexual connotations.</P>
    <P>Section 12 makes it an offence to publish or display an advertisement which indicates an intention to engage in prohibited conduct. Section 16 specifies that certain actions are not discriminatory. A reasonable preferential charge for persons together with their children, married <Col N="355" /> couples, persons in a specific age group, or persons with a disability is permissible.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill deals with enforcement. The Employment Equality Act, 1998, provides for the establishment of the Equality Authority and the office of the Director of Equality Investigations and for their respective functions in the employment equality area. Under section 21 a person who claims that prohibited conduct under the Bill has been directed against any person may refer the case to the director. No claim will be investigated unless the complainant gives the respondent an initial notification in writing within two months of the alleged act of discrimination and the respondent fails to reply to the satisfaction of the complainant. The director may dismiss the claim if the complainant does not have sufficient interest in the claim or the claim has been made in bad faith, is frivolous, vexatious or trivial.</P>
    <P>Sections 26 to 31 deal with investigations by the director. The types of redress which the director may order are one or both of the following: an order for compensation or an order that the persons as specified in the order shall take a specific course of action. The director may go to the Circuit Court to seek information to take specific courses of action. Part IV of the Bill outlines the additional functions conferred on the Equality Authority.</P>
    <P>I fully support the legislation which is enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement and the principles of common sense. We want to build a society that respects the differences of others. Discrimination is the key element which must be eliminated at all times. The Amsterdam Treaty which came into effect on 1 May gives the European Union greater powers in combating discrimination in society. The European Union should take the necessary measures to achieve these important policy objectives.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and commend the Minister for bringing it forward and moving, at long last, on the equality agenda, the impetus for which was provided by my former colleague and Minister, Mervyn Taylor, who introduced a large tranche of reforming legislation. During the term of office of the partnership Government there was a separate Department of Equality and Law Reform. It is to be regretted that the Fianna Fáil Party, for whatever reason, took it upon itself following the 1997 general election to dismantle that Department and place it under the wing, as a small division, of the Department of Justice.</P>
      <P>Day in, day out the Department must deal with the myriad of problems relating to the Justice portfolio, including the gardaí, prisons and the crime wave. While this point is slightly off the subject under debate, I repeat my call for an independent audit of current crime statistics because serious crime is on the increase as we have seen over the past 18 months and it is incumbent on us to deal with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="356" /> The former Department of Equality and Law Reform was subsumed and submerged by the Minister's massive Department. The pioneering drive which Mervyn Taylor brought to that Department during the partnership and Rainbow Governments has sadly been lost as a result of not having an independent Department. We find ourselves here some years after the Supreme Court decision again addressing equality legislation. It was regrettable that the Employment Equality Bill was found unconstitutional by the Supreme Court, that we have had to revisit this Bill and that we did not have this necessary legislation on the Statute Book for the past number of years.</P>
    <P>Like many Deputies who represent the Dublin area, I see the need to address the issue of equality on a daily basis, particularly in relation to people from different ethnic backgrounds, people with disabilities and the traveller community. Yesterday, I represented one of the new Irish, one of the people who arrived in this country in recent years. He has married and is living with a young family in an inner city private flat and complains bitterly that he has been subjected to harassment and intimidation. He is from a North African country. As regards his ultimate status and that of family, it is clear he will remain in this country long-term. The catalogue of abuse he detailed to me makes it incumbent on this House to take a stern stand on this issue and to make it clear that that type of behaviour is intolerable. Certain areas of our city have changed with the arrival of newcomers and it is incumbent on the Minister to implement the significant refugee legislation which the Rainbow Government passed and which was worked on by the previous Government in the partnership era.</P>
    <P>This legislation is crucial as regards the administration of the rights of citizens, and I referred to people from different ethnic backgrounds. My colleagues and I believe it is regrettable that the Minister has seen fit to water down some of the ground breaking aspects of the original Equal Status Bill banning discrimination. On Committee Stage we need to look at a number of aspects of this Bill as regards reform.</P>
    <P>In recent years people suffering from disability have often complained bitterly to Members on all sides about the lack of will on the part of the House and the Government to take the fundamental action necessary to promote accessibility at all levels and to ensure the full integration into the workforce and community of people suffering from physical disabilities in particular. It was a disgrace that the expansion plans for Dublin Bus announced by the Minister's colleague did not originally provide for those with disability and also for accessibility.</P>
    <P>I represent one of the constituencies in the capital city which is served by the DART. We, with the northside organisation for those with disability and for the improvement of accessibility in transport, which is based in my constituency, have had lengthy ongoing negotiations in this regard. <Col N="357" /> We have come up against a rigid and what will be, following the enactment of this legislation, an illegal approach by Iarnród Éireann which refused to make the DART stations on the northside, in particular, accessible and to invest in necessary accessible carriages and platforms. It is impossible for members of that group in the Kilbarrack and Edenmore areas, in particular, to utilise the excellent public transport which the DART provides because no effort has been made by Iarnród Éireann. Until very recently, no effort was made by Bus Éireann either to promote full accessibility.</P>
    <P>Over the years the public sector has attempted to engage in affirmative action in relation to people with disabilities. When I was a Member of the Committee of Public Accounts in the 27th Dáil, almost every year we asked the Accounting Officers of each Department about the 3 per cent rule in relation to people with disability. Although I am not sure if the position has improved much in recent years, we seemed to be far from enabling people with disability to take their rightful role in the public service.</P>
    <P>I refer to the traveller community and the settlement of that community. My northside constituency and neighbouring constituencies have taken the lead through Dublin City Council and, to a much lesser extent, Fingal County Council, which is not yet properly off the blocks in relation to the provision of settled accommodation. The northside areas administered by Dublin City Council have begun to seriously address the housing and associated needs of the traveller community over the past ten or 15 years. The Housing Act, 1955, this legislation and the Constitution make it clear that this is something with which we must deal. I pay tribute to my colleague, Deputy McManus, and former Senator Mary Kelly who were very prominent in heading up the commission on the traveller community and their rights as regards, health, housing, education and so on.</P>
    <P>I am proud that a number of parishes in my area have 30, 40 or 50 housing units for travellers but, in general, it is an area in which we need to take a tough and determined stand to ensure the right to housing for everybody, particularly for this small number whose ancestry and traditions go back to time immemorial. Very often they bear some of the greatest names in our country's history, such as Ward, McDonagh, Gavin and so on.</P>
    <P>I commend this Minister to the extent that this legislation has been introduced and will make it illegal for people to discriminate in the provision of basic services and, indeed, social services for the traveller community. Housing and education programmes have helped to integrate the settled and traveller communities in my area in recent decades. There are many promising developments in that area. This legislation will strengthen communities and encourage them to realise their full potential.</P>
    <P>Although this is the second time around for this <Col N="358" /> Bill, I commend the Minister for introducing it. We will raise a number of issues on Committee Stage. We hope it will be law as soon as possible and that discrimination on the grounds of religion, ethnic background, sexuality, etc. will be left in the past as we move into the 21st century. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies who contributed to this debate. Deputy Theresa Ahearn referred to the lack of wheelchair accessible taxis, the fact the interdepartmental committee on transport has not met and that building regulations are being ignored. She acknowledged that many of the issues she mentioned are not relevant to my Department. I can only introduce this legislation in the best spirit possible.</P>
      <P>I draw the Deputy's attention to the power under sections 17 and 18 to make regulations to ensure that certain vehicles, including buses and trains, and bus and train stations are accessible to people with disabilities. I am sure she welcomes that provision. Building regulations do not come within my remit. I join the Deputy in encouraging everyone to be mindful of the need to ensure accessibility for people with disabilities. I assure her that regulations which can be made under the relevant sections will be considered carefully in the context of the implementation of this legislation.</P>
      <P>Deputies Theresa Ahearn, O'Sullivan and Broughan expressed concern at the lapse of time since the previous legislation was introduced and suggested that it should not have taken two years to introduce this Bill. We were obliged to proceed extremely carefully to ensure the Bill was constitutional. The Employment Equality Bill was considered in great detail by the Supreme Court. This meant we were able to address the issues which were found to be unconstitutional by the Supreme Court and introduce an Employment Equality Bill which was not unconstitutional and covered the points raised by the Supreme Court.</P>
      <P>The difficulty is that the Supreme Court did not consider the Equal Status Bill in any detail. In those circumstances, we were operating without the benefit of the Supreme Court's judgment and had to proceed with great caution. The broad scope of the legislation and the many constitutional issues involved meant we would have been foolish not to take detailed legal advice and that is what we did. There was no point rushing through a Bill which might not stand the test of time. We had to introduce legislation which would stand up. We did that in so far as it was possible for us to introduce legislation which comes within the parameters of the Constitution, although nobody can be definitive about such things. I am sure everyone agrees it was more important to get it right than to rush through a Bill which might fail at the first hurdle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Theresa Ahearn also referred to the Supreme Court judgment on disability and said it had been criticised by many people who advocate <Col N="359" /> the rights of people with disabilities. I note what she said about what is seen as a setback for people with disabilities. She also said that section 4 was inserted only to comply with the judgment and not to reflect equality. Unfortunately, we had little room for manoeuvre because of the Supreme Court judgment and consequential upon it. It was my desire to preserve the concept of reasonable accommodation as far as I could. In doing that, I had to ensure the Bill was constitutional. This presented a difficulty and it would be churlish of me not to admit that. We tried to include the reasonable accommodation provision as far as we could, but I admit we were greatly constrained, as Deputy Theresa Ahearn pointed out, by the Supreme Court judgment.</P>
    <P>We discussed the definition of disability in great detail during our deliberations on the Employment Equality Bill. It would not be fair to participants in this debate, who also engaged in that debate, to go over that ground again. I am sure everyone will be relieved to learn that I will not do that. The definition is the same as that in the Employment Equality Act, 1998.</P>
    <P>Deputy Theresa Ahearn also referred to treaties, including the Amsterdam Treaty. Article 13 of the Amsterdam Treaty enables the EU to take action to combat discrimination based on a number of grounds, including sex, religion, race, age, disability or sexual orientation. Any action must be taken on the basis of anonymity. Action could include, for example, a directive or an awareness raising programme. My understanding is that no action has yet been taken under Article 13. There is no contradiction between this legislation and Article 13. Article 13 of the Amsterdam Treaty, which deals with equality provisions, states that the Council acting unanimously on a proposal from the Commission and after consulting the European Parliament may take appropriate action to combat discrimination based on the various grounds.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Sullivan asked about premises and the operative date of the legislation. As I announced in March, premises for the Equality Authority and the Director of Equality Investigations have been secured at Clonmel Place near Harcourt Street. I understand it is a very fine premises. The Employment Equality Act is due to come into operation on 1 September 1999. It is not possible to say when this legislation will come into effect. The legislation will be brought forward and will take effect at the earliest date practicable.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Sullivan referred also to the views of women golfers and the whole issue of registered clubs. There is only one sanction in this legislation against the discrimination of registered clubs. While some may say it would be desirable if there were more sanctions, the legislation reflects the legal advice I have received. However, the removal of a drinks licence from a registered club is a serious sanction. It would remove from the club a lucrative source of rev<Col N="360" /> enue. We had to take legal advice in regard to other sanctions and the legislation reflects the legal advice obtained.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Sullivan referred to concerns expressed by women golfers about the voting rights of associate members. I do not consider it would be appropriate to include a detailed provision of that type in this Bill. I emphasise the Bill deals with discrimination not only in regard to membership but in regard to facilities offered to members of registered clubs.</P>
    <P>The Deputy criticised section 4(4) and said it was targeted at people with disabilities. Section 18(3) of Deputy O'Sullivan's legislation is similar to section 4(4).</P>

      <P>I thank Deputies for their contributions. The debate has not been as controversial as the previous discussion which related to the Employment Equality Bill. I look forward to the debate on Committee and Report Stages. I recognise the work and research the Opposition have done for this debate. I acknowledge their bona fides in trying to improve the legislation. If there are amendments on Committee or Report Stages which are worthwhile and should be taken on board, I will not be found wanting in that respect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to address the House on important issues of foreign policy. For understandable reasons there has been a great deal of focus recently on the terrible events in Kosovo and surrounding countries and the debate about our proposed membership of PfP. I will address both issues in my speech today. Important as they are, however, they constitute but part of the broad spectrum of our foreign policy. In well over 40 capitals where we have resident missions, in cities as diverse as Washington and Maputo, in the chambers of the United Nations and the Council rooms of Brussels I am proud that <Col N="361" /> Ireland plays an active role in world affairs. We have a strong and effective foreign policy which is well positioned to meet the challenges of the new millennium.</P>
      <P>Ireland is a militarily neutral country, but that does not mean that we have a neutral approach to the major issues confronting us in the world today, or that we are ineffective in our efforts to promote constructive solutions to the problems facing us. It is precisely because of the traditional values that have long inspired our foreign policy that we are better placed to promote positive developments than many larger countries, who are restricted by various constraints. We do not seek to emulate the larger countries. We have no aspirations to &ldquo;force projection&rdquo; in sensitive regions of the world. That is not for us. What we can do, and I believe we are doing, is to use our advantages to best effect in a number of key areas.</P>
      <P>Before I turn to the issues of Kosovo and Partnership for Peace, it may be useful to set out the broad context in which the approach that we are taking on these two specific issues is situated. This will provide reassurance that the objectives of Irish foreign policy remain those that we have been following for many years and that there is no intention whatsoever of redefining these to serve any short-term needs.</P>
      <P>Let me give some examples. Last week in the Hague, I gave one of the opening addresses to the Hague Peace Appeal and chaired a round table discussion involving three Nobel Laureates: Archbishop Tutu, Ramos Horta and Rigoberta Menchu. In my opening statement, I described the efforts which Ireland has been making, together with a small group of like-minded countries, to promote further our initiative for nuclear disarmament. Already, last year, our resolution in the United Nations General Assembly was adopted by an overwhelming majority. This year we are actively preparing for the Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference in 2000, and we look forward to even greater support at the General Assembly in the autumn. I cannot accept that on issues of such fundamental importance Ireland cannot or should not make its voice heard.</P>
      <P>In that regard it is interesting to note in today's edition of the <i>International Herald Tribune</i> an article under the heading &ldquo;The World Rejects Nuclear Arms&rdquo;. It is a joint article by Swedish colleague, the Foreign Minister, Anna Lindh, and myself. It is interesting that it should receive significant prominence in a paper of the reputation of the <i>International Herald Tribune.</i> It is indicative of the fact that although we are a small neutral country people listen to us and read what we have to say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also described in the Hague the efforts we have been making to ensure the effective implementation of the Ottawa Treaty banning anti-personnel landmines. Earlier this month I attended in Maputo the first conference of state parties to the treaty. I witnessed at first hand the trauma and devastation that these inhumane weapons <Col N="362" /> have caused in Mozambique. I saw the efforts that are being made, including those funded by Irish aid, to clear the land of these abominable devices. I challenge anyone who says that we do not have a foreign policy to go out and see for themselves what is being done.</P>
    <P>When I was in Maputo, I had detailed discussions with President Chissano and, separately, with my Mozambican counterpart on a wide range of issues. We discussed the conflicts that are raging in Africa, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Angola as well as between Ethiopia and Eritrea and in the Sudan. Many thousands of people are dying in these conflicts and the fact that they are not European is no reason for spending fewer resources on efforts to settle them.</P>
    <P>The issue, however, that my interlocutors were most interested in was what was happening in East Timor and my recent involvement when, following my visit to Dili last month, I sought to focus international attention on the urgent need for action. There have been some positive developments, but major threats remain. Following the recent signature of an agreement in New York, we will participate actively in activities under the auspices of the United Nations in support of the consultative process. I also took the opportunity at that conference to speak to the Foreign Ministers of many other countries in connection with our upcoming contest for the Security Council.</P>
    <P>My last example relates to what I saw in Africa during my recent visit to Tanzania, which is a great country, and South Africa and also on earlier occasions in relation to our development co-operation programme. The Irish aid programme has grown, in the quarter century of its existence, from a budget of £1.5 million to over £159 million. It has also grown in spread and quality, focusing on people in some of the poorest countries in the world. We seek to make our development assistance activities sustainable. By tackling the basic problems of deprivation, whether in health, education or other basic needs, in a spirit of equal partnership and working with public and private bodies, including NGOs, we are making a tangible and meaningful contribution to building peace, justice and prosperity in the areas where it is most needed.</P>
    <P>I have given these examples to show that we have wider horizons and ambitious goals not confined to Europe. However, the same principles and approach apply to what we aim to achieve in Europe and acting in concert with our EU partners, in the Union's common foreign and security policy. Earlier this month an important event, not only for Ireland but for all the countries of Europe, took place but it did not attract as much public attention as it deserved. This was the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam. This treaty put into place the framework within which the European Union will seek to achieve its objectives of providing a peaceful and prosperous Europe, free of all tensions and dangers which <Col N="363" /> overshadowed the history of our continent and the whole world in the first half of this century.</P>
    <P>A year ago, however, we were engaged in a wide-ranging and lively debate on what the Treaty of Amsterdam meant for Ireland, what its implications for the future might be and how Ireland could play its full part in the construction of Europe while preserving the core values which have always inspired our foreign policy. I suggest the reason the entry into force of the Amsterdam Treaty has attracted relatively little attention is that we are comfortable with it. We can identify well with the provisions relating to conflict prevention and peacekeeping activities and we want to see them becoming effective. If any warning is needed of what happens when conflict prevention activities are not effective, we need look no further than the Western Balkans. The 1990s will be remembered for the appalling carnage and atrocities which took place first in Croatia and Bosnia and are now being replicated in Kosovo.</P>
    <P>The overriding imperative is a moral one. A Europe which turns a blind eye to gross abuse of human rights is a Europe which allows the seeds of its own self-destruction to take root. That is why we in Ireland attach such enormous importance to upholding human rights and why we have been very active in this area internationally. Mrs. Mary Robinson's tireless efforts, including in Kosovo, on behalf of the whole international community have rightly received attention. We should also, however, recognise the efforts of all the non-governmental organisations which ensure that these issues cannot be swept under the carpet. I pay tribute to the efforts of the Irish delegation to the United Nations in Geneva, which last month chaired the annual session of the Commission on Human Rights.</P>
    <P>However, it is not enough to increase awareness of human rights and ensure adequate means of protecting them, we must also ensure that the abusers of human rights are brought to justice. It is vital that those who have in the past committed atrocities, and who are doing so even as I speak, should be identified and brought to justice as soon as possible. Under no circumstances should they be rewarded. This applies in the case of Kosovo. Prevention is much better, and less expensive, than cure.</P>
    <P>Apart from the moral imperative, there are very powerful arguments for ensuring that conflict prevention is successful. The costs of failure, in human and economic terms, vastly outweigh the costs of preventive action. If one looks, for example, at the annual budget of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, the regional organisation with wide-ranging responsibilities for maintaining peace in Europe, and contrast it with the cost of just one day's military activity related to Kosovo, one might question the priorities. If one looks at the chronic financing problems of the United Nations, and the effect this is having on its conflict prevention and peacekeeping operations, the short-sight<Col N="364" /> edness of the current approach is even more apparent.</P>
    <P>The greatest human costs are those being borne by the Kosovo Albanians themselves. Those whom we seek to protect are the main victims. Nearly one million have already lost their homes. What we are doing in Ireland to help refugees is very necessary, but represents only a small part of a much bigger international response. I know the refugees would like to return home as soon as circumstances permit but, tragically, there is little prospect of this in the immediate future.</P>
    <P>My colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy O'Donnell, will visit the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia next week in order to assess the situation and in particular the needs of refugees, including those who will be coming to Ireland. I reiterate that we will be generous. Ireland is committed to taking 1,000 refugees immediately, but if and when it becomes necessary to take more, we will not be found wanting. The Government will do its duty in the international community.</P>
    <P>The economic costs of the conflict are also horrendous for the people of Kosovo and others in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the neighbouring states. At the meeting of EU Foreign Ministers, which I attended in Brussels last Monday, we agreed on the broad content of a stability pact for the region and this is now being developed as a matter of urgency. We are participating actively in this work.</P>
    <P>The greatest priority of all is to bring the conflict to an end in a way that will achieve the key objectives of the international community. At the General Affairs Council on Monday, I welcomed a role for President Ahtisaari of Finland whose country has not been involved in NATO's military actions and which will shortly assume the EU Presidency. Working with Mr. Chernomyrdin of Russia, the UN and the other permanent members of the Security Council and the G8, he can play a useful mediating role. I have made clear our willingness to assist these efforts in any practical way that is open to us.</P>

      <P>The conflict in Kosovo  highlights another key issue, the extent to which the international community is capable of addressing problems which reflect internal and ethnically based issues. Frequently these are linked to the legitimate wish for self-determination. A core principle of the UN Charter is that of non-inter<Col N="365" /> vention in the internal affairs of states, except with the endorsement of the Security Council. This principle respects state sovereignty and is intended to ensure stability internationally. Unfortunately, it has been invoked &ndash; as in Kosovo &ndash; as a means of frustrating the legitimate concern of the international community in human rights abuses, ethnic cleansing and other violence. In a world where conflicts are increasingly internal to states, the challenge for the international community is to weigh the sometimes conflicting rights that exist in international law, including the UN Charter. Should a tyrant practising ethnic cleansing escape the concerted action of the international community because of a veto in the Security Council, a veto which was originally intended to ensure that permanent members of the council would not mandate UN military action against each other, rather than as a device to protect ethnic cleansers?</P>
      <P>This is a complex and evolving issue. The welcome growth of international concern for human rights has led to a situation in which the issue of intervention on humanitarian grounds, even in the absence of a Security Council decision, must be looked at in a serious and sustained way at the international level. I do not see a &ldquo;quick fix&rdquo; solution through an amendment to the UN Charter for the simple reason that it is almost impossible to amend it, given the veto powers of the permanent members of the Security Council. However, creative efforts should be deployed by statesmen, stateswomen and international legal experts to come to a working international consensus on how to address this problem. Meaningful reform of the UN is a priority if that organisation is to be able to discharge its core responsibilities effectively.</P>
      <P>Strategies of conflict prevention, peacekeeping and crisis management are central to what we in the EU are trying to achieve in searching for stability and security in Europe. This is an important element in the background to the Government's wish to participate in the Partnership for Peace. PfP is structured around co-operation for peacekeeping and humanitarian missions. These are techniques of fundamental importance. Our Defence Forces should have the full benefit of participation in training and co-operation for these techniques.</P>
      <P>I have encouraged debate on the issue and am grateful for the contributions made on all sides of this House. However, debate must be well-informed and there has been a demand for factual information about PfP. That is why the Department of Foreign Affairs has today published an explanatory guide.</P>

      <P>This guide sets out exactly what is entailed in PfP, demonstrating clearly that our military neutrality, which we value greatly, is not incompatible with our participation in co-operative efforts to enhance security in our continent. This excellent, truthful and honest guide speaks for itself. It is transparent, open and leaves nothing unsaid. I urge all those interested in the truth and in an honest approach to PfP to read it carefully. There is full transparency &ndash; nothing relevant is left out or concealed. The guide reproduces the views of the previous coalition Government and, with the permission of the four states concerned, the presentation documents which Austria, Finland, Sweden and Switzerland presented to NATO when they first joined PfP.</P>
      <P>That an issue merits thorough debate both inside and outside the Oireachtas does not mean that a national referendum is called for. Successive Governments have made clear that if Ireland were to join a military alliance such as NATO this important question would be put to the people in a referendum. That remains our commitment. However, the Government has concluded, based on crystal clear legal advice, that a referendum is not required. I have annexed to the guide the letter incorporating the Attorney General's conclusions on this matter.</P>
      <P>At the heart of Ireland's commitment to a peaceful world has been support for international collective security and active engagement in peacekeeping and humanitarian tasks. PfP is a framework geared to the need for greater co-operation in peacekeeping. Far from marking a radical departure in our foreign policy, participation in PfP would be in tune with our basic and enduring approaches to international affairs. Participation in PfP would reinforce our ability to support the United Nations and the OSCE in implementing peacekeeping operations and would be in full accordance with our policy of military neutrality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would also be of considerable benefit in ensuring that our Defence Forces remain at the forefront of best practice in UN peacekeeping. Our Defence Forces have a great record and as a former Minister for Defence I express again the Government's deep appreciateion of the brave and courageous manner in which they have conducted peacekeeping missions in many parts of the world. They have acted in the name of international peace, served their country with pride and gave us pride in turn. PfP is not in conflict with our traditional support for United Nations peacekeeping operations, nor will it hamper our continuing commitment to UN peacekeeping outside Europe. Participation in PfP will enhance the <Col N="367" /> ability of the Defence Forces to meet the challenges of UN peacekeeping in the next century.</P>
    <P>The external environment in which Ireland must now operate has changed fundamentally in recent years. All the major international organisations active in Europe. including the EU, NATO, the OSCE, and the Council of Europe, have adapted themselves to this new environment. A feature of this process of adaptation has been co-operation between these different organisation and among the states who form their different but overlapping memberships. Participation in PfP and the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council is an important means of having Ireland's voice heard in an international environment of increasing complexity.</P>
    <P>Ireland is an island but we are not insular in our approach. We are neutral but by no means indifferent to what is happening in the world around us. PfP and the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council offer the possibility of engagement in Euro-Atlantic structures in ways which are in keeping with our traditions of conflict prevention and peacekeeping and with a wide range of countries, including all our EU partners and the North American countries, on issues of mutual concern. The Government is committed to participation in PfP on terms which are consistent with our values and national interest. The nature and scope of Ireland's proposed participation, set out in a presentation document, will be submitted to the Oireachtas for its consideration and approval.</P>
    <P>I stress the importance of maintaining a correct perspective on PfP. I do not see it as an end in itself, rather as one of a range of instruments we can use to obtain our objectives. These objectives remain those that the Government have pursued and will continue to pursue with, I hope, the widest possible support.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The impression has been given that this debate is only being launched now. In January 1998, Fine Gael published a detailed policy document setting out its position in favour of joining Partnership for Peace and in January 1999 allocated its Private Members' time to the first debate in this House on the subject. That debate smoked out the Government's position and induced it to declare publicly that it had changed its mind in respect of Partnership for Peace. Fine Gael welcomes the opportunity to debate again Ireland's proposed membership of the Partnership for Peace, particularly in light of developments since the last debate on this issue in January.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to discuss whether the current crisis in Kosovo should affect the timing of our decision to join PfP. Some have argued that the Kosovo crisis should give us pause for thought before joining. I argue the reverse &ndash; the crisis in Kosovo points yet again to our current isolated position in Europe, unable to influence or try to influence events. It emphasises the urgent need to recify that situation by joining Partnership for Peace <Col N="368" /> immediately. Furthermore, I ask the Minister to confirm that Ireland will appoint an ambassador to NATO when it joins Partnership for Peace, as the other European Union and non-EU states have done. I urge him to make that appointment now so at least there will be channels open to NATO for the views of this House and of the Irish people to be put directly to the Secretary General.</P>
    <P>Events in the Balkans represent, in the first instance, a crisis for the people of Kosovo terrorised by the actions of Slobodan Milosevic and his band of ethnic cleansers. It also represents a crisis for the European Union which has again demonstrated its weakness by its failure to respond to a crisis only a few miles from its border. The debate on the future shape of the European security architecture is gathering pace. If Ireland wishes to influence this debate and not leave it to others to decide that architecture, we must join the other European Union neutral states in the PfP now.</P>
    <P>I welcome Fianna Fáil's belated conversion to Partnership for Peace. If it had not chosen to play politics with the issue when it was in Opposition, Ireland could have joined some time ago. The debate on Irish entry to PfP goes to the heart of the issue of where Ireland sees its role in the world. Do we continue to develop our proud tradition of contributing to the maintenance of peace in the world by joining the pivotal forum in Europe through which co-operation and peacekeeping missions are increasingly organised, Partnership for Peace? Do we simply shout encouragement to others from the sidelines? Are we self-confident enough as a state to enter such a forum, knowing our values and principles, ready to argue for them and, in so doing, make a distinctive contribution to the maintenance of peace and security in the world?</P>
    <P>We hear again the cant from opponents to Ireland's entry to Partnership for Peace that PfP in some way represents second class membership of NATO, a military alliance with mutual defence obligations, and that Irish entry would mean an end to Irish neutrality. Let us be clear about this issue. Partnership for Peace is not a military alliance. It carries no military mutual defence obligations. It is a co-operative structure in which participants pick the areas in which they choose to co-operate. For this reason, ultra neutral Switzerland, which is not even a member of the United Nations because of the obligations it imposes on members, is able to join PfP. It is the reason other traditionally neutral countries such as Sweden, Finland and Austria, were willing to join PfP.</P>
    <P>In January 1998, I set out in detail in the Fine Gael policy paper the nature of PfP and the advantages of Ireland joining. I also put forward that case in the Dáil last January. Rather than rehearse it, I wish to address the argument of opponents of PfP that there should be a referendum on the issue. Ireland is a representative democracy in which the people elect their representatives to legislate under the auspices of a Constitution which was also democratically <Col N="369" /> chosen by the people and is open to amendment by the people.</P>
    <P>This House decides many matters that are crucial to the lives of people, for example, tax rates, levels of social welfare, consumer protection, environmental protection and criminal law. Nobody suggests that the Government must consult the people by referendum on these crucial issues. However, on the issue of PfP, a number of people believe there is a need to so do.</P>
    <P>Let us get serious about this. Partnership for Peace involves no mutual defence obligations. Even Switzerland, which holds four or five referenda per year, did not hold a referendum on its entry to Partnership for Peace. Opponents of PfP are aware that the elected representatives of the people favour PfP membership. They simply wish to subvert our representative democracy and get another bite of the cherry by holding a referendum.</P>
    <P>There are three reasons for my opposition to holding a referendum on this issue. The first relates to the Good Friday Agreement. The Irish people voted on that Agreement and agreed to amend the Constitution to give effect to the Agreement. We must accept that Northern Ireland is part of NATO and that Northern Ireland is the reason Ireland is not part of NATO. Partition is the reason Ireland did not join NATO from the beginning.</P>
    <P>We must regularise our relationship with Northern Ireland and with Britain. That involves taking into account what future relationship we want with Britain and with other countries with which Britain has alliances. That includes examining security and defence issues. Partnership for Peace allows us to do that without joining NATO. We must learn to co-operate. To amend the Constitution again after already amending it on foot of the Good Friday Agreement is nonsensical.</P>
    <P>The Constitution was also amended by the Amsterdam Treaty which came into effect on the first day of this month. That treaty incorporates the Petersberg tasks which include humanitarian and rescue tasks, peacekeeping and tasks of combat forces in crisis management, including peace enforcement. Partnership for Peace will allow our Defence Forces to train for participation in the Petersberg tasks yet there is a demand to put the question to the people again. It has already been dealt with in two referenda and holding a third referendum on the issue would undo the work of the Good Friday Agreement and the Amsterdam Treaty.</P>
    <P>What question would be put to the people? Would it be &ldquo;Should we join Partnership for Peace?&rdquo; or &ldquo;Should we join Partnership for Peace and carry out the following tasks: A, B, C, D and E?&rdquo;  If we take the first option and the people agree, we can negotiate virtually anything under the guise of Partnership for Peace. If the second option is agreed to, we might find that the issues on which we initially sought to co-operate need to be varied, increased, decreased or that <Col N="370" /> they do not suit and we will be unable to participate without a further referendum.</P>
    <P>I was sorry to see a recent editorial in a reputable newspaper, <i>The Irish Times</i>, taking this soft option. This newspaper is generally imaginative, fair, balanced and reasoned and it gives good coverage to serious issues. To change its stance and produce such an editorial, which has the implications I outlined earlier, was, to put it mildly, a great surprise to people who have faith in that newspaper.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that those in favour of Ireland's membership of Partnership for Peace would win a referendum on the subject. Recent opinion polls show a clear majority in favour. However, that is not the point. In a representative democracy, the people elect their representatives to govern and if they do not agree with the actions of those representatives, they have the opportunity at least every five years, usually more frequently, to replace them.</P>
    <P>I wish to address a further matter relating to our &ldquo;cherished neutrality&rdquo; and the type of role Ireland wishes to play in the world. To many of its advocates neutrality has been imbued with almost mystical value. To the neutralists, we still live in a world of two armed camps, and there is something pure and moral about being neutral between these two equally loathsome camps. I am not sure I ever bought into this view of Ireland's role in the world, but I do not accept it in the Europe of 1999. Irish neutrality seems to consist of being, to quote the Minister for Foreign Affairs, stuck between a rock and a hard place, with the hope that somebody somewhere will do something. I do not take pride in the way Ireland and the rest of Europe stood aside while murder, rape and ethnic cleansing took place in Bosnia. I am not levelling that criticism at my colleague in Government. As Minister of State with responsibility for European Affairs, I attended General Affairs Council meetings, and we did nothing. We did not have the capacity or will to do anything until NATO went in and took on the tyrants. Srebrenica was only the start of a number of Srebrenicas. We should be ashamed to talk in the terms we talk considering what happened in Srebrenica. Ireland cannot speak out or influence these issues unless it is willing to play a role. We cannot be neutral on ethnic cleansing.</P>
    <P>In terms of Kosovo, Milosevic could not have been allowed to act again with impunity as he did in Bosnia and Croatia. The world could not stand idly by while millions more were raped, murdered and forced out of their homes. NATO was left with no choice but to bomb the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. That is not to say mistakes were not made. The failure to plan properly for the influx of refugees, even though it was foreseeable and foreseen, and to develop a plan B if the bombing did not succeed were serious miscalculations. The argument that the world should have continued the way it was, with endless talks with President Milosevic while ethnic cleansing was taking place in Kosovo, could not be sustained. <Col N="371" /> The world tried negotiations and unarmed monitors, but to no avail. Those monitors were held outside Racak while people were murdered and the only thing they could verify was that people were dead. Milosevic understands only one thing. Like all bullies, he must be stood up to. All other options failed in Bosnia and in Kosovo. Ireland must make its voice heard at meetings of the UN Council, the European Union and Partnership for Peace. We have a distinctive contribution to make with our sense of justice and long experience of peacekeeping and some of peace enforcing.</P>
    <P>I welcome this debate because it gives us an opportunity to raise these issues. Sixty million Europeans lost their lives in the first half of this century because of conflicts that started in Europe. The European Union was set up to prevent a recurrence of such conflict. The integration of countries into the European Union brings with it rights and responsibilities. If the objective of integrating Europe is economic and political security, we should take our share of the responsibility for security.</P>
    <P>The European Union is open to all European democracies. I hope one day the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia will join the EU, when it becomes a democracy and respects human rights &ndash; a criterion for membership. It is currently not a democracy and does not even remotely meet the EU requirement in terms of respect for human rights. It perpetrates genocide within its borders. The stealth with which this genocide commenced in Kosovo is best summarised in the words of an experienced Irish diplomat, who has had much experience of the Balkans. He said their approach is that a village a day keeps NATO away. That is the reality. Kosovo was planned. The Holbrooke process, Racak or the Rambouillet process did not work.</P>
    <P>The genocide continued during all that time. Nobody with any sense of morality wants people to lose their lives in Serbia or anywhere else. Accidental death of civilians, however dreadful, cannot be compared with the genocide the bombings aim to prevent. The position in regard to refugees is somewhat different. It was foreseeable and foreseen. It is appalling that the response to the refugee crisis, including our response, was so meagre and so late. I hope a basis can be found to allow for a cessation of the bombing, but such a basis must include provisions for the secure return of refugees to their homes and a force to guarantee the security of all Kosovars in Kosovo.</P>
    <P>I say this for a reason. The KLA, by some accounts, has a split personality, with hints of fascism on one side and Stalinism on the other. There are reports that 130,000 Serbs left Kosovo between 1966 and 1989 because of harassment and discrimination by the Kosovan Albanian majority. That has not been mentioned very often. I read that recently in a respected journal entitled <i>Foreign Affairs. </i>If this is true, it is alarming and must also be condemned. The KLA <Col N="372" /> objective may well be a greater Albania with all the worrying implications that has for Macedonia and Montenegro.</P>
    <P>An article in <i>Foreign Affairs </i>by Chris Hedges of Harvard University in the May-June edition states that Kosovo, unlike Cyprus and Bosnia, has no fixed lines dividing the antagonists and that the province's battle lines resemble the constantly shifting sands of the 1980s guerrilla wars in Central America. He also states that a stretch of road that is safe in the morning can be deadly in the afternoon and that because this is an insurrection, rather than a war between armies, rebels can be farmers one day and combatants the next and that it will be impossible to define them. He goes on to state that, in contrast, the frontlines in Bosnia had changed little by 1992.</P>
    <P>Sending in a land force is not a simple solution. We cannot adopt a policy to fight to the last American. Those calling for an end to the bombing, the commencement of negotiations and a ground force to be sent in must realise such a ground force must be representative of all member states of the European Union, as well as having an input from NATO and, hopefully, Russia, but it will have a difficult task. It would not be its task to simply hand over to one side to the detriment of the other. This is something that needs to be kept to the forefront, and I hope the Minister will do that in any discussions he has in Europe.</P>
    <P>We must learn from this crisis that Europe and its people must be defended from attack and genocide from outside or inside, and that Ireland has a responsibility to share in such defending. On the issue of security and defence, it gives me no pleasure to say we behave like selfish adolescents rather than a mature proud independent State. Independence does not mean indifference. It means choosing to become involved when we see injustice done. We can fool ourselves into thinking that we did not know how Charlie Haughey got his wealth. It is well known that people did not want to know about it. They hoped he would pull the same stroke for the country as he did for himself. We can fool ourselves into thinking we did not know about Belsen and Dachau. We can even fool ourselves into thinking we can revise history and pretend that fear of the IRA usurping the State is what really kept us neutral in World War II, but what excuse can we give for Srebrenica? I am ashamed of the role of the EU, including ours, as we stood by and talked nonsense when people were murdered in large numbers in Srebrenica. Yet some people in this House and outside it spit out the name NATO as if it is a foul word.</P>

      <P>The EU may, in time, evolve into a defence community. This may come about through the merger of the EU and the Western European Union. We cannot bury our heads in the sand and pretend not to know yet again. We cannot and must not go on fooling ourselves. If the EU-WEU merger comes about, those who will join at the beginning will make the rules and NATO participants will have to take all or nothing, just like EMU.</P>
      <P>From the beginning, it would serve our strategic interests best to take part in the debate in a real way. We should argue that the Western European Union commitment in article 5, which requires one state to automatically come to the defence of another if attacked, should be an optional protocol. This gives us the maximum number of options if the merger goes ahead. I know, as a member of the reflection group which prepared the agenda for the Amsterdam Treaty, that a number of European states would be prepared to listen to that argument. We should not miss this opportunity because if the merger goes ahead and that protocol is not dealt with, it will be very hard to undo it later.</P>

They are the people who suffer when there is no law and order. I make no apology for arguing for law and order as a social justice issue. Social justice requires us to take our part in securing our neighbours in Europe. In preparing to undertake the Petersberg tasks we must take on the responsibility of joining Partnership for Peace.</P>
      <P>In a previous debate I cited the reasons we should join Partnership for Peace. I wish to make two further points and to repeat those reasons. First, whatever happens at the end of the conflict in Kosovo, there must be no safe conduct, no safe haven and no absolution for those who have perpetrated the terrible crimes of genocide. This must be made absolutely clear in the final outcome.</P>
      <P>Second, I wish to make a special case for Bulgaria and other countries who have suffered enormously because of the war in Serbia. As Todor Gradev argues in today's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i>, Bulgaria deserves an open and straight road to western Europe. A country which has struggled to bring about democracy and a market economy is now being devastated because it cannot get its goods to the marketplace. Bulgaria and other similarly affected countries in the region must be given assistance now.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, as a result of the economic suffering in Bulgaria and other countries and the political implications, with people looking to Russia rather than the West, I ask the Minister to urge his colleagues to bring forward EU enlargement and the financial assistance promised to those countries to allow them take on that responsibility. We need this as much as they do. If we are to have peace and stability in Europe we must have integration, not disintegration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many reasons I believe we should join Partnership for Peace. Our extensive peacekeeping experience which is disproportionate to our size, can be shared in a structured way with other states. We in turn can learn in a structured way from the experience of other states. Member<Col N="375" /> ship of PfP would create an outward looking perspective, keep our Defence Forces in a modern mode and boost morale. Ireland should not set a precedent of splendid isolation &ndash; if other states follow its example, instability in Europe could ensue.</P>
    <P>Membership of PfP would not affect our tradition of military neutrality, as is evidenced by the role in PfP of Austria, Finland, Sweden, Switzerland and even Russia, although we need a separate debate on neutrality. There will be an opportunity for greater North-South, East-West and British-Irish co-operation, building on the strong foundations of Air Corps-Naval Service-RAF search and rescue practice. The co-operation of neutral Sweden and NATO member Norway, both of whom are members of PfP, shows how neutral and aligned neighbours can co-operate. Increasingly, international strife is of an internal nature in countries such as former Yugoslavia and Algeria and requires a new response.</P>
    <P>Humanitarian aid can be distributed only where there is security, stability and good order. Participation in PfP can help to maximise our capacity to assist in circumstances of this kind. Training to counteract illegal drugs importation could be written into any PfP agreement. As an island state this could bring many benefits in dealing with the drugs epidemic. It demonstrates to our EU partners and the wider international community that we are prepared to play an active role in the evolving post-Cold War European security architecture and helps establish our credentials for influencing this evolution. PfP is a mutual agreement. We agree the role we want and this is designed to suit our circumstances. It is not a &ldquo;one fit&rdquo; suit which states must wear. A cogent argument in support of not joining it, based on sustainable principles has not been put forward.</P>
    <P>In response to Deputy Higgins, I recently raised the question of the Kurds with the speaker of the Turkish Parliament and with an all-party delegation from that Parliament. I have no difficulty raising such issues.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>As one of Ireland's observers in the Western European Union, I have on numerous occasions re-emphasised our neutrality. Compliments were regularly paid to our neutrality and the role Ireland has played as a peacekeeper. I welcome this opportunity to speak about the current crisis in Kosovo and the Government's plan to join PfP. However, it is regrettable that the House is only now getting around to holding a substantive debate on PfP, particularly as it is long after the Government has made its decision and Fianna Fáil has reneged on the commitment it gave to the electorate prior to the last general election that a referendum would be held.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The conflict in Kosovo is the biggest Europe has witnessed since the end of the Second World War. The House has not discussed the matter since March when there was a brief debate in the <Col N="376" /> immediate aftermath of the initial NATO attacks on Yugoslavia. We are living in a period of rapid political change. Within the past ten years, we have witnessed the collapse of the Berlin Wall and the map of eastern Europe change beyond recognition. New alliances are emerging and the Thatcherite tide that threatened to swamp Europe during the 1980s has been reversed with 13 EU member states having left or centre/left Governments. The EU has developed at a rapid rate moving closer to political and economic union with the Maastricht Treaty, the Amsterdam Treaty and the introduction of the single European currency on 1 January 1999.</P>
    <P>Attitudes are changing, positions are being re-examined and views are evolving. For instance, the Minister for Foreign Affairs in Germany is a member of the Green Party and he participates in meetings of NATO foreign Ministers. In this rapidly changing world, it is not sustainable to repeat a meaningless mantra about &ldquo;the sacredness of Irish neutrality&rdquo; as if we were still in the midst of the Second World War or trapped deep in the dark days of the Cold War.</P>
    <P>As papers released earlier this year indicated Ireland's neutrality during the Second World War was not as neutral as many people had believed. In addition, any objective study of Ireland's role during the Cold War will show that it's neutrality was lopsided. That is not to devalue our record on neutrality or, particularly, that of successive Governments in keeping the country out of military alliances.</P>
    <P>Despite its neutrality, Ireland has not been isolationist. As far back as the 1930s Ireland was an active member of the League of Nations. It has been a member of the United Nations for 40 years, has served on its Security Council and provided the President of the General Assembly on one occasion. Irish troops have served with distinction in virtually every continent. Irish foreign Ministers, such as Deputy Spring, have served with distinction as President of the EU Council and in that role have helped to broker solutions to many international conflicts and disputes.</P>
    <P>It is against that background that the entry of Ireland into PfP must be considered. In the context of the people's long standing commitment to neutrality and non-participation in military alliances any proposal that Ireland should join PfP, an organisation that is effectively a NATO sub-group, was always going to be controversial. It is known, that there is a range of views within most political parties on this issue but whatever decision is finally taken I am absolutely satisfied that there is a need for a full and informed debate on the implications of all the security needs of the EU in advance of any application for membership.</P>
    <P>Despite the repeated promises of the Government we have not had that debate and it has done nothing to promote one. The leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Quinn, made a distinction between a debate and statements on the Order of Business earlier. Only today the Government got <Col N="377" /> around to issuing a discussion paper on the matter. Some people have read it and said that some statements in it are confusing.</P>
    <P>The recent opinion polls published showed that a majority of people is in favour of PfP membership but also that a majority is in favour of holding a referendum. This indicates the level of uncertainty that exists. Fianna Fáil made a specific statement in its general election manifesto that it opposed Ireland's participation in NATO-led organisations such as PfP. The Taoiseach also stated in the House in March 1996 that &ldquo;A decision to join the PfP without a referendum would be a serious breach of faith and fundamentally undemocratic&rdquo;. For any political party to renege on such a solemn pre-election commitment is to further undermine public confidence in political parties and create further cynicism about the entire political process.</P>
    <P>I recall the former Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Burke, when he was a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committees on Foreign Affairs and European Affairs, continually saying Fianna Fáil would not allow Ireland to join PfP without a referendum. He emphasised that so often that all of us were convinced that if anybody else attempted to join PfP based on any legal opinion, Fianna Fáil would oppose it if it were in Opposition. It has transpired that in spite of the commitment it gave to the electorate, Fianna Fáil has reneged on it in Government.</P>
    <P>Last week, the Tánaiste stated that the people elect representatives to give leadership and make decisions. That is undoubtedly true, but I hope she will also acknowledge that the electorate votes for parties and expects them to keep their promises, especially when it is a solemn commitment such as that given on this important matter.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil's position defies logic. It acknowledges that it needs a new mandate for its U-turn but says the election to the European Parliament on 11 June will provide it. How can those electing the European Parliament provide a mandate for membership of PfP, an organisation that has no relationship to the European Parliament, as it is not an EU institution? That there are a range of views on this subject in virtually all the political parties, means the European elections are a particularly unsuitable mechanism for testing the wishes of the people on this issue.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge that the legal advice available to the Government, which was re-emphasised by the Minister today, is that a constitutional amendment is not required to allow membership of PfP. Similar advice was given to the previous Government. However, the Fianna Fáil party committed itself to holding a referendum or consultative plebiscite to establish the views of the electorate on such an important matter. It was elected to Government on the basis of that commitment.</P>
    <P>The Government is already committed to holding a referendum to establish a constitutional basis for local government on 11 June, in conjunction with the local and European elections. It would have been a relatively simple administrat<Col N="378" /> ive and organisational task to put another question to the people on PfP &ndash; as it promised it would do &ndash; on the same day, without any additional expense.</P>
    <P>It is most unacceptable that the Government has failed to honour its commitment to a full national debate in advance of any decision to join. Regardless of whether this country ultimately joins PfP, it is essential that there should be a full and informed debate on the implications of membership and of all the security needs of the European Union. In this regard, I commend Deputy Gay Mitchell for at least attempting on several occasions to institute this debate. A limited discussion within the narrow confines of the Fianna Fáil party does not constitute a national debate, irrespective of how big its members believe their party to be, or the percentage of the vote they expect to get in any future election.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that, regardless of one's views of PfP, all democrats would accept the decision of the people as expressed through a plebiscite. The people have shown consistent support for full membership of the European Union and the sharing of sovereignty this requires. I fully support Ireland's participation in the development and implementation of the Common Foreign and Security Policy envisaged by the Amsterdam Treaty. Partnership for Peace and the security needs of the European Union are separate and distinct issues. One can support one without necessarily supporting the other.</P>
    <P>The shocking conflict in Kosovo and Yugoslavia serve only to emphasise the need for new security arrangements in Europe and to illustrate once again that NATO, with its Cold War legacy, is not a suitable or appropriate body to try and deal with this conflict in Europe. It is most disappointing that the Government has done absolutely nothing &ndash; apart from attending meetings &ndash; to help to broker a solution to this conflict. We are now a month into what is the biggest war Europe has seen for the past 50 years, yet the Government has been reduced to the role of silent spectator. The silence and inactivity of the Government has been in stark contrast to the commendable efforts of our other neutral colleagues in Europe, such as Finland, and even NATO members like Greece and Italy, to secure an end to the fighting, and broker a political solution. Inevitably, this will have to happen.</P>
    <P>The plight of the people of Kosovo &ndash; and the way in which the international community should react to that plight &ndash; raises political, moral and legal questions to which there are not easy answers. There are different views within the Houses of the Oireachtas as to whether NATO attacks were a legitimate or effective way of defending the Kosovar Albanians. However, what is abundantly clear is that the situation cannot be allowed to drift and that new diplomatic initiatives are required to secure a settlement to the conflict in Kosovo and bring about an end to the NATO attacks on Yugoslavia.</P>
    <P>Slobodan Milosevic is a brutal dictator who <Col N="379" /> seems to be imbued with the most malignant form of nationalism. His forces have been guilty of serious atrocities against the civilian population in Kosovo. The desire of all democrats should be to see Milosevic out of office, proper democratic structures established in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and significant autonomy for Kosovo, which would ensure that the civil, religious and cultural rights of its people will be protected and their civil rights upheld.</P>
    <P>Raising questions about the wisdom of the NATO approach does not imply support for Milosevic. It is clear that the NATO approach has not worked so far. Milosevic is still in place, ethnic cleansing continues and hundreds of thousands of Kosovar Albanians have been driven out. Many of them are in refugee camps, the conditions of which are appalling. Other refugees are being dispersed all over Europe, including Ireland. Enormous damage has been caused to the civilian infrastructure in Yugoslavia and many innocent civilians have died.</P>
    <P>Overnight, we have heard reports of three patients being killed when their hospital building in Belgrade was struck by a missile. If anyone believed it was possible to have a war without innocent victims, then surely they must have been disabused of this view by the horrific images on our television screens in recent weeks of the Kosovar refugee camps and the mutilated bodies and broken people in the aftermath of the latest NATO attacks. This is not the first conflict to show that smart bombs and surgical strikes are concepts that exist only in the minds of generals and military strategists.</P>
    <P>Equally shocking have been the accounts of ethnic cleansing and rape being carried out by official and unofficial Serbian forces, free from the glare of television cameras. It simply cannot be allowed to continue. There should be no question of pursuing a war that is not going to work, simply because to end it would damage NATO's credibility.</P>
    <P>New political initiatives are required, therefore. The Labour party believes the following steps should now be taken. There should be an immediate suspension of NATO bombing for a specified period of perhaps 72 hours, which could then be extended as appropriate. There should be a simultaneous end to all hostile actions by Serbian forces and the KLA and Slobodan Milosevic should undertake to facilitate the immediate and unconditional return of the Kosovar Albanians who have fled to neighbouring countries. There should also be an acceptance of the need for a UN mandated peace enforcement presence &ndash; including troops from NATO countries, Russia and neutral states &ndash; to guarantee the safety of those returning.</P>
    <P>Among the steps to be taken should be an immediate commencement of the withdrawal of Serbian forces from Kosovo and the phased introduction of the UN force, the immediate re-entry <Col N="380" /> to Kosovo of the OSCE monitors who left prior to the NATO bombing and a massive international aid package to provide food, facilities and health services for refugees, pending their return to Kosovo. There should be political negotiations under the auspices of the UN, involving Serbia and the two separate Kosovar strands, represented by Ibrahim Rugova and the KLA to determine arrangements for the future governance of Kosovo. A regional UN conference should be held to settle all outstanding issues in the Balkans with the participation of Russia, Serbia, Greece and other local states and an EU stability pact for south-eastern Europe which would include substantial economic assistance for the Balkan countries and an association agreement, including trade agreements, leading to eventual membership of the EU.</P>
    <P>I welcome the tentative indications during recent weeks that some NATO countries are beginning to seek a way out of the present campaign. I also welcome indications that within Serbia there are people beginning to question the intransigent position of Milosevic. What is beyond dispute is that the people of Europe cannot allow this conflict to drag on indefinitely while the casualties mount, the plight of the people of Kosovo continues and we drift inexorably towards a more deeply divided world and a renewed arms race that will have incalculable consequences for the poor of the world.</P>
    <P>It is also beyond doubt is that, even when Milosevic eventually calls off his killers, when the KLA put away their arms, when the bombers go back to bases and the missiles are returned to their silos, there will still be a huge humanitarian relief effort required. The conflict in Kosovo has led to the greatest mass displacement of people in Europe since the end of the Second World War and there are now up to 750,000 refugees in the region. To put this in a familiar context, it is the same as the population of the entire Connaught-Ulster region being forced to move out of that area and into Leinster and Munster. This movement of people has, of course, put a huge strain on those countries which have received the refugees &ndash; mainly Albania and Macedonia. They have taken the majority of refugees created by this extraordinary war. It has also put a huge strain on the resources of the humanitarian organisations that have tried to ensure basic food, medical care and some degree of shelter for the refugees. These bodies have performed heroically in the most difficult circumstances and without their intervention many more of those who fled the ethnic cleansing in Kosovo in search of safety would have died of hunger and disease.</P>
    <P>While there are many humanitarian organisations in different countries, including Trócaire, Concern, GOAL and others in Ireland, who are doing great work, the international body with primary responsibility for dealing with the plight of refugees is the United Nations High Commission for Refugees. Its role is to protect and assist refu<Col N="381" /> gees worldwide and to try to find a solution to their plight.</P>
    <P>The UNHCR is now in crisis because of the strain put on it by the scale of the exodus from Kosovo. The Commission has spent all the cash available for the Kosovo emergency and it would be appalling if, as a result of a cash shortage, its operation in the Balkans had to be either stopped or even scaled down. The UNHCR has appealed for $143 million to allow it to continue its operations. So far I believe it has received only about $71 million but much of this is already spent or committed. My colleague, Deputy De Rossa, raised this matter on the Adjournment last week and urged the Government to substantially increase its contribution to the UNHCR. So far the response from the Government has been disappointing &ndash; a rather miserly £400,000. This is a conflict taking place in Europe, the wealthiest continent in the world, with Europeans being displaced and Europeans dying at the hands of other Europeans. Yet the biggest response to the UNHCR has come from Japan. With the enormous resources at the disposal of the European Union, it must be possible for it to respond in a generous way to the appeal from UNHCR.</P>
    <P>Surely it is possible for this country, which is creating record wealth and where the Exchequer is literally awash with cash, to respond to the UNHCR and to at least match the contribution of $3.4 million made by Denmark and the Netherlands, which are similar in size to Ireland. If, for whatever reason, the Government does not consider that it can take any political initiative to help stop the conflict, then surely it can give a lead in terms of humanitarian response.</P>
    <P>I believe there is also a particular obligation on those NATO countries which are waging the air war against Yugoslavia to match the money they are spending on the military campaign to provide resources for the humanitarian effort. The war has so far cost billions of dollars, though nobody other than the Governments involved know the exact amount. Since each cruise missile costs in the region of $1 million, the money the UNHCR is seeking is the equivalent of 143 cruise missiles. That money must be found.</P>
    <P>There are increasing signs of a possible deal in relation to Kosovo, which is welcome. Any action by the international community which leads to an end to bombing must be fully supported. However, it would be cynical in the extreme if, in the course of negotiations which will now almost certainly begin, anyone were given immunity for crimes committed during this conflict, especially for crimes committed in the name of ethnic cleansing. This is intolerable and people involved should be tried as war criminals.</P>
    <P>Almost 1 million people have lost their homes in Kosovo in the past 14 months and three out of every four of them have been displaced in the last two months. According to the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe the crimes committed against those people include killing, execution, physical abuse, rape, forced displace<Col N="382" /> ment, destruction of civilian property and looting, sexual assault, including rape of groups of women, torture, ill-treatment, harassment, intimidation and the use of groups of people as human shields. All the people so cruelly treated have not been accounted for and it is not beyond the bounds of possibility that if and when the people of Kosovo return home, mass graves will be found as further evidence of the atrocities committed.</P>
    <P>It would be unthinkable if the people responsible for these crimes were to be given immunity from prosecution in return for some compromise agreement. The only basis the west would have for agreeing to such immunity is the fear that in its absence, the west itself could be called to account for such matters as the deliberate bombing of TV stations in which journalists and others were at work.</P>
    <P>All of us want to see peace. All of us want to see the people of Kosovo to their homes and begin the rebuilding of their lives and their communities but a peace deal which lets war criminals off the hook would bring further shame to the entire international community.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister. I will be sharing my time with Deputy Joe Higgins.</P>
      <P>Before the bombing of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia began, I said in this House that the action would cause major difficulties in the region, that it would play into the hands of Mr. Milosevic, weaken our relationship with Russia and, worst of all, worsen the position of the Albanian Kosovars. All that has come to pass. I agree with Deputy Ferris that we need an immediate ceasefire. We must continue the diplomatic initiative begun by my German Green Party colleague, Joschka Fischer, so that we can bring about peace in the region. It is interesting to note that, according to the President of Albania, the Apache helicopters and the troops are in Albania and Macedonia because of PfP commitments. This is not some innocuous organisation or what Jamie Shea calls &ldquo;an educational forum&rdquo;. It is much more than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to outline the positions of the parties with regard to Partnership for Peace. Deputy Ahern, when Leader of the Opposition, said it would be a gratuitous signal to others that we were giving up our neutrality; it would be a breach of faith and fundamentally undemocratic to enter PfP without a referendum. We now see Fianna Fáil doing a brazen U-turn with very little <Col N="383" /> explanation of what has changed in the meantime. Fine Gael, since 1994, has intended to abandon Irish military neutrality. The party stated in its election manifesto that it wanted to join the Western European Union. Fine Gael's position is quite clear and Deputy Mitchell has even called for a debate on full NATO membership.</P>
    <P>This morning I was greeted with howls of derision and even outright hostility by my colleagues in the Labour Party because I had the temerity to ask what their party's position is on PfP. I am still not clear, having listened to Deputy Ferris. Is it too much to ask a main opposition party their stance on the NATO-led Partnership for Peace? What is wrong with asking that question? The Labour Party is deceiving people by calling for a referendum while not stating what its position will be when the referendum is called. The people would like an answer to that question. The holding of a referendum is supported by 71 per cent of the people and they are being ignored.</P>
    <P>The smaller parties who are opposed to membership of PfP have been allocated ten minutes to speak in this debate. This reflects the attitude of the main parties; they do not want a debate on this issue. Partnership for Peace is a stepping stone to NATO. We should forget the argument that other neutral countries are members of PfP. In a position paper prepared for the US Congress, those neutral countries have been referred to as former neutrals and within those countries there is internal opposition to PfP. That position paper prepared for the US Congress states: &ldquo;Public opinion is still attached to Sweden's military neutrality. However, elite opinion sees the logic in joining a military alliance&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The position is exactly the same in this country where the debate is being led by elite opinion. Members of the Defence Forces have behaved disgracefully speaking in public about sensitive political matters. A civil servant attending the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs disagreed with his Minister and stated that we should join the PfP. What will happen next? Can we expect a Secretary General to recommend to the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs that we should join NATO?</P>
    <P>All the predictions made by the Green Party in the Amsterdam Treaty referendum campaign have come to pass. We warned that by signing Article J.7.2 of the Amsterdam Treaty we were committing ourselves to further military activity and that this would represent a significant erosion of Irish neutrality. I note that this is used in the document published by the Department of Foreign Affairs today, quoting the Petersberg tasks. Once we join the PfP, it will only be a matter of time before this House debates full NATO membership.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party now fudge on the issue of membership of PfP. In its place they suggest a European army. Would such an army be based on first strike nuclear weapons? It is time the electorate knew where each party stood on the <Col N="384" /> issues of Irish neutrality and PfP. The US ambassador to NATO has said that enhanced PfP is furthering the goal of military inter-operability and &ldquo;making the difference between being a partner and being an ally razor thin&rdquo;, in other words, the difference between being a member of NATO and of PfP is practically non-existent. We will spend a great deal of money which could be used to build hospitals, schools and houses on military equipment to bring ourselves up to the required standard for inter-operability. When that happens it will only be necessary to sign on the dotted line and become a member of NATO. What will the Attorney General's advice be on the need for a referendum on joining NATO? When Ireland signed the Amsterdam Treaty, his advice was that there would be no need for a further referendum. The people must not be led up the garden path.</P>

        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> The Government, Fine Gael and the Labour Party have behaved shamefully in ganging up to ensure that the opponents of PfP do not have adequate time to debate this question. The major parties are afraid of a debate because they know the truth will out.</P>
      <P>The Partnership for Peace explanatory guide published by the Government this morning is a disgraceful document. It is utterly dishonest and attempts to convey the impression that joining PfP is like joining the boy scouts or the girl guides. We need only read the documentation to see that the reality is the opposite. The framework document which set up PfP on 10 January 1994 is explicit. It states: &ldquo;The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation and the other states subscribing to this document resolve to deepen their political and military ties . The states joining PfP will co-operate with NATO for the development of co-operative military relations with NATO for the purpose of joint planning, training and exercises and the development over the long-term of forces that are better able to operate with those of the members of the North Atlantic Alliance . NATO resolves to promote military and political co-ordination at NATO headquarters in order to provide direction and guidance relevant to partnership activities with the other subscribing states including planning, training, exercises and the development of doctrine&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>These are chilling words which signal the preparation for a full military alliance into which this country is being dragged by a grand coalition of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael. The Labour Party is utterly dishonest, refusing to state where it stands but favouring an EU army. The denial of a referendum is a denial of a debate on this issue. This is a deliberate action by the Government because it is afraid the truth will come out. The Government is afraid the people will see that this is not a partnership for peace but a new military alliance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Language is daily degraded by NATO in the Albanian and Serbian conflict. Language is also degraded in the politics of this State. Deputy Mitchell demonstrated the hypocrisy of those who <Col N="385" /> advocate PfP. He completely failed to recognise the position adopted by NATO towards Turkey where the Kurdish people are routinely repressed and denied their rights.</P>
    <P>I protest at this sham debate which gives no time for a proper discussion of this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>As chairman of the Irish delegation to the Council of Europe, I am glad to avail of this opportunity to raise some matters relating to this very important issue. Time is equally short for all contributors to this debate. There is a need to draw the attention of the public to the alarming and deteriorating situation in the Balkans and Kosovo in particular. In the past two years no issue has taken up as much time in the Council of Europe. Many were caught by surprise. It was the hope that a formula would be found in the peace negotiations near Paris around St. Patrick's Day. The situation is deteriorating rapidly and there is now little prospect of finding a speedy solution. The military action looks set to continue for some time. There is a real danger &ndash; this is the view of many on the Council of Europe &ndash; that the conflict will extend beyond Kosovo and engulf the entire region in what would be an enormous international tragedy.</P>
      <P>It is relatively safe to comment from a distance but if one speaks to representatives on the Council of Europe from Croatia, Bosnia Herzegovina, Slovenia and the other countries which have suffered enormously at the hands of Slobodan Milosevic it is obvious they believe that there is no option but to decide his future militarily. He will not make any effort to resolve the conflict and, in the view of those familiar with his tactics and conduct, is hell-bent on escalating the conflict in Kosovo and dominating the entire region in a way that is inexplicable.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the non-governmental agencies involved on their efforts to find a way of dealing with the refugee crisis which is of enormous dimensions and escalating. The majority opinion is that refugees want to remain as close as possible to the areas from they have been expelled and to return as quickly as possible. The problem has been resolved to a limited extent in Croatia.</P>
      <P>The Government, which has made a valuable financial contribution, has agreed to accept up to 1,000 refugees. I congratulate the local community in Farranfore for turning up in large numbers at a late hour and in bad weather to welcome the first group of refugees on their arrival in County Kerry. This indicates a willingness on the part of the community at large to make every effort to be supportive. I compliment the Departments and non-governmental agencies involved in the provision of accommodation, education services and interpreters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When people are being slaughtered and ethnically cleansed, Ireland, no more than any other civilised country, cannot remain neutral. Slobodan Milosevic has to be tackled head on. I can <Col N="386" /> see no other way of dealing with the crisis which the Russians and the Germans are making efforts to resolve. The sooner Slobodan Milosevic is defeated the better to restore sanity to the region and avoid the prospect of the conflict spreading which is too horrific to contemplate.</P>
    <P>The previous speaker criticised the document issued today by the Department of Foreign Affairs, Ireland and Partnership for Peace, from which he quoted at length. His logic baffles me. I compliment the Department for explaining in detail the issues involved and for outlining the background to the establishment of Partnership for Peace in January 1994.</P>
    <P>Partnership for Peace is a framework for greater co-operation in the area of peacekeeping. There are no constitutional implications for Irish sovereignty or neutrality and no mutual defence commitments. There is no need for a referendum which would be overwhelmingly carried. Austria, Finland, Sweden and Switzerland remain committed to their neutrality. Switzerland has made it clear that if Partnership for Peace forms a military alliance, it will withdraw to preserve its neutrality. Ireland would be in a similar situation.</P>
    <P>There has been a transformation in Europe since the end of the Cold War. The Council of Europe was established with 11 countries 50 years ago. There are now 41 member states following the accession of Georgia about one week ago. We are living in an era of co-operation. Our involvement in Partnership for Peace would be a welcome endorsement of our peacekeeping efforts.</P>

      <Quest>the steps, if any, he has taken to deal with the staffing crisis in the Naval Service; the proposed crewing levels for the new ship; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are approximately 100 vacancies within the Naval Service at present. The ongoing recruitment campaign for enlistment within the Defence Forces, which I have approved, is designed to address this shortfall. In the present year, 65 positions within the first intake of general service recruits in March-April have been allocated to the Naval Service. There will be a second such enlistment intake of general service recruits in September-October. Some 14 cadets will also be recruited this year from the 1999 cadet competition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new vessel is still under construction in the UK and is due for delivery at the end of September. The crewing level for the vessel has not yet been decided. In order to assess the crewing level required for the new vessel, full regard will be paid to and full advantage extracted from the <Col N="387" /> new technology incorporated in the vessel, given what it offers in terms of automation and labour savings. This process of assessment can only be undertaken when the vessel has been delivered and the Naval Service has had an opportunity to train personnel in its operation.</P>
    <P>The Defence Forces Review Implementation Plan provided for special studies on the Naval Service and Air Corps. Price Waterhouse has conducted those reviews and, in its report, recommended adjustment in personnel strength to a level of 1,144 in the case of the Naval Service. The Government, in line with recommendations from Price Waterhouse, has agreed in principle that the State's future sea and air support requirements be discharged by the Naval Service and the Air Corps, on the basis of an appropriate mix of multi-tasking-multi-capabilities and dedicated services and it is proposed that this approach will be taken into account in relation to the crewing of the new vessel.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept the Naval Service is very close to having to tie up a ship or else drastically reduce the profile and work of the other vessels? Does he accept crewing levels on the ships are low and that more than half the fleet is sailing without its full complement of watch-keepers, for example?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but first I would like to welcome the Deputy back from the Lebanon. I was delighted to hear the trip was a success. I hope we were able to facilitate the trip in a way the Deputy would have wished.</P>
      <P>The debate on the crewing of the new ship is going on. Let me make it absolutely clear there is no question of tying up ships. We will take on board the views of the Naval Service and its requirements. We have agreed with the overall manning requirements of the Naval Services of 1,144, which emerged from the Price Waterhouse review. We will take in 65 people in this recruitment drive and a similar number in September-October. It is important to take into account that the new ship and its requirements are a matter for discussion. Needless to say, we will bring that to a happy resolution. I look forward to seeing eight ships on the water next January with a full complement of staff doing the work we need them to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his kind words in relation to the Lebanon and for facilitating the trip. One certainly saw the professionalism of the Irish Army and the Defence Forces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the Naval Service, it is disturbing that the Minister does not accept that crewing levels on the ships are low and that some of the ships are sailing without the proper complement of watch-keeping officers, for example. If the Minister is to make progress on this matter, he will have to implement other measures. Has the Minister considered a scheme of rising through the ranks? <Col N="388" /> What is stopping such a scheme from being developed? What about civilianisation in the Naval Service? Surely these proposals would help to deal with the shortages.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the start of 1998 the Naval Service has recruited, apart from the 74 recruits, four apprentices, nine watch-keeping officers, 12 cadets and three radio radar technicians. A second competition for 17 apprentices is now being completed. There are some stresses and the way in which the economy has developed has meant the numbers leaving the service have been greater than anyone would have wished. There are opportunities in the broader economy, which we are happy to report. We have to consider it as an opportunity and challenge which we must face down.</P>
      <P>I am optimistic that the Price Waterhouse review and the numbers agreed by the Government are sufficient to do the job. We have to work within these constraints to ensure we make the best use of personnel. Everything possible is being done as regards recruitment. We have not had this scale of recruitment before, and we now have constant recruitment. The next tranche will be helpful and in the meantime, we will resolve the difficulties regarding manning. All over the world we have seen rationalisation proposals, adjustments, changes, new ships, automation and labour saving measures. I am confident we can resolve this issue on the basis of getting the best consensus possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I expect we will be able to issue letters of offer to the residents within the next few weeks. The problem resided around the title, which was classified as a recorded monument under the National Monuments Act. One, therefore, does not have the same freedom in respect of freehold as one would have in other properties. <Col N="389" /> We have been able to resolve that matter and I am anxious to proceed with the sale on the basis of the tenant purchase scheme and in consultation with Kildare County Council and the residents. We are very close to a resolution and I am happy to see it develop in this way. I will facilitate any further elements because we need to clear the matter up. Ownership is something to which people in Ireland have a great attachment. I would like to see the area beautified and improved, with the residents and the councils improving the surrounding infrastructure.</P>

      <Quest>when he will establish a compensation tribunal to deal with deafness claims in the Defence Forces; if he will cap awards; if he is appealing the Hanley judgment prior to the establishment of this tribunal; if he has the support of the representative associations in relation to his plans; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The State has now lodged a certificate of readiness with the Supreme Court in the Hanley appeal and I understand that it is likely to be heard sometime in the next term which commences 2 June 1999. Deputies will be aware that last February, I announced that I had directed officials of my Department to draft proposals for a hearing loss compensation scheme for serving and former military personnel. This work is in full progress and will obviously be influenced by the outcome of the Hanley appeal in the Supreme Court. This work includes consideration of the question as to whether there will be a requirement to introduce legislation.</P>
      <P>The main issue in the State's appeal of the Hanley case is the issue of the scale of damages laid down by the High Court. If this tariff were to be reduced, I envisage that the majority of claims could transfer from the courts to the compensation scheme to which I have referred. In recommending a level of compensation in the scheme to the Government, I must be mindful of striking an equitable balance between the rights of claimants with genuine injuries and what can be afforded by the taxpayer while having regard to the view of the Supreme Court on these cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the representative associations, both RACO and PDFORRA have indicated <Col N="390" /> their support for the principle of a compensation scheme designed to resolve this issue in a less costly and less adversarial way than through the courts. I stress, as I have on previous occasions, that I do not see the necessity for a tribunal with attendant delay and representation costs. Rather I intend to establish a compensation scheme which will provide for the speedy resolution of claims by reference to established and accepted criteria of assessment and compensation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>At what rate are cases coming in? What progress has the Minister made on establishing the broad parameters of the compensation board? I am sure the Minister agrees there should not be any delay and that it should be resolved as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister confident he will have the support of the representative associations because it would be desirable to have their support when a compensation board is established? I understand the Minister is appealing the Hanley case and I welcome that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It is desirable to establish this alternative system in an out of court environment as soon as possible. As we are now close to the Supreme Court hearing in the Hanley case, which would influence that decision, we will await that. However, if the Hanley case is delayed longer than I anticipate, I will look at introducing the scheme in advance. We are at an advanced stage at present. My proposals have been completed and we are submitting those to the Attorney General for his advice on some of the legal aspects and whether legislation will be required. The hope and expectation is that legislation will not be required, but we need to clarify that.</P>
      <P>The representative associations have indicated strong support for this type of compensation scheme. I have no doubt that when we try to strike the right balance between the claimants with genuine injuries, what the taxpayer can afford and the High Court decisions, there will be a fair degree of consensus. We need to leave this tragic picture behind us as quickly as possible and move on to developmental and progressive areas. I appreciate the consensus and support in the House for moving in that direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister could clarify the number of cases being received. Is it constitutionally acceptable to put a cap on compensation awards? Does the Minister intend to put a cap on such awards which could be given by the newly established board? Is he prepared to make a decision, ahead of the Hanley case, on the scale of compensation which is a balance between the green book and the implications of the Hanley case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to work along those lines. As regards the question as to whether one would be 100 per cent satisfied that the constitutional position would not be infringed when <Col N="391" /> a cap is set, it is important to look at the history of these unique cases as they have developed. The level of damages has decreased from an average of £35,000 in 1996 to an average of £11,000 per case at present. I will be guided by the experience of the courts and by what is fair to all sides. This will cost money, which we can ill afford in many cases, but we need to get a resolution and to strike the right balance.</P>
      <P>The number of cases being received has decreased from an average of 609 two years ago to a little less than 100 per month.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>In the period from 1970 to 1994 approximately 1,360 tonnes of obsolete ammunition was disposed of at sea in the Beaufort Dyke and the North Atlantic. The material consisted of small arms ammunition, bombs, depth charges, fuses, primers, shells, grenades, pyrotechnics, etc. Under the Dumping at Sea Act, 1996, such dumping is no longer permitted. I am advised by the military authorities that their records relate only to the disposal of obsolete ammunition referred to above.</P>
      <P>Under the Dumping at Sea Act, 1996, certain members of the Defence Forces serving on board Naval Service vessels are designated as authorised officers for the purposes of the Act. This enables them to take certain actions in relation to dumping at sea, including the monitoring of the effects of any such dumping.</P>

The accepted and best method of disposing of home-made explosives, as found in north County Dublin, is by immersion and dissolution in water. On the basis of the information available to me, the risks to which the Deputy referred do not exist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The practices have changed and we have advanced technology in recycling. We take the <Col N="392" /> opportunity to export to Germany for recycling some of our remaining explosives. Technology is so advanced, we must manage it in the best environmental way possible.</P>

      <P>I am sure Deputy Fitzgerald would be interested in the earlier discussion on Partnership for Peace and the preparatory training work done in conjunction with other countries to ensure a faster reaction in terms of the deployment of forces which are suitably equipped to deal with any type of emergency which might arise.</P>
      <P>Later in the year we hope to go down that road. In the beginning we said we would be able to send a transport company and we envisaged about 100 personnel being available. When such a request is made we will come back to the Dáil for approval. We hope that request will be made as soon as possible. That would mean the beginnings of peace in that troubled area.</P>
      <P>Since the Israeli elections we may begin to see the prospects for relieving some of the pressures on UNIFIL. That would change the picture dramatically over a period.

Is training provided for the 100 personnel and is preparatory work being done? I welcome the continuous recruitment drive in which the Minister is involved. I know from my visit to the Lebanon that we will have to ensure a balance between new, inexperienced recruits and older, more experienced personnel on these missions. In that context the overseas duty allowance will be a factor.</P>

      <P>We have been successful in continually attracting many experienced personnel to United Nations missions. Each of the reviews I have referred to shows members who have been on their ninth, tenth, eleventh or twelfth mission. That is an enormous commitment that puts great pressure on their families and which the country appreciates. That experience is fundamental, particularly in security terms, to safeguarding the younger personnel. Almost 40 per cent of the contingents taking part in UNIFIL are going for the first time. The additional experience is necessary.</P>
      <P>In regard to the medical corps, we are already heavily stretched here but it is an important component in any contingent. Efforts last year to attract more people into the medical corps were not very successful. Another effort will be made this year and we may be able to help in the reorganisation process. The reorganisation process has helped in the training area. We now have more centralised training because of people moving from the barracks which have been closed. There is a better opportunity for more centralised training. While we have no great fears in that area, we cannot take anything for granted. My expectation is that we can do a great deal. We have had requests from GOAL, to which we have responded on two occasions. We have observers and helpers with the refugee agencies. Whenever we make a request to the chief of staff, within 24 hours he is in contact to say he has personnel ready to do the job. The position is fairly satisfactory within limits.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 13 and 85 together.</P>
      <P>The cost to date of employing private security firms at the vacated military barracks in the five locations in question is £386,462 inclusive of VAT. The amount by individual location is as follows: Murphy Barracks, Ballincollig, £112,131.62; Devoy Barracks, Naas, £80,540.02; Magee Barracks, Kildare, £90,111.12; Military Barracks, Castleblayney, £48,507.69; Fitzgerald Camp, Fermoy, £55,171.16.</P>
      <P>There would also be additional costs in providing military security parties at the vacated barracks. Apart from normal pay and allowances, these costs include security duty allowances as well as transport and subsistence. On security duty allowances alone, the military authorities have estimated that savings to date amount to over £250,000. In addition, there have been significant savings on utilities such as telephone and electricity charges etc. which approximate to £25,000 in the case of Murphy Barracks, Ballincollig, for a six month period. It must be borne in mind that one of the main reasons for closing barracks was to relieve the Defence Forces of the burden of guarding too many barracks and posts, and thereby to release personnel for operational duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it envisaged that other barracks will be used for refugee accommodation? Has the Minister accepted a tender for the sale of any of the barracks? Is it envisaged that the mounting security costs will continue? Does the Minister see a change in the situation in relation to the sale of the barracks? Has the new crisis which has arisen in relation to refugee accommodation changed those plans?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It is extraordinary that the security costs are more than offset by having moved out because of the cost of utilities and the cost of security duty allowances. That can be left aside as not being an additional cost. It is important to take into account that Price Waterhouse said we have too many barracks. The second greatest demand on manpower was manning these installations. The more positive developments are taking place on that side.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fitzgerald is right, the equation has changed for me. I was looking forward to disposing of a number of these barracks to the best advantage from a financial position and investing the funds in equipment and so on. In some cases that will be delayed. Nonetheless, the humanitarian cause which has arisen is greater than what I had set out to do. This country wants to play its part in meeting that terrible human tragedy in the best way possible. We have no problem with facilitating the Department of Foreign Affairs. I have asked that Department to look at all the facilities with a view to accommodating refugees from Kosovo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of the barracks at Fermoy, we are close to finalisation of the disposal of the lands <Col N="397" /> there. In the case of Devoy Barracks, Naas, we have virtually completed negotiations with Naas Urban District Council. That involves not only the agreement reached but rezoning these lands. The sale of two barracks is well advanced. Magee Barracks, Kildare, is used to accommodate refugees. The Department of Foreign Affairs is looking at the other two in the event that they are needed. At the same time the process of negotiation at local level to proceed to the ultimate sale is going on in tandem.</P>
    <P>The humanitarian cause was an unexpected development but the greater need is being met for the time being by accommodating the refugees. The sale of two barracks is at an advanced stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Given what has emerged &ndash; the needs of the refugees is a separate issue &ndash; in relation to the needs of local communities and the sale of barracks, will the Minister accept there is a change in the situation and should he reconsider the usage of those barracks? The real question is whether the State should seriously consider the use of these lands for housing and other community developments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of Devoy Barracks, Naas, we had a number of meetings with Naas Urban District Council.</P>
      <P>We were able to reach an amicable agreement with the local representatives on that matter. We will try to do the same in Castleblayney and in regard to Fitzgerald barracks in Fermoy. There is no change. As I said at the beginning of the process, I want a good resolution. I want the towns in which the barracks are being vacated to have the best possible prospects of development. The process is continuing on the basis of benefit to both sides. We will dispose of lands and the income generated will be used for necessary equipment and development. We will also facilitate local elected representatives in the areas involved in terms of getting the best possible deal. There has been no change in my approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to the disposal of lands. I presume land is attached to all the barracks but are there any proposals from local communities about the buildings? I welcome the Minister's ongoing consultations with the Department of Foreign Affairs about making suitable places available for refugees. The Minister is aware of the trauma caused in towns when barracks closed. This problem must be overcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said the Price Waterhouse report stated that there were too many barracks and that is why they were closed. However, people in my constituency, for political reasons, constantly suggest that eventually Clonmel barracks will be closed. I know this is not on the Minister's agenda but it is essential that he reaffirms his commitment to barracks which have been allowed to remain open and are fulfilling an extremely <Col N="398" /> important need in communities. Does the Minister agree that is the position with regard to Clonmel?</P>
    <P>There are housing crises in most local authority areas. Does the Minister agree it would be advantageous to hold discussions with housing authorities about some of the disused barracks which are being maintained at a high cost? It is obvious much money is being spent on security. Does the Minister agree such a move would be more advantageous than providing land for further buildings?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of pressures in these areas. A number of initiatives have been taken by the Government in the context of trying to ensure more land is available for housing generally. As the Deputy noted, there are local authority housing waiting lists which need to be addressed. The private sector is also seeking more land for houses in an effort to maintain or reduce prices.</P>
      <P>We have had discussions directly with the Department of the Environment and also with local authorities in relation to the best use which could be made of the facilities in the future. For example, in Kildare, I would be astounded if a considerable part of the 42 acres was not dedicated to social housing. However, we will reach agreement on these matters at local level and ensure the best possible resolution.</P>
      <P>I do not know how many times it is necessary to outline the position regarding Clonmel barracks. I tackled the problem in the best way possible and we must now complete the dealing in which we have already engaged in terms of the closures. There is nothing else on the agenda. I appreciate that people, for whatever reason, will continue to raise the issue, but they should not have any fears.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to Questions Nos. 9 and 102 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="401" /> The Government, on 15 July 1998, approved a programme of evacuation and sale of six barracks which are considered surplus to military requirements. The barracks in question are located at Fermoy, Ballincollig, Naas, Kildare, Castleblayney and Clancy Barracks, Dublin. With the exception of Clancy Barracks which will be vacated by 1 July 2000, the other five barracks have been evacuated.</P>
    <P>The decision to close barracks was part of the relocation, refurbishment and re-equipment of the Defence Forces, as recommended in the context of the Price Waterhouse report regarding the rationalisation of military installations generally. The purpose of the decision was to remove from the Defence Forces the burden imposed by manning and maintaining unnecessary installations and to effect savings in relation to security and maintenance costs at the locations concerned.</P>
    <P>It was also designed to release troops for operational duties which would have a positive impact on the security duty capacity of the Defence Forces and free up resources for necessary re-equipment. Price Waterhouse consultants commented that &ldquo;security military tasks&rdquo; were the highest consumer of military manpower at home. Essentially, this activity is concerned with the military guarding or otherwise securing its facilities. Troops engaged in this activity are not available for operational tasks. The high level of manpower involved in this area is partly a function of the excessive number of facilities occupied. All personnel affected by the closures were re-assigned to other posts or were offered voluntary early retirement if they satisfied eligibility criteria.</P>
    <P> It is expected that up to £50 million will be raised from the sale of the barracks and major projects to provide operational, living and recreational accommodation, estimated to cost £30 million, are already under way mainly in the Curragh camp and Collins Barracks, Cork.</P>
    <P> The cost of providing security at the vacated barracks amounts to £386,462 to date. On security duty allowances alone, the military authorities have estimated that savings to date amount to more than £250,000. In addition, there have been significant savings on utilities such as telephone and electricity charges which approximate to £25,000 in the case of Murphy Barracks, Ballincollig, for a six month period.</P>
    <P>Arising from a request from the Department of Foreign Affairs for accommodation to house the Kosovan refugees, I offered the Department the opportunity to inspect the five vacated barracks to check out their feasibility or otherwise for the accommodation of the refugees. Currently Magee Barracks, Kildare, is being used for this purpose on a temporary basis and the question of using Castleblayney for a similar purpose is under examination.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional information.</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>Arrangements for the sale of the barracks are proceeding and I expect to bring the process to fruition in the coming months. Deputies will <Col N="402" /> appreciate that such matters, of necessity, take time and that the availability for sale of barracks occupied on a temporary basis for the accommodation of refugees will depend on a resolution of the Kosovo situation.</P>
    <P> Having regard to the objectives set out in Price Waterhouse, I remain committed to the development of the Defence Forces as a modern and effective organisation staffed and equipped to meet the challenges of the 21st century and I emphasise that the decision to close and dispose of the barracks in question is to enhance the training, accommodation, equipment and, hence, the professionalism of the Defence Forces.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>One element of the question was the replacement of facilities elsewhere and the Minister indicated that the Curragh Camp and Collins Barracks in Cork are two of those concerned. Is he aware that, contrary to what he undertook to do at the announcement of the closure of Magee Barracks, the accommodation required has not been provided at the Curragh; and that one unit, comprising 100 personnel, must use six offices in the Curragh without any facilities? What plans does he have to sort this out?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Any fair minded evaluation of what happened in the Curragh since last year would show there was an extraordinarily speedy outcome to the work. When I visited the Curragh last August ten contracts were ongoing, five more were about to be signed and it was a hive of activity. I compliment the staff and the leadership provided by the military authorities in the Curragh for what I consider to be one of the best and fastest approaches to meeting the heavy demand arising from the closure of Magee Barracks in Kildare. I cannot say that everything is complete but a fantastic job was done speedily. I will examine what the Deputy said about the final parts of the accommodation. Given the location of the Curragh and its opportunities for future development, I am conscious that it needs more refurbishment and investment. This is being provided, including a swimming pool, etc. For the UN and other activities significant investment must be made there. As Deputy Dukes knows as a representative of that area, a lot of work has been done in 12 months.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Defence</askee>
      <Quest>the plans, if any, he has to provide the Air Corps with medium lift helicopters which would allow it to undertake search and rescue around the coast when the current contract between the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources and Bond Helicopters for the provision of search and rescue facilities at Dublin and Shannon expires.</Quest>
      <QRef>[9278/99]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The Irish Marine Emergency Service, IMES, of the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources has overall responsibility for the provision of a marine search and rescue service in this country. The Air Corps provides a search and rescue service from Finner, County Donegal, and Waterford Regional Airport as part of the overall search and rescue arrangements. Bond Helicopters provides a search and rescue service, using medium lift helicopters, from Shannon and Dublin Airports under contract to IMES.</P>
      <P>The service operating from Dublin Airport commenced on 1 July 1998, prior to which the Air Corps provided search and rescue coverage on the east coast. It had been intended that the new service would be crewed by Air Corps personnel and would operate from Casement Aerodrome once legal difficulties concerning the question of the basing of a civil operation at a military airbase had been resolved. This latter element is being pursued with the Department of Public Enterprise and the Irish Aviation Authority.</P>
      <P>The high incidence of retirement of Air Corps flying officers in recent years meant that the Air Corps was not in a position to provide pilots for the new service. Provision was, however, made in the contract with the operator for the introduction of Air Corps crew at a future date. The new service is currently operating from Dublin Airport with the option of relocating to Baldonnel at a future date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government considered the Price Waterhouse reviews of the Air Corps and the Naval Service in the middle of last year. A planning and implementation process was set in train to give effect to the Government's decision. I have asked the Chief of Staff in conjunction with the General Officer Commanding the Air Corps and the Flag Officer Commanding the Naval Service to submit implementation plans for my consideration to give effect to the effectiveness and efficiency recommendations in the Price Waterhouse report. The Chief of Staff has received draft implementation plans and work is continuing on <Col N="404" /> the military side to finalise these for my consideration.</P>
    <P>In parallel, and as part of the general White Paper process, I have asked for proposals from the Chief of Staff to address the long-term air and sea requirements of the State which would form the basis of the longer term development of the Air Corps and Naval Service to complement the on-going effectiveness and efficiency measures. I recently received his initial proposals and these are currently being considered. These proposals, including the question of future aircraft requirements, will have to be assessed and evaluated in the broader overall context of the White Paper on Defence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>While the service provided so far has been entirely satisfactory within the limitations imposed by the resources available to it, does the Minister not agree it would be more desirable in the long-term for this service not only to be crewed by the Air Corps but to be provided entirely from Air Corps resources? Would that not also help expand the envelope of the Air Corps' capacities in other logistics operations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Dukes and that was the original intention but as he would know from his ministerial and other experience, the growth in the civil aviation industry has led to many pilots being attracted away from the Air Corps. We have had to introduce different schemes to hold back the haemorrhage. That is the prime reason we have not been able to follow that path. We have had constant recruitment for the last four years and the retention scheme has been relatively successful. The position has been stabilised but it still does not afford us the opportunity to man the aircraft for sea rescue in the way originally envisaged. It is hoped to return to that at some time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister committed to this? Is he actively working to ensure this service will return to the Air Corps? This is a catch 22; pilots leave because the Air Corps is not doing these essential tasks and morale goes down as a result. Surely there should be an attempt to replace the Air Corps fleet. Is the Minister actively working on that? Is there a timetable for its replacement? The key is whether the Minister is committed to the tasks returning to the Air Corps because if he is, it can happen. He must also replace the fleet and continue to recruit pilots; the latter numbers have been increasing slightly but need to increase further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think my commitment is in question, nor was that of my predecessors, but there was not much they could do given the growth of the civil aviation industry and the much more attractive remuneration packages which can be afforded by the private sector. The Air Corps has 81 pilots at present and the position is being stabilised. I am committed but I need an imple<Col N="405" /> mentation plan for the Air Corps to decide what investment will be made in future aircraft; we have not reached that stage yet. I am committed to developing that military base as best I can. I have also indicated, privately and publicly, that I am anxious to look at Baldonnel in a wider context to see whether the potential for a mixed military and private development would enable me to have additional resources which would accelerate a programme of aircraft acquisition without always having to lean on the taxpayer.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12, 16, 21, 23, 35, 36, 43, 48, 55, 77, 78, 81, 103 and 104 together.</P>
      <P>Cé go raibh an Teachta MacGearailt thar lar, tá sé soiléir go raibh sí ag obair. The Government considered the Price Waterhouse reviews of the Air Corps and the Naval Service in the middle of last year. A planning and implementation process was set in train to give effect to the Government's decision. The reviews of the Air Corps and the Naval Service must be seen in the broader context of the reorganisation of the Defence Forces generally. The Defence Forces review implementation plan made specific provision for the special studies of the Air Corps and the Naval Service on the basis that the initial Price Waterhouse review had necessarily concentrated on the Army.</P>
      <P>Price Waterhouse's 1998 report on the Air Corps and the Naval Service sets out a range of recommendations for more effective and efficient air and sea services. Some of these recommendations can be proceeded with fairly quickly while others will take longer. As with the reorganisation of the Defence Forces, the changes in the Air Corps and the Naval Service will be of a positive nature aimed at ensuring the ongoing development of these services consistent with the needs of the State and those of the taxpayer.</P>
      <P>It is important that implementation of the recommendations is undertaken in a planned way having regard to the development of the Defence Forces as a whole. This is why I have asked the chief of staff, in conjunction with the general officer commanding the Air Corps and the flag officer commanding the Naval Service to submit implementation plans for my consideration to give effect to the effectiveness and efficiency recommendations in the Price Waterhouse report. The chief of staff has received draft implementation plans and work is continuing on the military side to finalise these for my consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In parallel, and as part of the general White Paper process, I have asked the chief of staff for proposals to address the long-term air and sea requirements of the State. These proposals would form the basis of the longer-term development of <Col N="409" /> the Air Corps and Naval Service to complement the ongoing effectiveness and efficiency measures. I have recently received his initial proposals and these are currently being considered. Of course, these proposals, including the question of future aircraft requirements, will have to be assessed and evaluated in the broader overall context of the White Paper on Defence.</P>
    <P>I have also emphasised the importance of involving all the relevant stakeholders in the process. Accordingly, I have established a special consultation group to provide a forum for the input of the key stakeholders in relation to the State air and sea services. This consultation group, which I chair, comprises representatives from the civil and military branches of my Department, from the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources, the Department of the Taoiseach, the Department of Finance and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
    <P>To date the group has held an initial meeting at which I invited the stakeholders to make their inputs to the process and appropriate contacts have been made at official level to facilitate this. Subsequently, the flag officer commanding the Naval Service and the general officer commanding the Air Corps were tasked with drawing up implementation plans to give effect to the effectiveness and efficiency recommendations in the Price Waterhouse report.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned, draft implementation plans were recently submitted to the chief of staff and these are currently being finalised for my consideration. Once these plans have been received, the consultative group's principal work will begin. Further meetings of the group will occur as the planning and implementation process develops.</P>
    <P>Full consultations will take place with the Defence Forces representative associations in accordance with the normal system of representation. In addition, arrangements are being put in place to ensure that the representative associations are kept informed of developments. However, I am conscious of the need for a balance to be maintained between such consultations on the one hand and my duty as Minister in relation to the formulation of defence policy on the other.</P>
    <P>The relocation of Air Corps and Naval Service headquarters to Casement Aerodrome and Haulbowline, respectively, was a key recommendation of the Price Waterhouse report. In directing that the headquarters of both services be relocated as the initial step in the reorganisation process in the Air Corps and Naval Service, I am giving a firm and tangible indication of my commitment to this process.</P>

      <P>Before our Government colleagues leave, I point out the Minister requested the quo<Col N="410" /> rum. We thought he only needed a glass of water after his long reply.</P>
      <P>This review of the Army and naval service, particularly the review of the naval service, was a major bone of contention during the by-election in Cork. Extreme disappointment was expressed at the lack of progress made and there was concern at the Minister chairing the committee. The Minister will be aware of the recent widespread discontent of naval personnel at the Department of Finance's apparent obstruction of the review. Will he confirm that is not the case and that the Price Waterhouse review of the naval service, which will benefit the service, will proceed without the dead hand of the Department of Finance?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Ferris is correct. The review took longer than anticipated because the original Price Waterhouse review concentrated primarily on the Army and it was thought deeper consideration should be given to the Air Corps and naval service. The review took longer than anyone envisaged.</P>
      <P>The implementation plan for the Navy and Air Corps is in draft form. There is a significant ongoing recruitment programme for the Navy and we will have the first new ship in 14 years in September. Many positive things are happening and a massive new galley has been built in Haulbowline at a cost of almost £3 million.   Given that the alternative job opportunities for highly qualified technical people are greater than ever before, the haemorrhage from the service is also greater than ever before. There is a challenge to maintain the manpower levels and we are determined to maintain them. We will introduce any scheme we can to do that. We are at a late stage in examination of that whole process and I am sure people feel a little happier about what is happening.</P>

Have the military authorities and the general staff, in particular, acquired the habit of consultation? Have they shed their excessively defensive view of consultation with PDFORRA and RACO? Are they prepared to accept that the representatives of the serving members of the forces have recommendations, views and ideas that are worth taking into account in the future development of the role of our Defence Forces?</P>

      <P>As a non-military person, it took me some time to get to grips with the systems in the Defence Forces. For a long time they belonged in the past but they have been radically improved. The consultative partnership approach and consensus type management, which have evolved, particularly in past last ten years, were desperately needed. More of that is happening now and more of it should happen. I want to encourage much greater participation. I accept there is still room for improvement, but a great effort is being made to improve these systems. In the past 12 months, apart from the closure of barracks and the pay deal, which will always be an area of fundamental disagreement in regard to the amount, there has been very little real dissent on all these issues. I am delighted about that and I want to encourage that for the future.</P>

      <P>The Minister appointed himself chair of the implementation group. I understand from his reply that he has chaired one meeting of the group to date. Is that correct?</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister should take a more hands on approach to the implementation of this report. The report recommended he should appoint an independent chair. He did not do that; he appointed himself. He has held only one meeting of the group. Surely he should give the matter more impetus. Is it not the case that the implementation of the recommendations of these reports has been deferred pending the White Paper? </P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>No, that is not true. As I indicated in my reply, the draft implementation report is with the Chief of Staff and I will receive it shortly for consideration. There are two ways of approaching this matter. I could become inextricably involved in the process of consultation, which will take place following the publication of the Price Waterhouse review, or stand back and allow those services to put forward implementation plans and then discuss how we will implement or change them. I am not a Minister who dictates to the people involved on a day to day basis and I am not doing that. I see the process of consultation following the production of the plans, as a new area in this whole thing, and I will be more directly involved then because that is the stage where I will have to seek resources and dditional resources will be needed. The profile of financial investment, whether for recruitment, the purchase of a ship, refurbishment or upgrading equipment has increased from £10 million five years ago to £37 million this year. <Col N="412" /> Part of my job is to try to secure the necessary resource when I get the plan. I do not have the plan yet. Once I have it we are ready to go.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned abut the Minister's approach to this. Will he accept that the Price Waterhouse report on the Navy and Air Corps emphasises the need for a chairperson to drive the process forward, given the many problems there have been in both services down through the years? Should he not take a more proactive approach as chair of that committee to move forward the process? He said last month that he was awaiting the reports. I am glad to hear they are in draft from with the Chief of Staff and with the Navy and Air Corps. Is the Minister saying the delay is because they have not finalised their recommendations to him?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a consultative process between the various services and the chief of staff. I directed them to produce their implementation plan without let of hindrance from me. I am waiting for it and the moment I have it we will be into a new ball game. What the services want and need, and the efficiency and other measures they want introduced are in their hands until such time as I get the reports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister saying the reason for the delay in implementing the plan is that he has not received the reports?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Having had one meeting of the group, the Minister is sitting like Buddha, immobile and waiting for all these things to come. Will he adopt a more active posture once he has the reports? For example, when he has these recommendations will he set target dates for the implementation of the various stages and will he let us know what they will be? Will he provide for consultation on those target dates with the serving members of the Defence Forces?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no idea why Deputy Dukes uses the language he does when he asks a question. I said from the beginning that I would ask the different services to produce their own plan and we would then begin the implementation process. I also said I would do everything I could in the interim period, whether a constant recruitment process, refurbishment work, or the purchase of equipment. I have already cited the profile of investment which has increased 400 per cent in four years in different areas. I have done everything possible to improve the system and deal with outstanding allowance issues which have been troublesome for a long period of time. I await the plan of the different services &ndash; there is no greater autonomy than that.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14, 24, 31, 68, 72 and 73 together.</P>
      <P>By 19 May 1999 the total cost of awards, settlements and plaintiffs' legal costs paid by my Department in Army hearing loss claims was £78.2 million. Some £2,800,000 has been paid in respect of 168 court awards, while out of court settlements in 2,983 cases have cost £58.2 million. Plaintiffs' legal costs amount to £17.2 million paid to date.</P>
      <P>Some 33 per cent of hearing loss claims have been received from serving members of the Defence Forces and 67 per cent have been received from former members of the Defence Forces. The total cost of awards, settlements and plaintiffs' legal costs has amounted to £32.1 million in respect of serving members and £46.1 million in respect of non-serving members. Some 63 hearing loss claims were received in March this year and 129 in the month of April.</P>
      <P>Administration costs are currently estimated at approximately £800,000 per year for staff and overheads in the Department of Defence; £1.1 million per year for staff and overheads in respect of the Defence Forces; and almost £800,000 per year for staff and overheads in the Chief State Solicitor's office. The total estimate for administrative costs is, therefore, approximately £2.7 million per year.</P>
      <P>Details concerning hearing loss cases settled in January, February, March and April 1999 are contained in a tabular statement which will be circulated in the Official Report. The average quantum of damages in claims where awards or settlements were reached for each year between 1996 and 1999 are 1996, £30,874; 1997, £23,830; 1998, £17,336; and 1999 &ndash; up to 19 May &ndash; £12,888.</P>

      <P>I have made no progress directly with the Incorporated Law Society. However, the Attorney General has taken a personal initiative and a number of these cases are now being heard in the Circuit Court with associated legal costs. I would like to have made more progress with the Incorporated Law Society on a scale of cost which would reflect the similarity of a great number of these cases. However, so far this has not been achieved. This has been one of the driving forces behind the adoption of an out of court settlement procedure instead of the current system.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15, 39, 74 and 75 together.</P>
      <P>As Deputies are aware, I have expressed reservations in relation to some aspects of the judgment in the Hanley case, particularly in relation to the additional prognostic factor which was added to the Green Book method of assessing hearing disability in order to take account of the future effect of noise damage to an individuals hearing ability. My particular difficulty revolves around the increasing unreliability of any statistical methodology the further into the future it is required to predict. Allied to this concern is that the additional prognostication methodology greatly increases the tariff which applies in these claims.</P>
      <P>My Department has, accordingly, consulted with experts in the fields of medicine and statistics regarding the modified assessment methodology as developed in the Hanley case. However, having obtained legal advice on the issue, I am of the view that these concerns should not delay the hearing of the Hanley case in the Supreme Court. A Certificate of Readiness has thus been lodged by the State to the Supreme Court in the Hanley case. The decision to proceed with the Hanley appeal will not prevent a further airing of the concerns in relation to the prognostic element of the Hanley judgment in the High Court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The following arrangements apply in the Defence Forces regarding comments on political matters. Defence Force Regulation A.7 provides that: &ldquo;Comment, if any, in publications, lectures, broadcasts or talks, touching on questions of a political nature &ndash; whether national or international &ndash; shall avoid strictly any reference which might be construed as being of a controversial nature.&rdquo;  Where the Defence Forces representative associations are concerned, Defence Forces regulations provide that no public statement or comment concerning a political matter shall be made by an association and that an association shall not sponsor or resort to any form of public agitation as a means of furthering claims or for any other purpose whatsoever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The established procedures for elements of the media seeking contact with members of the PDF is that they do so through the Defence Forces press office. Defence Forces personnel <Col N="417" /> who are speaking to the media do so on the understanding that they do not comment on political matters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that when the chief of staff, Major General Stapleton, comments on an issue such as Partnership for Peace, he is commenting on a political matter? Will the Minister intervene and request members of the Defence Forces to cease commenting on sensitive issues of foreign policy? Members of PDFORRA such as Mr. Lucey have been given free rein on the radio. Does the Minister think this is appropriate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The statement made by the chief of staff, Major General David Stapleton, was to the effect that there would be significant benefits to the Defence Forces if it was allowed participate in Partnership for Peace but that the decision to do this was a matter for the Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree it is worrying to hear a member of a party in this democratically elected assembly attempting to censor citizens in the expression of their views on important public issues, particularly when those citizens make it clear they are not making a political comment and that a decision on the substance of the matter must be made by politicians? Does the Minister agree it would be deplorable if anyone in this House tried to prevent people with particular expertise from giving the benefit of their knowledge to political debate?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">

It is part of western civilisation and is morally obliged to play its part in defending that civilisation. I have seen an abdication of responsibilities in this regard by politicians and pressure groups. I come from a military background and, while I do not know the views of other members of my family, my father and two brothers were senior members of both the Army and the Naval Service. I do not have any apologies to make.</P>
      <P>I regard it as cowardly to take everything that is going from western civilisation, benefit from its protection and prosperity and give back nothing. Of course, it eventually beggars a question: why is an army needed in Ireland if the country is not prepared to contribute to the protection of civilisation? Should the Army be converted into a civilian aid to the Garda? It would be more upfront, honest, practical and desirable and would rid our streets of hooliganism, vandalism and anti-social behaviour.</P>
      <P>It is difficult to understand people who condemn NATO's actions because the alternative is just so horrible &ndash; ethnic cleansing, genocide, extermination, rape, murder and pillaging. This has not just taken place since the bombing started eight weeks ago. It has been going on systematically since 1989 when the Yugoslav Federation broke up and it has accelerated since, particularly in the months prior to the NATO actions. Even Members of this House condone that type of activity rather than support NATO. NATO is carrying out an honourable function to stop people in their tracks.</P>
      <P>It is pity that an organisation comparable to NATO was not around in Ireland 300 years ago when people such as Cromwell came here and exterminated large sections of the population. We never had the benefit of such protection, but now that Ireland is independent, prosperous and has facilities, including an army it should be willing to take part and play a role in protecting that civilisation.</P>
      <P>I tabled a parliamentary question last week asking the Minister for Foreign Affairs whether Ireland had applied for membership of NATO or if we had any intention of joining it. The Minister said Ireland had not applied and then referred to 1949. He stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that in January 1949 the US Government formally sought the views of the then Government of Ireland concerning the issue of an official invitation to Ireland to participate in the proposed North Atlantic Treaty, which came into effect later that year. The Government at the time indi<Col N="419" /> cated that it did not wish to join NATO on the grounds of the partition of Ireland.</P>
    <P>That was a reasonable and common sense attitude to adopt then but this is 50 years later. It has been accepted that partition is a fact of life and no military action will be taken to get rid of it as was the insinuation in 1949, when circumstances were totally different.</P>
    <P>Decent people have been let down and anybody who feels that the NATO action in Kosovo is incorrect, improper or immoral should visit towns such as Baltinglass, County Wicklow. A gentleman who witnessed the arrival of refugees from Kosovo in Baltinglass last weekend told me it was the most harrowing experience of his life and that included the funerals of members of his family. The refugees were poor, innocent people displaced from their normal places of habitation. They were lost and separated from their extended families; were heartbroken and he did not know how we could stand idly by and allow that to happen.</P>
    <P>Ireland should make a contribution. I objected on the Order of Business earlier to the removal of Parliamentary Question No. 8 in my name tabled yesterday to the Minister for Defence which dealt with sending a detachment of Irish troops to Albania, Montenegro and Macedonia to help in the humanitarian effort by providing logistical support, such as tents, latrines, water purification plants and personnel to organise such activities. Non-governmental organisations do incredible work and the State should be involved.</P>
    <P>I must criticise some wealthy countries with many facilities which could do a great deal of good, but stand idly by. A league table should be drawn up to see who is performing a humanitarian service for the displaced people of Kosovo. The Germans, Turks, British, Irish and Norwegians are doing a great job but what about Muslim countries in the Middle East which are blood brothers of Kosovo? What is Libya doing? It was willing to give arms to the IRA to kill innocent people throughout Ireland, particularly in the North. How many refugees has Saudi Arabia, one of the richest countries in the world, taken in? I would say none.</P>
    <P>There is a major question over the uniformity of the effort to help these defenceless people. Well meaning and fair-minded Irish people would be well advised to ask who is pulling his or her weight and, then, pinpoint those who could but are not. We would be better employed doing that rather than condemning NATO for risking its soldiers' lives. I agree with the Government that no referendum is needed on the question of Ireland's membership of PfP. The 166 Members of this House are elected to decide such issues. Let us not be led by the nose by opinion polls. The majority of people feel that joining the PfP is reasonable and if we are going to be led by pollsters and newspapers, then we might as well not have a House of Parliament and hold a referendum on every damn <Col N="420" /> issue. I support the Government. I certainly do not think much of China and Russia objecting to what NATO is doing. There is a major conflict there between the haves and the have nots. The remnants of a disgraced communist system are trying to bring down people who are trying to do their best to help the tail of that system. Milosevic and his kind are the sting in the tail of a discredited communist system. There is no credit due to the Russians or the Chinese. Instead of being supportive, they are trying to trip up the Americans, the British and everybody else who means well. Just because we have a prosperous civilisation which has proved to be successful, they are trying to grasp this opportunity to denigrate people who are doing a fine job.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, the best of luck next week when she visits Macedonia. I hope she comes back unharmed. What would we do without her?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on the issues of Partnership for Peace and Kosovo. I would like, in particular, to deal with the question of the possible future role for the Defence Forces in peacekeeping activities under PfP, should it be decided that Ireland will participate in PfP. As I indicated in the House previously, I consider it important that, regardless of whatever decision is ultimately reached by Dáil Éireann on the question of participation in PfP, such a decision is preceded by and progressed through a constructive and informed debate, both inside and outside the House, where the views of all interested parties, whether political parties, individuals or organisations, can be heard.</P>
      <P>An essential element in this process is a clear understanding of what PfP is all about. The explanatory guide on PfP published by the Government today should not alone enlighten that debate but should help to dispel any misconceptions that exist regarding PfP. Certain of these misconceptions have led to many unfounded concerns.</P>
      <P>The philosopher, Bertrand Russell, once observed that &ldquo;the whole problem with the world is that fools and fanatics are always so certain of themselves, but wiser people so full of doubts&rdquo;. For a generation, every time Ireland has taken a further step out into the world, ending our years of isolation, we have evoked the same Pavlovian response from the ranks of the permanently indignant. From the original application to join the EEC, to the signing of the Single European Act and the Maastricht and Amsterdam treaties, we have been assured with great certainty by these unrepresentative, self-appointed guardians of the national conscience that disaster lies around the next corner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The exact opposite has happened. We have grown and developed in leaps and bounds. However, one must admire the sheer cheek. Lesser men and women would be mortified at being proved wrong so publicly and so often. However, the keepers of the national conscience <Col N="421" /> are made of sterner stuff. Their ludicrous opinions remain completely undisturbed by the facts.</P>
    <P>Regarding Ireland's proposed membership of Partnership for Peace, there is more than a whiff of paranoia in the air. Over the past decade, the world has been transformed; the Berlin Wall has fallen and the Cold War is over. At least, for those of us who base our opinions on the observation of facts, the post-war division of the world into hostile armed camps is at an end. Sadly, for those who sleepwalk through life, the world never changes. Paradoxically, the last of the Cold War dinosaurs are now to be found among the supposed defenders of our neutrality.</P>
    <P>PfP is one element in the development of new inclusive co-operative security arrangements in Europe. It is a truly co-operative approach to security with the stated aim of intensifying political and military co-operation in Europe, promoting stability, reducing threats to peace and building strengthened relationships by promoting practical co-operation amongst its participants.</P>
    <P>While initially it was felt that PfP appeared to be geared to countries aspiring to eventual membership of NATO, it has since been joined by most OSCE countries, including Russia and the former Soviet Republics, as well as neutral countries such as Sweden, Finland. Austria and Switzerland. Currently, 43 states participate in PfP.</P>
    <P>The development of structures such as PfP reflects the need felt by some countries arising from the current transitional nature of European security. The emphasis has now shifted away from territorial defence towards issues of conflict prevention, peacekeeping, crisis management and the security threats imposed by international crime. Similarly, the approach in the Amsterdam treaty reflects the trend away from territorial defence, with its focus on the Petersberg Tasks of peacekeeping and crisis management.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that the Petersberg Tasks were conceived in the context of support for the efforts of the United Nations and the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe &ndash; the OSCE &ndash; and which the European Union is now seeking to develop under the Amsterdam treaty. Much of the planning and preparation for the Petersberg Tasks is now carried out by countries under PfP programmes.</P>
    <P>The new European security architecture is essentially a continent-wide interweaving in collective security in the new and emerging European relations. Within this architecture, PfP is a voluntary, flexible and non-binding co-operative security framework between NATO and non-members of NATO. It is the very flexible nature of the arrangement which, no doubt, has attracted so many countries to participate. In addition, PfP can be said to have built on the United Nations' Charter. It is recognised that no one state or institution can by itself deal with the complex and diverse challenges to security of the post-Cold War world.</P>
    <P>The former Yugoslavia is probably the best <Col N="422" /> example of the new approach of mutually reinforcing co-operation between a range of institutions, i.e. the UN, EU, NATO, OSCE, Western European Union and Council of Europe. PfP has been complemented by a body known as the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council, or EAPC, which includes all members of PfP. The EAPC grew out of consultations involving the members of PfP who felt the need for a new multinational consultation framework at political level, which was not limited to members of NATO or the former Warsaw Pact alliance.  Membership of the EAPC is open to all OSCE states who have subscribed to the PfP's basic document. It is envisaged that Ireland would participate in the EAPC on joining PfP. Partnership for Peace and EAPC can be described as instruments of collective co-operation.</P>
    <P>As participation in PfP would not involve membership of NATO, participation on appropriate terms would not affect Ireland's policy of military neutrality. Participation would not bring Ireland into any form of alliance involving mutual defence commitments. Neither would it constitute or imply any undertaking or intention to become a member of NATO in the future. The overall objectives of PfP, which I will refer to, are consonant with Ireland's approach to international peace and European security. PfP simply involves voluntary and non-binding co-operation with NATO.</P>
    <P>As regards the possible role of the Defence Forces in peacekeeping activities under PfP, participants in PfP subscribe to a framework document which sets out the basic purposes and objectives of PfP. These include, <i>inter alia,</i> the protection and promotion of human rights, the safeguarding of freedom, justice and peace, the preservation of democracy. the upholding of international law and the fulfilment of the objectives of the UN Charter and OSCE commitments. In addition, individual states decide on the scope of their participation in PfP activities and in this regard agree an individual partnership programme covering the activities to which they wish to subscribe.</P>
    <P>In Ireland's case, should it be decided to participate in Partnership for Peace, it is envisaged that these activities would include peacekeeping under a UN mandate, humanitarian and rescue works &ndash; all tasks in line with the traditional involvement and experience of our Defence Forces in those most worthy areas of service to our fellow human beings. Considerable benefits would also accrue to the Defence Forces in terms of the training opportunities and experience that participation in PfP activities would afford them.</P>
    <P>The areas of peacekeeping and search and rescue are expanding progressively. Partnership for Peace would allow the Defence Forces to improve their capability for multinational peacekeeping operations in the future, through the medium of interoperability development, training and exercises. In particular, membership would enhance the Defence Forces' capacity to conduct <Col N="423" /> modern peacekeeping operations with other military forces.</P>
    <P>The nature of peacekeeping missions is changing. The United Nations is undergoing a critical change in how it organises and implements such missions and is increasingly mandating regional organisations to conduct those missions on its behalf. This new strategy places greater responsibility on participating nations to examine their forces' self-sufficiency in training, equipment and operating proficiency. The Defence Forces must be given the opportunity to respond to these critical changes if Ireland is determined to stay at the forefront as a contributing nation to international peacekeeping operations.</P>
    <P>An example of Defence Forces' facilities which could be made available for the purpose is the United Nations' Training School and a language laboratory at the Curragh, with their associated infrastructure and courses. The experience of Ireland in the field of peacekeeping is well recognised by other countries. This experience can be imparted to other PfP nations and will give Ireland an influence in how peacekeeping operations will be conducted in the future.</P>
    <P>PfP has developed into a major framework for co-operation, training and preparation for UN mandated peacekeeping, humanitarian tasks and crisis management. The call on the international community, including Ireland, to support peacekeeping missions is stronger than ever today. If we need any reminder of the absolute requirement to deal with conflicts before they escalate into major crises we have only to look at the situation in the Balkan region in recent times, including the appalling humanitarian catastrophe in Kosovo today.</P>
    <P>I am horrified by the appalling human tragedy that has unfolded in Kosovo. The barbarities inflicted on the people of Kosovo, particularly those inflicted on the Kosovo Albanians by the Serb authorities, have shocked the world. This terrible tragedy has again brought home the horror and cruelty of war in the most direct way and the hardship it causes ordinary men, women and children.</P>
    <P>The plight of hundreds of thousands of displaced persons who are suffering in an unwarranted and unspeakable way in the Balkans calls for a determined and significant response from the international community. The policy of deportation and destruction of an entire people being pursued by President Milosevic and his evil regime cannot be allowed to succeed. Maximum pressure on him from the international community must be maintained in order to avoid further suffering and destruction. It is to be hoped that a political solution, which the overwhelming majority of the international community desires, will soon be achieved.</P>
    <P>My concern for the Kosovan refugees has been focused on assisting in the humanitarian crisis by contributing the services of experienced Defence Forces personnel and in providing facilities for <Col N="424" /> the accommodation of refugees on their arrival in Ireland. In the latter regard, arising out of requests from the Department of Foreign Affairs for accommodation for the Kosovan refugees, Magee Barracks in County Kildare was selected as a suitable location. Arrangements were made to find mobile homes to accommodate refugees there and 109 of the refugees who arrived in Ireland on 13 May have been accommodated there. A further intake is expected today and they will also be accommodated there. Should any of the other former military barracks be found to be suitable for refugees, I am prepared to agree that arrangements be made to accommodate refugees there. We continue to stand ready to provide whatever help we can in this appalling tragedy.</P>
    <P>Regarding Partnership for Peace, to those of us who have opened our eyes to the changing world PfP is a perfectly natural development in our foreign policy. Yet those who are unwilling to accommodate change are warming up for another chorus of doom and gloom. It is a free country and such people are entitled to express their views. However, I invite them to reflect on the following words of Hubert Humphrey: &ldquo;The right to be heard does not include the right to be taken seriously.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Ms M. McGennis Ms M. McGennis">
      <NameTxt>Ms M. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>I was contacted in January this year by constituents regarding a planning application from a garage for an extension and other matters. The planning authority refused permission not on the basis of the matter I wish to raise but because the area was residential while the application was for retail use and therefore not in keeping with the draft development plan. However, it became clear that this garage had been operating for a long time before 1996, when it applied for a licence to store petroleum and was refused. It was obvious that it had been operating a petrol station with large storage areas from that time without a licence. Further representations to the local authority received the response that it was not a matter for that body but was rather an issue for the Health and Safety Authority.</P>
      <P>When I wrote to that organisation part of the reply I received read:</P>
      <P>In relation to the Esso petrol station located on Sarsfield Road, the fire prevention authorities of Dublin Corporation, the licensing authority for petrol stations under the Dangerous Substances Act, have written to the Health and Safety Authority concerning this station. We are currently awaiting the implementation of the new legislation referred to above before taking action in such situations, at which stage a systematic evaluation of the licensing situation throughout the country will be undertaken by the Health and Safety Authority in co-operation with the fire authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="425" /> That does not address the specific representation I made. I call the Minister of State's attention to the fact that it seems absolutely ludicrous that a local authority, which has responsibility for granting planning permission and, according to this reply, also has responsibility for issuing licences, feels these functions have nothing to do with each other and has taken no action in an extremely dangerous situation. This matter only emerged after the garage owners submitted a planning application for more commercial development at a time when the business was operating without a licence to store petroleum. It is very difficult to explain this to constituents and it is not sustainable that residents were told by the local authority that it could do nothing about this. The quotation I have read seems to reinforce the view that the local authority is not addressing what it can do under current legislation but is simply saying it will bring forward new proposals.</P>
    <P>That is not satisfactory and my constituents cannot wait for those changes. Even without those changes it should be possible for the Health and Safety Authority to close down petrol stations in residential areas if they are operating without licences. This station has been operating without a licence since 1996 but the Health and Safety Authority has taken no action to stop it trading while the local authority seems to feel it has no function in the matter. If the Minister's response is merely to promise to introduce a code of conduct and to change regulations, I will not be satisfied. A planning authority should not allow construction to commence until the relevant approval is given by the Health and Safety Authority. Most commercial developments require a fire safety certificate before building can commence.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will be able to tell me that action will be taken to close this retail outlet down and if not, that the owners will be informed of what needs to be done to bring the premises up to the required standard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy McGennis for bringing this matter to the attention of the House. I appreciate the effort she has made in doing so. I will deal with the general issue and then with the specific point the Deputy has made regarding the Esso petrol station in Sarsfield Road.</P>
      <P>The operation of all petrol retail outlets is covered by the Dangerous Substances (Retail and Private Petroleum Stores) Regulations, 1979 (S.I. 311 of 1979) as amended by the Dangerous Substances (Retail and Private Petroleum Stores) (Amendment) Regulations, 1988 (S.I. No. 303 of 1988). These regulations outline the licensing arrangements for petroleum stations as required under the Dangerous Substances Act, 1972.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The enforcement of these regulations is the responsibility of the Health and Safety Authority which is the statutory body responsible for the promotion of occupational safety and health and <Col N="426" /> for the day-to-day administration and enforcement of relevant statutory provisions in this area.</P>
    <P>Under this legislation there is a legal requirement on the operator of a petrol station to make application to the relevant local authority for a licence in the first instance. The Health and Safety Authority is responsible for making adequate arrangements for the enforcement of such licensing and this is conducted by way of routine visits, reaction to complaints, service of enforcement notices and prosecution as appropriate.</P>
    <P>Where licences are refused by a local authority because of non-compliance with the technical standards laid down in the regulations, the operator of a petrol station may appeal to the Health and Safety Authority for a review of the situation. The authority may confirm and enforce the refusal or require the issue of a licence following remedial work or otherwise.</P>
    <P>On foot of notification from licensing authorities that petrol stations are operating without a licence or that a licence has been refused, and where there does not appear to be any imminent risk of serious injury as a result of the activities carried out at the petrol station, the following action may be taken.</P>
    <P>First, the petrol station operators may be visited by an inspector of the Health and Safety Authority. In the case of a station that has not hitherto applied for a licence to store petrol, the operator is advised to apply to the relevant licensing authority without delay. Second, the petrol stations are revisited after a short period to ensure that applications have been submitted for a licence. In some cases, in consultation with the licensing authorities, the local fire officer is requested to visit the premises. The Health and Safety Authority takes no further action while a licensing authority considers an application for a licence.</P>
    <P>The authority has recently undertaken a review of the eligibility requirements under the current licensing system. As a result of this review, I now propose to repeal the existing regulations and replace them with a new set of regulations. These will be based on risk assessment and will impose general duties on all petrol station operators to store and dispense petrol in a safe manner. The new regulations will be supported by codes of practice currently being developed by the Health and Safety Authority in conjunction with the petroleum industry.</P>
    <P>Some of the main provisions of the proposed new regulations are as follows: the information required to be submitted in respect of an application for a first licence and for a renewal will be specified; additional powers will be transferred to the licensing authorities; time scales for the issuing of licences will be specified; the supply and unloading of petrol at an unlicensed petrol station will be prohibited; kerbside petrol stations may be licensed on the basis of a risk assessment approach; the regulations will address the keeping, although not for sale, of small quantities of <Col N="427" /> petrol without licence, for use by persons in engines owned by themselves.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to give enhanced enforcement powers to licensing authorities to deal directly with non-compliance. These powers will, apart from prosecution through the courts, include the power to force immediate closure where there is imminent risk of serious injury as a result of the manner in which activities are carried on at a petrol station. The proposed new regulations will also include a prohibition on persons under the age of 16 dispensing or buying petrol.</P>
    <P>The drafting of the new regulations and the codes of practice to support them are well advanced. However, further examination and consultation has still to be carried out. It is my intention to have the regulations finalised well before the end of this year.</P>
    <P>Another primary piece of related health and safety legislation is the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989. This Act deals with workplace health and safety and clearly sets out the responsibilities which both employers and employees have in providing and maintaining a safe working environment. The Act applies to all places of work &ndash;  including, therefore, petrol stations &ndash; and covers all employers, employees and the self-employed.</P>
    <P>With regard to the refusal of a licence to the Esso petrol station at Sarsfield Road Dublin, a Health and Safety Authority inspector has visited the station on a number of occasions and I have been informed that these visits have resulted in agreement on a programme of work to be implemented with a view to ensuring that all the requirements for the issue of a licence may be met. The authority will continue to monitor the situation and is satisfied that progress is being made and that, with the completion of the work, the station will be in a position to show that it does not present a danger to public safety.</P>
    <P>The question of kerbside petrol stations is one with which I am concerned. It has been raised by a number of Deputies. I thank Deputy McGennis for bringing it to the attention of the House and I hope I can pursue some of the points she has raised.</P>

      <P>For many years the health provisions in south Tipperary were in a dismal state. Truthfully, this was due to local disagreement as to whether the new hospital would be located in Cashel or Clonmel. However, in 1997, the Minister for Health, Deputy Michael Noonan, announced State funding of £13.5 million for the provision of an adequate health service in south Tipperary. We thought our problems were over. However, despite the brave decision of the Minister for Health, the provision of facilities is not only slow but incoherent, illogical and wasteful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>St. Joseph's Hospital, Clonmel is already overcrowded. There are long waiting lists for all treat<Col N="428" /> ments. The waiting list for X-rays, however, is completely unnecessary. Following the provision of funds by the Minister, money was allocated for a new X-ray room. The room is ready and contains the most sophisticated equipment. I am sure the public would be outraged if they knew that public money has provided a facility which is little more than a museum. The X-ray room is not being used for the purpose for which it was intended. The room is closed while queues form in hospital corridors for the already insufficient X-ray service. Radiographers are working overtime and are on call every second night.</P>
    <P>It seems illogical for a Minister to oversee a service in which excellent facilities cannot be used for want of staff. All that is needed to allow this facility to be put into the service of the people of south Tipperary is the appointment of a radiographer. This modern, up-to-date, fully equipped and badly needed medical resource is lying idle. This is the ultimate in wastefulness and it cannot be tolerated.</P>
    <P>A recent report has found that Ireland is in 16th place in the provision of health services. St. Joseph's Hospital provides a perfect example of the failure of our health service. Someone, somewhere must make logical decisions and insist that once technology is provided, it must be used. The public will question once again how we run our affairs. If a private company invested this amount of money in new facilities and new technology, it could not afford to allow them lie idle. How can the Department of Health and Children afford to do so? The health of patients in south Tipperary is being affected. The waiting lists for X-rays are too long. Where they wait in the corridor in full view is a fully equipped modern resource room which cannot be used for the want of staff. How anybody could have agreed to spend money on this facility in the knowledge that staff would not be available to make use of it is beyond me.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State should bring to an end immediately this unacceptable situation. The South-Eastern Health Board should not allow it to continue. The Minister of State should at least give us some hope that where facilties are provided they will be used. The facilities in question have been lying idle for five months. This is too long, unfair on patients and constitutes a waste of resources. It is not something that the Minister of State or I could be proud of.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of medical services at St. Joseph's Hospital is a matter for the South-Eastern Health Board in the first instance. A major phase 1 capital development is under planning at the hospital to provide for the transfer of surgical services from Our Lady's Hospital, Cashel in line with the south Tipperary hospital agreement. In view of the projected overall increase in activity at St. Joseph's Hospital that this major development will entail, the health board has developed separate plans for the enhancement of the existing radiological capacity <Col N="429" /> at the hospital to meet anticipated increased demand.</P>
      <P>To this end, the board has completed the development and equipping of a second radiology room at the hospital at a capital cost of £113,000. The recruitment of a radiographer is in train and the board hopes to commence utilisation of the new facility by August this year. The recruitment of further staff to facilitate the full utilisation of the additional service capacity available will be considered as part of the development of services at the hospital in the year 2000 having regard to the availability of funding and the board's competing priorities.</P>
      <P>I understand from the board that it is satisfied the existing radiology room in use at the hospital is adequately meeting current service demands. I am pleased to note that this is the case and that the board is taking appropriate steps to ensure the radiology service will continue to respond to needs as the overall development of services at the hospital proceeds.</P>
      <P>In relation to the major phase 1 development, preparatory construction work is under way on the site with a view to enabling work on the main development to commence later this year at a cost of £13 million at January 1997 prices. This landmark development in the history of the health services in south Tipperary will involve the provision of a new accident and emergency department, ward accommodation, operating theatres, ICU, day care unit, central sterile supplies department, physical medicine department, education centre and counselling rooms.</P>
      <P>This development will represent a hugely significant advance in the quality of service available to south Tipperary hospital patients. The development of services in south Tipperary has regrettably been impeded in the past by the long running dispute on the preferred organisational arrangements through which a modernisation programme was to be achieved. The final settlement of that issue through the signing of the south Tipperary hospital agreement in 1996 has paved the way for this development and the concurrent developments at Our Lady's Hospital, Cashel and in Tipperary town.</P>
      <P>The overall objective is to ensure the services available to the people of south Tipperary are responsive to their needs. The Minister trusts that the developments under planning and under way will be seen as tangible evidence of his commitment in that regard.</P>

Although the infections occurred in the 1970s <Col N="430" /> and 1980s, they could only recently be detected. Hepatitis C screening is only possible since 1991. There are hints that big pharmaceutical and other medical research facilities could have improved on this.</P>
      <P>Haemophilia is now easily controlled and sufferers have good life expectancy. Because of the lack of treatment in the early years, however, 65 people have died, 210 were infected with hepatitis C and 103 with HIV resulting in untold human misery.</P>
      <P>The Government and its predecessor committed themselves to the establishment of a tribunal of inquiry which would involve an investigation of the Department of Health and Children. The discussions on its terms of reference have dragged on since Deputy Noonan was Minister. He was engulfed in controversy when he attempted to tackle and deal with this complex and difficult problem. Agreement was reached on the issues to be investigated in May 1997.</P>
      <P>The Minister promised to present final draft terms of reference to the Cabinet on 30 March but &ndash; for justifiable reasons &ndash; this did not happen. He wants to be seen to take decisive action and the inquiry proceed. He hopes to finalise the terms of reference at a meeting at 11 a.m. tomorrow with the Irish Haemophilia Society. He should then publish them, outline where the tribunal will sit, its composition and possible duration. Officials of the Department should offer full co-operation and disclosure to the tribunal.</P>
      <P>Some of my constituents are affected. They are among the most vulnerable and weakest in society. Their families are also affected. They wish to know the truth. A serious wrong was visited upon them innocently. I hope the Minister will move swiftly to clarify the situation and get the inquiry under way as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Health and Children, the Attorney General and their officials have been endeavouring as a matter of priority to expedite the establishment of a tribunal of inquiry into the infection of persons with haemophilia with HIV and hepatitis C. The Government is fully committed to establishing a tribunal and on 23 February gave approval to its establishment.</P>
      <P>The background to this decision is the infection of approximately 200 haemophiliacs with hepatitis C, of whom approximately 100 are also infected with HIV and the subsequent death of approximately 60 haemophiliacs as a result of their infection. The Irish Haemophilia Society which represents persons with haemophilia sought the establishment of a tribunal to investigate the infection and death of its members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The completion of terms of reference for the tribunal has proved to be a very difficult and complex task involving issues requiring detailed examination and consideration. It appears that most blood products implicated in the infection of haemophiliacs with hepatitis C and HIV were manufactured outside the State and were <Col N="431" /> imported for use by haemophiliacs here. Home produced products are also implicated. It was necessary to take advice from counsel here and consult with attorneys in the United States in relation to the jurisdiction of an Irish tribunal in examining matters arising outside the State.</P>
    <P>Following examination and consideration of the legal advice, the Minister's and the Government's approach to the tribunal is as follows: that the terms of reference would allow the tribunal to discharge its task efficiently and effectively; that the tribunal would be workable and would be given practical terms of reference which cover important matters which are capable of being investigated and that the tribunal would not be required to embark on a long drawn out inquiry with little expectation of a useful outcome.</P>
    <P>In this context, it is anticipated that the tribunal will examine the decisions taken within the jurisdiction in relation to the importation of blood products implicated in the infection of haemophiliacs and that it will be open to the tribunal to compare the actions and omissions here with those in other jurisdictions; to hear evidence from international experts; to examine international research and publications and to seek information and assistance from the US Food and Drug Administration, the US Centre for Disease Control and the pharmaceutical industry.</P>
    <P>Following the Government decision of 23 February, considerable effort was expended in relation to finalising the text of the terms of reference. A difficulty remains in relation to how the international dimension of the investigation will be handled within the text of the terms of reference. Because of the special position held by the Irish Haemophiliac Society in that it represents persons directly affected by the HIV and hepatitis C contamination of blood products, the Minister <Col N="432" /> and his officials have consulted with the society in relation to the issues which require to be examined by the tribunal.</P>
    <P>The Minister wrote to the Irish Haemophiliac Society on 31 March 1999 in relation to the complex issue of the tribunal's remit in examining matters arising outside the State. He stated that he was prepared to see what could be done to clarify the international dimension within the parameters of the legal advice that was to hand. What he has in mind is the possibility of incorporating a provision which would enable, but not require, the tribunal to investigate anything arising outside the State that it considers relevant to its terms of reference in so far as it considers it practicable, appropriate and reasonable to do so, and in so far as it considers that the procedures adopted for that purpose can be carried out without unduly delaying the completion of the inquiry and with a substantial expectation of being able to obtain the evidence necessary for the inquiry.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Attorney General have arranged to meet with representatives of the society tomorrow morning and the Minister hopes that the meeting will resolve any outstanding matters relating to the drafting of the terms of reference. I reiterate that the Minister is fully committed to establishing the tribunal as a matter of priority but it is essential that the terms of reference, when finalised, will enable the tribunal to complete its task efficiently.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18 and 42 together.</P>
      <P>The service commitment scheme was introduced in 1997 for pilot officers of the Air Corps. From the outset the scheme applied primarily to experienced personnel who are currently rated on and flying the Gulfstream IV, Beechcraft, CASA and Dauphin aircraft which are the principal operational aircraft in the Air Corps. The scheme, the conditions of which were not changed as suggested by the Deputy, was introduced with a view to retaining senior pilots who occupy key appointments in areas such as search and rescue, maritime surveillance and ministerial air transport. The gratuities are designed to strike a balance between the demand of the commercial environment and the need to exercise responsibility in relation to public service pay. Such financial incentives are not uncommon in Defence Forces in other countries where similar difficulties exist in retaining qualified personnel.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the incentive scheme has helped to stabilise the drain of pilots from the Air Corps. A total of 14 pilots have opted to participate in the service commitment scheme and it is likely that a number of pilots who will become eligible for participation in the scheme later this year will also opt to participate.</P>

      <Quest>the progress with the pilot scheme to use St. Bricin's military hospital as a step down facility for civilian patients; the time schedule for matters associated with this pilot scheme; the potential use of St. Bricin's for this facility; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[13125/99]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <P>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith): Agreement in principle was reached last year between my Department and the Mater Misericordiae Hospital on a proposal to use St. Bricin's Military Hospital as a step down medical facility into which certain categories of civilian patients could be transferred from the Mater Hospital.  It was agreed that initially a pilot scheme would be set up under which up to eight civilian patients would be accommodated in St. Bricin's for periods ranging from seven to ten days. If this pilot scheme proved successful the intention would be to enter into a long-term arrangement for accommodating up to 20 civilian patients at a time at St. Bricin's Hospital.</P>
    <P>The Department of Health and Children has overall responsibility for the health and well-being of civilian patients in this country. Accordingly, before the pilot scheme can commence, it is essential that that Department has fully satisfied itself with regard to the arrangements surrounding the transfer, accommodation and treatment of civilian patients while in St. Bricin's Hospital. The Mater Hospital recently made proposals to the Department of Health and Children with regard to the use of St. Bricin's Hospital for civilian patients. These proposals have been examined by the Department's chief medical office and, while it is accepted that they have merit, a number of issues still require clarification to ensure that the patient is best served at all times. The Department of Health and Children is in communication with the Mater Hospital regarding these issues and once they have received the required clarification they will be in a position to make a decision on the matter. A <Col N="435" /> number of legal and insurance issues will also need to be resolved prior to the commencement of the pilot scheme.</P>
    <P>When the Department of Health and Children has satisfied itself fully with regard to the proposed arrangements, it will formally approach my Department to request that St. Bricin's Hospital provide the facilities described above. In the meantime, I remain committed to the successful implementation of the pilot scheme and the matter will be progressed as quickly as possible.</P>

My concern, in examining these proposals, would be to protect the military aviation interests at the aerodrome. The question of extending usage of these facilities for hire or reward requires careful consideration as it may have implications regarding licensing of the facility for commercial use. However, the greater utilisation of this underused resource could have benefits for both military and civil aviation in Ireland.</P>
      <P>The other implications of the greater use of Baldonnel by private companies are appropriate for consideration by the Minister for Public Enterprise.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 27, 52 and 60 together.</P>
      <P>This will be the first ever White Paper on Defence.  It will provide a framework for the evolution of national defence policy and the continuing reorganisation process in the Defence Forces. Overall, the White Paper presents a positive opportunity to map out a strategy for the development of the Defence Forces and Civil Defence over the next ten years.</P>
      <P>A range of foundation work is now under way which will form the basis of the future planning elements of the White Paper. These foundation elements relate to an assessment of the defence and security environment, an examination of the progress already made in the reorganisation of the Defence Forces under the Defence Forces review implementation plan and, of course, the consultative process.  </P>
      <P>To date, this consultative process has involved the receipt of 45 written submissions from a wide range of individuals, groups and organisations. I understand that these submissions contain a wide range of views. It is a matter in the first instance for the individual and organisations concerned as to whether these submissions are published. The submissions are being considered actively at present as part of the overall White Paper deliberative process, therefore it would be inappropriate for me to publish them at this time.</P>
      <P>A series of informal consultation meetings are beginning today between the civil and military members of the Department's White Paper project management group and a number of individuals, groups and organisations. These will provide an opportunity for further elaboration and exploration of aspects of the written submissions.  In addition, full consultations will take place with the Defence Force representative associations in accordance with the normal system of representation.</P>
      <P>I would like to emphasise at this point the importance that I am placing on having a real and meaningful consultation process.  It would be remiss of me not to ensure that a topic of fundamental importance is properly addressed. However, I must add that I am conscious of the need for balance to be maintained between consultation, on the one hand, and my duty as Minister in relation to the formation of defence policy, on the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The timetable for the White Paper will depend on the completion of the consultative and planning elements and the subsequent work. The defence and security environment is itself in a <Col N="438" /> state of evolution both in the European and national contexts. Subject to the satisfactory completion of this work, the aim is to finalise proposals for the Government by late summer.</P>
    <P>As with all Government publications, the White Paper will be widely disseminated. A copy will be placed on the Department's Internet site.</P>

      <P>The Naval Service is equipped with a total of seven vessels comprising one helicopter carrying vessel, four off shore patrol vessels and two coastal patrol vessels. At any one time there would generally be three or four vessels on patrol. In December 1997 a contract was placed for the supply of a new fishery protection patrol vessel which is due to be delivered in September 1999.</P>
      <P>I propose to maintain a policy of continuous recruitment to the Permanent Defence Force and in this regard some 65 positions from the first intake of general service recruits, which took place in March-April last, have been allocated to the Naval Service. A similar intake is planned for later this year. Seventeen apprentices have also been recruited to the service and some 14 cadets will be recruited from this year's cadet competition.</P>

      <P>While I have had informal contacts with the Defence Forces representative associations from time to time I have not had any formal meetings with either PDFORRA or RACO since 1 April 1999. I addressed the RDFRA annual delegate conference on Saturday 15 May and I have also had some informal contacts with representatives of that association over the last few weeks.  A formal meeting with PDFORRA will take place in the near future.</P>
      <P>The conciliation and arbitration scheme for the Permanent Defence Force and the agreed representative arrangements with RDFRA are the mechanism within which issues of concern to the associations and the departmental side can and should be addressed. A number of meetings with PDFORRA and RACO have been held under the conciliation and arbitration mechanism this year and there are regular informal contacts between the official and staff sides.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 30 and 101 together.</P>
      <P>In recent years considerable sums have been expended under the Defence Vote in updating military equipment. Total amounts spent on weapons, ammunition, transport, communications systems, and equipment for the Air Corps and Naval Service over the last four years are as follows: 1995 &ndash; £18 million; 1996 &ndash; £20 million; 1997 £31 million; 1998 &ndash; £37 million.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that approximately £55 million will be spent on those areas this year and will include the following major items: a new fishery patrol vessel, due for delivery later this year; <i>LE Eithne</i> completed a half life refit earlier this year and <i>LE Orla</i> will undergo a similar refurbishment programme later in the year; the supply of 16 new turrets and 16 fire directing systems for fitting to existing Panhard armoured cars. The first two turrets and two fire directing systems were delivered and fitted last month and the balance is expected to be delivered towards the end of this year; the delivery of approximately 70 troop-carrying vehicles, such as 4 x 4's and three-quarter ton trucks; a contract for the supply of up to 40 armoured personnel carriers. It is expected that a contract will be in place later this year and the first armoured personnel carriers should be delivered next year.</P>
      <P>It is my intention to continue, and expand where possible, with the modernisation programme to ensure that the Defence Forces are equipped to the highest standards appropriate to their roles.</P>

      <P>SHIRBRIG is an initiative undertaken by Denmark for the establishment of a UN Standing High-Readiness Brigade, drawn from United Nations member states which have made a commitment to the United Nations Standby Arrangements System UNSAS.</P>
      <P>It is the intention that the brigade, which would have reaction times of between 15 to 30 days, would be deployed for up to six months on UN peacekeeping operations under Chapter VI of the United Nations Charter. Ireland has participated in SHIRBRIG meetings as an observer since 1995. SHIRBRIG, however, is not yet operational.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the United Nations Standby Arrangements System UNSAS, I signed, on behalf of Ireland, a memorandum of understanding with the UN when I visited its headquarters in New York in October 1998. The memorandum commits Ireland to the provision of up to 850 military personnel. There is, however, no obligation to participate in any particular mission and Dáil approval would be required for the dispatch of a contingent to any specific operation. UNSAS gives the UN a precise understanding of the forces and other capabilities that Ireland would have available at a given state of readiness for a UN operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any commitment by Ireland to SHIRBRIG would involve the same personnel currently committed under the UNSAS arrangement. There are currently approximately 710 military personnel serving with UN peacekeeping missions, 613 of whom are serving with UNIFIL. The total num<Col N="442" /> ber of military personnel currently serving overseas, including six personnel seconded to humanitarian relief agencies, is 754.</P>
    <P>My Department continues, as an observer at SHIRBRIG, to keep abreast of developments and the question of a deeper involvement with this initiative will be kept under review in light of the Defence Forces overseas commitments generally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 41 and 89 together.</P>
      <P>The report of the investigation carried out under the Air Navigation (Notification and Investigation of Accidents and Incidents) Regulation 1997 S.I. No. 205 of 1997 into the air accident at Dublin Port, during the Tall Ships Race, was made public by the air accident investigation unit of the Department of Public Enterprise on 19 April 1999. The report has been received in my Department and its conclusions are as follows. The injuries to the members of the Naval Service diving section were caused by the excessive forward speed of the aircraft; the following factors contributed to the accident: lack of aircrew experience, particularly commander's experience, in this type of operation; lack of planning, rehearsal and aircrew training for the demonstration; lack of laid down, agreed and approved procedures for dropping personnel from the helicopter; lack of management involvement and supervision, on the part of the Naval Service and the contractor, display pressure on participants; the failure to appoint an effective safety co-ordinator for the demonstration and the helicopter jumping techniques used by the Naval Service.</P>
      <P>Following receipt of the report, I asked the Chief of Staff to have the report's safety recommendations in so far as they pertain to the Defence Forces implemented. To this end, standard operating procedures for future operations will be drawn up, taking into account the findings and recommendations of the report. Until such time as these procedures are in place, no further exercises of this nature involving Defence Forces personnel will be undertaken.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 45 and 47 together.</P>
      <P>The Amsterdam Treaty brings within the remit of the common foreign and security policy the Petersberg Tasks of humanitarian and rescue tasks, peacekeeping and crisis management. The treaty provides that it will be for the Western European Union to carry out such tasks, at the instigation of the EU. Ireland will be entitled to participate in such tasks, and has indicated its willingness to do so on a case by case basis. Ireland considers it important that the EU should seek to ensure the effective functioning of these new provisions on peacekeeping and crisis management now that the Amsterdam Treaty has come into force.</P>
      <P>Any involvement by the Defence Forces in the Petersberg Tasks under the auspices of the Amsterdam Treaty would most likely be in the areas of peacekeeping and humanitarian tasks on a voluntary and case by case basis. It is the policy of the Government to ensure that the Defence Forces are adequately trained, equipped and resourced to undertake whatever overseas operations with which they are tasked from time to time.</P>

      <P>There were 28 apprentices at the Army Apprentice School in Devoy Barracks prior to the closure of that barracks. Of these, 18 attended the Dublin Institute of Technology, either at Bolton Street or at Kevin Street for the purpose of completing <Col N="445" /> their final &ldquo;off the job&rdquo; training module which consisted of ten weeks. These 18 Army apprentices are training as fitters, carpenters and electricians. They commenced their attendance at Dublin Institute of Technology in late January and completed it at the end of March.</P>
      <P>The remaining ten Army apprentices, who are training in electronics/commmunications, have relocated to the school of signals in the Curragh. They will now complete their technical training in the middle of the year 2001.</P>
      <P>It is envisaged that, in future, Army apprentices will attend at FÁS and/or regional technical college courses for their formal &ldquo;off the job&rdquo; training. This is already the long established situation with Naval Service apprentices. The apprenticeship needs of the Army, Naval Service and Air Corps are kept under regular review. Apprentices will continue to be recruited for specific trades and crafts, as and when required, in response to identified service needs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is currently a total of 748 military personnel serving overseas of which 710 are serving with UN missions. Late last year I agreed to the secondment of 27 personnel to the Agency for Personal Service Overseas to assist in the relief effort in Honduras following the devastation caused by Hurricane Mitch. Their work has just been completed and the last members of the group returned home last week. Four military personnel have recently been seconded to GOAL and are based in Albania and two personnel are on secondment to the Irish Refugee Agency and are based in Macedonia. These personnel are engaged in relief work relating to the Kosovar refugees in those areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position in relation to requests for personnel for overseas missions is that any such requests are considered on their merits in the prevailing circumstances within the context of the United Nations Stand-by Arrangements System. This system is intended to enhance the United Nations capacity for rapid response to emergency situations. It has been decided that the Defence Forces will participate in this system up to a maximum of 850 personnel at any one time. I signed, on behalf of Ireland, a memorandum of understanding with the UN when I visited UN headquarters New York in October 1998. There is no obligation to participate in any particular mission and Dáil approval would be required for the dispatch of a contingent to a specific operation. The decision to participate in UNSAS is a <Col N="447" /> tangible expression of Ireland's continuing commitment to involvement in peacekeeping operations. Such peacekeeping operations invariably facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid in the troubled areas.</P>
    <P>On a separate but related matter, there is at present an initiative sponsored by Denmark known as SHIRBRIG. This envisages the establishment of a high readiness multi-national brigade, composed of contributions to the UNSAS with the aim of deploying troops at short notice to troubled spots around the world. Ireland has been keeping a watching brief on this initiative. The question of participation by Ireland in SHIRBRIG will be kept under review.</P>

      <P>The Department with prime responsibility for emergency planning for nuclear accidents is the Department of Public Enterprise.</P>
      <P>My Department has a significant role in the preparation and exercise of emergency plans for nuclear accidents particularly in the years subsequent to the catastrophic destruction of a nuclear reactor in Chernobyl in 1985. As I indicated to the House on 25 February and again on 1 April this year my Department has played its full part in such planning which is carried out under the auspices of my colleague in the Department of Public Enterprise. The Government approved a national emergency plan for nuclear accidents and this was published in booklet form in 1992 under the auspices of the Department of Energy. The plan is designed to provide a rapid and effective response to accidents involving the release, or potential release, of radioactive substances into the environment which could give rise to radiation exposure. This culminated late last year in Government approval of a revised and approved format for such emergency management.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department ensures that the planning and preparations are in place to ensure an effective response. Arrangements with local authorities to have an effective Civil Defence organisation available to undertake the various duties assigned under the emergency plan are ongoing. Civil Defence personnel are trained, equipped and exercised to monitor radiation levels and to col<Col N="449" /> lect samples of soil, vegetation etc. Arrangements are in place for Army personnel to monitor radiation levels at pre-determined and other locations.</P>
    <P>In times of crisis my Department will provide such services as may be required from the permanent Defence Force and Civil Defence to assist with the implementation of counter measures. Liaison will be maintained with the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland and the emergency response co-ordinating committee at the Department of Public Enterprise to ensure provision of the appropriate support.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>On 19 June 1995, the General Affairs Council authorised the Commission to open negotiations with the Republic of South Africa with a view to concluding an agreement for trade and co-operation between South Africa and the European Community.</P>
      <P>Intensive negotiations, which continued for over four years and involved 25 negotiating rounds, were concluded on 23 March 1999. The special European Council in Berlin on 24-25 March gave its unanimous political approval to the agreement. Ireland, which had always supported the conclusion of a generous agreement with South Africa, was particularly pleased by the decision taken at the European Council.</P>
      <P>The agreement encompasses a broad range of measures aimed at the promotion of trade liberalisation between the two sides. It will establish a free trade area, in conformity with WTO rules. The agreement covers industrial and agricultural products and other trade-related issues. Provision is made for economic and development co-operation across a broad range of sectors. Co-operation in other areas, such as science and technology, environmental and social issues, are covered by the agreement.</P>
      <P>In sum, the new agreement underlines the EUs commitment to, and solidarity with the people of South Africa. The close ties that exist between South Africa and the EU in the trade, economic and other fields will be deepened and consolidated by the decision to conclude this agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The outcome of the negotiations necessarily involved compromise on both sides and the Commission, which conducted the negotiations on behalf of the EU, had to be mindful of the particular and legitimate interests of some of our EU partners. I am satisfied that the agreement constitutes a fair and balanced package, which will promote and sustain a significant increase in trade to the benefit of both South Africa and the EU. The <Col N="450" /> outcome at Berlin will be seen as a landmark in the continuing process of addressing South Africa's special needs and circumstances as its Government and people continue to tackle the inherited legacy of the apartheid era.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated in my reply to the House on 1 April 1999, the only missions for which Ireland is entitled to reimbursement of troop costs by the UN are the United Nations interim force in Lebanon, UNIFIL, and the United Nations peacekeeping force in Cyprus, UNFICYP. Troop costs in respect of these missions are calculated at the rate of US $1087.10 per person per month.</P>
      <P>On 30 April 1999 the total amount owing to my Department by the United Nations in respect of contributions towards troop and other costs associated with the participation of Defence Force personnel in UN missions was calculated at IR£8.9 million approximately.</P>
      <P>The problem of arrears owing to Ireland and to other troop contributing countries for peacekeeping costs is a result of the ongoing financial crisis which the UN has been experiencing for the last number of years, and is not due to any unwillingness on the part of the UN Secretariat to clear arrears. The financial crisis has been caused by the failure of many member states to pay their assessed contributions to the UN regular and peacekeeping budgets in full and on time. The overall problem of arrears owing to the UN has led to a situation in which the Secretary General has sought to give priority to maintaining the programmes and activities of the UN system. However, he has also acknowledged the importance of reimbursing troop-contributing countries for peacekeeping costs and reimbursement payments are made to Ireland on a phased basis as funds become available to the UN. Over the six months to date the UN repaid arrears of £4 million approximately, almost entirely in respect of UNIFIL.</P>

Important factors in this regard will be that the work is carried out to the highest standard and to the best economic advantage to the Department. <i>LE Ciara</i> is scheduled to be refurbished in 2000 and arrangements relating to the carrying out of the work will be considered in due course.</P>

The dockyard primarily provides second and third-line maintenance which complements the first-line work carried out by Naval Service technicians. Refurbishment and upgrading of the dockyard infrastructure and equipment are undertaken as and when required, the most recent project being the complete replacement of the masthouse roof at a cost of £189,000.</P>

      <P>One of the recommendations arising out of the Price Waterhouse review of the Naval Service was the need to provide a two year on-two year off rotation to sea for naval personnel. The Naval Service has recently identified a number of measures which could improve the pattern of rotation, including the introduction of new support and operations structure, branch rationalisation to allow more flexibility in rotating personnel, maximising the number of personnel within the new naval establishment who are available for seagoing duties, multi-skilling of personnel to provide more flexibility in rotations, and the maintenance of agreed personnel strengths through a policy of continuous recruitment.</P>

      <P>I propose to dispose of Devoy Barracks as soon as is practicable. Agreement in general has been reached between the Department and Naas Urban District Council with regard to local requirements. The details are currently being addressed and it is hoped to have a definitive agreement concluded in the near future. A process of rezoning is required before the property can be offered for sale on the open market. It is anticipated that this process will take a number of months. The sale of the barracks will take place when this process has been completed.</P>
      <P>No additional costs relating to personnel affected by the closure were incurred.</P>
      <P>The cost, to date, of providing security at Devoy Barracks amounts to £80,540 which has been more than offset by savings in the manning and maintenance of an unnecessary installation.</P>

    <P>Military vehicles are assessed annually on age, mileage, mechanical condition and roadworthiness. All of these factors affect the notional life of vehicles and they are disposed of and replaced, as necessary, within available resources. There is an ongoing policy of vehicle replacement based on the most economical service life of the vehicles. This year £3.4 million has been allocated for the purchase of new soft-skinned vehicles and the maintenance of existing stocks. In addition a figure of £8 million has been set aside this year for the purchase of up to 40 armoured personnel carriers over five years.</P>

      <Quest>his views on whether there is a lack of incentive for farmers to lease milk on a temporary basis to their co-op as opposed to privately leasing it in view of the fact that the stocking rate rule in relation to beef premia composed in the milk quota leased to the co-op on a temporary basis is still counted in establishing the stocking rate of that farmer; and his further views on whether the rules in this regard should be changed.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">

      <P>The rules relating to the treatment of milk quota for the purposes of calculating stocking density under the cattle premium system have not been changed under the Agenda 2000 agreement. Under these rules the milk quota is included in the calculation of the stocking density of the producer holding the quota on 1 April which is the start of the milk quota year.</P>
      <P>In the case of a land and quota lease effective from the beginning of the milk quota year, the quota would be held by the lessee and included in the calculation of his or her stocking density. It should be remembered however, that the land to which the quota attaches would also have been transferred from the lessor to the lessee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of temporary leasing, the quota, under the regulation, is in the possession of the quota owner on 1 April and, therefore, is included in the calculation of his or her stocking density. The method of dealing with temporary <Col N="458" /> leasing for the purposes of calculating stocking density has been raised by my Department with the EU Commission a number of times. However, the Commission has confirmed that this is the way temporary quota must be treated for the calculation of the stocking density and I see no prospect of changing that.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that the temporary leasing scheme has operated satisfactorily over the years and has allowed very significant quantities of quota be transferred each year to the benefit mainly of small scale producers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the EU regulation which governs the scheme of early retirement from farming the early retirement pension has to be reduced by any national retirement pension payable to the beneficiary. In a joint management application, any national retirement pension received by both the beneficiary and his or her spouse has to be deducted from the early retirement pension. A joint management situation arises where the farmer and his or her spouse both work on the farm and the spouse is regarded as managing the farm jointly with the farmer. The spouse can then apply under the scheme rather than the farmer if this is more favourable for the purposes of the early retirement pension.</P>
      <P>A joint management application is involved in this case and before the pension of the applicant can be put in payment my Department requires that her spouse must make an application to the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs for a contributory or non-contributory old age pension, as the level of early retirement pension payable will depend on the decision of that Department. The applicant has been informed of the position and the application will be approved as soon as the decision of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs is forwarded by the applicant to my Department.</P>

      <P>Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board. Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.</P>
      <P>Income guidelines have been drawn up by the chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these are revised annually in line with the consumer price index. However, these guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that his or her medical needs or other circumstances would justify this.</P>
      <P>There are a variety of arrangements in operation for the provision of home help services. Where a small amount of income is involved, health boards normally exercise their discretion as to whether this income should be taken into account in individual cases.</P>

      <P>The detailed management of the health service, including the granting of incremental credit to staff for previous experience, is a matter for each individual health agency. However, in this instance, the Southern Health Board has confirmed to my Department that the relevant national agreements are applied. In particular, temporary nurses are paid in accordance with Department of Health and Children's Circular S103/196 dated 25 November 1992, which gave effect to The Wholetime Temporary Nurses Agreement (1992), as follows: two increments may be granted with effect from 1 January 1992 to those nurses with two years full-time continuous service (or the equivalent of two years aggregate service in the preceding three years) in the health service; a further increment may be granted, if appropriate, not earlier than 1 January 1993; and a further increment may be granted, if appropriate, not earlier than 1 January 1994.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the 1997 nurses pay agreement, incremental credit was allowed up to the seventh point with effect from June 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should mention, however, that the Labour <Col N="462" /> Court recently recommended further changes to the incremental credit provisions for temporary nurses (LCR 16094). Discussions have taken place between the health services employers agency and the alliance of nursing unions on the application of this recommendation, and it is envisaged that health agencies will be advised shortly concerning new arrangements to replace the 1992 agreement.</P>

    <P>The above figures differ slightly from numbers given in response to a similar question on 5 May last. The Southern Health Board has explained that 68 beds in St. Finbarr's Hospital were recently reclassified from &ldquo;welfare&rdquo; to &ldquo;geriatric&rdquo; beds, thus increasing the number of public geriatric beds in Cork city from 373 to 441. In addition, the board states that the number of private geriatric beds in Cork county is 763 rather than 741, as previously reported; this is because one private nursing home, of 21 beds, was omitted in error from the previous return and one bed has recently been added to another nursing home.</P>

      <P>I can assure the Deputy that I have no plans to downgrade Waterford regional hospital.</P>
      <P>The banding system which the Deputy refers to relates to the categorisation of director of nursing-matron posts within five pay bands which was introduced as part of the 1997 nurses pay agreement. Waterford regional hospital is classed as Band 1 within this system.</P>
      <P>In the course of discussions on the implementation of the report of the commission on nursing which took place as recommended by the Labour Court recently (LCR 16084), the alliance of nursing unions sought a restructuring of the bands which would include Waterford regional hospital in Band 2. The management side, represented by the health services employers agency, opposed this proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Labour Court <Col N="464" /> is currently considering claims from the alliance of nursing unions arising from LCR 16084. The court met both parties on 29 and 30 April last. In view of the complexity of the issues involved, it has arranged to meet the parties again separately &ndash; the management side today and the nursing alliance next week. It would, therefore, be inappropriate for me to make any further comment at this stage.</P>

      <P>Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin, is one of three paediatric hospitals located in the Dublin area. The hospital plays a key role in the provision of specialised secondary and tertiary referral service for children.</P>
      <P>This year Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children was allocated over £35.5 million. Included in this allocation is a provision of £628,000 to meet the costs of service developments in the areas of ICU, radiology, nephrology, microbiology, infectious diseases, pathology and cystic fibrosis. Also included in the hospital's overall allocation is a sum of £95,000 to fund its waiting list activity.</P>
      <P>In addition to the above, the Deputy may be aware, I have a granted approval to the hospital to appoint a design team for the theatre development at the hospital. When completed, the new theatre development will provide five new operating theatres with ancillary accommodation, a day surgery area and a central sterile supplies department. The existing theatre facilities will be upgraded to provide a further two theatre suites. It is expected that when these theatres are fully commissioned Our Lady's Hospital will be in a position to perform an additional 100 paediatric cardiac procedures which is a 40 per cent increase on existing capacity.</P>
      <P>The estimated completion date for the development is 2002. However, the timing of the completion of planning and tendering and the commencement and completion of construction for the development will depend on several variable factors which are difficult to assess accurately in advance and it is not possible, therefore, to give a precise timetable for this project.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may also wish to note, that I have also approved the appointment of an additional consultant cardiothoracic surgeon and a consultant cardiologist to the hospital and I understand that the process of appointing suitable persons to these posts is under way.</P>

      <P>Each local authority is required under section 11 of the Housing Act, 1988, to make a scheme of letting priorities to determine the order of priority to be afforded to applicants in the lettings of dwellings provided by the authority. The making or amendment of a scheme of letting priorities is a reserved function of the elected members of the authority and is subject to ministerial approval to ensure that an adopted scheme is in accordance with statutory requirements and that all categories of need specified in section 9(2) of the 1988 Act are covered by the scheme. The order of priority of different categories of persons to be set in a scheme of letting priorities and the other detailed contents of a scheme are entirely a matter for decision by the local authority.</P>
      <P>Local authorities were advised, in guidelines issued by my Department subsequent to the passing of the 1988 Act, that it should be the aim of a scheme of letting priorities to promote equality of opportunity in getting access to local authority housing based on relative housing needs to ensure that a dwelling, if suitable, is let to the person in greatest need and to ensure that no category of needy persons is at a permanent disadvantage <i>vis à vis</i> other categories.</P>

      <P>The objective of the back to work allowance scheme is to give an incentive to long-term unemployed persons who, in the absence of the scheme, would not be in a position to take up a job. The scheme has a limited number of places and is targeted at people who need an additional incentive to return to the workforce. It is, therefore, a requirement of the scheme that an application must be made prior to taking up employment.</P>
      <P>The person concerned commenced employment on 7 January 1999. He applied for the back to work allowance on 30 March 1999, some 11 weeks after commencing employment. Accordingly, his application was refused on the grounds that his claim was late and that he was in a position to return to the workforce without the need for the financial incentive which the scheme provides. There are no circumstances in this case which would justify a revision of this decision.</P>

      <P>My Department has, since 1996, operated the scheme of community support for older people, the purpose of which is to provide funding for initiatives to improve the security and social support of vulnerable older people.

      <P>Since its inception in 1996 a total of £12.6 million has been made available for this scheme and up to the end of 1998 some 56,000 people had been assisted by the scheme. This means that since I came into office, this Government has spent £10 million on this scheme as opposed to £2 million spent by the previous Government.</P>
      <P>I am anxious to ensure that this scheme addresses the security needs of the most vulnerable people and that it provides this assistance in the most efficient and effective way possible. I am in the process of finalising the arrangements for the scheme for 1999 and I hope to be in a position to make an announcement on the matter in the near future.</P>

      <P>The issue raised by the Deputy is amongst those examined in the report entitled The Disincentive Effects of Secondary Benefits prepared by Goodbody economic consultants which was published recently.</P>
      <P>The report sets out to examine the range of issues associated with the interaction of secondary benefits, including the rent and mortgage interest supplements payable under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, and the incentive to take up employment and training opportunities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report found that only a small minority of <Col N="472" /> unemployed people &ndash; 15.5 per cent had rent-mortgage supplements. For those in receipt of it, the supplement could have a significant impact on the monetary incentive to take up work. The report noted, however, that the arrangements whereby people taking up work under the back to work allowance or revenue job assist schemes can retain secondary benefits for a number of years largely addresses the problem for these groups.</P>
    <P>Following the publication of the report, and in line with a commitment contained in the Partnership 2000 agreement, my Department has initiated discussions with the social partners with a view to devising cost-effective solutions to the employment trap associated with the withdrawal of the rent and mortgage interest supplements. The issues involved are not straightforward, and account must be taken for instance of such matters as the need to ensure equity within the SWA scheme; the impacts of the existing arrangements whereby long-term unemployed people may, subject to certain limitations, retain entitlements; the absence of any similar arrangements for people wishing to avail of FÁS training schemes; and the need to ensure that any proposals emerging from the discussions do not give rise to employment or poverty traps elsewhere within the system.</P>
    <P>It is intended that these discussions will proceed quickly so that any proposals emerging can then be considered in the context of the next budget.</P>

      <P>Pensions and other long-term social welfare payments have traditionally been paid by pension order book at post offices. Short-term payments such as disability benefit are generally paid by cheque or, in the case of unemployment payments up to recent times, in cash at the Department's offices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unemployment payments are now generally paid at post offices through the use of a social services card. Certain long duration disability benefit payments were transferred in 1992 from payment by cheque to payment by payable order book at post offices. These payments are cur<Col N="473" /> rently being transferred back to the standard disability payment arrangement. Because of concerns expressed, these cases are being offered the option of continuing to be paid at the post office if this is their wish.</P>
    <P>It has been the policy for many years to extend the range of choice of payment methods available to social welfare customers.</P>
    <P>My policy in relation to access to social welfare payments is to provide for my Department's customers a modern, cost-effective, flexible and convenient payments delivery service which takes account of customer preferences and the changes taking place in the area of payment systems generally. In this context, quality of service and convenient access to payments have always been, and will continue to be, indispensable features of my Department's payments delivery systems.</P>
    <P>I recognise and value the central role which post offices have played over many years and continue to play in providing a service to my Department's customers. I believe that An Post is well positioned to continue providing this service into the future. The Government is committed to maintaining the network of post offices, as stated by my colleague, the Minister for Public Enterprise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am assuming from the Deputy's question that a community polic force under the control of the Garda Síochána would be along the idea of a reserve police force.</P>
      <P>The question of the establishment of such a force has been considered from time to time. However, it is not clear that any possible advantage arising from the establishment of such a force would outweigh potential difficulties which arise from it. For example, one would have to be concerned with the rights of individuals faced with a new law enforcement group who would initially lack the expertise and training of full-time police.</P>
      <P>A reserve police force would also cost money and, given the potential difficulties and the problems of acceptability of such a force, I am in no doubt that the money would be better spent in providing increased capacity for the Garda Síochána. This can be achieved through the recruitment of additional gardaí and by increased civilianisation, thereby maximising the number of gardaí who can be released to operational duties. It is in line with this belief that the Government is committed to incresing the strength of the Garda Síochána to 12,000 members by 2002.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has always been the policy of this Department and the Garda authorities to encourage all <Col N="476" /> law abiding citizens to assist the gardaí in law enforcement. This policy is being implemented by the concept of community policing in the urban context where we have the community alert and neighbourhood watch schemes and various other community based voluntary initiatives. Neighbourhood Watch has been in operation in Ireland since 1985. There are currently over 2,600 schemes countrywide, covering over 410,000 homes. The schemes provide a sound basis for a partnership between the gardaí and the community, the aim of which is to prevent crime.</P>
    <P>Community Alert is a community based initiative which aims to improve the life and security of people who are vulnerable, especially the elderly. It is often seen as a rural version of Neighbourhood Watch although it has, in fact, a far wider brief. The scheme is organised by Muintir na Tíre, a voluntary self-help body active in rural areas. The Community Alert network throughout the country comprises over 1,100 committees, and employs five development officers. As you may be aware, I allocated a grant of £80,000 to Muintir na Tíre in December 1998 to partly fund the cost of employing the development officers who organise the running of the Community Alert programme nationwide.</P>
    <P>I am not convinced that a reserve police force is currently needed and I intend to commit the resources that we have in strengthening the Garda Síochána and in continuing our existing community policing initiatives.</P>
