      <P>Yesterday the Taoiseach agreed that the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, would come into the House for a 20 minute question and answer session about the resignation from the Telecom Éireann board. Because of the suspension of the House yesterday, the Postal and Telecommunications Services (Amendment) Bill, 1998, was not taken and it will not be taken until next week because of a problem with the Minister. Will the Tánaiste ensure that the matter, for which we probably need more time now due to the second resignation, will be taken tomorrow rather than next week? All I want is a commitment on that and then we will agree the business.</P>

The arrangement which was made in respect of the time provided yesterday would have been appropriate had it been possible to deal with the matter then but it was not. I suggest, in support of the points made by the Deputy of the Fine Gael Party, that this matter needs to be addressed sometime this week rather than next week, that it should be taken tomorrow subject to agreement by the Whips.</P>

      <P>Will the Tánaiste tell the House what were the nature of the discussions she and the Taoiseach had with the Prime Minister of Russia? What advice did the Government give to the Prime Minister in relation to NATO strikes? I must ask this now because I do not know whether you will allow a Private Notice Question, a Cheann Comhairle, and if the time goes now, we will not be able to get information on this matter. I understand the Taoiseach also had discussions on this matter with President Clinton when he was in Washington last week. It would be useful for the House to know what exactly the Government said to the Prime Minister of Russia in relation to potential NATO strikes which might take place tonight.</P>

A serious situation is evolving where NATO is planning to carry out bombing operations tonight. There is no UN mandate for this action. Ireland is committed to the pacific settlement of international disputes. It is important that we make our voice heard both at European and UN levels. Will the Tánaiste indicate the actions which are being taken by the Government today to make its voice heard on this matter?</P>

We are clearly entering a very dangerous situation and, while not usurping the role of Ceann Comhairle, I am sure that later in the day you may allow questions on this matter. The aggression by Serbia against the Kosovar Albanian population cannot be allowed to continue. It is regrettable that this has not been stopped through negotiation and diplomacy. This has always been and remains the Government's position. The Taoiseach will reiterate it at the Heads of Government meeting.

      <P>The confusion has arisen because some people referred to the juvenile justice Bill and others to the children Bill. There is one Bill. It will be substantially different from the Bill published by the last Government. As the Taoiseach said, there will be between 240 and 250 amendments. That being the case, it is likely the Government will agree to a new Bill rather than amend a Bill on that scale. However, the decision has not been formalised.</P>

      <P>In page 3, to delete lines 34 to 37.</P>
      <P Just="Right">&ndash;(Deputy Noonan).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mr. M. Higgins: The effect of the amendment, which deals with ESAF, would be that the Bretton Woods legislation, as proposed, would proceed without these explicit references to ESAF. I have used the time since the debate adjourned to check again with a number of agencies and institutes on what has been claimed on behalf of the restructured facility being suggested. To put it bluntly, the evidence is not there that the facility being proposed to be assisted in this legislation has acceptability in a reasonable range of countries affected. There is a clear message in the evidence from NGOs, aid agencies and experts &ndash; the cost of accepting a facility like this is paid in terms of reduction in health care, education, nutrition and other vital needs.</P>
    <P>The feedback from the people upon whom the new facility will be foisted is that it simply is not working. Curiously, the people working with <Col N="851" /> communities and groups at risk in the states for which success is being claimed, in both the African and Latin American continents, have said that while our Government sometimes has been forced to accede to the delivery of this instrument by an agency that found it necessary to review its own procedures in relation to developing the facility, it has not been welcomed by the people.</P>
    <P>I will return to the point I originally made without rehearsing the general arguments again. This is our last chance to take on an inappropriate instrument about which questions were raised even by those advancing it &ndash; they had an internal and external review which were both critical &ndash; one which is usually negotiated on an inter-agency basis between governments, which has been almost universally criticised in terms of its impact on the communities involved. It is entirely out of character with the instruments being used by the other more appropriate international agencies, yet we are being asked to leave this wording in the Bill at the same time as there are proportionate cuts on forms of bilateral and emergency aid. What is the basis for this disgraceful enthusiasm for a suspect measure that is rejected by those towards whom it is directed? The NGOs and all those involved in the debt and aid coalition have been unanimous about this as were backbench Deputies on previous Stages of the Bill. Deputy Roche made an eloquent speech to the effect that he could find nothing wrong with what was being said from this side of the House. An enormous loss of face is not required. The suggestion that we include this measure came from a Government Department, was opposed politically by another Government Department and was dropped. It should be dropped again.</P>
    <P>I speak from experience. Trócaire held a conference recently which brought together international experts from the different countries involved who evaluated different measures that might deliver aid to various countries. The recommendation from that conference is unanimous. The reason I oppose this tooth and nail is the uncompromising attitude we are experiencing in this case. There is a suggestion that those interested in the economics of development or aid are somehow softer than real economists who are able to talk about inter-bank and inter-finance department relationships. That is the reason we have had so many bad experiences in the southern hemisphere and unemployment in the northern hemisphere. There is an inability to make an integration between the life needs of people, expressed through the minimum amount of gross domestic product that can ever be used in relation to the other big issue, debt repayment or whatever.</P>
    <P>Let us be honest about this matter. Are we telling people who need clean water, food and education that they must first restructure their economies on the Chicago model before they can feed, educate or clothe their people? This is not just a disintegrated and miserable view of an <Col N="852" /> economic relationship, it is close to being immoral.</P>
    <P>I am not making the argument on moral grounds only or on the basis of the evidence that has been provided by the practitioners on the ground. I am making the case in the absence of a more thorough debate which we need on the integration of the aid, debt and development questions and on all the evidence from one international source after another. We cannot nod the Bill through the House because it is flawed on all the bases I mentioned. The widespread support for deleting these sections from the legislation, not only from this side of the House, has been encouraging. Many Members on the Government benches do not have a single argument to put forward against what we are saying. The Independents, who claim to be so precious that they cannot contaminate themselves by joining a political party, have heard the arguments also. I wonder what Deputy Healy-Rae, Deputy Fox and others would do if they had to make a choice which involved the development of Wicklow, Kerry or Donegal. If they support the Government on this occasion they are doing so in the full knowledge that a case has been made for which they have no answer.</P>
    <P>We oppose the persistent, obdurate inclusion of these sections against which such a powerful case has been made and we will vote against it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>We oppose the policy which underpins the sections. We do not want the ESAF programmes included or that section to go through. In that context, when it is the policy and politics of the Bill which we oppose, it is deplorable that there is no political representative of the Department of Finance in the House to take this debate. This is the second time in recent weeks that the Minister for Finance and the Minister of State at that Department have been guilty of dereliction of duty. They failed to turn up for the reply to Second Stage of the Finance Bill and have failed to turn up today. I know where the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, is, and he should be here. We do not know where the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Cullen, is, but if the Opposition goes to the trouble to which we have gone in opposing the politics which underpins these sections, then we should be informed that the Ministers are not available on a specific day and should be given the option of taking Report Stage when they are available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not a criticism of the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Treacy, who has been asked to do a job as part of an Administration. It is, however, unfair to us because we are arguing the politics and policy of a situation but the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, will not report back to the Department and Cabinet on this legislation. My party will refuse to co-operate with the Department of Finance and the Minister for Finance in future unless it gets assurances that the <Col N="853" /> Ministers responsible for policy will contribute to and take part in debates, take responsibility and take the legislation for which they are responsible.</P>

      <P>I sincerely regret that my colleagues cannot be here but as two of the three Deputies in the House have served in Cabinet, they will understand the pressures on Ministers. The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, is at a very important meeting with the Taoiseach where the future of the country is at stake <i>vis-à-vis</i> additionality of resources required over the next few years. The Minister of State, Deputy Cullen, is out of the country on other Government business.</P>

      <P>All I know is that I was asked to take this legislation as I have been many times in the past. The House has ordered the legislation and I am here to discharge the collective responsibility of the Government. I regret my colleagues are not here and I am sure the House understands. I fully appreciate the sincerity of the contributions made on Second and Committee Stages and today on Report Stage. Sincere contributions have been made on a very compassionate basis, which I understand.</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 1, 2, 4 and 5 have as their objective the deletion of all references to the ESAF trust. Similar amendments were put down on Committee Stage and were rejected. Their resubmission allows me the opportunity to place on the record a number of key points in relation to the enhanced structural adjustment facility. On Committee Stage, Deputy McDowell rightly asked what progress had been made since the publication of the international and external evaluations of ESAF. Progress has been made under a number of headings specifically identified as areas of concern. On programme of ownership, IMF staff are, in individual programme cases, giving greater consideration to alternative policy measures which could attain the desired economic objectives. IMF staff are also continuing and intensifying their efforts when requested by the national authorities to help build up a consensus for reform.</P>
      <P>On collaboration with the World Bank, work is on the way in six pilot cases in Cameroon, Ethiopia, Nicaragua, Tajikistan, Vietnam and Zimbabwe in which the staffs of the World Bank and the IMF are experimenting with new modes of collaboration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>On the social impact of adjustment, work is now under way to develop <i>ex ante</i> social assessments of specific adjustment policies <Col N="854" /> and integrate the findings into programme design, including the design of well targeted social safety nets. The IMF is now demonstrating that it is willing to listen and examine its own actions and policies. I refer to its response to the evaluation of the ESAF programmes in its own review of its policies in relation to the Asian crisis and its support for the review of the highly indebted poorer countries initiative.</P>
      <P>Deputy McDowell welcomed Chancellor Schröder's debt initiative which is virtually the same as what we propose. I draw the attention of the House to the fact that it calls for adequate funding for both the ESAF and the HIPC initiative, particularly in relation to bilateral contributions. I also remind the House that we are instituting, through this Bill, accountability, openness and transparency provisions relating to Ireland's participation in the Bretton Woods institutions. I hope we can work together to improve the position of the poorest and most heavily indebted countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>A couple of points arise from the Minister of State's contribution. The external evaluation of the ESAF structural adjustment fund was only produced last year. It is clearly far too early to judge whether we should take it seriously or, more to the point, whether we should take seriously the stated intention of the IMF to take on board the recommendations made. With many others, I am deeply sceptical of the ability or the willingness of the IMF to do that. As an institution, it has a way of doing things, an ethos, which seems to run quite contrary to many of the recommendations made in the external review. I would be pleasantly but very surprised if in two or three years' time we could look at the implementation of that review and the recommendations and say they have been largely implemented.</P>
      <P>I am amazed the Minister of State feels comfortable coming in here today a matter of months after those recommendations were made to say that he is satisfied they are being put in place. There is a particular responsibility on the Government and the Minister in looking at what has happened over the past three or four years, at Ireland's history in relation to this matter and at our specific policy decisions several years ago as regards ESAF to say one of several things but, ideally, all of them. If the Minister could come in here and say this is the best possible way to give assistance in terms of debt relief to the Third World, it would be fine but it clearly is not. Part of the Government's initiative which I fully applaud is direct bilateral assistance or a direct grant to Mozambique. That is fine, and we all support that. It is clearly the most effective way and the way over which we have most control to do this. Why back that up with a contribution to a fund about which we all have doubts and over which we have effectively no control? I do not see the logic behind that and the Minister has failed utterly to justify it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="855" /> Since this is the primary point of Report Stage, I hope the Acting Chairman will indulge me. This is one of those occasions &ndash;  thankfully, there are few but it is by no means unprecedented &ndash; where this House will pass a Bill which clearly does not have its support. It is clear the majority of those on the Government side who take an interest in these matters do not support this important element of the Bill. There is an onus on the Minister in those circumstances to stand it up and, I respectfully submit, he has not done that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret very much that the Minister for Finance is not present, and I am not being churlish about the presence of the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, or the absence of the Finance Ministers. It is quite clear a majority of the House has serious doubts about the ESAF programmes. If there was a free vote this morning, I have no doubt that references to ESAF would be removed from the Bill. We are being denied the opportunity to convince the political head of the Department of Finance of the rightness of our case and that of the majority of the House. While the Minister of State is always welcome, all he can do, in effect, is read out briefing notes prepared by his officials. In effect, he will neither now nor later have a policy input into this decision. We are going through an empty formula and wasting our sweetness on the desert air because there is no way the Minister of State has been authorised by the Minister for Finance to concede to any of the Report Stage amendments.</P>
      <P>In a normal good Report Stage, a Minister for Finance would stand up and take into account what we have said and would be prepared to make concessions, but that is not happening this morning.</P>
      <P>Our problem with the ESAF programmes is simple and the criticism is very profound. We believe that the IMF imposes macroeconomics recipes that are too rigorous on countries with difficulties. The prescriptions of the IMF push rigour to the point where the basic human rights of the ordinary population are denied. In circumstances where, as a result of the rigour of the medicine, infant mortality is rising, life expectancy is falling and basic education is denied, the programmes are not only ineffective but morally wrong and no self-respecting parliament should waltz them through simply on the authorisation of Government Whips. That is the key issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance informed us on previous Stages that we were lagging behind. He told us other members states have signed up to this and we were out of step. There was some merit in his arguments two or three years ago, but there is little or no merit in them now. An Irish Government, through its tardiness of action, is moving to take up policy positions that have been abandoned elsewhere. It is not the case that we are out of step, but rather that if we sign up to this we will be out of step once more. The positions advocated by the Minister of State and by the <Col N="856" /> people he represents have been abandoned by the great and powerful countries, which make far more serious contributions than we do to overseas development aid and debt reduction.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the remarks made by President Clinton last Tuesday in Washington to the Conference on US-Africa Partnership for the 21st Century. His remarks highlight the current policy of the United States. After his preliminary remarks about the importance of Africa in the world of American-Afro relationships, he went on to say:</P>
    <P>There's another crucial way the United States can hasten Africa's integration. One of the most serious issues we must deal with together, and one of truly global importance is debt relief. Today, I ask the international community to take actions which could result in forgiving $70 billion in global debt relief &ndash; global debt. Our goal is to ensure that no country committed to fundamental reform is left with a debt burden that keeps it from meeting its people's basic human needs and spurring growth.</P>
    <P>That is now the American position. What we are legislating for here is contrary to the policy enunciated by the United States.</P>
    <P>President Clinton went on to say that we should provide extraordinary relief for countries making extraordinary efforts to build working economies. His remarks were greeted with a standing ovation by the representatives of the 46 African nations present.</P>
    <P>He also stated:</P>
    <P>To achieve this goal, in consultation with our Congress and within the framework of our balanced budget, I proposed that we make significant improvements to the heavily-indebted Poor Countries Initiative at the Cologne Summit of the G-7 in June. First, a new focus on early relief by international financial institutions, which now reduce debt only at the end of the HPIC program.</P>
    <P>That is in line with what I said. There must be early relief that is not dependent on the implementation of the macroeconomic recipe. President Clinton advocated relief before the HIPC programme is implemented, not at the end of it.</P>
    <P>He also said:</P>
    <P>Combined with ongoing forgiveness of cash flows by the Paris Club, this will substantially accelerate relief from debt payment burden.</P>
    <P>Second, the complete forgiveness of all bilateral concessional loans to the poorest countries.</P>
    <P>Third, deeper and broader reduction of other bilateral debts, raising the amount to 90 per cent. Fourth, to avoid recurring debt problems, donor countries should commit to provide at least 90 per cent of new development assistance on a grant basis to countries eligible for debt reduction.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="857" /> Fifth, new approaches to help countries emerging from conflicts that have not had the chance to establish reform records, and need immediate relief and concessional finance. And, sixth, support for gold sales by the IMF to do its part .</P>
    <P>All the briefing we got from the NGOs advocated that the IMF would do more, that it would sell some of its gold reserves for debt relief, but the Minister's response to that was merely to sneer at us. He compared me to the editor of the <i>Skibbereen Eagle</i> , as if our debates here are irrelevant. His response was to the effect that we should keep an eye on the Tzar of Russia, know our place in Opposition, sit down and be good and listen to the dictates of the people in the Department of Finance who know better.</P>
    <P>The President of the United States told the IMF to sell its gold reserves to enable it to make additional contributions. He also said funds and additional contributions by us and other countries to the World Bank's trust fund were needed to help meet the cost of this initiative.</P>
    <P>He said:</P>
    <P>Finally, we should be prepared to provide even greater relief in exceptional cases where it could make a real difference.</P>
    <P>What I am proposing is debt reduction that is deeper and faster. It is demanding, but to put it simply, the more debtor nations take responsibility for pursuing sound economic policies, the more creditor nations must be willing to provide debt relief.</P>
    <P>He put the case more succinctly than the Oppo<Col N="858" /> sition that the rigorous prescriptions in ESAF programmes are preventing democratic African countries, in particular, from fulfilling their humanitarian obligations to their people. That is wrong and President Clinton agrees with that.</P>
    <P>HIPC programmes should provide for relief upfront where it is clear that a reform process will be undertaken. There is no point applying another rigorous macroecnomic prescription to a country ravaged by war where the infrastructure has been devastated and the means of production are not longer operating. In those circumstances relief must be given before restructuring recipes are put in place. In many cases grants rather than loans should be paid and the IMF should fund more from its resources and, in particular, it should use its gold reserves.</P>
    <P>We did not get a reasonable response from the Minister for Finance to the arguments we put forward and neither have we got a reasonable response from the briefing notes supplied to the Minister of State. Opinion elsewhere during the past few months has moved to the position taken by the Opposition. It is not the Opposition but the Minister and the Administration who are out of line. The Opposition is not lagging behind international policy positions. The Government is lagging behind them and that is clear from President Clinton's speech to which I referred. If we have to stay here and vote on this Bill on several occasions, we will do that. What the Minister of State is doing is shabby. It is ill-considered, unfair and undemocratic and we will oppose him every inch of way.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 4, line 37, to delete &ldquo;a payment or payments&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;such payment or payments as the Government decides&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>These amendments deal with financial control and approved mechanisms. With respect to amendment No. 3, the Minister promised Deputy Noonan that he would table an amendment to make payments made by the Minister to the HIPC trust under section 4(2) subject to Government approval. The amendment will bring the subsection into line with the provisions of other subsections in section 4. This is essentially a tidying up amendment and we are grateful to the Deputy for bringing this to our attention.</P>
      <P>With respect to amendment No. 7, the Minister promised Deputies Noonan and McDowell that he would table an amendment of this nature. Both Deputies were anxious that further provisions with regard to accountability to the Dáil would be inserted in the Bill in respect of further Irish contributions for debt relief purposes. Both Deputies suggested a formula which would necessitate the Minister for Finance informing the Dáil of his intention to make full repayments under sections 4 and 6. The Minister indicated his willingness to accommodate the concerns of the Deputies and the House by tabling an amendment on Report Stage.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 6 is a similar amendment, which was already discussed on Committee Stage. The Minister's amendments deal with the issues of control, accountability and aggregation in a fair, reasonable and transparent manner. I hope, therefore, the Deputies will be reassured and agree to our amendments.</P>

      <P>We should welcome the fact that the Minister has gone some distance towards meeting our concerns but I wish he had gone further. The purpose of my original amendment was to restrict the capacity of Government to contribute willy nilly incrementally to a fund and given that Government said it wants to see progress in a particular direction and set out a policy statement last September with the NGOs, it was felt appropriate that the Government should provide a progress report and justify every continuing contribution when it wanted to make additional contributions. However, I acknowledge that the Minister has gone some distance to meet that.</P>

    <P>This amendment puts a time limit of 31 March on the submission of the proposed annual report in respect of Ireland's participation in both the bank and the fund. Deputies Noonan and McDowell have stressed the importance of the timely submission of the annual report to the Oireachtas. The amendment is designed to meet the Deputies' concerns in this respect.

      <P>I welcome this amendment. We argued for a more definite form of words than &ldquo;as soon as may be after the end of each year&rdquo; for the reporting mechanisms to the Houses of the Oireachtas.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a good precedent to pin down the period of time within which the annual report should be submitted. I refer to the debate on Committee Stage when the Minister agreed that the previous Irish representative would make a presentation to the Committee on Finance and the Public Service and share his experiences and thoughts with it. It would be useful it he would do so in the near future. It is remarkable but hardly surprising that it is more than 20 years since Ireland's participation in the IMF and that what we do there and how we participate is debated in the House at all. That is hardly likely to change with the presentation of a simple report or by laying it in the Library. It would be useful if we were to hear from Mr. O'Loughlin, the previous representative at the IMF, at the earliest opportunity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is agreed that such a presentation will be made as soon as a request is received from the chairman of the committee.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 9 could be regarded as consequential on amendment No. 8 and seeks to bring the statement which the Minister for Finance is required to bring before each House of the Oireachtas under section 8 guaranteeing by the Minister the participation by the Central Bank in the substitution agreement within the time limit of 31 March each year. This is essentially a tidying up exercise and will allow Members of the Oireachtas to have a timely and up to date report on all aspects and activities under this Bill, which will subsequently become law.</P>

      <P>I regret that the ESAF sections of this Bill are being forced through under the whipping system in the House. It is quite clear from the debate that the majority of Members are opposed to these sections. It is a travesty of parliamentary democracy that this should happen. I regret that the Minister for Finance has not taken a stronger interest in this Bill. He dealt with it as minor legislation scarcely worthy of his attention and concern. That is not good enough when we are dealing with matters of such import. The normal compliments that would be passed on Fifth Stage are being withheld as I am very unhappy with the way the Bill was handled. A bad day's work has been done.</P>

      <P>This is a bad day's work. Unfortunately the inclusion of a contribution towards ESAF sullies what is otherwise a good Bill. We are now developing a further element to <Col N="864" /> our development aid strategy and involving ourselves in debt relief. That is good but unfortunately we are taking away from it by choosing to use the ESAF structure as one of the means of contributing. I agree with Deputy Noonan that the way in which this debate has occurred and the decision that has been taken reflects very badly on our democracy. I do not know whether the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, has a particular ideological bent which inclines him to support ESAF or whether he just did not care and allowed the decision to be taken by his officials. Either way we have ended up with a decision and legislation that this House does not support.</P>

      <P>This is an important Bill and it would be unfair of any Member to generalise. While Deputies have views on particular aspects of it, this is a positive decision by the Government for the first time to transfer huge amounts of money to third world countries that need it. Members can be certain the Minister for Finance is a strong personality. He has represented Ireland with distinction at the IMF. He fought a very strong case on behalf of third world developing countries and laid down the clear parameters Ireland expects for participation therein. The compassion, humanity and commitment of Ireland is reflected by him. While there are certain aspects people may have difficulties with, at the end of the day it is a positive decision by Ireland to help those in need.</P>

      <P>Before proceeding to Report Stage I wish to reiterate the serious concerns in relation to the admissibility of certain amendments to the Bill which have been conveyed to members of the Select Committee on Family, Community and Social Affairs during the consideration of Committee Stage of the Bill. The amendments in question require the Minister to prepare and lay before Dáil Éireann a report on the implications of changing various social welfare schemes. If these amendments did not include the report mechanism, they would be clearly out of order as imposing a charge on Revenue. The allowance of amendments of this kind will have to be reviewed in the future and I understand that the matter has been raised with the Government Chief Whip so that the issues involved can be examined by the Sub-Committee on Dáil Reform with a view to having Standing Orders amended to prevent this practice.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Deputy will reserve his arguments and allow his party's representatives to put them before the Sub-Committee on Dáil Reform which will examine the matter.

      <P>I wish to echo the comments of Deputy O'Keeffe. We understand the difficulties inherent in the discussion given that many decisions relate to the budget and are financial in nature. However, the Minister has independently made decisions since the budget which have a financial impact and which the Houses should discuss. The most disturbing aspect of the ruling, based on the legal advice received by the Labour Party, is the claim that we are seeking to create a precedent this year in relation to such motions. The Labour Party is frankly not prepared to accept this.</P>

      <P>In page 5, line 14, after &ldquo;one&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and may be cited together as the Social Welfare Acts, 1993 to 1999&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We see no reason why the Social Welfare Act and the Finance Act are not named cumulatively over a number of years. This seems to be the only legislation where this does not occur. The Minister gave an extensive briefing on the matter on Committee Stage and I am prepared to accept that for the moment.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 5, between lines 14 and 15, to insert the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(3) The Minister shall as soon as may be after the passing of this Act prepare and lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report on the rationale for the differing com<Col N="868" /> mencement dates of social welfare and tax aspects of the annual budget.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment relates to the core issue in the Social Welfare Bill, namely, the timing of increases. The fundamental point we made on Second and Committee Stages was that it is totally unacceptable that the majority of the population receives pay increases in terms of changes in taxation on 6 April while one third of the population, a very significant minority for whom we are totally responsible in terms of income, have to wait months before receiving increases. The situation is worst in relation to increases in child benefit which were announced in December 1998 but which will not come into effect until September 1999, a time lapse of almost a year. Under section 6, 1 September is the date from which the increased benefit will be paid. Later we will refer to our desire for proper increases in child benefit, but our concern here is the very inappropriate timing. Section 4 states that increases in unemployment benefit will be paid from 27 May, increases in disability, health and safety and injury benefits and the disablement gratuity from 31 May, increases in retirement and invalidity pensions from 3 June and increases in the disablement pension and death benefit from 4 June. Section 5 states that increases in unemployment assistance will be paid from 26 May, increases in supplementary welfare allowance from 31 May, increases in the disability allowance from 2 June, increases in the pre-retirement allowance, the one-parent family payment and the carer's allowance from 3 June and increases in the old age &ndash; non-contributory &ndash; blind, widow's and widower's &ndash; non-contributory &ndash; pensions and the one-parent family payment from 4 June.</P>
    <P>The reason for tabling the amendment is the Minister is not prepared to make plans during his stewardship of the Department to bring increases in social welfare rates into line with taxation changes. He told us in reply to a question that the cost of the social insurance and assistance elements would amount to £350 million. However, this should be compared with an overall budget of £5.5 billion, so he could synchronise the increases in payments. All politicians have experienced this as a gripe which repeatedly arises.</P>
    <P>The previous two Governments, especially the rainbow Government, attempted to synchronise payment increases with changes in taxation. However, it did not succeed, which means people dependent on social welfare are treated differently from the other two thirds of the population. The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, said before Christmas it was his ambition to bring all taxation changes onto a calendar year basis over the next two to three years, if the Government survived. If that is the case, people in receipt of social welfare will be even more disadvantaged.</P>
    <P>This matter relates to the issue of income adequacy. Despite low levels of inflation, there have been increases in food, clothing and hous<Col N="869" /> ing, especially in rent, so it is particularly cruel that the Government is not prepared to synchronise social welfare payments with taxation changes so that all sectors of the population are treated similarly. I referred in previous discussions to Fr. Healy and others in CORI who have argued for a basic income for all the population. One small step towards that would be to synchronise all social welfare payments with taxation changes. I urge the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to support the amendment. The House should, I hope by all-party agreement, aim towards this worthy and laudable objective. The Minister is not being asked to synchronise the increase in payments this year but to prepare a report on the issue. We should all agree it is a worthy objective to synchronise the date of payment of social welfare increases with the beginning of the tax year initially and ultimately to have both coinciding with the calendar year. That should be the objective. I am sure if the Minister were on this side of the House he would agree with that, so I can see no reason he cannot at least agree with the objective in his current position.</P>
      <P>What really highlights how ridiculous is the current situation is child benefit. We have been told there will be a magnificent increase of £3 per month for our children. However, it will not come into operation until September this year. Effectively it is a total of £12 for the year. That shows how ridiculous is the current situation. The £3 per month increase is small enough, but to confine it to the last few months of the year makes it ludicrous.</P>
      <P>It is a worthy objective to aim towards the synchronisation of the increases in payments. They should all be brought forward initially to the commencement of the tax year, and ultimately the year for both systems should be brought forward to coincide with the calendar year. I anticipate the Minister will be defensive and tell us about all the good things he is doing, such as bringing forward payments by a couple of weeks. That indicates the Minister agrees with the objective, but he would have to accept there is a long way to go. We are aiming for an acceptance of this as a worthy objective. We do not expect it to be attained immediately, but we should try to progress towards it. For that reason, I support the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment was tabled on Committee Stage and I gave my views on it on that occasion. Deputy O'Keeffe used the phrase &ldquo;worthy objective&rdquo; and that is the case. It would be a worthy objective and has been for all political parties, be they on this side or the other side of the House. However, the Government has paid the increases given at budget time for 31 weeks of the year as opposed to only 29 weeks during the previous Government of which Deputies O'Keeffe and Broughan were members. The much more substantial increases given by the cur<Col N="870" /> rent Government in the past two budgets, which are considerably in excess of those given by the rainbow coalition, are given for a longer period over the year than was the case during the rainbow coalition's time. I make that point in case anyone thinks that the Government is being niggardly because that is not the case.</P>
      <P>When a Minister is faced with a budget package amount, he or she must decide on the priorities. The Government decided it would give priority as much as possible to those over 65 or 66 as appropriate. It gave them an increase of £5 in its first year and £6 in its second year, which is considerably more than the rate of inflation, four times in one case, and far ahead of any increase in previous years. They are the largest increases given to old age pensioners for a long time. Deputies will say there is plenty of money in the coffers, but the Government has the difficult job of not only ensuring financial constraint to provide for the rainy days but also of giving as much as it can in current circumstances.</P>
      <P>The Government is examining the possibility of bringing increases in social welfare payments and taxation changes into line with the calendar year, which is our express wish. However, there are implications involved. If social welfare payments were brought forward to 1 January, that would cost in the region of £80 million plus in a year, apart from any increases. That would have to come from the financial package amount made available to the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs at the time, and that might restrict the money available for increases. I have always said that I would prefer to give an old age pensioner £6 later in the year than a smaller sum earlier in the year.</P>
      <P>In its first budget, the Government brought forward the payment dates by two weeks, at a cost of £8 million. It would cost in the region of £32 million to bring them forward to 6 April. This would have to be met from the overall social welfare package. While the amendment is worthy and laudable, the Government will do what it can.</P>
      <P>Deputy Broughan said that the increases will be paid on different dates. The general increases will be paid in the same week. For logistical reasons, the payment dates differ; the increases will apply from the normal payment day. For the reasons given, therefore, I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
      <P>Much of what is in the Bill is dictated by the budget announced in December which made provision for an overall social welfare package of £305 million &ndash; £177. 5 million in 1999. Since then additional measures, which I would like to think Deputy Broughan will support, have been taken. An additional £5 million will be made available for the farm assist scheme while an additional £500,000 &ndash; £1 million in a full year &ndash; will be made available to assist low-income fishermen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The initial allocation for the bereavement grants scheme, which was due to be introduced on 6 April, was £7.5 million &ndash; £10 million in a <Col N="871" /> full year. Following representations, mainly at meetings of the Fianna Fail parliamentary party, the changes came into effect from 2 February, the date of the Government announcement, at an additional cost of £1.7 million.</P>
    <P>A sum of £750,000 &ndash; £1 million in a full year &ndash; will be allocated for over 56 pensions. As a result of these changes, the overall social welfare package comes to £317.5 million &ndash; £192.95 million in 1999. This is by far the largest social welfare package in the history of the State. I am delighted to be a member of the Government which introduced it. It will do more before it leaves office.</P>

      <P>When will we have another year like last year or this one? According to <i>The Economist</i> yearbook, this is the forty-third or forty-fourth wealthiest country in the world. Ireland is in the top 20 when it comes to income per head and accounts for 1 per cent of world trade. We have overtaken the United Kingdom.</P>
      <P>We have heard all the clichés about the tiger economy and the tiger cubs, of which there are between 400,000 and 500,000 totally reliant on the income the Minister provides. In a niggardly way, the Minister for Finance &ndash; the iron chancellor &ndash; has determined, as he did when Minister for Social Welfare, that the increases will be paid on the dates decided by him. He banked £1 billion before Christmas and will attempt to bank hundreds of millions more this year. He is not prepared, in an attempt to be socially inclusive, to use some of this largesse to pay the increases from the same date, possibly early January.</P>
      <P>We do not know what will happen in 2002 following the introduction of the euro. The Minister should assert himself and demand the extra funds required for the forgotten people. His colleague from the north side of Dublin and every Fianna Fáil backbencher would echo my sentiments. All he has to do is present a report.</P>

      <P>A reasonable case has been made by Deputy Broughan about the commencement date for payment. The Minister has accepted that it is a worthy objective, that we should aim towards bringing forward the date for the payment of increases because it seems unfair that the weakest section of the community should have to wait longest for their annual increases. If we agree that is a worthy objective and use our best endeavours to achieve that, then something might be achieved from this amendment.</P>

      <P>In our first budget we brought them back by two weeks and the intention is to continue on that path. It is not at the instigation of Deputy O'Keeffe or anyone else. It is the general view of all Deputies in this House to bring back the payment dates to when the tax changes are made. There will be added difficulty from a financial point of view if the Government decides that the tax changes should be brought back to the calendar year, as suggested by a number of people in this House. In a particular year and in successive years that will place a substantial additional burden on the social welfare budget, but it is the right thing to do and we should aim for it. Given the opportunity that we will have in Government in coming years, we will do that.</P>
      <P>As I said earlier, I, as Minister, am delighted to have introduced measures such as the bereavement grant. Deputy O'Keeffe may criticise Deputy Callely for complimenting the Minister, but it was a good decision.

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 5, between lines 14 and 15, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;2.&ndash;Not less than every 3 months commencing on the passing of this Act, the Minister shall prepare and lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report on any provisions of the Social Welfare Acts which are not yet in force, and the plans, if any, for bringing such provisions into force.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This was one of a number of amendments prepared for me by my predecessor who shadowed Deputy Dermot Ahern, namely Deputy Moynihan-Cronin. In recent years she was concerned about various aspects of and regulations under the Social Welfare Acts which were not yet brought into force. Obviously the legislation is extremely complex. For years further refinements have been introduced. The Minister referred to the bereavement grant and I commend him and any Government Deputies, including my northside colleague, Deputy Callely, who strongly supported it. It is a welcome innovation. The public will be grateful for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="874" /> On looking at all the legislation, not just in the social welfare area but other social legislation, Deputy Moynihan-Cronin was concerned that there were many aspects of legislation which had not yet been brought into force by the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs.</P>
    <P>One of the references she gave me related to all the divorce provisions of the Social Welfare (No. 2) Act, 1995, following the introduction of divorce. Following the referendum, there was a concern among many people who were separated or divorced that all of those regulations had not been brought into force.</P>
    <P>The amendment asks the Minister to give the House regular updates on when all social legislation, relating to the remits of the Ministers for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Justice, Equality and Law Reform, including possibly even the Minister for Education and Science, will be brought into force or which parts are outstanding. I ask the Minister to comment briefly on the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Over the years parliamentary questions have been tabled about this issue. The last one to which I replied was tabled in June last. A number of the regulations have been brought into force even since then. It might be appropriate for the Deputy to table a parliamentary question to which I could reply.</P>
      <P>On the issue he raised with regard to the Social Welfare (No. 2) Act, 1995, we checked the &ldquo;blacks&rdquo; of last year's Committee Stage and could not come across the reference, but we think it is the one in section 10(4). Many of the social welfare measures in relation to the introduction of divorce have been put in place. This is one which, in the view of the Department, is fairly academic because it has not arisen. It is the issue of two qualified adults being paid because it is considered most unlikely that a divorced person, who is in receipt of a social welfare payment, would be able to maintain a former spouse at such a level as to prevent that former spouse from qualifying for a social welfare payment in his or her own right. Our understanding is that this has not arisen. If the Deputy knows of an instance of it, he might let me know.</P>
      <P>There is an interdepartmental working group examining the treatment of different types of household under the tax and social welfare systems. That group is examining that and other aspects and will report fairly soon.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 6, between lines 2 and 3, to insert the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;4.&ndash;The Minister shall lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report outlining up-to-date figures for the expected current Budget surplus in 1999 and contrast these with up-to-date figures for the additional <Col N="875" /> monies payable from the Exchequer in 1999 arising from measures in the Bill over and above the pre-budget estimate for the Department.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment goes to the core of the question of whether we are achieving a fairer society. My tone is not critical of the Government's proposals. I accept the money made available is greater than in previous years. However, we are now in a totally changed situation. Things can be done today which would have been unimaginable three years ago and certainly ten or 20 years ago. Our economy is the envy of Europe if not the world. Some of our citizens are experiencing great prosperity and I am delighted because I love to see people doing well. In consequence, we have many more wealthy people in the country. This is good for those people and it is good for the country. On the other hand, some people have been left behind and have not gained in any way from our economic prosperity. Some have even been disadvantaged as a consequence of the Celtic tiger economy because our booming economy has produced higher prices for housing, including rented accommodation. People at the bottom half of the economic scale are faced with those consequences while getting no advantage from the booming economy.</P>
    <P>The Social Welfare Bill, with the social welfare provisions of the budget, is one of the instruments for dealing with this inequality. My colleagues, Deputies Browne and McGrath and I tabled this amendment for the purpose of initiating a more philosophical debate on this issue. I do not expect the Minister to be able to change anything at this stage, but I hope a message will be sent from all parties that we must do much more if we are to achieve a fair society. Our actions must not be confined to the Social Welfare Bill. We must do much more in the area of health where we have waiting lists of more than 35,000. These people do not have private health insurance. They must rely on the public health services and many of them are waiting in pain. The question of equality is not confined to the Social Welfare Bill, but it is a major instrument in achieving a fairer society. I pin my colours to the mast of a fairer society. That is what my party is aiming for and it is what we should all aim for.</P>
    <P>We will have unprecedented Exchequer surpluses. The budget surplus for this year is estimated at £2,300 million. In my view that is an underestimate. The surplus will be hundreds of millions of pounds more than that. The excess over the estimated surplus will probably be greater than the entire amount budgeted for increases in social welfare. That is my prediction. When such an amount of money is available, a totally changed approach towards achieving a fairer society is possible.</P>
    <P>We must contrast this huge amount of money with the amount made available for social welfare provisions. The Minister quoted a figure of an additional £192 million. The additional money <Col N="876" /> from the Exchequer over and above the pre-budget social welfare Estimate amounted to only £77.9 million. The figure of £77.9 million and the Minister's figure of £192 million can be reconciled by the fact that some of the money in addition to the £77.9 million from the Exchequer, will come from the social insurance fund to people who are contributory pensioners and beneficiaries. This amount bridges the gap between the Minister's figure and my own, and I am happy the social insurance fund is in surplus.</P>
    <P>Because of the amount of money available it is time to take a different approach and to examine the real problems of disadvantage in our society. For the first time in our history we can deal with the have-nots in society. The first group to be considered in this regard are our children. Child benefit is being paid in respect of approximately one million children. This is a very large number of children, the benefit is universal and many of these children do not suffer disadvantage. However, the figures available from, for example, Combat Poverty show a significant amount of poverty among children. It estimates that 28 per cent of children live in poverty. The Minister corrected me on Committee Stage when I said one third of our children live in poverty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>That figure is for 1994.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that. I also accept that the figure is probably lower than 28 per cent now because of improvements in society since 1994. I certainly hope so. The figure of 28 per cent is the most recent available. We can safely say that approximately 25 per cent of our children, according to the definition of Combat Poverty, live in poverty. Is this the kind of fairness we want in our society? If we are agreed that we do not want this, we must ask ourselves what we should do about it.</P>
      <P>There has been a debate in the past about whether one should concentrate resources in child benefit or in extra benefit to the children of social welfare recipients. The argument has been won by those who advocate increased child benefit. All the experts tell us that increased child benefit is the right approach to tackling the problem of child poverty. It has the advantage of not excluding the families of people who are in low paid employment and it is not a disincentive to those who wish to take up employment. A number of Ministers have agreed that child benefit is the way to deal with child poverty. In that case, how can an increase of £12 per year make an appreciable change?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
      <P>The National Millennium Committee, which I chair, has not received a proposal in respect of Dublin Corporation's plan for a new monument for O'Connell Street. Dublin Corporation has submitted a plan for the integrated development of the O'Connell Street area for consideration for funding as a millennium project. This proposal is currently under consideration by the National Millennium Committee in the context of its mandate to examine and make recommendations on proposed projects for inclusion in the Government's millennium programme.</P>
      <P>I have received a large number of postcards supporting the erection of a statue in O'Connell Street, Dublin, to mark the 2000th anniversary of the birth of Christ. I will bring this petition to the attention of the National Millennium Committee. I have also brought this petition to the attention of Dublin Corporation. Such a proposal would need to be submitted to the millennium committee in a worked out form before it could be given detailed consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>On Question No. 1, notwithstanding the quality of the project &ndash; I do not cast aspersions on it; it is a fascinating idea and I am interested in innovative ideas for Dublin city &ndash; and the manner in which it was chosen, will the Minister of State agree that to erect a 400 ft. spire of light in O'Connell Street without any consultation with the people of Dublin is the wrong way to proceed? I raise this question because a number of projects of this kind took place in Dublin city which would not be tolerated elsewhere. I doubt if a statue or monument of any magnitude would be erected in Mullingar without Deputy Paul McGrath or the local public representatives <Col N="878" /> informally consulting the people. It is not possible to do that in Dublin but given that the local elections will take place on 11 June, will the Minister of State agree that the opportunity should be taken to consult the people of Dublin so that we do not have a repetition of the reclining lady in the water for which Dubliners have no affection?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that the maximum consultation should be entered into by Dublin Corporation. He will appreciate this project is one for Dublin Corporation alone; it is not a matter for the National Millennium Committee because I have not received any request from the corporation for funding. I gather that the vote at the council was 34 for and 14 against the project. A total of 84 submissions were received by the corporation which went through a thorough assessment procedure. It is a matter for the corporation to defend itself on this issue because it chose to do it this way. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. That is a true phrase when it comes to the monument in O'Connell Street. One either loves it or hates it but I expect in future we will be unable to ignore it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply. Will he agree that if beauty is in the eye of the beholder, O'Connell Street is in the ownership of the people? The people who own O'Connell Street have not been consulted about this project. It sounds like an interesting project but delaying the erection of something like this for two months, which presumably will be in O'Connell Street for most of the next century if not longer, would allow people to have their say and be given ownership of the project. It is all very well for a small number of so-called experts to conduct a competition but there is no democracy in the way this decision is being made.</P>

    <P>The national committee has 408 proposals before it in regard to projects. It has deemed 128 of those to be national and 117 local, and they are being whittled down by the day.

If one of those is a proposal to erect a suitable statue to mark the 2000th anniversary of the birth of Christ, will he give proper and fair consideration to the proposal which is supported by a large number of people?

The Christian churches in particular have a strong role to play in that regard. I have had a meeting with Bishop Field, who runs the millennium festivals in Dublin for the Catholic Church, and with Bishop Ryan, who is the chairman of the National Catholic Church Millennium Committee. I have also had a meeting with the religious liaison group of the millennium committee. It is made up of representatives from the different religious organisations and is representative of Muslims, Jews, Catholics, Church of Ireland members, Presbyterians, Methodists and Buddhists.

The sculpture in question was by Andrew O'Connor and is one of the finest pieces of monumental sculpture in this country. It was put in a place of obscurity because people were afraid of being offended. I join with Deputy Gay Mitchell in asking the Minister if he and his committee will give some consideration to the appropriateness of a Christian memorial for the 2,000th anniversary of the birth of Christ.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been significant publicity concerning the report of the Working Group on Company Law Compliance and Enforcement prior to its presentation to me last December, since then and subsequent to its publication on 15 March 1999. This is an indication of the keen interest in the whole issue of badly needed reform on company law. The Government made decisions on foot of the report of the Working Group on Company Law Compliance and Enforcement on 9 March 1999.</P>
      <P>The report of the working group has confirmed the worst fears as to the low level of compliance with company law and the extent to which company law is being enforced in Ireland. For example, the group found that in 1997 only 13 per cent of the 136,000 companies due to file their returns on time actually complied with their obligations.</P>
      <P>The Government had no hesitation in accepting the thrust of the McDowell group report and decided to establish a new Office of Director of Corporate Enforcement with primary responsibility for the enforcement of company law, and to establish a statutory Company Law Review Group.</P>
      <P>In one important respect, the Government decided to go beyond the recommendations of the working group in deciding to transfer from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to the director primary responsibility for company law investigations. The Government also decided to provide the necessary staffing resources to both the director and the review group.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for her reply and share her concern about some of the findings in Mr. McDowell's report, that is, that only 13 per cent of companies complied with their obligations to file annual returns on time. How does the Minister envisage the new director of corporate enforcement will interface with the DPP and other agencies, such as the National Bureau of Fraud Investigation, which will be intimately tied in with this new office? What input does she have into the new fraud legislation which is long overdue from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The new director of company law enforcement will have seven members of the Garda Síochána on his or her team assisting in this area. He or she will also have people with expertise in accounting and other professional expertise, which will be necessary. I envisage the director will act very much as the Director of Consumer Affairs does <i>vis-à-vis</i> consumer affairs issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="882" /> In relation to summary offences, it will be the sole function of the director to prosecute in those cases. The director and his or her office will assist in the preparation of cases for the prosecution of indictable offences which is clearly a matter for the Director of Public Prosecutions. The director will also be empowered to seek injunctions against companies, their directors and other persons in order to secure compliance with the companies Acts. The director will be able to apply to the court under sections 150 and 160 of the Companies Act, 1990, for the restriction of directors and the disqualification of persons who act as company director or other officers or promoters or others who discharge important roles, such as auditors, examiners, liquidators or receivers of a company.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said seven members of the Garda Síochána will be in the office, but the report recommends only that a team of gardaí should work alongside the staff in the enforcement office. Will the Minister clarify that? Is she looking at something similar to the Criminal Assets Bureau where gardaí, Revenue Commissioners and social welfare personnel are seconded into the bureau? Will these gardaí be seconded into the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement? How will this enforcement director be accountable to the Dáil? It looks as if the Minister will move the powers which she currently has into this new office. How will we, as Members, be able to question the Minister? Will the answer be that this matter is not the responsibility of the Minister but of the Director of Corporate Enforcement? Will it not be a diminution of the democracy which exists here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I will respond to the last part of the Deputy's question first. The director will be required to report annually to the Minister. In relation to policy issues, the Minister remains accountable to the Oireachtas and to the public through it. We have not begun to draft the legislation yet but I envisage that a residual power will be held by the Minister like that which the Minister has in relation to the Competition Authority, for example. I envisage that the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement will work very much like the Criminal Assets Bureau. It is envisaged that seven members of the Garda Síochána will work on the director's team on a full-time basis, whether they work in the office with the director or elsewhere. That is necessary.</P>
      <P>In all, it will cost about £2.5 million per year to run this office and the Government has agreed to make that money available. We hope to have the legislation before the House after the summer because it is urgent in the context of all the inquiries and what has come to light. The Companies Registration Office is writing to 500 companies per day. That is the first step in the striking off procedure. Some 11,000 companies, an enormous number, have been struck off since last autumn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="883" /> It is important to enforce company law and corporate governance is important, particularly for an enterprise economy. We need to provide the resources to deal with this issue. We also need to depoliticise the inquiry area, which is not satisfactory. This should be done on an independent basis by an officer who has full responsibility in this area but, of course, the Minister will have to have residual powers on how that will work. I envisage that it will be similar to the Competition Authority but we have not yet begun to draft the legislation and I need to consult with the Office of the Attorney General on that matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 and 5 together.</P>
      <P>In December 1998 I reconvened the high level group on trade union recognition and addressed them on a number of industrial relations issues. On 11 March 1999 the group adopted and submitted to me a report which includes an agreement on industrial relations issues. I thank the group for reporting back so speedily.</P>
      <P>The group agreed that, where negotiating arrangements are in place, the most effective means of resolving differences which arise between employers and trade unions representing employees, is by voluntary collective bargaining, that is, the existing voluntarist industrial relations system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The group's report makes four proposals, designed to underpin the voluntarist approach to industrial relations, which serves this economy so well. These areas are as follows: agreed arrangements to enable the parties to a dispute to work voluntarily with the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court on the pay and conditions elements of the dispute where negotiating arrangements are not in place and collective bargaining does not occur; agreed exceptional arrangements, which would confirm, in legislation, the Labour Court as the court of last <Col N="884" /> resort in disputes where the agreed voluntary arrangements proposed by the group are not followed; amendments to the Code of Practice on Disciplinary Procedures, which would reflect existing legal provisions and best practice on grievance as well as disciplinary procedures; and the parties providing essential services to amend their dispute procedures to include key provisions of the Code of Practice on Disputes in Essential Services before the expiry of Partnership 2000.</P>
    <P>This is an agreed report and I express my appreciation for the work of the group's members, especially the IBEC and ICTU representatives. Debate on the group's proposals has commenced, not least within the social partner organisations.</P>
    <P>The proposals in the report merit careful consideration by those concerned with national social and economic partnership, industrial relations generally, the role of the LRC and the Labour Court and investment in business and jobs. I will present the report to Government in due course.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">

    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>The process is as follows. IBEC will put these proposals to its national executive in the coming weeks. As the Deputy will be aware, the trade union movement has publicly supported these proposals. I understand it will put its recommendations to its executive congress. I am not in a position to say when I will introduce legislation on this area. This question was tabled before proposals have been put to Government. This matter has been debated publicly, but this is the first time it has been aired in the Dáil. I welcome the opportunity to respond to this matter along the lines I outlined. I wish to await the conclusions of the deliberations by IBEC and ICTU, in particular, before indicating when legislation on this matter will be introduced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>In terms of negotiation getting under way for a prospective new agreement, is it not the case that it is the wish of both social partners that this matter should be out of the way and such legislation enacted? Will the Minister of State give a rough guideline as to when that will happen?</P>
      <P>The Minister of State welcomed the innovation that the Labour Court will have a role ultimately in terms of binding conclusions or recommendations. How does he reconcile his welcome for that with his comments on the Labour Party Bill, which sought to do the same thing, to the effect that &ldquo;it will undoubtedly lead to litigation in industrial relations disputes&rdquo;?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I will refer to it from memory. <Col N="885" /> Why is the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, so happy about a mandatory role for the Labour Court, given that when this proposal was brought forward in a Labour Party Bill it was his belief that it would undermine the effectiveness of the Labour Court? Is he now satisfied that, on mature reflection, it will not undermine its effectiveness?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy can be assured we will deal with this as speedily as possible. He is correct in suggesting this is an important issue for the trade union movement, in particular, in the context of agreeing a successor to Partnership 2000. The Deputy will be aware a number of issues emerged in the Ryanair dispute that had to be dealt with. I said at that time we needed to bite the bullet and that is why I welcome the fact that matters have progressed to this stage.</P>
      <P>Regarding the Deputy's comments on the Labour Party Bill, which was put forward before the he joined the ranks of that party, I made comments then that are still valid now. These proposals are based on an agreed formula. They are not being imposed. I recall clearly the debate on that Bill where I said it was endeavouring to impose mandatory trade union recognition. At that time I said the voluntarist system was the foundation of our industrial relations procedures and it was valuable in the context of social partnership, particularly since 1987. Under these proposals that system is enhanced and the proposals seek to get the parties to work the State machinery to resolve difficulties. I was concerned at that time about following the legal route and ending up with issues of this nature coming before the courts. I asked the high level group on trade union recognition to take account of a number of issues, including the Labour Party Bill, because it was a valuable contribution to the public debate at that time, but my views on that Bill have not changed. We are putting forward an agreed formula drawn up under the umbrella of social partnership, which is a valuable contribution. I look forward to following up on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for letting me have a copy of a report that was available to people who contributed to a radio programme. Will he examine the mechanism and methods whereby information, such as this, is made available not only to Members but to the public? I understood this report would be issued in the normal way when the high level group had reached its conclusions, but information has filtered through in various ways. I thank the Minister of State for sending me this three page document, but I only got a copy of it today even though the document was in the public arena for some time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On promised legislation, I exhort the Minister of State to realise this legislation and the awaited minimum wage legislation will form vital components of a new partnership agreement. The possibility of a new partnership agreement will <Col N="886" /> have been strengthened by the issuing of this document on trade union recognition. Are there not elements of other legislation that could be amended prior to the introduction of the substantive legislation on this area? Paragraph 3.5 recommends that the Code of Practice on Disciplinary Procedures of 6 May 1996 be amended. Could that not be done prior to the introduction of the substantive legislation? Are there any other elements of this report that could be implemented prior to the introduction of the substantive legislation?</P>
    <P>The group most concerned about mandatory trade unionism was the multinationals. We were told a number of multinationals might not invest here because of that concern. Has the Minister of State any indication about their sense of satisfaction about these recommendations? It would be welcome if they were happy with this because that would mean we would not face the problems highlighted previously by the Minister of State?</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy asked a number of questions. With regard to the mechanism of releasing this information to colleagues and to the general public, I am sure the Deputy will accept that the procedures involved here were very much internal. We reconvened the high level group and let it get on with its business. I am pleased with its speedy response. Information has come into the public domain. This is my first opportunity to inform the Dáil about this. I circulated, albeit at short notice, the contents of the report to Deputies Owen and Rabbitte earlier today. We want to get this right. Ideally this information will come into the public domain when it is signed sealed and delivered. There is still some consultation to take place with ICTU and IBEC. However, I accept it would be appropriate to get this information to Members of the Oireachtas as quickly as possible if we had developments of this nature. I note that point made by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The Deputy referred to the minimum wage. The minimum wage legislation is being dealt with by the social partners and the drafting is under way. Such legislation would amend the 1946 Act and it would be prudent to do it comprehensively in one fell swoop.</P>
      <P>In regard to foreign direct investment&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked about the code of practice. I assume that is not legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>The code of practice will have to be agreed by the social partners. The social partners have agreed to deal with two issues &ndash; disputes of special importance and the code of practice on dispute procedures &ndash; before the end of the year. There are clear time limits on aspects of this agreement. This is all being done in the context of a successor to Partnership 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to foreign direct investment, my view is that the general response has been positive. People are looking very carefully at these pro<Col N="887" /> posals, as we speak. I hope this will win approval &ndash; the initial responses have been positive. Given that this has been done in an agreed way and that ICTU and IBEC have signed off on it within the high level group, I expect we will have a positive response.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to compare what we are doing here with what is happening in the UK. The UK approach, under the fairness at work document, goes down the route of mandatory trade union recognition and examines the whole question of thresholds, which is a different approach. The UK employee relations Bill is before Parliament at present. My concern at the time of the debate was that if we went down that road we would bring industrial relations into the law courts.</P>
    <P>The work of the high level group is to be commended on the basis that it has built on and enhanced the voluntarist industrial relations procedures and come up with these proposals. I am confident that the multinationals, which have particular views on this, will support the proposals of the high level group.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there will be some alarm outside the House that the Minister of State is so hazy about a date for legislation. I wish to press him again to tell the House when he will bring this legislation before it.</P>
      <P>I remind the Minister of State that when he responded to my colleague, Deputy Broughan's, Bill, he referred to the Labour Court issuing binding recommendations. Does he accept that this accord provides for binding recommendations by the Labour Court? Does he still think that will undermine the efficacy of the Labour Court, which was his point then? It is important that he, as the Minister of State with responsibility for industrial relations, puts his views on this on the record. If he harbours fears about it undermining the voluntary system, he ought to say so; if he is now happy and has thought better of his intemperate and ill considered remarks during the debate on the Labour Party Bill, he should say that also.</P>

      <P>The amendment proposed in Deputy Rabbitte's Bill could not, I believe, be made applicable to the inquiries that are under way at present. This is because the legislative basis on which they commenced would have changed and my investigations would, therefore, be open to successful legal challenge. I wish that the position would be otherwise but I am constrained by the provisions of the Companies Acts as they stand in relation to the present inquiries.</P>

      <P>Will the Tánaiste interpret that for the House? She has said on previous occasions that she has in her possession either completed or draft reports in respect of 11 different inquiries. She said that some of the information in those reports is so serious that she is extremely concerned about the implication that some people &ndash; the principals, I presume &ndash; feel they are above the law. That is a very serious situation. Does the Tánaiste now believe that if she cannot support the Labour Party Bill she will have to take these reports with her to the grave? We are trying to lessen her load so that she can share this with others. Is there any mechanism open to her to bring this information into the public domain?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The McDowell enforcement and compliance group was established because of what was coming to light. Some of the completed reports have been sent to the relevant authorities, which are defined in the Act and can be a court of competent jurisdiction, the Minister for Finance &ndash; who has to authorise the Revenue Commissioners to receive it &ndash; the DPP and the Central Bank. They are the only persons or groups entitled to the reports at the moment unless the body being inquired into gives permission. To date, no such permission has been forthcoming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept the thrust of the Labour Party Bill and that the amendment is necessary. However, we need to broaden the groups covered by the Bill. For example, I would like to include the Revenue Commissioners, as of right; the Stock Exchange; accountancy and other professional bodies; over<Col N="890" /> seas recognised authorities, such as the DTI in the UK; and the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>
    <P>The point is that we cannot retrospectively apply it to the information I currently have. The case taken by Dunnes Stores, due to be heard on 13 April, is being made precisely on these points. Information which has been received is being given to authorities. Basically, a section 19 inquiry is a preliminary inquiry and, therefore, one is not entitled to give any information that one receives by way of a preliminary inquiry to any other body, which includes a tribunal.</P>
    <P>However, much of the information which has come to light at the Moriarty tribunal, in particular, was brought to my attention because it refers to some of the companies under investigation. It seems that the institutions, banks and others, from whom information was sought have also provided the information to the tribunals of inquiry. The final reports are currently being drafted. When I receive them, it is clearly open to me to petition the High Court to have an inspector appointed in many cases and they would then become public documents. The issues are so serious that they should be in the public domain and not just go to competent authorities.</P>
    <P>The Deputies assume that we will oppose the Bill, although the Government has not formalised its view. I will strongly recommend that the Bill is supported and amended but, unfortunately, it cannot apply to the current inquiries. I wish it were otherwise because section 19 can bring a great deal of information to light but the restriction is that the body in question must give permission for its publication.</P>

      <P>During Question Time on 16 February, when the Tánaiste replied to questions on this issue, she indicated that she had received the Garuda report and had sought permission to make it available to the relevant tribunal. Has she received a reply to that request. She also wrote to me following that Question Time informing me that the Faxhill Homes report had been completed. Has that company commented on the report or given permission to send it to a tribunal, if it is relevant?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I sought permission from Garuda Limited to publish the report. In the past fortnight a response was received from the lawyer representing the company which said that the company could not agree to its publication, which I regret. The Faxhill Homes report is very much tied in with the Dunnes Stores inquiry and, therefore, I have not sought the company's permission to publish it because it is relevant to the case that will be before the courts on 13 April. I have not finalised my view on the report on Garuda Limited. It could be sent to the Revenue or the DPP. I hope to have legal advice on the matter later this week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Tánaiste agree it seems at least wasteful that she has spent an amount <Col N="891" /> of money, quite properly, in investigating these matters of considerable public interest and is unable to bring them into the public domain or make them available to the tribunal? I welcome her commitment to bring them into the public domain. Does she believe that the Labour Party Bill is constitutionally infirm? How does she propose to bring these matters into the public domain?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party Bill has a great deal of merit for future inquiries. I was not constrained by the 1990 Act but if it were amended I would be able to bring them into the public domain. However, that Act precludes me from so doing. It defines who are the competent authorities, otherwise one must get the permission of the company in question. Even if it were a favourable inquiry, I wonder whether companies would want these reports brought into the public domain.</P>
      <P>However, because the matters which have come to light are so serious they require further examination. For example, the authorised officer in a section 19 inquiry cannot call in third parties. If the parties he has spoken to give conflicting information he cannot call in a third party, for example, an auditor or a professional body. That is a huge restriction along with the restriction on publication. For that reason, and subject to my receipt of the final reports, which are currently being drafted by the officer and which I hope to have before Easter or shortly thereafter, it may well be that these matters will have to be taken further and an inspector appointed under section 8 of the Companies Act, 1990.</P>
      <P>With regard to the matters being brought into the public domain or otherwise, we can talk about general matters which have been discovered but the key to what has been uncovered is that leading principals in large organisations have been involved in huge breaches of the Companies Acts. They seem to have felt for many years that the Acts just did not apply to them. That is very serious for corporate governance in Ireland and the economy and it is damaging to enterprise. For all those reasons, if we want to change that culture, in addition to implementing the recommendations of the McDowell group, we must be seen to take action. That is what the public wants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>How will the new Director of Corporate Enforcement interface with such inquiries? Will he be a competent authority to whom the reports can be given or will he carry out the inquiries?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is envisaged that the director will carry out the inquiries and they will be depoliticised. It is important for the future that inquiries should be conducted on an independent basis. Much of the expense of these inquiries has arisen from legal challenges because in the main they have been carried out by full-time officers in the <Col N="892" /> Department. During some legal challenges, companies which were subject to investigation alleged that the inquiries were under way for political reasons and, of course, that is not the case. However, some people seem to feel that might be the case. It is important that such inquiries are taken out of the realm of what could be broadly called &ldquo;party politics&rdquo; and given to an independent officer. From here on in the officer will take care of all prosecutions for summary offences and will assist the DPP in relation to indictable offences. The powers currently held by the Minister will be transferred to the director.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, perhaps with one exception. Many of the inquiries are tied in together, even though they involve different companies. However, that is the intention because many of the inquiries have been under way since September 1997. We have not gone into Dunnes Stores yet, despite our best efforts over the past nine months and, hopefully, that will be finalised in court on 13 April. Other than the Dunnes Stores inquiry, that is the intention because the inquiries are at the stage where they can be completed.</P>

      <P>I have no proposals to amend or abolish the Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order, 1987.

    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">

      <P>Does the Tánaiste agree, in light of the recent controversy over &ldquo;hello money&rdquo; and the changing structures of the retail grocery market, with the entrance of a number of UK retailers, the groceries order is more essential <Col N="893" /> than ever and should be retained? Does she accept that the stability and fair competition which the order has provided has encouraged investment in the retail trade throughout the country? More than £500 million has been invested in the independent sector with the result that consumers have benefited from high quality stores in outlying regions.</P>
      <P>Is she aware that more than 26 per cent of weekly domestic income is spent on goods covered by the groceries order? Is she further aware of the admission by Tesco that it has been overcharging Irish consumers for grocery products by as much as 3 per cent; that this practice seems to have been ongoing since last summer and that such an error could cost consumers up to £33 million in one year?

      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have said before in the House that we need competition. That is what keeps prices down. I also referred to the fact that goods not covered by the Groceries Order increased at a lower rate than those covered by it, which is extraordinary. However, I acknowledge that it has played a useful role. I have an open mind on the matter. I am awaiting the results of the Michael Collins review group which I will have in July. Clearly I am concerned about the matters that have come into the public domain. The hello money in relation to one supermarket is a serious matter being investigated by the Director of Consumer Affairs, who is the appropriate person. It is not an acceptable practice. We must have a level playing field. We have understood for quite some time that it is illegal and still believe that to be the case. I am determined to ensure that any deficiencies in the order in relation to that will be rectified as a matter of urgency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regret the issue that has come to light in relation to Tesco. I have been given an assurance that it will be rectified by the weekend. Perhaps they will consider returning some of the money to the consumer that was collected through overcharging. I do not know how they might do that but it is a serious matter. As the Deputy said, 26 per cent of net family income, on average, is spent on groceries. It is a high percentage and when added to the spend on mortgage or rent, almost all of the income is spent in that direction. We <Col N="894" /> want competition in the market because that gives consumers better choice and perhaps better quality products at better prices but if there are deficiencies in computer systems they can eliminate the benefits that come from competition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the consternation and anger caused by the revelation that Tesco has been overcharging? Is she prepared to do anything other than say it will be investigated? Am I right in saying this was brought to light last October and nothing was done in six months or more? The IT system the Minister referred to must have been flawed or is it more serious than that? The Minister said it was accidental but was it? My colleague said £33 million had been taken out of consumers' pockets in one year. That is staggering by any standards. It amounts to £500,000 per week. What is the Minister doing to ensure other stores are not involved in this kind of activity? It is a national disgrace and a scandal. Will the Minister assure the House and consumers that she is doing more than mouthing platitudes? The country is in uproar over this. Radio programmes are inundated with calls on this issue. What does the Minister intend to do about this serious matter?</P>

I have not the power to give back to people the money that was overcharged. We are concerned about the matter. I do not know if there are instances of it in other retail outlets, but I will ask the director to investigate that matter also.  </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I share my colleagues' outrage at what has emerged. As the Director of Consumer Affairs is the person with power to investigate the matter we cannot get answers here. Will the Minister ask the director to look at exactly what occurred where a price was shown for a product yet when the bar code was put through the machine it showed a higher price? Is there something wrong with the bar coding system, which I understand is a complex matter Europe wide? Is the bar code on the products in Ireland falsely showing a price which is different from that on the flashing on the shelf where the product is displayed? Will the Minister raise that with the Director of Consumer Affairs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister state whether, since 1977 when the Groceries Order was first introduced, there has been any groundswell of opposition to it or requests that it be abolished on the grounds that it is non-competitive? We heard a submission <Col N="895" /> recently at the Committee on Enterprise and Small Business that the order should be abolished as its function would be taken over by the Competition Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>People have said to me that it is anti-competitive but I can hardly describe them in terms of organisations. The irony is that according to the last set of figures the goods covered by the order increased by a higher amount than those that were not covered. Competition seemed to keep the price of other goods down. That may be just a strange irony. I have an open mind about it. We want to ensure there is no below cost selling and prohibit the payment of hello money. Perhaps the penalties for a breach of the order are too small, a fine of up to £500 or six months in jail or a continuing fine of £50 per day. About ten breaches of the order have been investigated over the past ten years and three have gone to court. I will ask the Director of Consumer Affairs to examine all the matters. She has the responsibility to carry out an investigation and is the sole person who can prosecute for breaches of the order. If new breaches come to light I hope there will be prosecutions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Minister to acknowledge that it would be unacceptable, given the scale of the suspected fraud on consumers, to leave it to the marketplace to correct whatever the fault was, intentional or unintentional. We are taking it that it was unintentional. Does she agree that the matter cannot be left without the necessary prosecutions or some appropriate punishment being decided on against this multiple? I received several phone calls from people who were outraged about this and remember there were other questions about Tesco at the time of their coming to do business in this jurisdiction. Many people are outraged that advantage seems to have been taken&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The investigation of the matter is for the Director of Consumer Affairs and any prosecutions in relation to summary offences are a matter for her. Clearly more serious offences are a matter for the Director of Public Prosecutions and there can be a fine for an indictable offence of £10,000 or three years imprisonment. There is much merit in what the Deputy says about how we rectify this. It is not enough to say it was a mistake, it will not happen again and we will move on from here. The company in question <Col N="896" /> should be seen to reimburse their consumers. Perhaps that is something we can explore with the company. If the sum is as large as £33 million or £500,000 per week, it is a considerable amount of money. It is more than the turnover of many in the retail trade nationally. It has very serious consequences for competition as well as the effect it has on the consumers in question. It is obviously very bad publicity for the chain that this happened over such a prolonged period and only came to light when a competitor brought it to the attention of the Director of Consumer Affairs and the public in recent days.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer to the £2 billion turnover. In view of the exposure of this scandal and the similarities between it and the NIB scandal, will the Tánaiste appoint an inspector under the Companies Acts to inspect Tesco's books? I am very concerned that all risks be removed in this matter, particularly in light of the Grocery Order being questioned.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 64 together.</P>
      <P>In early 1998, I invited and received the commitment of representatives of a broad range of relevant business organisations and State agencies to support the Government's awareness campaign and take part in a year 2000 national committee to oversee and advise on the campaign.</P>
      <P>The role of the committee, the members of whom have given of their time on a voluntary basis, has been to advise me on campaign strategy and to report on the progress within the bodies represented and in the wider business community. Its members include representatives of groups which interact with small business on a daily basis and are therefore in a position to exert influence, for example, the banks, the accounting-auditing profession, the insurance industry and many business associations and organisations.</P>
      <P>The committee has met officially on four occasions since its formation. The members of the committee have also attended many other meetings on this issue throughout the past year. With the help of the committee, a comprehensive brochure was prepared outlining the nature and implications of the problem and giving advice on how to deal with it. This brochure was circulated to more than 100,000 businesses throughout the country.</P>
      <P>In addition, a series of seven regional conferences have been held to increase awareness of the problem, at which I, along with committee representatives, have impressed on participants the urgency of the need to address the issue. These conferences and a subsequent national conference in Dublin received wide media coverage. The total cost of the brochure and the conferences was £42,964. A further sum of £30,000 has been included in my Department's Estimate for spending on this issue during 1999, as required. Before the current campaign got under way, £10,000 was spent in 1997 on the production of a leaflet highlighting the problem. This leaflet was distributed widely.</P>
      <P>In addition to this, the Government through the Minister for Finance, included a sum of £40 million in the last budget in order that the necessary resources would be available to ensure compliance across the public sector. In reply to separate questions today, I will give details of the £300,000 Enterprise Ireland awareness campaign which I recently launched.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not heard a list like that since I last attended mass. Does the Minister think a representative of the plain people of Ireland should perhaps be appointed to the committee, a housewife or house husband for example?</P>
      <P>In terms of the Minister's reference to media coverage, some newspapers such as the <i>Sunday Business Post </i>and the <i>Sunday Tribune</i> have treated this issue quite seriously. However, there has been regular comment to the effect that there are concerns about the level of awareness in Ireland in regard to the Y2K problem, especially among small indigenous companies. Is the Minister confident that given the very short time available to deal with this problem, such companies will be able to address it? Is there any arrangement or central mechanism within Government to monitor progress on this issue in each Department or to monitor the way in which individual Ministers are ensuring accountability from agencies and organisations under the umbrella of their Departments?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy Rabbitte wishes to forward his CV to us, I am sure we might be able to include him on the committee. We are very grateful to the committee members who are very committed and dedicated to the task in hand. A number of systems have been put in place to ensure everything possible is done to ensure Ireland will be Y2K compliant. Reports are presented to Government every two months by the relevant Ministers on the organisations under their Departments' aegis, semi-State organisations, public sector bodies and so on. The Cabinet considers those reports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="899" /> In a subsequent reply, I will inform the House that Enterprise Ireland is carrying out a very detailed survey on the various companies with which it has been interacting and collaborating in recent months. The first quarterly survey for this year will be published next month and surveys will be published on a quarterly basis for the rest of the year. We have in place a major support system through Enterprise Ireland which we plan to operate into the early part of next year.</P>
    <P>The surveys show there is a 90 per cent level of awareness of the problem. We are concerned about compliance from small and medium enterprises throughout the country and are doing our best to maintain pressure in this respect. At a conference held on 9 September 1998, we outlined 9 September 1999 as the date by which the first problems were likely to arise. We clearly signalled that if companies were not compliant by that date, they could be in very serious trouble by 31 December 1999.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>Enterprise Ireland brought together the business development functions of Forbairt and An Bord Tráchtála and incorporated the relevant human resources expertise from FÁS's services to business function. Has Enterprise Ireland received any direction to deal with small companies? Small companies, supermarkets, retailers and the service sector are being excluded in regard to the Y2K problem. They will be left in the deep sea with nobody to help them. Will the Minister ensure the interests of small companies and business people will be addressed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>We have addressed that situation. I, in consultation with the national committee, have deliberately involved city and county enterprise boards which have been given the very important role of liaising with small companies. We have also instructed semi-State organisations, such as IDA, Enterprise Ireland and the enterprise boards that people should not be in a position to draw down any grant aid awarded since the latter half of 1998 or in 1999 unless they will be Y2K compliant. A condition should apply to any grant aid being given in 1999 and since the latter half of 1998 that unless companies are year 2000 compliant they cannot draw down the money. We have used every incentive possible and are continuing with a strenuous campaign which is constantly accelerated to ensure a focus on the smaller companies, about which we are worried. The enterprise boards are deeply involved in this matter at ground level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>There is little evidence of that type of programme being available in County Sligo. Several business people have said computer companies are speculating and selling software solely on the basis that they have to buy it. There is a lack of knowledge on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that some of the more prestigious experts have recommended there ought to be some independent system of verification of progress? Is anything in place to deal with that point? Can the Minister assure the House in terms of the capacity of city water systems to surmount the year 2000 problem? To what extent is there a systematic pattern of big companies helping little companies as, for example, that pioneered by the ESB? Is that system operating in the private sector?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Responsibility for the semi-State organisations rests with the Minister in charge of the Department to which those semi-State organisations respond. For example, local authorities respond to the Department of the Environment and Local Government. A number of areas are crucial to the proper functioning of society after 31 December, namely, water, communications, transport, aviation, health services etc. The Government allocated £40 million in the last budget to ensure resources were available and that there would be compliance in this area. There is a strong targeted effort by the various Ministers, in co-operation with the various county managers and the chief executives of semi-State organisations to co-ordinate a system to ensure compliance. We are optimistic on the public sector side that everything will be in order. However, one never knows because embedded systems laden with problems and old systems can create unexpected and unknown difficulties. We will not know this until the situation unfolds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have looked at the question of independent verification. Enterprise Ireland has been given a clear remit to conduct a detailed survey which it is hoped will put pressure on companies to be compliant. We are pleased the ESB has adopted the SFA programme and have asked other companies, particularly the big corporates, which have sub-supply companies, to co-operate with them and ensure the smaller companies are <Col N="901" /> brought along. We believe this is beginning to work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I started to raised this issue with the Minister of State when I became spokesperson in 1997. I still sense he does not realise we are in the last year before the problem will manifest itself. There are some experts who say it will have started to manifest itself from January 1999 onwards. Does the Minister propose to hold a stocktaking conference or meeting to ascertain if people are prepared? If this is left until September or October I am terrified I will have to rescue him from a lift or that the country may come to a standstill on new year's eve. Already people are planning to fly all over the world and to do all kinds of interesting and exciting things. We might all be locked into offices, buildings, lifts, deep freeze units and so on.</P>

      <P>I am confident that anyone west of the Shannon, including Deputy Rabbitte, who left would always be delighted to come back. The yearning is always there. Since coming into office I have not refused one year 2000 invitation, whether to launch a programme, to initiate a service or, to support or meet groups. I have done that throughout the country and will continue to do it. We want to ensure the public, business people and those who have responsibility are aware because it would be a disaster if anything went wrong. One company gone down is one too many. We will do our utmost to ensure that does not happen.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 44 together.</P>
      <P>A services strategy was published in March, 1997 and included a graduated system of support for services companies ranging from a basic level of support, mainly information and advice, to access the full range of agency supports for internationally traded firms in &ldquo;designated&rdquo; sectors. A reappraisal of that strategy took place in the context of drawing up the legislation to establish Enterprise Ireland in 1998 and the opportunity was availed of to update the list of services within the &ldquo;designated&rdquo; sectors to include specifically new emerging sectors such as electronic commerce, multimedia and logistics management services. This should assist Ireland to become an &ldquo;early mover&rdquo; in these new electronic services.</P>
      <P>A study of the services sector is under way to determine ways and means of stimulating greater activity throughout Ireland in all services. Work on this review should be completed within six months.</P>
      <P>Measure 3 of the Small Business Operational Programme also supports studies into new and emerging services areas. The focus of these studies is to determine the potential of the sectors to create sustainable employment and to identify the parameters necessary to realise this potential. In addition, Enterprise Ireland provides support through its linkage programme to Irish SMEs involved in the supply and services sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the report was published in 1997, several other reports have been published on audio visual facilities, the multimedia sector, the creating of a franchise and the establishment of a digital park. Areas under investigation include direct mail, the design centre, entertainment and support services. A major survey is being carried out in the service sector. Given that there have been up to ten different studies since the report was published in 1997 I am astonished that another report is to be conducted on the service sector. Given that the service sector has been neglected I am pleased emerging businesses are coming forward. I hope they are better supported than they have been to date. Following all the surveys will there be support for the service sector to create jobs? In America the greatest job creator is the service sector. What direction has been given to the consultant who will be given the overall remit of condensing about 15 reports which have been conducted since the early 1990s?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>My predecessor, Deputy Richard Bruton, published a services sector strategy. That strategy is being implemented. As I said in my reply, certain designated services were identified <Col N="903" /> for support. Clearly, we cannot support through grant aid corner shops or other such activities. Rather we must support internationally traded services, an area which is changing all the time, particularly given the potential of electronic commerce. A huge percentage of jobs currently being supported by Enterprise Ireland in the context of indigenous companies and by the IDA in terms of foreign direct investment are in the services sector. In export terms the services sector is currently worth approximately £2 billion annually, accounting for about one quarter of total exports. Half of this comes from the internationally traded services in the financial sector and about 25 per cent, or £25 million, is accounted for by software services.</P>
      <P>The new support mechanism available through Enterprise Ireland is much different from that which was available through Forbairt or the Export Board. Enterprise Ireland provides support to help companies grow to a sustainable level, develop R&amp;D and train employees. In general, Irish companies have had very little interest in human resources, training employees and upgrading employee skills which leads to increased productivity and greater use of technology.</P>
      <P>It is fair to say we can only support service companies involved in trade and not those which display services in other parts of the country or within particular regions. The Price-Waterhouse-Coopers study is not a preliminary to another strategy but is being carried out in the context of the Operational Programme for Support to Small Industry. It is a Community-wide initiative to examine how we can develop the potential of services, not just nationally but particularly within the regions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of job creation in small companies in the services sector, I appeal to the Minister that, rather than providing an employment grant, which can be restrictive to a certain extent in the context of the development of small companies which can get £7,000 per job created, she provide a capital grant for equipment. This would allow a company grow to a greater extent. In certain cases the biggest risk for small companies is taking on people when doing so cannot be justified. A company would develop to a greater extent if a capital grant was available to help sustain growth at a relatively modest rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Grant aid is given under a range of headings, some focused on capital equipment. In recent years grant aid has been geared more and more towards job creation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>In the indigenous sector much grant aid is provided to upgrade existing activity and to install new technology and equipment. In the foreign sector grant aid is probably more <Col N="904" /> employment than capital orientated. On average the companies which receive the largest amounts of grant aid are those which install new equipment. Such equipment is very expensive and companies, particularly indigenous ones, receive a fair proportion of the capital cost. Last week I was involved with a company in the midlands which has potential but has never traded internationally. It now has potential to develop its export market and Enterprise Ireland will help it upgrade its facilities and put in place new equipment and technology which will allow it improve productivity.</P>
      <P>The mandate we gave Enterprise Ireland is very broad. It was asked to examine how companies can be made more sustainable in the medium and long-term. This involves examining the entire company, including the capacity to research and develop new products, to upgrade skills of employees, etc., and not just the number of people employed or the technology used. I think the new strategy is working and is beginning to take effect quite rapidly. It is better than having separate grant aid for exports operated by the trade board and for company development operated by Forbairt as happened in the past and which led to a very disjointed approach. Because of this some companies slipped through the net and did not get the kind of support they needed. Other companies which needed it least got more support. I hope we will see improvements in the sector and we must keep an eye on it as more jobs are being created in the services sector, in Ireland and elsewhere, than in other sectors. This means the strategy for the support of industry must change accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of the strategy, what is the current situation regarding the labour and skills shortages in the services sector? Is it leading to wage inflation? What strategies has the Minister planned to deal with this issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is fair to say that in many sectors, including the services and manufacturing sectors, companies are experiencing difficulties in getting unskilled and in particular skilled employees. This is why the Government, on taking office, established a £250 million education technology fund to increase the number of engineers, scientists, those with software qualifications and PLC courses, addressing, for example, the demands of the call centre sector where there was a shortage of people with linguistic skills. The biggest complaint I get concerns the provision of people with skills. That is the reason we have an additional 8,800 places this year in active labour market programmes, namely, training programmes as opposed to community employment which has not had the desired effect in some regions in terms of people progressing into employment. The catering industry, for example, is experiencing difficulties, not just in terms of employees but also in getting people to do relevant courses. Recently the Minister for Tourism, <Col N="905" /> Sport and Recreation commented that some courses are finding it difficult to get people to avail of the training opportunities, which is a great pity.</P>
      <P>Unemployment is down to 6.8 per cent. There are 37,000 in community employment, a further 18,000 apprentices and approximately 29,000 doing various programmes. Therefore, there is a large number of people involved in Government backed training programmes. The challenge is to ensure we have enough people for the emerging jobs. This is why Forfás, working with the skills group which was established, is currently trying to forecast what we will need over the next number of years if current growth levels continue so that we will have some idea of where money should be spent. A considerable amount of public money is being spent and yet there are shortages. The construction industry, for example, is also experiencing difficulties in recruiting people, while at least one or two of the people serving in most restaurants in Dublin are from outside the jurisdiction. I welcome this, but this is so because it is difficult to get Irish people to do some of the jobs currently available.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10, 27, 40, 47, 55, 61 and 82 together.</P>
      <P>A total of 4,879 young persons were referred for interview to FÁS in the period 1 September 1998 to end January 1999 as part of the support measures in place under the employment action plan. Fifty eight per cent of these attended for interview while 1,671, or 34 per cent of those referred, did not attend for interview. Of those who did not attend, 652, or 13 per cent of those referred in this period, were still on the live register by end February 1999. Of those persons interviewed by FÁS, 35 per cent were placed in a job or training and a further 5 per cent were referred to a training programme.</P>
      <P>Of those persons interviewed by FÁS and not yet placed in a job or on a FÁS programme, 20 per cent continue to receive FÁS supports following their first guidance interview. No further action was being taken in relation to the remaining 23 per cent of cases. Cases where persons drop out of contact or decline an offer of intervention are referred for review by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Full details of the outcomes for persons referred for supports under the employment action plan are available from the regular monthly reports on the plan. The monthly report covering the end January position of the cumulative referrals to date is available in the Dáil <Col N="907" /> Library. I am giving preliminary details in this reply from report number five which covers the period to end February and will be published next week.</P>
    <P>I have recently received a report of the outcomes of the first cohort of 884 referrals, in September 1998, and their outcomes in the months subsequent to the referral process. This shows that by the end of the fifth month of operation of the employment action plan, 78 per cent of the original cohort of September referrals had left the live register and 66 per cent of these had left for identified positive reasons, namely, 42 per cent to a job, 16 per cent to a FÁS programme and 8 per cent to re-enter education. This indicates the progress being made in achieving the results set out in the plan.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is clearly working from more up to date figures than I am. I am working from the third progress report which covers the period up to the end of December. I doubt anyone in this category stays up late enough to watch &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo;, now that RTE has slipped back into its bad old habits and has not adhered to its undertaking to show the programme by or around midnight. However, the relevant point from all the statistics the Minister read out is that only a third of those presenting to FÁS for interview have found a job or a training programme. Is that not a disappointing rate? Do we have any knowledge of what happens to the two thirds who turned up as opposed to those who absented themselves?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The idea of the interview is to assist people to seek and access an opportunity. Although FÁS has places available or positions are available in employment, an interviewee may not be interested in those. The idea is to help people enter the areas they want, because it will be more successful that way. It is early days and FÁS must continue to work with those who were not assisted in their first interview. Some of them are waiting for places on programmes or courses to start. Not all of them were able to access what they wanted at the initial interview. New programmes had to be put in place. We were waiting for certain decisions in the budget which allowed those programmes to get under way. A major difference will be seen as we move into summer. It will probably take another two or three months before we know what exactly are the trends although some are emerging. We want to ensure those who take up employment are still employed some months later and it is too early to say whether that is the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most interesting statistic is that a high proportion of those contacted, 78 per cent, have signed off the live register for positive reasons, for example, to go into training, employment or further education. A small proportion of those contacted are not ready for employment or even <Col N="908" /> for a training programme. One of the disturbing aspects which has emerged is the high numbers of people, in absolute rather than percentage terms, who have a poor standard of education and are unable to read and write. Since those are all under 25, it is an indictment of how we have treated them until now. We must examine the role of education in these matters, especially further education. Someone who does not have the capacity to read or write today will be like someone in a few years who cannot use a computer &ndash; they will be unemployable. We have a great deal of work to do. FÁS does not have the capacity to provide the assistance in some of those areas. We are exploring in association with the Departments of Social, Community and Family Affairs and Education and Science what opportunities we might put in the way of such persons. There are also a small number of people who have addiction problems and the assistance they require is a function of the Department of Health and Children. We are also engaged in discussions with health boards regarding ways such people might be assisted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>We have just dealt with the question on skills shortages. Does the Minister acknowledge the absurdity of a skills shortage on the one hand and, on the other, only a third of the people who present for interview to FÁS being placed? The Minister raised the possibility of using the big stick with these people on one or two occasions, but that does not sound credible if no programme or job exists for them or we are not managing to place them in jobs. Is my information correct that the number of placements in jobs is proportionately worsening and that the Minister is contemplating raising the ceiling of the 25 year age limit? Does she agree that, if that happens, matters will worsen further for the cohort on which this programme focused in the first place? Will the Minister plead with the Minister for Education and Science to provide some form of education for these young people who apparently cannot take up even unskilled jobs in the economy because of the poor quality of their education?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>There is something ironic about a situation where there are jobs but people to take them cannot be found. There is no doubt huge numbers of jobs are being created in the economy, about 1,000 a week. It is one of the reasons so many work permits are being granted at present. An unprecedented number have been granted in addition to the 44,000 people who returned to the country last year, and this has resulted in net immigration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding education, we must stop more young people following the pattern of those currently being interviewed. They are a relatively small number of people but I regard it as a high number in absolute terms given the amount of money spent on their education and given their relative youth. The Minister for Education and Science has reduced the pupil-teacher ratio and has made provision for improved assistance to schools by way of remedial education. Perhaps we need to go further.</P>
      <P>One of the difficulties is that the people concerned want jobs in certain areas and some of them do not want to go into areas where there are vacancies. One area in which there is difficulty encouraging people to pursue a career path is the hotel and catering industry. My colleague has referred on a number of occasions to the fact that positions are available and yet people seem reluctant to take up a training course in that important sector which will become more important as the tourism industry grows.</P>
      <P>The challenge is to gear programmes towards providing people with opportunities which will lead to work. It is a major challenge on which we are spending an enormous amount of money. A huge number of people throughout the country are doing valuable work and yet not acquiring the skills they need for the jobs emerging. I hold discussions with FÁS and other interested parties on an almost weekly basis on this issue because the situation is unsatisfactory. It is not good for the economy, for the individuals involved or for the taxpayer. We will have the capacity when I make some new decisions shortly arising from various reports submitted to me. The new training allowance will encourage more people into training. There was a gap between what a person received in a training course and what he received in community employment. We all respond to the economics of our situation and tend to opt for that action which is made more beneficial for us. I want to see as many people as possible going into training to allow them access opportunities in the labour market. The allowance has been extended to people up to 34 who will receive 12 months' unemployment payments.</P>
      <P>The Government has also decided to interview every unemployed person on the live register in two areas in the country so that we have a good profile of the whole cohort of unemployed people. One of the major difficulties in this area is that statistics are very bad and we do not know the qualifications and skills of the unemployed. We have chosen two areas, one urban, one rural, in which every person on the live register will be contacted and interviewed over the next ten months and will either be offered an opportunity or at least have their position discussed so that we will have good data on the remaining people on the live register.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Minister would tell us where those areas are or are they secret?</P>
      <P>Does she agree that both she and the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, are taking great credit for the employment action plan? Every time statistics are issued, she says they indicate the scheme is working well. How many of those under 25 who have been invited to an interview to be assessed for a job or training have disappeared between the cracks in the woodwork and into the black economy? Where are they and what are they doing? Is it the case that many have temporarily left the live register out of fear that somebody will catch up with them and that they will receive an official letter inviting them to an interview?</P>
      <P>Will the Minister give serious consideration to introducing, as has been done in the United States and other places, a mentoring programme for the cohort of young people who do not have the educational skills required to take up a job or undergo initial training? Has the Minister asked members of the business community if they would be willing to employ young people of low educational standard, monitor their progress and encourage them to pursue their education?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The two areas chosen were Ballyfermot in Dublin, including Cherry Orchard, and Kilkenny and the surrounding area. They were chosen because they have a FÁS training centre, employment opportunities and training programmes are available and new programmes can be put in place.</P>
      <P>A range of programmes is needed. Some will have to ease their way back to the world of work. In their case, a full-time training course would not be suitable. For that reason a number of part-time programmes are available, particularly for those over 35 who have been unemployed for more than three years, but more needs to be done.</P>
      <P>The recommendation from the community pillar of social partnership is being explored. The real economy and the social economy have to be separated. Voluntary organisations have a huge role to play in community development. Worthwhile work is being done in schools, for example. We have to decide what we are trying to achieve. Different things are being done with different groups. I had discussions recently with members of the working group and recommendations will be presented to Government shortly after Easter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>About 78 per cent of those who have been interviewed have left the live register for positive reasons, they are in a job, undergoing training or have returned to education. About 13 per cent of those who did not turn up for interview were still on the live register at the end of February, but they will be given a second chance. An attempt will be made to find out why they did not turn up. They may have been sick. FÁS will write to them again and they will be interviewed by the Department of Social, Community and Family <Col N="911" /> Affairs. We want to help those who want to find work, part time or full time, or to access training. This data will be of enormous benefit in terms of the strategies being pursued.</P>
    <P>It is incredible that unemployment has dropped so rapidly, from 16 per cent in 1991-92 to 6.8 per cent today, despite the fact that 44,000 have returned from abroad. It is a terrific achievement but we have to go further. Many remain unemployed but we are moving rapidly in the right direction.</P>

      <P>I have extended the LES to a number of areas. There will be further extensions shortly. The LES is doing a marvellous job with many of those on the live register. Those involved with the LES do not have to attend for interview. Some are involved in counselling and mentoring.</P>
      <P>It is important that everything works together. There is a need for co-ordination and integration. I want to ensure the LES and FÁS work closely together. There are two employment offices in Clondalkin, which the Deputy and I represent, and this causes confusion. They both have a huge role to play. I do not intend to remove the LES. I want to ensure there is a system of support measures in place which work effectively.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>Beidh a fhios ag an Teach go bhfuil an Aire Gnóthaí Eachtracha thar lear agus tá mise anseo in a ionad. The House will be aware that the Minister for Foreign Affairs is abroad on Government business. I am here on his behalf.</P>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I wish to answer all the Private Notice Questions together. The crisis in Kosovo is once again at a most acute stage. The Government is deeply disappointed that the most extensive and intensive efforts by the international community to have the parties to the conflict there, the Serbs and the Kosovo Albanians, reach agreement through the negotiations, which started in Rambouillet in February and which were resumed in Paris this month, did not succeed.</P>
      <P>As the House will be aware, the talks were adjourned after the Kosovar side signed the text of the agreement. The Paris meeting can be resumed when the Serb side is ready to sign. The Government is also disappointed that the efforts of the US envoy, Mr. Holbrooke, did not succeed in persuading President Milosevic to change his mind and sign the agreement. It has to be emphasised that the option of signing still remains open to President Milosevic. Should President Milosevic continue to refuse to sign, then we are clearly entering a new and dangerous phase of the crisis.</P>
      <P>As the House will be aware, the Belgrade authorities used the period between Rambouillet and the resumption in Paris not for the purpose of addressing the agreement text but instead to create a major build-up of their security forces, both within Kosovo and on its borders. This was a major breach of Security Council Resolution 1199 of last September which, <i>inter alia</i>, had called for a withdrawal of such forces to pre-crisis levels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the weekend we have seen the tragic results of the operations of such forces, with a major new flow of refugees and displaced persons and the return of a possible humanitarian catastrophe. The impact of this new flow of refugees and displaced persons on the earlier one of last <Col N="913" /> summer and autumn, which had only been remedied in its most acute aspects, should not be underestimated in terms of its effects throughout Kosovo and on the strained facilities and capacities of the adjoining countries. Against this background the major priority now must be to ensure that this Serb aggression against the Kosovo Albanian population is not allowed to continue and that a humanitarian catastrophe be avoided.</P>
    <P>The gravity of the situation in Kosovo was discussed yesterday by the Taoiseach when he met the Russian Prime Minister, Mr. Primakov. Today the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, are attending the European Council in Berlin and the Taoiseach will brief his colleagues on his discussions with Mr. Primakov. In addition, the EU members of the Contact Group will be participating in the extensive discussions taking place in Berlin. In accordance with established practice, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs will report to the House on the outcome of the Berlin discussions.</P>
    <P>I would hope that the House could be in agreement today on the objectives of the international community in regard to the situation and what has to be done. Let me specify the objectives. The means to achieve a peaceful solution to this problem are available through the interim agreement which was so painstakingly worked on by international mediators and signed by the Kosovar Albanian delegation. Such signature was only arrived at after major compromise on their side, in terms of postponing their goal of independence and the disarming of the Kosovo Liberation Army. It is now up to the Serb side to compromise in similar fashion and in the realisation of the benefits which this agreement could provide for them in terms of safeguarding the integrity of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and ensuring the future of the Serb minority in Kosovo.</P>
    <P>Hard experience from Bosnia teaches us that agreements have not only to be signed but also implemented in that part of the world. The text of the agreement fully covered implementation measures, and they too would have to be addressed.</P>
    <P>The terms and demands of Security Council Resolution 1199 of 23 September are also valid and still apply in full. The demands which are most relevant and immediate today are that the Belgrade authorities end the use of excessive and disproportionate force in Kosovo and that they withdraw their army and special police forces to pre-crisis levels.</P>
    <P>As we speak, the Government is aware of the threat of imminent air strikes by NATO. The deployment of maximum pressure has avoided in the past the need to carry out such enforcement actions. The Government sincerely hopes that this can be averted even at this very late stage. In the meantime we are addressing a hypothetical situation and it would not be appropriate to speculate further on it. I can assure the House, however, that the Government is fully aware of <Col N="914" /> the gravity of the situation and developments are being monitored as closely as possible.</P>
    <P>For some time the Department has advised against travel to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. This advice still holds. We are not aware of any Irish citizens in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia who need further advice or assistance on this matter.</P>
    <P>I can confirm to the Deputy that all personnel serving with the OSCE Kosovo Verification Mission have been withdrawn on the decision of the chairman in office to withdraw the mission.</P>
    <P>In relation to the question of the European Cup match scheduled to take place in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, the Government is advising against travel to a number of Balkan states, including the FYROM, and the FAI is aware of this. The fact that the match has been postponed means that these difficulties can be avoided. Naturally we would have been concerned for the safety of football teams, officials and supporters. The question of how people deal with their air fares clearly does not arise at this stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from the Minister's reply, I want to ask specific questions and I would appreciate if the Minister would address each of them in turn. I note that the Secretary General of NATO, Mr. Javier Solana, directed that these NATO bombings take place. Is the Minister satisfied that there is a basis in international law for NATO to carry out the instructions of its Secretary General? It is a specific question and the Minister for Defence will be particularly aware of the implications.</P>
      <P>There appears to be EU support for the NATO strategy of bombing specific targets in Serbia. Is this correct? Where does the Government stand in regard to this particular policy?</P>
      <P>On what principle does the Government base its attitude to these events, particularly in relation to the UN resolutions? What specifically is the Government doing to contribute to a resolution of the conflict on our Continent? What role is the Government taking in that regard?</P>
      <P>Has the Government received any request to fly over the State or to use any of the aviation or other facilities in the State as part of this exercise?</P>
      <P>Will the Minister set out what the Government sees as the alternative, if any, to NATO's bombing of specific targets in Serbia?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>One must go back to last summer, when the Serbian authorities intensified their aggression in Kosovo. This resulted in the displacement of up to 300,000 people, homeless and shelterless, and their being driven into the mountains, and the subsequent UN Security Council Resolution 1199 to reduce that aggression, to enter into negotiations and to find a peaceful agreement. The Government has been constantly in touch with the United Nations, through the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in terms <Col N="915" /> of finding a peaceful solution. Subsequently efforts were made to bring about the agreement and compromise on both sides. We are in constant touch in relation to trying to make sure that agreement could ultimately be signed. The fact is that it has not been signed by one side. The Kosovars have signed it but the Serbs have not, and the aggression and the displacement and making of thousands more homeless continues. There are the questions of human rights and of the right of people to freedom and not to be persecuted by any state.</P>
      <P>The Government's position on human rights is absolutely clear. No one has a right to take these freedoms away from any individual in the way that has been suffered by these people. As many as 3,000 people have been killed in the past 12 months and hundreds of thousands have been displaced. The question is not a simple one of what is the international law on the question. What are the answers to that sort of persecution? One must find an agreement which brings people around a negotiating table and which can be honoured. Up to now one side has compromised and the other has not. We must continue to work towards a peaceful solution, even at this stage because there is time to pull back and that time should be used.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister accept that the NATO operation is illegal and does not have a UN mandate? Is the Minister aware that as far as President Milosevic was concerned, the stumbling block was the participation of NATO? At any stage during the negotiations in Paris, was the idea of a UN peacekeeping force mooted and if so, what was President Milosevic's reaction to that idea? Were the alternatives simply NATO or nothing? Is the Irish Government prepared to push the idea of a UN protectorate? Does the Minister accept that, far from helping the Albanian Kosovars, air strikes could have the opposite effect and that in the absence of ground forces we could witness massacres on a wide scale and perhaps even genocide? Are we playing into the hands of Mr. Milosevic?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A subtle change has taken place in NATO terminology. Is the Minister aware that Serbia was first forced to comply with international agreements for a ceasefire and political autonomy in Kosovo but that the terminology now refers to the aversion of a humanitarian crisis in Kosovo? The Petersberg tasks &ndash; Article J7.2 of the Amsterdam Treaty &ndash; include not merely humanitarian and peacekeeping missions but also &ldquo;tasks of combat forces in crisis management <Col N="916" /> including peace making&rdquo;. Is the Minister aware that we have signed up to the Amsterdam Treaty of which the Petersberg tasks are part and will Irish troops actively participate in Kosovo as a consequence?</P>
    <P>Does the Minister agree that this operation is not about saving Kosovars, it is really about saving NATO? Is the Minister aware of the statement by the US national security adviser, Sandy Berger: &ldquo;inaction could involve a major cost in credibility, particularly at this time as we approach the NATO summit in celebration of its 50th anniversary&rdquo;? Is this really about saving the credibility of NATO?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The Irish people have endorsed the Amsterdam Treaty so I will not debate that matter with Deputy Gormley. Air strikes must be an absolute last resort. It is hoped that the threat of strikes will create a circumstance where agreement can be reached and the strikes averted. The Deputy is right; it would be preferable if a UN mandated intervention was proposed. My advice is that such an action is unlikely and could probably never happen, given the different stances taken by countries who are members of the UN. We must bear in mind that Security Council Resolution 1199 was not adhered to by President Milosevic. The four elements contained in that resolution were ignored. There is no certainty that President Milosevic would accept a mandate from the United Nations when he did not adhere to one which required him to do much less and continued his aggression.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister clarify and confirm that it is the Government's view that if the threatened air strikes do not result in the agreement negotiated in Paris being signed, it is essential that the action proposed by NATO be taken to protect Kosovars from the barbarism of the Serb army? Does the Minister acknowledge that it is important that we do not see in Kosovo a repetition of what took place in Srebrenica? In the absence of NATO taking action and of the agreement being signed, what alternative does the Government propose to tackle the problem which confronts us in the region?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The football match has been postponed and its importance pales into insignificance compared with the tragedy befalling the area. It seems the Minister was not aware that the match was postponed until I informed him of this in the House. When was the FAI made aware by the Government of its view that neither the teams nor supporters should travel? Was it only when the Tánaiste said this in the House today that Aer Lingus informed the FAI that it would not fly to Macedonia? Is it as a result of Aer Lingus so informing the FAI that the FAI informed UEFA and the match was postponed? If that question had not been put to the Tánaiste and she had not made that comment, the two Irish teams and Irish supporters would be at risk of being flown into a potentially serious war zone. Why was the <Col N="917" /> Government's view on this issue not clearly made publicly known at the start of this week or even yesterday by the Taoiseach when he was given the opportunity to make his view known and bring an end to the uncertainty?</P>

      <P>The Government position was made clear in my contribution earlier. In circumstances where there is such aggression and tragic displacement of hundreds of thousands of people, with all the consequences of that, an effort is continuing to try to get an agreement which one side is prepared to support while the other has an opportunity to so do to avoid the type of catastrophe the Deputy mentioned. I, too, believe air strikes would be a catastrophe, but there is still time to avoid that. Let us hope there is enough common sense in the world to bring about a solution. I will not say here this afternoon what will happen if air strikes are carried out, but God help us if they are. Every moment in the intervening time must be used to ensure they do not happen and that opportunity rests with the people who have the responsibility for this, not with me.</P>

        <b>: </b>Will the Minister explain what he means when he invites the Dáil to be in agreement on the objectives of the international community in regard to the situation and <Col N="920" /> what has to be done? The Minister spoke in terms of safeguarding the integrity of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Does the Government oppose the demand of the people of Kosovo for self-determination and an independent state, and does it support some of the leading NATO countries in denying that legitimate demand? What does the Minister mean when he invites the Dáil to support the end of the use of excessive and disproportionate force by the Belgrade authorities in Kosovo and to withdraw their army and special police forces to pre-crisis levels? Is the Government in agreement with some level of force against the people of Kosovo by the Milosevic regime? Is the Minister not aware that the pre-crisis levels of the Serbian army and police were highly repressive of the people of Kosovo? Does he support the right of the people of Kosovo to an independent state? Does he agree this would be the best way for those people to be freed from brutal repression, with the rights of the Serb minority guaranteed? Is the Minister aware that in Serbia, despite the oppressive regime, there is a strong opposition movement to the nationalists and to Milosevic? Will he agree, therefore, that the overthrow of the Milosevic regime by a mass movement of the Serbian people, and the establishment of a genuine democracy, is the only way to create the conditions in the Balkans for the right of all peoples to co-exist in peace? Does he not agree, far from weakening Milosevic, bombing by NATO will strengthen his grip while causing immense suffering to ordinary people in Serbia, as happened in Iraq, and leave the regime intact? Will the Minister outline how that advances the interests of the persecuted people in Kosovo or the innocent people in Serbia?</P>

      <P>We support independence for Kosovo but we take into account that in the Rambouillet agreement the compromise on both sides was to defer the right of the people of Kosovo to independence and, at the same time, have a degree of autonomy which they were prepared to accept but which Milosevic was not. The first part of my contribution this afternoon referred to a peaceful solution to the problem, and I agree with the Deputy that the strengthening of democracy would be one of those vehicles. The words used here are identical to the mandate from the UN Security Council Resolution 1199 to return the forces to their pre-crisis level, bearing in mind that there is aggression on both sides.</P>

      <P>I am baffled as to the reason the Minister has not answered the five questions I put to him. I asked him if there is a lawful basis for these acts? What are the alternatives in the view of the Government? Surely the Minister has discussed these issues at Cabinet. I also asked whether Ireland agrees with majority EU opinion. I do not know whether there is an EU majority opinion on this. I do not know the answer to any of those questions. This would not <Col N="921" /> be tolerated in any other parliament and it is indicative of how bad matters have become in this House. I will try again. If there is to be an alternative to NATO bombing, presumably at some stage peace enforcement becomes an issue. Given that the Government has done a complete U-turn on Partnership for Peace, are we prepared to become involved in peace enforcement, for example? What consideration has been given to that? Have we been requested for any overflight facility or refuelling or landing facilitates? We still do not know the answer to that question.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister agree our whole approach to security and defence issues is not one of a neutral state but of a neutered state? We are like an ostrich with our head in the sand. We pretend these things do not happen and we do not contribute to their solution. Does the Minister agree that not only are we like an ostrich but we are like a neutered one and are not taking our responsibilities seriously in these matters? A crisis like the one in Srebenica can happen a dozen times over but this country will sit on its hands without a thought out policy. Will the Minister answer the questions put to him in a civilised way before he raises the temperature of this House unnecessarily on this most important issue?</P>

      <P>Arising from a remark the Minister made that he would prefer a peaceful resolution, is he pressing for a deferral of the threatened bombing, particularly in view of the fact that the Russian Prime Minister, who was on a visit to Ireland yesterday and who was met by the Taoiseach, indicated that the bombing of Serbia and Kosovo defied commonsense and that all diplomatic and political options had not yet been tried?

      <P>That position was unanimously agreed by the European Union. In light of that, has the European Union a common position on the current proposed action by NATO? Have there been bilateral meetings between the Minister for Foreign Affairs and his counterparts in other member states? Does he believe double standards are being pursued in this area, given that there are areas of the world where millions have died, and even today many are being slaughtered? I refer to Indonesia, East Timor, the Kurds in Turkey and the Great Lakes region where millions have died over the past ten years. NATO is planning to bomb a country in Europe when those other regions are literally bleeding to death and we have no proposals from anybody that these areas should be bombed into submission or into peaceful negotiations?</P>

      <P>It would be unusual for people in Europe to take the position that because one is unable to solve all the problems in different parts of the world one should not try to do whatever one can to solve this crisis. We must bear in mind that the threat of force brought about the circumstances in which the Dayton Agreement could be honoured in Bosnia-Herzegovina where <Col N="925" /> people's lives are beginning to have some semblance of normality. It was the threat of force that achieved that; nothing else was able to achieve it. Like the Deputy, I regret that those circumstances arise. In this instance it is hoped that the threat of force will create the same result. There is still time for it to happen and that should also be the hope of the House.</P>

        <b>: </b>Does the Minister agree the powers that control NATO are the last people in whom the people of the Balkans can put their trust? Virtually all those powers have been guilty of imperialist conquest in the past. Does the Minister agree the cynicism of the Milosevic regime is mirrored by the cynicism of those imperial powers within NATO? For example, NATO ignores the democratic rights of the Kurdish people in Turkey, which is an important member of NATO, while professing to stand for democratic rights in the Balkans. While it is true that Milosevic will hardly tremble at the thought of a debate in this Chamber about the horrors in the Balkans, nevertheless the Irish people can play an important role by taking an independent stand on this crisis and by saying clearly that the crude and barbaric method of bombing is not the way to defeat Milosevic.</P>

      <P>I want the House to agree, by virtue of this amendment, that we need to adopt a new approach to establish a fairer society. We have unprecedented funds at our disposal with an expected current surplus of £2,300 million. It is in that context that I want the contrast to be made with the moneys we are making available through the social welfare budget. This is not really a criticism of the Government. I am trying to get a united view of this House, of which the Government might take notice and which might be of support to whoever is Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs when the next budget negotiations take place, that we want future social welfare budgets to reflect the unprecedented wealth in the economy and, in particular, the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>If we are in favour of a fairer society, we must be prepared to accept a different approach, one which is predicated on the enormous moneys now available for the achievement of that fairer society. We must aim for and work towards the achievement of that fairer society and one way is to use the device I propose in this amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>I warmly support this amendment which concerns a report on the current budget surplus in 1999. I referred, in the context of amendment No. 3, to the timing of changes in social welfare benefits. The overall picture has been painted well by Deputy O'Keeffe.</P>
      <P>I cited a couple of reports on Committee Stage, particularly the ESRI report of 27 October 1998, in which Tim Callan, Brian Nolan and John Walsh, the authors of an interesting paper called &ldquo;Income Tax and Social Welfare Policies&rdquo;, conclude that, with current policies, recent budgets have favoured higher earners. They say that if we continue past policy trends, with social welfare rates increasing more slowly than average incomes, we will see a rise in poverty in coming years. An anti-poverty strategy cannot rely wholly on growth in employment or increased welfare rates, it must combine each of these with broader measures to reach the target reductions in relative poverty.</P>
      <P>This report shows that up to the 1997 period our expenditure on social welfare, as a percentage of GDP, fell from 12.5 per cent in 1987 to 9.8 per cent in 1997. The authors of this report and the authors of the recent CORI report also note that we spend the lowest percentage of national income on social welfare support in the EU, apart from Portugal. We must put into that context the various improvements in social welfare this year, on some of which I have commended the Minister.</P>
      <P>At a private meeting yesterday of the Committee on Family, Community and Social Affairs, of which I have recently become vice-chairman, we decided that one of the topics we intend to study is the performance of the Department in reaching, by 2007, the target in the NAPS report in regard to 5 to 10 per cent of those living in poverty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="929" /> The overall figures are not impressive when looked at in global terms, as Deputy O'Keeffe has noted. In terms of fiscal performance, the social welfare segment of the budget has fallen from 36 per cent of fiscal expenditure in 1992 to 32.3 per cent in the recent budget. In the recent budget the poorest 30 per cent of the population gained 2 per cent less than the richest 10 per cent. The bottom line is that the massive income increase obtained by the country in the past four or five years, especially in the past two years, has not been reflected in the targeting of extra resources at the areas of greatest deprivation.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in common with many of his predecessors, has not been prepared to grasp the nettle of poverty in our society. However, this Minister is different from all previous Ministers in that he has at his disposal resources about which other Ministers could only dream. That is the essence of this amendment which has been tabled by Fine Gael. The Minister has the wherewithal to, if he so wishes, reach the NAPS targets and effectively abolish poverty from our society, in regard to the spend of £5.2 billion on social welfare. Once again, he is not prepared to be the man who used the greatest opportunity in Irish history to launch a definitive war on poverty and to rid our society of it.</P>
    <P>This is exacerbated by the difficulties resulting from the decisions made by the Government on regionalisation. The Minister is lucky that his constituency is one of the 13 which will have Objective One status for the next five years, with the possibility of Objective One in transition status after that. The Taoiseach and his colleagues are working busily today trying to nail down the best possible deal for this country. However, many Deputies, including myself, represent areas in which there are still grotesque unemployment rates of between 40 and 60 per cent and tens of thousands of children are living in poverty.</P>
    <P>Many community leaders, including politicians, say glibly that we are a wealthy community. Some people are wealthy and about one third of the population are struggling to get by in relative prosperity, but one third of the population are still existing from hand to mouth and from day to day. Given the massive budget surplus this year and the projections for the next three or four years, it is outrageous that the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs&mdash;</P>

Unfortunately, it was not distributed evenly across the population. Various figures could be mentioned and I am sure the Minister will say that the increases he secured are unprecedented. Nonetheless, we must be aware of this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of unemployed people has reduced to a record low and recently the number of social welfare recipients has also fallen. That must be reflected in how we look after those who are in receipt of such payments. At a time when there is such an Exchequer surplus, the Minister must fight harder at the Cabinet table to ensure that a bigger share of the nation's wealth is given to those who are less well of, many of whom live from hand to mouth. I attended a meeting of business people and retired business people recently and social welfare expenditure was mentioned. A person in receipt of unemployment <Col N="931" /> assistance receives £70 per week while a single parent with one child is in receipt of £83 per week. This brought home to many people who attended the meeting that it is virtually impossible to survive in reality. We must distribute the country's wealth more evenly. I hope the Minister will not trot out a ream of statistics and will face up to the reality.</P>

      <P>Deputy Broughan stated that the Joint Committee on Social, Community and Family Affairs was examining the NAPS issue. I am delighted that is the case and, since I took stewardship of my Department and the Government took up office, our record on this issue exceeds that of all our predecessors. Recently during Question Time I stated that the targets outlined in regard to NAPS by the then Government were not ambitious and I instanced that we have virtually reached the unemployment target already, well within the NAPS timespan, and it is probably the most important poverty indicator. I still firmly believe that the way to eliminate poverty in society is to create jobs and this Government has presided over job creation during the past 20 months. The live register figure has reduced by more than 50,000 and is still reducing &ndash; between April 1997 and September 1998 96,000 jobs were created. That is the way to deal with poverty.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Keeffe requested a philosophical debate. However, action is much better than such a debate. The Government has taken action by reducing the live register figure by 50,000 and creating jobs. The Deputy said the Government has huge amounts of money at its disposal. While there is an Exchequer surplus for the first time in many years, we must also take cognisance of the fact that rainy days will return and could do so quickly. The Deputy said that four or five years ago we did not foresee what has happened and he is correct. I recall taking part in an away day meeting of my party in the Slieve Russell hotel a number of years ago at which a number of economists spoke. They told us that the boom would continue for at least the next five years. I am always acutely aware of the wisdom within my party and it is probably no different from that in other parliamentary parties.</P>

      <P>One of my colleagues said to a leading economist that he and his colleagues did not foresee what has happened five years ago and he had to admit that he was correct. Economists did not foresee that there would be such an economic boom. It is a simple illustration of how it is <Col N="932" /> absolutely vital we use our current resources wisely and not in a spendthrift way. I would love to be able to spend more, as would the Government.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Keeffe referred to the fact that the social insurance fund is in the black but we must look down the road when there will be much more dependence in this society than is currently the case. Currently, there are approximately 400,000 old age pensioners but in 50 years there will be more than one million. That is not a long way away.</P>

      <P>The ratio between worker and dependant will reduce significantly from 5:1 to 2:1 in 50 years but in 20 years it will also have reduced significantly. While it would be great to be able to say that we can spend every penny, Deputy O'Keeffe and others would be first to say that there are many other issues. There are many bottlenecks in the economy which prevent advancement. Deputy Broughan referred to the ESRI report on social welfare. Since the Government took up office, social welfare increases have at least equalled or, indeed, exceeded wage inflation in many cases. Between 1997 and 1999 expenditure on social welfare has increased dramatically to take into account the better circumstances that prevail. Opposition Deputies must acknowledge that.</P>
      <P>The ESRI states that £50 million must be spent over the next few years in order to break the infrastructure logjam. That must be paid for and money must be provided for people with disabilities, carers and other social welfare recipients. The number of people in receipt of social welfare is reducing. That is an indication of how the economy is being handled. With one or two exceptions, the amounts under the heads in the estimate are decreasing. That is good and should be welcomed.</P>
      <P>However, we must not forget those who are, as Deputy McGrath said, living on £83 per week. It is enlightening for those who are doing well in the economy to see what it is like to live on social welfare. That is one of the reasons this Government gave significant increases to old age pensioners in the last two budgets. It believes that, unlike other groups, they did not have a strong voice. This Government has done extremely well in its first two budgets and it will continue to do its best, taking the broader picture into account. The social welfare package amounts to £317 million in a full year. It is 49 per cent higher than the budget two years ago when the rainbow coalition left office. It is a significant increase. During the coming years when this Government and my party is in power it will be increased even further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For those reasons the amendment is not necessary. All these issues will be discussed during Question Time and at the Committee on Social Affairs. At the end of the day, the Government makes the decisions regarding the Exchequer <Col N="933" /> amounts to be given to the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and other Departments while looking at the long-term picture.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>We have reached the crunch point in the debate. My amendment is framed in an unusual way to comply with the rules of the House. I cannot say, as I would like to, that because of unprecedented moneys in the Exchequer a substantial portion of extra money should be made available for the social welfare budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the Minister on a number of issues. I agree that the money being made available is greater than in the past. I agree that the approach of trying to get more people into employment is a very fine one. I am delighted to see the employment figures increasing and long may that continue. However, that is one half of the answer to the problem of disadvantage and poverty. There are people who will not gain from the improved employment position or benefit from the Celtic tiger. It is in that context that we must be prepared to devote a share of the extra wealth in the economy and a reasonable share of the extra wealth in the Exchequer towards the have nots in society. I do not think that is being done. The contrast between the estimated £2,300 million surplus on current account and the £77.9 million extra that will be paid in 1999 as a result of the increases in the budget proves the case. We should all be prepared to make more funds available to deal with <Col N="934" /> the problems of disadvantage and poverty in society. The money is there to do so.</P>
    <P>With all due respect to the Minister, saying that in 50 years' time there will be more people drawing old age pensions is no consolation to the person trying to cope today. Of course we must have reasonable prudence but with the vast amount of money that is available we can now do the kind of things we never dreamt of doing. If we take the proposal on child benefit put forward by Fine Gael, £150 million is needed to increase child benefit from £8 per week to £20 per week for children under five years. That would make a real impact on child poverty. Why do we not do that? It is because we are locked into a timeframe in the past where we did not have the means to allow us think in those terms.</P>
    <P>I am asking people to pay more out of the moneys that are available in order to have a fairer society. It would be of benefit to the Minister if the amendment was accepted. It is the core issue in the Bill. Are we prepared to make a reasonable amount available in an effort to achieve a fairer society and make a significant impact on disadvantage and poverty? Despite what the Minister says the budget will not make that impact. That is where I part company with the Minister. The money is there to make a significant impact. We are not doing so and that is why I will press this amendment which seeks to achieve a fairer society.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 6, between lines 2 and 3, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;4.&ndash;The Minister shall prepare a report on the measures required to close the differential within the rates of weekly benefits and social assistance paid to a beneficiary and the rates paid to an adult dependant and to lay such a report before each House of the Oireachtas not later than three months from the enactment of the Act.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment deals with the position of adult dependants and an approach which should be part of the philosophy of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. There should be an effort to close the differential within the rates of weekly benefits and social assistance paid to a beneficiary and the rates paid to an adult dependant. In most instances the adult dependant is a woman. I present this amendment as pro-woman because women would gain most from closing the gap between the rate payable to a beneficiary and the rate payable to an adult dependant. That is the net issue. The gap has not been closed. I would like an indication from the House of a willingness to adopt the broad approach to close the gap and eliminate the differential so far as we can.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support my colleague as in a previous similar amendment on the question of qualified adults. On the issue of income inadequacy, next April we hope to get the minimum wage. Recently we have seen advertisements for unskilled jobs at rates of £6, £6.50 per hour and so on. It is clear the median wage rates and the average industrial wage in the economy have risen so far that we should address this gross inequity and inequality in relation to the adult dependency rates and equalisation. The Minister supplied a helpful brief on budget day, 2 December 1998. It shows for senior adult dependants on social assistance an increase from £41.20 to £44, an increase in the blind person's pension from £41.20 to £43 and for assistance an increase from £41.20 to £43.20. It is an insult to any Irish citizen to say their basic weekly income will be in the region of £40. That is what any couple might pay for a basic meal this evening in a modest place of entertainment in the city. The princely sum of £43.20 is what we offer to these people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's argument during a previous Question Time about equalisation was that the combined basic rates for the person depending on <Col N="937" /> assistance or a non-contributory pensioner would act as a disincentive. I do not see how that is possible. These rates are disgraceful. The spouse of the person on assistance at home who may not have an insurance record often does not qualify for community employment or many of the other activities which are supervised by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. Therefore, there is a double whammy effect, with people on extremely low and deplorable incomes while at the same time people are cut off from joining the workforce. Because of this equalisation is very significant. The Minister's predecessor, Deputy De Rossa, was anxious to ensure every adult would have a separate payment on which he or she could live and which would stand on its own. I put it to the House that £43.20 is a disgrace. I urge the Minister to bring forward a report on equalisation which will address this as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment. The points made by my colleague are very important. Equalisation of payments to adult dependants is the next big measure which must be addressed. I ask the Minister to examine it particularly in the context of, for example, two brothers living together and each drawing a pension. In such cases do both receive full pensions or are they treated as one adult and one adult dependant? Equally, do two sisters receive full or reduced pensions under the social welfare code? As Deputy O'Keeffe rightly said, in general it is women who are disadvantaged in this context. They miss out as they are seen as the adult dependant and therefore receive the reduced rate. It is unfair that this should happen and I ask the Minister to examine it very carefully.</P>
      <P>In the context of statistics and how the pension burden will increase over the years, the Minister referred to the possible situation in 50 years' time. It is impossible to predict the population in 50 years. Statistics produced for Ireland were based on birth rates, emigration rates, etc., which have long since been surpassed. In the early to mid-1980s there was a relatively high level of births but huge emigration rates. There are approximately 77,000 in the current cohort of 18 year olds, but the figure for 12 year olds is only 47,000. Therefore, it is impossible to predict what is going to happen so far down the road. I agree with the Minister that over the next 25 years we can reasonably accurately predict what will happen in the over 65 age group, but after that we are fishing in the dark. We should not decide policy on what might happen 50 years from now. We must examine what will happen over the next five to ten years and base our policy on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now is the time to provide for those people given the unprecedented growth and surplus in the economy. Even in bad times, if they do come, we will find the resources to look after them. I say this in the context of the early 1980s when, despite inflation running very high and a school population of about one million children, we were <Col N="938" /> able to pay social welfare increases which were nearly in line with inflation. While the number of pensioners has increased, the number of school children has dropped substantially below a million and when both figures are taken together the number of dependants balance. Over the past three or four years the numbers at work have increased, a trend which will continue in a dramatic way in the coming ten to 15 years. Therefore, the number providing for dependants will increase substantially while the number of dependants will remain relatively stable. This means we can provide better payments for those in need of them.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to carefully examine this amendment and in his reply to comment on the rules pertaining to two brothers or two sisters living together who are in receipt of contributory old age pension. Similarly, do a husband and wife, who in their own right qualify for contributory pensions, receive the full rate?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Two brothers or sisters who live together and are in receipt of the old age pension in their own right in effect receive the full rate of pension if they qualify for it. There are no restrictions in this regard. There may be some instances where spouses may not have a pension in their own right and may qualify for a lesser payment. Under the changes in the budget and brought forward in the Bill, 119,600 qualified adults will benefit in real terms as a result of the increases.</P>
      <P>We all want equalisation and Deputy Broughan referred to the fact that Deputy De Rossa wished to see it implemented. I can make a political point and say Deputy De Rossa did not go a hell of a long way in achieving this.</P>

      <P>The Commission on Social Welfare which examined this area did not set a specific minimum rate for adult dependants but recommended that the appropriate rate for a couple should be 1.6 times the basic personal rate. In other words, a qualified adult would get, at the very least, 60 per cent of the basic personal rate. I achieved that in the last budget. It was one of the issues raised on Committee Stage this time last year by Deputies on all sides of the House who validly made the point that the qualified adult rates had slipped back and that the Government's first budget in some cases did not reach the 60 per cent rate. For these reasons, and given that the budget available to me was the largest in the history of the State and 49 per cent more than the last budget of the rainbow coalition Government, we were able to increase all the qualified adult rates to equal or surpass the 60 per cent level. The increases in this respect were very significant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An issue previously introduced was the concept of tapering. The point was made about the poverty trap associated with complete withdrawal of <Col N="939" /> the qualified adult allowance and tapering was introduced in this context. I addressed this to a certain extent in the budget by extending the basic rate from £60 to £105, replacing the previous top rate of £90.</P>
    <P>All of these issues are being examined. Previously on Question Time I said an interdepartmental committee, established under my Department, is examining household income under both the tax and social welfare systems and is due to report very soon. It will address some of the issues referred to by the Deputies.</P>
    <P>It is all very well to say we should equalise payments. In the case of old age pensioners, for example, the overall increase given in the budget of December last to a couple on the old age pension was £9, £6 for the personal rate and £3 for the qualified adult. This is significant and well in excess of anything given in recent times. The Government has made significant progress in its two budgets and has fulfilled the recommendation that it should be 1.6 times the basic personal rate. For those reasons, I am not of the view the Dáil should accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I will not spend too much time on any one amendment in an effort to deal with as many as possible. It was a laudable objective to aim for the 60 per cent rate for adult dependants in the past and I am glad it has been reached. Perhaps that should be increased towards equalisation. It cannot be achieved immediately, but I would like to open the debate that the 60 per cent should no longer apply and that we should in future aim towards equalisation, mainly because of the position of women in society who comprise the majority of adult dependants.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>I reaffirm the substance of amendment No. 10 which calls for a report on closing the differential. I welcome the fact that we have reached the target of 1.6 times the basic personal rate but the fundamental issue, which is again concerned with income adequacy, is that it is deplorable and an outrage that any citizen would be expected to live on £41 a week. The Minister is in a unique position to improve on the situation. He has a golden opportunity &ndash; these are the golden years &ndash; and it is up to him to grasp that opportunity.</P>

      <P>One area which could be addressed is the making of announcements about social welfare changes at budget time, be they by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs or the media. Pensioners are inclined to read the headlines, whatever they may be. On this occasion it was that they would receive a £6 per week increase, which is a huge improvement on the increases given during the rainbow coalition's tenure. This increase is a long way from the £1.90 increase during Deputy De Rossa's tenure as Minister in the rainbow coalition a few years ago. Pensioners see the headline they are to receive an increase of £6 per week. However, it is £6 per week for the recipient and a lesser amount for the dependant, and that causes complications because a husband and wife might expect a £12 increase.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>I did. The Minister is genuine and sincere in raising social welfare rates to what he sees as an acceptable standard and in line with the report of the Commission on Social Welfare. His response just now proves he is attempting to do so and he has succeeded in that he has fulfilled the recommendation that adult dependants receive 60 per cent of the full rate. He deserves congratulations in that regard. Perhaps some <Col N="941" /> mechanism could be put in place to indicate clearly to those who will receive an increase exactly what it entails.</P>
      <P>Another anomaly relates to a pensioner, usually a woman, who may have been paying social insurance and left her job to spend some time in the family home rearing children. She finds that, had she signed for credits, she would be entitled to a full contributory pension. That is an anomaly which needs to be addressed.</P>

      <P>I compliment Deputy O'Keeffe on the rationale behind his thought processes on how to address this matter in future. It would be the view of all in the House that we should work towards equalisation if the Exchequer could sustain it. However, looking at the figures, between the last amendment and this one we would have spent the surplus to which Deputy O'Keeffe referred, and that is before dealing with people with disabilities, carers, the unemployed and others. I accept it would be preferable if we could move further than 1.6 times the basic rate.</P>
      <P>Deputy Broughan said this is a scandal over which I am presiding. He has a short memory. I do not wish to make my point in a political way but he has raised it in that way. He and his party have been in office more often over the past decade than my party or Deputy O'Keeffe's party and they have presided over this.</P>

      <P>Regarding the issue raised by Deputy O'Keeffe about why the tapering only applies to certain categories and not others, especially pensioners, it was introduced to facilitate a return to work. It is part of the review being conducted by a number of Departments of the way household income is treated under the tax and social welfare systems. The report will be available soon.</P>
      <P>It would cost in the region of £180 million to £190 million in a full year to increase the QAA to the same level as the personal rate. A total of 120,000 people are in receipt of the allowance. The cost of the 1999 social welfare package is £317 million in a full year. The Government has achieved the figure recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 6, between lines 2 and 3, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;4.&ndash;The Minister will consider the possibility of assessing applicants for non-contributory social assistance payments with actual income from capital as opposed to fictitious and artificial income.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment deals with the rates at which capital is assessed in the case of those applying for non-contributory social assistance payments such as unemployment assistance or non-contributory old age pension. The current system is unfair because of the huge drop in interest rates following the introduction of the euro. The deposit interest rate is less than 1 per cent. In spite of this, for most, capital is assessed at 7.5 per cent. Capital in excess of £20,000 is assessed at 15 per cent.</P>
      <P>Applicants should be encouraged to place their capital in a bank, credit union or post office rather than keep it under the bed. The current system, however, discourages them from so doing and, in many instances, creates an injustice through the payment of a reduced rate.</P>
      <P>I have been running a campaign to have the rates changed and some progress has been made. On Committee Stage the Minister agreed to make his officials available and said that the matter could be looked at by the Joint Committee on Family, Community and Social Affairs. That is the way forward. It should be possible to come up with a more acceptable formula, which would not prove costly, to remove this injustice. I am not looking for those with enormous sums in the bank to qualify for non-contributory old age pension. That could be the effect of a straight cut in the interest rate to 0.2 per cent. The issue was included in the work programme of the joint committee yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the thinking of my colleague on this issue on which he has been working for some time. He has raised it on numerous occasions with the Minister who has agreed to look at it. The first £2,000 of income is disregarded. The next £20,000 is assessed at 7.5 per cent. The best approach might be to raise the amount disregarded to £10,000 to remove from the net those who are vulnerable and for whom a reduction of £15 in their old age pension would have substantial consequences. A reduction in the notional interest rate could result in those with substantial sums in the bank qualifying for payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many are anxious to leave this world without being in debt. It costs a substantial amount to bury someone. A man in receipt of an old age <Col N="943" /> non-contributory pension told me recently that he had a few pounds in the bank which he believed would not be enough to bury him if his nieces and nephews were to have a bit of a party. He has £5,000 in the bank.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>This issue has been raised at Question Time and the Select Committee on Family, Community and Social Affairs. At first sight, the figures quoted by Deputy O'Keeffe, 7.5 per cent and 15 per cent, do not look right in the current climate where deposit rates are low. The rationale which prompted my predecessor, Deputy De Rossa, to introduce these rates was correct. He endeavoured to assist those with limited means to qualify. On the other hand I have given an undertaking that I would look at some way of tinkering with the system, as suggested by Deputy McGrath, although I am not altogether sure if that is the way to proceed. We can get costings. That is one of the issues which would be part of the review I have undertaken will be looked at in the Department.</P>
      <P>Deputy De Rossa stated when he was bringing this forward that a couple with capital of £20,000 would be assessed with means of £600 which would give an effective rate of assessment of only 3 per cent. That is not unreasonable. If we were to reduce the 7.5 per cent and the 15 per cent without touching the disregard of £2,000, taking into account the other issues, the figures would be astronomical and people would be able to retain full pension. For instance, if one reduced the 7.5 per cent and 15 per cent assessment to a combined 0.2 per cent without touching the disregard, a single person on OAP would be able to have a sum of £158,000 in the bank and still get the maximum pension. A married couple would be able to retain in the region of £313,000 in the bank and still get full pension.</P>
      <P>This capital assessment provision which was put in place by my predecessor compares very favourably with the capital assessment regime in the UK. As part of the exercise of the review, we looked at what was happening in the UK. Our people, particularly our old age pensioners, are much better off under our regime of capital assessment than are those in the UK.</P>
      <P>I outlined this umpteen times to Deputy O'Keeffe during Question Time. I subsequently wrote to the Deputy and offered the facility of one or two of my officials &ndash; I named two officials in my recent letter to the Deputy &ndash; who would sit down with him so that he could question them as to the rationale behind this issue because I seem to be failing to convince him. However, I accept what he said today that it is not just a matter of doing away with the 7.5 per cent and 15 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are looking at the system to see if we can more or less achieve the same thing while ensuring it is as transparent as possible in that the 7.5 per cent and the 15 per cent, from a soundbite point of view, look quite excessive. However, when one looks at the disregards and all the other <Col N="944" /> issues which are taken into account, the effective rate is much lower than those two figures.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This is something which a number of Deputies have brought to my attention. It relates to people <Col N="945" /> who worked in Britain for most of their careers. I stated on Committee Stage that unfortunately there was a massive exodus from the country in the 1950s and early 1960s, especially to the UK. Many of those senior citizens, some of whom are Dubliners, have returned to live here. Despite the fact that they qualify for free schemes, etc., they find that with the British pension on which they live they do not qualify specifically for the living alone allowance or the over 80 allowance. Perhaps the Minister should address that issue in the future.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the fact that our senior citizens tend to do much better than the UK senior citizens in relation to capital assessment. In terms of labour mobility in the EU, this is a classic case over a number of decades of a huge movement of labour from this country to the neighbouring economy, which is now returning. We have been trying to address these problems over recent years. The Minister and his UK colleague, the Secretary of State for Health and Social Services, should get together and see if they can sort out this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Broughan's amendment. It is important that we take a broad view of people who are in receipt of pensions from Britain. Some do and some do not get top ups in this country, depending on their circumstances, etc. The Minister might conduct a specific review of those people because in some cases they get a raw deal. Deputy Broughan mentioned the living alone allowance and the over 80 allowance for which they do not qualify and many of them feel disgruntled about that.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Acting Chairman has come across this in his constituency and has met people who have run into those problems, although I suppose nowadays they are all handled and solved by the Minister and the workload is easier. Nonetheless he will be aware of them and will know what is happening.</P>
      <P>Another issue which should be looked at in conjunction with this, although it is not strictly within the Minister's jurisdiction, is the question of medical cards for people with British pensions. I understood at one stage that a person entitled to a British pension automatically qualified for a medical card, but recently I was disgusted to find that this is not the case. If a person receives an Irish pension also, the medical card is not automatically granted. That is the case despite the fact that the British Government pays the Government £60 million per annum for medical services to pensioners in this country. It is something at which we must look carefully. Are we taking money under false pretences? Why do all those pensioners, who are supposed to be getting the medical treatment to which they are entitled and for which they have paid in Britain, not get medical cards? We must look carefully at how we treat pensioners who have come here from Britain and are in receipt of pensions from Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another anomaly is that an occupational pen<Col N="946" /> sion and a social security pension from Britain are not taken into account in granting the medical card. If the person has a few pounds in Ireland, he or she is not entitled to a medical card and that is not fair. In supporting this amendment I ask the Minister to look at the whole question of foreign pensions. It is a good thing that pensioners choose to come to live in Ireland. Some are Irish people who have come home and some are British people who have chosen to live in Ireland to get away from it all. We welcome them and their contribution to the Irish economy. The subscription by the British Government to our health service is also welcome. It is interesting to note that this subscription goes into the central Exchequer and not to the health boards on any notional system. I am not sure if it even goes to the Department of Health and Children.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister, in considering this amendment, to look at the details of the treatment of British pensioners in Ireland and ensure that they are treated fairly, noting our involvement with Europe and our close ties with Britain. Many of these pensioners went to work in Britain in bad times and have come home to retire. We should make sure that they are treated fairly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter has been referred to previously in committees and during Question Time. I have already instituted a review of free schemes. A review of schemes is being carried out in all Departments but this is an area I feel should be looked at intensely. The issue of the entitlements of people, particularly pensioners, coming to this country must be looked at. Deputies have previously raised what they consider to be anomalies. Many of these so called anomalies are determined by EU regulations. Deputy McGrath referred to the reported figure of £60 million coming from the UK in payment for health services. I can safely say there is reciprocation of that money in respect of our responsibility for people living outside Ireland. Some Deputies have raised the question of medical cards for British pensioners. This is not strictly relevant to my Department but I quote EU regulation 1408/71:</P>
      <P>Persons taking up permanent residence in Ireland who are in receipt of a social security pension from another EU or EEA member state who are not in receipt of an Irish social welfare pension as either a recipient or a qualified adult and who are neither employed or self-employed here, are entitled to health services free of charge irrespective of means. Medical cards are normally given in such cases. The cost of these cases is normally borne by the country which pays the social security pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the issue Deputy Broughan raised, that is the extension of the living alone allowance of £6 and the over-80 allowance of £5 to UK pensioners, these allowances are in effect increases paid to supplement the basic personal rate of social welfare pension to people who satisfy the conditions, in recognition of the extra cost faced <Col N="947" /> by pensioners. Some 107,000 qualify for the living alone allowance and some 84,000 people qualify for the over-80 allowance. These supplements are not paid to people over pension age who do not qualify for an Irish social welfare pension, for example UK pensioners. Where a UK pensioner also qualifies for an Irish social welfare pension, he or she can get these supplements, subject to satisfying the appropriate conditions. The current basic rate of retirement pension payable by the UK is £64 sterling which is considerably lower than ours.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>It is less, even taking account of the currency difference. It should be noted that a UK pensioner can also get an additional pension which is earnings related, based on his or her contributions paid since 1978. This can amount to one eightieth of their earnings in excess of the specified threshold for each year, subject to a maximum of 25 per cent. The appropriate percentage depends on the number of years since 1978 and since reaching the pension age, 65 years. In many cases UK pensioners may well be receiving a higher overall pension than Irish pensioners when they are in this country.</P>

      <P>In page 6, between lines 2 and 3, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;4.&ndash;The Minister shall as soon as may be after the passing of this Act prepare and lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report on the level of uptake of the grant towards personal security alarms for the elderly and the extent to which this relates to the level of reimbursement available.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I have a particular interest in the security of senior citizens in urban and rural areas. Deputy Callely will be aware of many very vulnerable senior citizen complexes in Dublin city. Senior citizens in rural areas are perhaps even more vulnerable especially if community alert systems are not available and people live many miles from the nearest secure area. Gardaí, furthermore, are often severely stretched.</P>
      <P>In the last Dáil, Deputies Flaherty, Hughes and others joined me on an all-party committee in trying to address some of the problems faced by our senior citizens. I welcome the increases in social welfare payments for senior citizens which the Minister has introduced. The all-party committee proposed that old age pensions be linked to the average industrial wage. That was also the desire of the Senior Citizens' Parliament, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions senior citizens' group which liaised closely with the all-party committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Committee Stage the Minister deplored the <Col N="948" /> practice of lining up senior citizens to avail of security facilities. I have here a letter from a community worker who believes that the initial grant of 90 per cent, which was reduced to 60 per cent and in some cases 30 per cent, should be restored to 90 per cent. I still receive many communications of this sort. Given the great vulnerability of senior citizens and the fact that personal security is now essential in rural and urban areas, the Minister should accept this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>Personal security has become extremely important for everyone, particularly for the elderly. Many elderly people feel vulnerable and if one visits an elderly person in the evening one hears bolts being drawn back on the door and the elderly person is very cautious when answering the door. This is a result of the atmosphere in which we live. Atrocities have been perpetrated on elderly people, although these are very few. Many are very afraid, particularly if they live alone. It is important that the initiative of Deputy De Rossa, former Minister for Social Welfare, should be followed up and as much money as possible made available to ensure that all elderly people can avail of security systems. These systems reassure an elderly person that he or she can contact someone if necessary and the elderly person will not be frightened. In many cases these systems have been found to be effective in cases where the elderly person is in danger, feels he is in danger or simply does not feel well. I ask the Minister to accept the amendment and I hope the necessary level of funding will be restored to ensure the scheme can continue.</P>

Since the <Col N="949" /> scheme is a victim of its own success, do we want it to be even more successful?

Over the years it has been in place, approximately 62,000 people have benefited from the scheme. The task force was set up soon after a particular budget when it was pointed out that the tax allowance included in that budget would not be availed of by the people who most needed these alarms because the majority of people at whom it was targeted did not pay tax. The task force recommended that resources be made available through my Department to voluntary and community groups which would deliver these services.

The parameters and estimates set by the outgoing Government were £2 million for 1996, which was spent; £2 million in 1997, which was increased by me before the first budget to £5 million; and another £2 million in 1998 which again was increased by me by £3 million to £5 million.</P>
      <P>I accept Deputy O'Keeffe's point that, to a certain extent, the scheme is a victim of its own success. One view is that while the scheme was successful in its initial phase, it should be examined. Over the past few months an interdepartmental review group, involving the Departments of Finance, Health and Children and my Department, examined it. A report is due on my desk in the coming days and we will then be in a position to decide how the scheme should proceed. While 62,000 people benefited from the scheme, most of them are living alone. The number of people in receipt of the living alone allowance is 107,000 and if we continue with the current scheme we will meet that need in a few years.</P>
      <P>The scheme must be examined, however, because I understand the report will suggest that the more preponderant issue in relation to these alarms is peace of mind. If people are living alone they may suffer a stroke or heart attack and there is nobody to help them in the house. The health issue, as opposed to the security issue, must be taken into account also. We are conscious of that and we will closely examine it in the coming months. When the report is available I will publish it but ultimately the Government will have to make a decision in regard to the future of the scheme.</P>

      <P>The decision by the entire European Commission to resign last week has thrown the European Union into crisis at a critical stage in the negotiations on Agenda 2000. In so doing they have brought to a close one period in the Union's history and I hope opened a significant debate about its future.</P>
      <P>At the heart of the Commission's decision was its own mismanagement of the allegations made against it by EU officials and an inherent flaw in the existing EU treaties which render the Parliament incapable of bringing a motion of censure against individual Commissioners. This flaw will remain even after the final ratification of the Amsterdam Treaty by the Parliament which should take place sometime after May. That Treaty, although it represents some progress in securing the democratic accountability of the Commission, falls short on a number of fronts, the accountability of individual Commissioners to the Parliament being one of them.</P>
      <P>Clearly, as my former colleague, Barry Desmond, outlined when speaking on RTE over the weekend, there is a need to fundamentally reform the manner in which the Commission disburses funds. Similarly, there appears to be general acceptance that contrary to a common public perception, the Commission itself is understaffed. Even Mr Santer's belated and inadequate defence of the Commission's position, as outlined to the Parliament, warrants careful examination. His central accusation that the Commission was perhaps deliberately underfunded by the member states may not be as extreme as one might think.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The decision taken by the Parliament last week was as much against the manner in which the Commission handled this crisis as the actual allegations themselves and for that President Santer and his Commission have nobody to blame but <Col N="952" /> themselves. Some commentators have pointed out that some of the sins that the Commissioners were accused of would count merely as venial sins if put into comparison with the behaviour of members of some national Governments. Given what we now know about the conduct of Government of this State in the late 1980s and early 1990s, this is not difficult to believe.</P>
    <P>Yet, the Parliament was correct in exercising its power in the way that it did. Perhaps for the first time, the national electorates when they vote in European elections this June will understand that the body to which they are electing people is not a toothless tiger. They may also feel that again for the first time ever they can have a say and exercise some control over the Brussels monolith. If this is the case, the Parliament's action may come to be seen as the most significant step towards enhancing the Union's democratic legitimacy.</P>
    <P>The perceived unaccountability of the Union has been one of the most fundamental problems dogging it since its foundation. Whether national Governments are comfortable with it, the only meaningful solution to the problem is to increase the Parliament's powers to hold EU officials accountable, a power which is the essence of democracy. I note reports in yesterday morning's papers that Prime Minister Blair has been talking about increased subsidiarity. While subsidiarity when appropriate is important, I do not believe its extension to other areas of policy will necessarily enhance the reputation of the Union among its citizens. It is a poor replacement for direct democratic accountability where that is appropriate.</P>
    <P>The Union's failure to tackle effectively key social and economic problems such as unemployment has also undermined its support, but that is only one half of the story. In our country, Europe has been responsible, particularly in the social field, for improving the quality of life for many citizens in the workplace, at home and in their private lives. Unfortunately, as tends to be the case, these good news stories tend to receive a lesser degree of publicity than the problems on which the Union has found it difficult to make progress. All news is bad news as we know in this world of politics.</P>
    <P>However, there is little point and some degree of irony in the comments made by some national politicians across Europe about the weakness of the European Commission as a body, particularly the current Commission. Many of those difficulties are there by design rather than accident. The inability of the Parliament to hold individual members of the Commission democratically accountable exists because national Governments decided that this should be so, a position endorsed as recently as two years ago in the negotiations on the Amsterdam Treaty.</P>
    <P>That this Commission should be weak was a deliberate political choice forced on the other member states by the then British Prime Minister, John Major, at the behest of his Eurosceptic Conservative Party. It is somewhat ironic to see the Conservatives seeking to gain political capital on <Col N="953" /> this issue from a Eurosceptic perspective when one recalls the jubilation which greeted their perceived emasculation of the very same Commission. It should also be remembered that ultimately John Major was supported by other EU leaders, exhausted by the dynamism of the Commission under the Delors Presidency that had fought vigorously to protect the influence and independence of the Commission.</P>
    <P>The reality is &ndash; this point has been made by political commentators over the weekend &ndash; that a strong Commission is in Ireland's interest, but not necessarily in the interest of the larger member states. A strong Commission acting in the interest of the Union and all its members states can act as a counterpoint to the power of the larger members states.</P>
    <P>I agree with the British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, when he says that the current difficulty presents us with opportunities as well as short-term problems. Mr. Blair's determination to set the agenda for the next couple of months in terms of the Commission is in stark contrast to the performance of our Government on the issue, but I will return to that issue later.</P>
    <P>The resignation of the Commission, particularly the President, gives rise to one opportunity, the replacement of both with more dynamic forces. The situation should serve as a springboard for meaningful debate as to an appropriate relationship between the Commission and the EU Parliament and EU citizens. It has been floated by Jacques Delors that the President of the Commission should be directly elected by Europe's citizens, as representatives of the political parties within the European parliament. In other words, the main competing political groups for the forthcoming European elections should, as part and parcel of their electoral campaign, nominate who they would like to see as President of the Commission and that depending on the outcome of those elections, the incoming Council of heads of government would be required morally, if not in any other way, to give some strength and credence to that and to select that person. This is what Delors proposes, and there have been other such suggestions as to how more democratic accountability and representation could be found for the Parliament.</P>
    <P>The question is, what role will Ireland play in this process? It is in our national interest to seek the earliest possible appointment of a new President and Commission. Even leaving aside the importance of the ongoing discussions on Agenda 2000, which may or may not conclude this week, there are other important issues to be resolved, for instance, the commencement of the new round of World Trade Organisation talks later this year.</P>
    <P>There appears to be little point in seeing the Commission resign if its members are to remain on indefinitely in a caretaker capacity. The Commission's decision to work only on urgent business in front of it is the correct one in the circumstances but is unsatisfactory from the point of <Col N="954" /> running the Union. A quick decision on replacement is needed. I welcome today's news of the appointment of the former Italian Prime Minister, Romano Prodi, but the suggestion that the acting Commissioners remain in their positions until June is unacceptable. Watching the six o'clock news this evening, which colleagues may also have seen, it would appear that Mr. Prodi will not take up his post as incoming President until July of this year. We have a <i>de facto</i> situation where Jacques Santer will be caretaker President until then at least, and this needs to be clarified between now and 9 April when these decisions will have to be more formally agreed.</P>
    <P>Mr. Prodi's qualifications for the job are unquestionable. He has experience of political affairs at the highest level and also brings the freshness of approach of somebody who has not been involved in politics for his or her whole life. The task that lies before him is not an easy one and will require courage and determination on his part. The courage he displayed as head of the olive coalition in Italy, in the transformation of Italian politics with the entry of a central left Government for the first time since 1948 and the reform of Italy's public finances to ensure it qualified to meet the Maastricht criteria and thereby enter the single currency are a testament to his extraordinary courage and leadership.</P>
    <P>Speaking on radio on Sunday, the Taoiseach appeared to be backing the Dutch Prime Minister, Mr. Wim Kok, but I have no doubt he will have few complaints about the appointment of Mr. Prodi. Mr. Kok was not available and ruled himself out of the contest. In reality the Leaders in Berlin today had but one choice before them, Mr. Romano Prodi. The fact they had only one choice is not to denigrate in any way the ability or quality of that choice. The correct decision was made in Berlin today.</P>
    <P>As I said, however, the choice of a new President is only half the job. That decision will be effective only if it is followed on by a speedy process to reappoint members of the new Commission. While there is an understandable logic in the suggestion that the new President and new Commission be appointed for a five and a half year term, there are considerable difficulties with that.</P>
    <P>The current Commission has been replaced because the Parliament could not hold individual Commissioners responsible for discrepancies within their sections. Given the importance of the issue of democratic accountability in the current crisis, it is imperative that no attempt is made to bypass the Parliament's power to acede to the appointment of the new President &ndash; powers that will come into effect upon the final ratification of the Amsterdam Treaty. That date is two months after the final national ratification papers are lodged. It is expected to come into effect at the end of May.</P>
    <P>The manner in which the Government has reacted to the current impasse is disappointing. It has been underwhelming to put it mildly. It is <Col N="955" /> hardly surprising considering the manner in which the Government has handled itself on Europe related issues since coming into office. We were not to know it at the time, but the bungling of the appointment of a Minister for European Affairs on day one was to set a trend. It has all culminated in the difficulties we experienced over the past week, which arise, in part, from a failure to explain fully to our European partners the difference between our GNP and GDP levels.</P>
    <P>Put simply, this Government's European agenda has been a particularly passive one. Such an approach has, however, proven particularly inappropriate at a time when Ireland's role and standing within the Union is undergoing fundamental change. Rightly or wrongly our European partners feel they have witnessed our coming of age in recent years. Rightly or wrongly they feel they have financially contributed to this. They now expect us to act our age.</P>
    <P>In this crisis, as in others, the Government appears satisfied to stand by and allow the larger countries dictate the agenda. As a significant member of the European Union for over 25 years, a more constructive and proactive response from the Government might have been reasonably expected. Yet there is little or no evidence that the Government has done any real thinking about securing for Ireland an influential position within the European Union in the years ahead. For instance, of the six new applicant states, Ireland has resident embassies in only three of them. There are no plans, to my knowledge, in the short-term to establish resident embassies in Estonia, Slovenia or Cyprus. Neither is there any sign of Ireland establishing our own enlargement programme to actively engage the applicant member states on a bilateral or multilateral basis. Is it not obvious to the Government that we need to develop contacts with these members states whose support we may need in the long-term to take advantage of the rebalancing between large and smaller states within the Council of Ministers?</P>
    <P>Enlargement will also place considerable difficulties on the decision-making structures of the Union, issues which, as I said earlier, were not addressed at Amsterdam. The prospect of up to six further members operating under the existing structures is a nightmare scenario. Ireland is in a unique position to offer solutions to these problems and to play a constructive role in overcoming obstacles ahead. Our 25 years of experience in the Union is admired and even envied by some of our fellow member states. It is time to put it to good use.</P>
    <P>That Fianna Fáil should be largely unaware of these possibilities and has been unable to exercise influence in the past is hardly surprising. For instance, its MEP bloc in the European Parliament, because of its isolation, carries less weight than Bernie Malone or Pat Cox.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, it is time to start asking the questions. Is the Government satisfied that further institutional reform is needed within the Union to give the Parliament more powers? If it is, why <Col N="956" /> has it not said so? Does it have a view as to whether the President of the Commission should be more directly responsible, in some fashion, to the people of Europe, perhaps elected directly by the people as candidates of the larger political groupings within the Parliament? Does it accept the Union's recent difficulties are merely symptoms of a general malaise within the Union, which undermines support for the Union among the European people and requires serious remedial action? How long does the Government think the caretaker Commission should remain in office? What view did it express to the Chairman of the European Council, Chancellor Schröder when he visited Dublin on Friday evening last? Is it satisfied the acting Commissioners, having resigned, will be left in office for at least another three months or possibly longer? Is it prepared to create the necessary impetus behind the appointment of a new Commission by indicating its readiness to move quickly on an Irish appointment? The prevarication from the Taoiseach on yesterday's Order of Business on this matter was not particularly encouraging.</P>
    <P>Thankfully the sorry saga surrounding our Commissioner has come to a close. The Government's lack of dynamism on this issue has been all too apparent. The Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, has made the position of the Progressive Democrats very clear from the outset. They said they did not wish to see Pádraig Flynn reappointed. The Taoiseach has prevaricated on the issue for months and I am certain that had the acting Commissioner not indicated his disinterest in the position, the prevarication would have continued indefinitely. When it comes down to the national interest versus minor internal Fianna Fáil squabbles, the latter will win out every time in this Government.</P>
    <P>Commissioner Flynn is to be congratulated on securing a clean bill of health from the Commission's auditors, having regard to the substantial scale of the portfolio for which he is responsible and the massive amounts of money allocated for his responsibility. In the circumstances it would have been impossible for the Government to reappoint him. From the very outset, my party has taken the view that allegations made against a person holding high public office should be answered as soon as is feasible and that continues to be our view. Mr Flynn's decision to resign and not seek reappointment has taken the heat out of the situation.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate the Taoiseach was not able to be present this evening, but I realise he is on important business elsewhere, on which I wish him the best. Yet, as he enters into what are obviously difficult negotiations, he should reflect on how he, the Government and the Minister for Foreign Affairs have pursued European policy since coming into office. A fundamental rethink by the Government of European policy is required.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have great pleasure joining my colleagues in this debate. It is an opportune time to pass some comment on events that have taken place not only in the past few months but over the past few years. Europe now stands at a crossroads. The good aspect of the recent resignation of the European Commission is that politicians all over Europe will now focus on those institutions and ask themselves the questions which were being asked in only certain quarters over the past couple of years.</P>
      <P>The leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Quinn, pointed out that the President of the recently resigned Commission was a compromise candidate. A considerable amount of lobbying occurred throughout Europe at the time he was appointed. It is not a reflection on him but a fact of life that he was a compromise candidate and that a great deal of horse trading took place before he was appointed. The final decision was not necessarily made in the interests of the European Union or the member states, which is not a personal reflection on the President. The appointment of the President of the European Commission is a serious one that requires serious thinking and input. The person required is the one most likely to have the greatest impact on bringing cohesion to Europe and implementing the various treaties. I think the person who has now been nominated will prove to be a very good President.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Quinn that the sooner the appointment takes place, the better. The less of a vacuum that exists at this time, the less the European institutions will lack credibility. The longer we procrastinate on the appointment of a new Commission and on allowing the new President to take office, the greater the degree of despondency there will be and the greater the lack of credibility trading partners outside the Union will have in the EU institutions.</P>
      <P>As I said, Europe stands at a crossroads, as was borne out by what the previous speaker said. We must reflect very quickly on what has happened. I was a member of the European Affairs Committee 15 years ago and I have observed the thrust towards European integration, the implementation of the various protocols, directives and treaties over the years and the putting in place, particularly by the last Commission, of the mechanisms which would ensure Europe moved ahead. That seems to have taken a breather and been put on the back burner in recent times. There has been a re-emergence of national interest, which is now referred to as renationalisation. Renationalisation, to which the previous speaker correctly referred, is not in the interests of the smaller countries but quite the reverse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we reflect on our recent history, we find that the more powerful trading partners were quite happy to allow the <i>status quo</i> prevail because they did best in that situation. Our almost total dependence on one trading partner &ndash; by which I mean no disrespect to that partner &ndash; coincided with our economic difficulties, for various reasons. <Col N="958" /> When we broke out of that arena and moved into the wider playing fields and when tariff barriers were removed and we were able to sell our products throughout Europe, our economy flourished. Some people in the European institutions claim that this country's economic success has resulted solely from the injection of money by the European Union, but that is not so. The real secret of this country's economic success is that it has been able to trade in the wider European market without barriers or interference.</P>
    <P>Over the past couple of years there has been interference in that trading freedom, with interference with the export of our beef products at the UK ports and by the French truck strike. This has had the effect over the past couple of years of raising questions within the European institutions, questions which should have been asked and addressed by the European Commission in the first instance.</P>
    <P>The European Affairs Committee, recognising that this was happening, sought meetings with the various Commissioners, including the Irish appointed Commissioner. To be fair to them, most of them met the committee although the President, for reasons best known to himself, did not have time to discuss these important issues. These issues may not have been important from the standpoint of the President of the European Commission, but they were important from the standpoint of the political representatives of a small EU member state.</P>
    <P>The European Commission must be alert to what is happening and what can happen in regard to enlargement. I say to those in the European institutions who say they want to improve Europe to put it on a better footing and to ensure it is more economically viable and competitive, with less barriers to trade, that Europe has not done so badly over the past 50 years. It has come forward quite a bit and removed many obstacles. We have had, and I hope will continue to have, relative peace and economic stability in Europe, which had never before been achieved in European history for such a long period of time. That came about because of the foundations laid by the founding fathers.</P>
    <P>Everyone now wants to improve Europe. Some member states have decided there should be reform of the European institutions. It is true they should become more efficient, however, the smaller countries should not become the victims of that efficiency. The danger is that that will be the case. There were serious signs of renationalisation in the previous Commission which will ultimately, if not checked, seriously affect this country's economy. I hope the new Commission will come into office quickly and will take control of those areas and address them urgently. If it does not do so problems will arise.</P>
    <P>Some member states, notably the larger ones, have proposed a second tier of the European Parliament to ensure greater representation. Ironically, the numerical effect of that will be that the larger member states will have greater influence <Col N="959" /> emanating from that second tier. That is sad, but it is the case.</P>
    <P>The point raised by Deputy Quinn is important. It is in this country's interest to have a strong Commission that acts independently and is not immune to the views of member states or impervious to the representations made by them, but which is not the pawn of any one member state. The Commission must be fair and impartial. It remains to be seen whether the new Commission will achieve that. However, if it does not, Europe will not become the effective economic, social and political entity which it can be. That is the important aspect from our point of view.</P>
    <P>As others have said, Europeans perceive Ireland at the moment as having done extremely well as a result of our membership of the EU. I remind them and the House that we also paid quite a high price for our membership. Prior to our membership of the EU we had the protection of tariffs and trade barriers, albeit trading with mostly one partner. We lost that for the motor assembly, tyre manufacturing, textile, clothing and boot and shoe industries. I have reminded our European colleagues of that on several occasions and at various meetings. They do not seem to know or understand that we initially paid a high price for our membership. It does not necessarily follow that we should have to pay a price again.</P>
    <P>We should not apologise for being good Europeans and a constructive influence within Europe and for pointing out to our stronger and more powerful colleagues that they have also benefited to a large extent from membership of the Union. The gravy train runs not only in one direction. It is true that Ireland has received billions of pounds in supports over the years but other member states have derived huge economic benefit even though they might not want to recognise it.</P>
    <P>With regard to the recent discussions on Structural Funds and Objective One status, it is not good for a Government to make a submission just for the laugh. I am not suggesting that is why it was done as I am sure there were other reasons, cogent or otherwise. However, if it goes down that road it puts Ireland in a position where it cannot be treated seriously. It is a dangerous way to go and diminishes our credibility on the international stage. We are good and constructive Europeans. Why should we become facile and decide for political purposes that this looks good and the people at home will love it? Others look at this and see what we are trying to do. If we do not treat European institutions seriously, they will not treat us in a similar manner, therefore, it is up to us if we want to be treated seriously. A great deal more could have been done to identify a mechanism through which funding could be channelled in future and it can still be done.</P>
    <P>Our colleagues in France and Italy continually raise institutional reform which will ultimately <Col N="960" /> lead to the abolition of the right of smaller member states to a Commissioner. I am sure Commissioners represent far flung regions within the Union equally but I would be happier if I were guaranteed that Ireland would still have a Commissioner in future. On many occasions it has been suggested that there cannot be 25 members in the Union. America comprises 50 states and it has no difficulty. The administrative problems involved have been faced before and, no doubt, will be again. Therefore, it is not true that the number of people around the boardroom table will be so large that they cannot administer. The excuse that the number of Commissioners must be reduced, thereby removing representation for smaller members, is not valid.</P>
    <P>Of course, it should not be looked at on the basis that a Commissioner represents a country. He or she represents the Commission and is supposed to be totally independent in that role. Each country in the Union is supposed to be treated equally. Every manufacturer in the EU is supposed to gain equal access to all parts of the Union, without exception. For example, German, Italian and French motor manufacturers are entitled to distribute their products in all member states without interference, impediment, embargo or surcharge. Likewise, Ireland is entitled to export its products to all countries within the Union without impunity. That is how the EU and the Single Market is supposed to operate. When internal subsidisation or other mechanisms are introduced to assist business within the Union barriers are put up which are reminiscent of the old days.</P>
    <P>The old days were not good for Ireland and it is essential that that is remembered at this juncture in EU institutional review. It is not long since Ireland first achieved a trade surplus and now it has a healthy surplus annually. However, that was not always the case and, consequently, our predecessors travelled the world in order to obtain employment and eke out an existence. That is the saddest reflection of the system that prevailed heretofore. However, it highlights the fact that our membership of the EU must be supported and continued.</P>
    <P>Subsidiarity was trotted out in recent years and everybody wondered what it meant. It was mentioned a great deal during the referenda on the Maastricht and Amsterdam Treaties. Some member states saw it as a means whereby the people would have a greater affinity with the decisions taken at European level, have influence over them and identify with them. Smaller countries forgot that subsidiarity could also mean that the major powers would have an ever increasing influence within the Union on its policy. That is precisely what happened and Ireland should have been alert to that because smaller powers, economically, socially and politically, will always lose out in that battle.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="961" /> Naturally, if the four big powers get together it is not to Ireland's advantage if they want and get something that is of common interest to them. They had all the power and influence in the old days and dictated what happened socially, politically and economically. They left a trail of disaster behind them for a long time. Therefore, they have nothing to teach the rest of us. However, the loss of sovereignty for smaller countries was minimal and they can say to their larger colleagues that in return for their loss of sovereignty and independence they have had peace for more than 50 years, which has been a very important ingredient in the evolution of the Union.</P>
    <P>It is imperative that the new Commission is appointed quickly and addresses the tasks ahead knowing that for Europe to progress into the next millennium it is essential that it learns lessons from its evolution over the past 50 years. A caretaker Commission is not a realistic option. A new Commission must be appointed quickly and given its tasks so that it can carry them out. Ireland has had much to be grateful for in terms of the EU. It has made a major contribution to it and still has a great contribution to make. I totally reject the suggestion in some quarters that Ireland benefited from a gravy train to which it did not contribute. However, we need to treat European institutions seriously.</P>

    <P>I am speaking in place of my ministerial colleagues in the Department of Foreign Affairs who are, as we all know, occupied elsewhere on vital national business in which I know the entire House wishes them well.</P>
    <P>This is a very important week for Ireland in its relationship with the European Union; a relationship which has had a dramatic impact on our society and economy over the last three decades. Because of this ongoing impact, the standing and effectiveness of the Union's executive must be of grave concern to us. It is right that we should take a step back from the controversies that led to the unprecedented resignation of the entire Commission and reflect on each element of the future direction of the Commission, the balance of powers within the Union's institutions and our relations with the different institutions. In addition, the importance to Ireland of the effectiveness of our Commissioner is worthy of comment.</P>
    <P>There is absolutely no doubt the Commission's resignation signifies an extremely significant development with long-term implications. It represents a landmark of accountability, the spirit of which must be responded to by each of the Union's institutions. For our part, through our representation in the Council and our involvement in the formation of the new Commission, we must do all we can to ensure the Commission continues to be a dynamic force for the betterment of Europe.</P>
    <P>In this debate it is important that we fully set out the context for recent events and appreciate the various structural reforms which are already under way. This should not be a shallow points-scoring exercise; we need balance and reflection to inform our discussions.</P>
    <P>The immediate reason for the resignation of the Commission of the European Communities in the early hours of 16 March is well known. Having seen the report of the Committee of Independent Experts regarding fraud, mismanagement <Col N="963" /> and nepotism in the Commission, all 20 Commissioners resigned in light of the virtual certainty that the European Parliament would otherwise pass a censure motion under Article 144 of the Treaty establishing the European Communities, which would have obliged the members to resign as a body.</P>
    <P>To pass such a censure motion would have required a two thirds majority of the votes cast in the Parliament. The size of the vote against the Commission in the Parliament on 14 January, when it narrowly avoided censure, left little doubt that this majority would have been present for a censure motion tabled after publication of the report of the so-called &ldquo;Wise Men&rdquo;. In these circumstances, the President and the other members of the Commission resigned pre-emptively. As has been said previously by my colleagues, the Government respects that decision. A Declaration by the Council, issued on Monday, following discussion of the matter at the Conclave of Foreign Ministers, similarly &ldquo;notes and respects&rdquo; the Commission's decision. I will return later to other elements of that declaration because it encapsulates the approach of the Council, fully shared by the Irish Government, towards finding a way forward in this matter.</P>
    <P>The deeper meaning of what has occurred has already generated a great deal of comment and forms the essential core of both the Labour Party's motion and the Government's amendment. The resignation of the Commission is an unprecedented event in the 40 year history of the European Union. In bringing it about, the European Parliament has made an important shift in the balance of accountability within the Union, both in its own favour and to the benefit of the Union as a whole.</P>
    <P>The Council of Ministers, which until the Commission's resignation had remained at one remove from the dispute between the Commission and the Parliament, is fully engaged in the task of putting in place a strong Commission capable of taking action as needed. The Heads of State or Government of the member states, meeting today and tomorrow in Berlin, have shown themselves to be eager to retake the initiative while complying with the procedures specified in the Amsterdam Treaty.</P>
    <P>As I have said, I believe this debate should be firmly grounded in the facts. Over the 40 year history of the Union, the Commission has grown to the point where it employs some 6,000 officials of 15 nationalities under the political control of a President and 19 other Commissioners. Under the current Treaty, the President has few powers over the Commissioners. The Santer Commission, ironically, is the first Commission which set out, under the President's direction, to modernise its own administration, in particular by improving organisation, personnel management <Col N="964" /> and financial control and by introducing greater transparency in keeping with the letter and spirit of the Amsterdam Treaty. A major report on Commission reform, which has been under preparation for many months, is scheduled to be presented to the European Council in Cologne in June. President Santer saw it as the blueprint which he would bequeath to his successor. While acknowledging the serious issues which led to the Commission's resignation, it would be grossly unfair to ignore this work. Unfortunately for the Commission, the necessarily painstaking process of reform moved too slowly, particularly in the eyes of the European Parliament.</P>
    <P>The directly elected members of the European Parliament face elections in June. A high level of participation in these elections would be good for the Parliament and the Union as a whole. As my party's director of elections for last year's referendum on the Treaty of Amsterdam, I have direct experience of the difficulty of capturing the interest of Irish voters for European affairs, critical as they are to the welfare of every one of us. I hope, for future referenda and elections, the other parties which also espouse a positive attitude towards our European experience will also run national campaigns in order, at very least, to respond to incessant misrepresentations and occasional conspiracy theories of Europe's determined opponents in this country.</P>
    <P>MEPs of all 15 nationalities share the difficulty of mobilising voters to turn out in European elections. In this context, some issues are more potent than others. There is no doubt the Parliament's assertiveness in relation to the financial and administrative affairs of the Commission will have heightened the public's sense of the Parliament's role. I hope the forthcoming campaign will be used as an opportunity to focus on a more positive agenda.</P>
    <P>The motion tabled by the Government acknowledges the key role played by the European Parliament in highlighting the issues on which the Committee of Independent Experts reported &ndash; namely fraud, mismanagement and nepotism in the Commission. The Government, however, does not share the somewhat simplistic view expressed in the Opposition motion that it automatically follows that the Parliament should, on this account, be given further and greater powers beyond those already to be provided, particularly in regard to the appointment and monitoring of the Commission. As I shall outline later, the powers of the Parliament are already to be significantly enhanced by the Treaty of Amsterdam and particular measures are included in relation to the appointment of the Commission.</P>
    <P>I will place on record the mandate and the essential findings of the Committee of Independent Experts as this is essential to a sound assessment of subsequent events. The primary task of the committee, in accordance with its terms of <Col N="965" /> reference, was to &ldquo;seek to establish to what extent the Commission as a body or Commissioners individually bear specific responsibility for the recent examples of fraud, mismanagement and nepotism raised in Parliamentary discussion&rdquo;. The scope of the report which issued on 15 March is limited to this matter. The responsibility of the Commission services, as distinct from that of the Commission as a body and of specific Commissioners, will be addressed in a second report expected in May.</P>
    <P>The committee examined six specific areas where fraud or mismanagement has been alleged, namely, tourism; Mediterranean programmes; the European Community Humanitarian Office; the vocational training programme (Leonardo da Vinci); the security office and nuclear safety. It also investigated allegations of favouritism by six Commissioners, specifically, Commissioners Cresson, Liikanen, Marin, Pinheiro, Santer and Wulf-Mathies. It did not find any instance of direct or personal involvement by a Commissioner in fraudulent activities. It found no proof that any Commissioner had gained financially from fraud or mismanagement. It did, however, find instances where the Commission as a whole bore responsibility for fraud or mismanagement.</P>
    <P>With one qualification, the report does not find the individual Commissioners concerned with the six areas examined solely or even mainly responsible for mismanagement. It did find that one Commissioner failed to act in response to known and continuing irregularities over several years and failed to inform the President of the Commission and, through him, the Parliament of the problems relating to the Leonardo Da Vinci programme. The Commissioner involved was Commissioner Cresson.</P>
    <P>While not accepting that inadequate resources excused the human resource problems identified, the report concluded that the Commission as a whole, or previous Commissioners, bear responsibility for not providing the resources needed to implement programmes properly in the six areas examined. Other management failings were identified such as failure to set priorities, to assess in advance the volume of resources required for new policies and to lay down in advance how new policies should be implemented. The report found control and audit mechanisms and procedures for investigating the responsibility of individual officials for irregularities inadequate.</P>
    <P>The report found no justification for the allegations of favouritism against three of the six Commissioners about whom this allegation was investigated. It found that Commissioner Cresson bore responsibility for one instance of favouritism, that Commissioner Wulf-Mathies used an inappropriate procedure to recruit a person to her personal staff and that Commissioner <Col N="966" /> Pinheiro should not have employed a close relation of his to work in his private office.</P>
    <P>These findings, while undoubtedly serious, would not perhaps have precipitated the Commission's resignation were it not for the far graver finding of a failure by Commissioners to accept responsibility for what was happening in their areas. The committee observed that Commissioners pleaded that they were not aware of what was happening in their services. The report judged such protestations as &ldquo;tantamount to an admission of loss of control by the political authorities over the Administration they are supposed to be running&rdquo;. More than any other element, the conclusion of the report concerning responsibility was felt by the Commission to have discredited it as a body and made it necessary for it to resign <i>en masse</i>.</P>
    <P>In its declaration of 21 March which I touched on earlier, the Council considered that a new Commission should be appointed as rapidly as possible and in compliance with the procedures specified in the Treaty of Amsterdam. The Council expressed its expectation that the Commission would remain in office until then as provided in the current treaty and that it would resolutely represent the interests of the European Union to the outside world as well. I need hardly say that the Government, like the Council of Ministers, attaches importance to the Commission's remaining operational role in dealing with the tasks immediately before us, especially Agenda 2000. As such, today's agreement on the nomination of Romano Prodi to serve as Commission President is very welcome.</P>
    <P>The Council declaration goes on, without ignoring the criticism levelled by the European Parliament or the situation described in the report of the independent experts for which the Commission assumed political responsibility in resigning, to record its thanks to the Commission and its staff for its committed work in the interests of the European Union. The Government shares this sentiment. It should not be forgotten that the Santer Commission made a significant contribution to important strategic decisions of the European Union,<i> inter alia</i>, in relation to the euro, the future financing of the Union and enlargement.</P>
    <P>This country has particular reason to be grateful to the Santer Commission for the support it gave to the peace process in Northern Ireland. Various parties in this House have formed relationships with some of the Commissioners who were directly affected by the committee's report and have been appreciative of their work.</P>
    <P>The Council declaration affirms the Union's need for a strong Commission capable of taking action. It states &ndash; this is a very important element &ndash; that the Commission's democratic legitimacy will be strengthened by the increased involvement of the European Parliament as pro<Col N="967" /> vided for in the Amsterdam Treaty. It observes, soberly, that under that treaty, the rule of openness and closeness to citizens applies to all institutions of the European Union. This includes the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament as well as the Commission which, at this point, is the institution undergoing scrutiny.</P>
    <P>The question thus arises as to where we go from here. It is clear that none of the institutions of the Union, including the Parliament, would actually have wished to see developments unfold as they have. It does not serve the Union or the cause of European integration well to have an institution as central and valuable as the Commission weakened. Ireland has traditionally and rightly recognised that a strong and effective Commission is the engine of the Union and, as guardian of the treaties, the greatest guarantor of the interests of smaller member states. We have no interest in contributing to the arguments of sceptics who may relish the undoubted difficulty faced by the Union as a whole in the wake of these resignations. We are all involved; the European Council must make decisions in the coming weeks which are a full and effective response to the loss of confidence in the Commission, which are consistent with the letter and spirit of the Amsterdam Treaty and which set in motion a revitalisation of the Commission and its relationship with the Council and Parliament. With regard to these latter two points, the Government motion specifically refers to the forthcoming entry into force of the Amsterdam Treaty. Though not the subject of significant public attention at the time of its ratification, the Amsterdam Treaty provides for a very significant input from the Parliament into the process of selecting a new Commission President and, through him or her, to the nomination of individual Commissioners.</P>
    <P>Specifically, the new treaty contains provisions designed to strengthen the authority of the President of the Commission within the collegiate structure of the Commission. This will be done in three ways. First, the new treaty will amend the provisions under which the European Parliament is to be consulted before the Governments of the member states, by common accord, nominate a person to be President of the Commission. The new provision will require that &ldquo;the nomination shall be approved by the European Parliament&rdquo;. Since the nomination of the President of the Commission will have been specifically approved, not only by the member Governments but by a vote in the Parliament before the other members of the Commission are appointed, the effect of this provision should be to strengthen the political authority of the President <i>vis-à-vis</i> the other members. Second, the treaties provide that the Governments of the member states shall nominate the other members of the Commission &ldquo;in consultation with the nominee for President&rdquo;. <Col N="968" /> This will be amended to read &ldquo;by common accord with the nominee for President&rdquo;. The college of Commissioners as a whole will remain subject, as at present, to approval by the Parliament. Third, the authority of the President of the Commission will also be strengthened by the addition of a new provision to Article 163 of the EC Treaty and equivalent articles in the other treaties. It will provide that &ldquo;the Commission shall work under the political guidance of its President&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>These provisions are very significant steps in enhancing the democratic nature of the choice for Commission President, while preserving the concept of collective responsibility which is vital for an independent and effective Commission. The Government's amendment calls attention to the provisions of the new treaty which will be respected in the decisions to be made by the European Council.</P>
    <P>I would like at this juncture to correct any misapprehension concerning the question of democratic control within the Union as a whole. The public does not greatly distinguish between the institutions of the Union, and a difficulty for one is a difficulty for all. It is, however, not the case that the Union is undemocratic and insensitive to the wishes of European citizens. The Commission has until now been appointed by the Council, which is made up of elected representatives who are directly connected to their electorates by virtue of mandates received in national elections. The addition of the role of Parliament, provided for by the new treaty, will add a dimension of democratic input which is valuable, but which does not alter the fact that democratic input has always been an important part of the institutional balance within and between Union institutions.</P>
    <P>Member states are the implementing agencies for European legislation. There is an extent to which it is easy to use the catchphrase &lsquo;democratic accountability' while ignoring the fact that national Parliaments and the executives which are accountable to them, have a very large degree of influence. We may have all failed in the task of linking with our electorate on these matters, but this will not be addressed by downgrading the significance of national Governments and Parliaments in the Union's decision-making procedures.</P>
    <P>While it required the refurbishment which informed the Amsterdam Treaty, the current balance of powers between the institutions has served both Ireland and Europe well. For a small and peripheral state such as ours, being reduced to the level of a constituency rather than a member state with considerable rights to enable it to protect its own interests, would do us immense damage. We have seen in recent weeks how the strong and assertive position, which we have through the significance of the Council of Ministers, has played an absolutely central role in winning vital concessions for this country. Both the <Col N="969" /> Taoiseach and the Minister for Agriculture and Food are accountable to our citizens and they have been able to ensure that the interests of our citizens are properly considered at the highest level when key decisions on the Union's future have been taken. It is highly unlikely that we could have achieved so much if the essential balance of powers and responsibilities now in place in the Union were overturned.</P>
    <P>It is the task of all of us, Council, Commission, European and national parliaments to exercise and demonstrate that democratic link to what our citizens want. The European Commission plays a vital role as initiator of legislation and as the initial point of sifting through proposals to ensure consistency with the treaties, equity between member states' interests and feasible but compelling timetables for implementation. Our public life here in Ireland has been transformed as we have brought our legislation in almost every field of activity into line with European initiatives inspired, negotiated and implemented by an able and effective Commission. This is why the Government motion refers to a strong Commission; one which is capable of retaining its central role in the complex nexus which governs Europe. This is why, for example, we would see adequate resourcing of the Commission for the tasks which it is given as an appropriate longer-term response to the current criticisms, rather than an effort to reduce Commission activities or influence.</P>
    <P>In parallel with this retention of the rightful central role of the Commission, there is an equally compelling need for the work toward reform which is already under way to be carried forward as well as early implementation of anti-fraud measures. The Commission was already in the process of re-casting itself for a different role in advance of enlargement. The Parliament has legitimately asserted its right of oversight in relation to the Commission. Such a right is a necessary counterweight to a strong institution. Such a right carries with it the responsibility to work with and not against the other principal guarantor of democratic control and responsibility, the Council of Ministers.</P>
    <P>I know the Heads of State or Government will, at their meeting in Berlin, respond to the requirement for effective and clear action. I hope all the other institutions of the Union can then support this course of action with a view to restoring momentum and credibility to a new Commission which will have the task of implementing the decisions made under Agenda 2000.</P>
    <P>It should be obvious to us all that the Commission has been a good friend of Ireland in many ways and that central to this has been the exceptional ability of the Commissioners whom we have nominated.</P>
    <P>Mr. Ray MacSharry was a brave Commissioner <Col N="970" /> who piloted through major reforms and won the hard-earned respect of leaders throughout the world. In this he also achieved major things for this country.</P>
    <P>His successor Padraig Flynn has stood out for his many achievements as Commissioner in the demanding and diverse Social Affairs portfolio. He has been innovative and effective across the wide range of his responsibilities and has won the respect of most of those predisposed to receive him negatively when he was appointed. Pádraig Flynn has been the Commissioner with whom I have had the most dealings since my appointment and I acknowledge the pivotal role he has played in developing a large number of progressive policies and programmes. I have always found him to be completely on top of the issues and it is clear he commands great respect from his officials. Because of his work, major funding has come to this country to support initiatives directly targeted at helping disadvantaged groups particularly in the education sector. New education, training and employment opportunities have been opened up for marginalised groups. I have no doubt that many of these would not have been possible without the active support of Commissioner Padraig Flynn. He deserves our thanks for his work.</P>
    <P>The quality of our Commissioner matters; we have established a reputation of nominating people of the highest calibre from any side of the House, who can make a major contribution to the development of the European Union. The Government is committed to ensuring we will protect and enhance this tradition through the appointment of the new Commissioner. Today's agreement by the Council to nominate Romano Prodi for confirmation as President of the Commission is the essential first step in this process. He will now be involved in confirmation proceedings of the Parliament. Once this is complete an agenda will be developed to address the many issues which have arisen and to consult with the national governments on the formation of the full, longer-term Commission. The Government will seek to appoint a person who can carry on and enhance the traditions of our representation on the Commission. I have no doubt we will be able to do so.</P>
    <P>This has been a difficult time for the Commission and the Union as a whole, but it can emerge stronger and more effective. To do this, it must complete important reform already under way and comprehensively address the many structural weaknesses which have been identified. For our part, the Government will do all it can to help the Commission in this work and we will ensure the person nominated by us to the Commission will be capable of fully participating in the ongoing project of building a European Union which is both effective and accountable.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to have an opportunity to contribute to this motion on the European Commission and to welcome the news that Romano Prodi has been selected to be the next President of the Commission, subject to confirmation by the European Parliament in April along the lines specified in the Treaty of Amsterdam. This resignation of all the Commissioners on 16 March was unprecedented in the 40 years of the Union's history.</P>
      <P>It is a landmark in terms of accountability. In the longer term it will lead to an even more dynamic Commission and I have no doubt Ireland will play its role in the formation of the new Commission. It is important to note there was nothing for or against our Commissioner. His role in the ban on smoking advertisements has been extremely important. This is a matter which members of the Committee on Health and Children have examined for some time. It is generally agreed that his role in Europe has been extremely significant in this matter.</P>
      <P>This is a difficult juncture during which important negotiations are ongoing. All Members will wish the Taoiseach, the Minister for Agriculture and Food and the Minister for Foreign Affairs every success in the negotiations in which they are involved.</P>
      <P>Coming from County Donegal I am aware of the importance of the Cohesion and Structural Funds. I understand the important work done by the Minister for Agriculture and Food in recent weeks and congratulate him on his significant input to the negotiations and the result achieved. Often people in Ireland do not realise the important role of the Commission and the different aspects of the Council in our day to day lives, especially in agriculture. It is important that everyone is made aware of the role of Europe given its significant impact. It also provides £4 for every £1 contributed by us. I hope there will be a successful outcome to the negotiations this time round and that the drop in funds will not be as great as feared. We in County Donegal are hoping to retain Objective One status. I am confident the Taoiseach and his team will make every effort to ensure we get the maximum amount of funding to pursue the various infrastructural developments still outstanding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given the forthcoming European elections it is important to stress the role of Europe. The resignation of the Commissioners has brought the whole issue into the public domain and has put Europe on a bigger stage than in the past. The Opposition motion is bringing Europe to the fore and highlighting the existence of a structure <Col N="972" /> which is not recognised for its importance in the daily lives of the public. I look forward to the reinstatement of a strong Commission, which will be of benefit to Ireland. I am aware of the benefits that come from our involvement with Europe. I wish the President designate Romano Prodi and the incoming Commissioners every success.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I join others in congratulating Romano Prodi, the former Italian Prime Minister, and wish him well in the task to be carried out.</P>
      <P>In the short time available I will comment on one aspect of the Minister's speech which was extraordinarily conservative. The Minister said:</P>
      <P>I would like at this juncture to correct any misapprehension concerning the question of democratic control within the Union as a whole. It is a fact that the public does not greatly distinguish between the institutions of the Union, and a difficulty for one is a difficulty for all. It is, however, not the case that the Union is undemocratic and insensitive to the wishes of European citizens.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, such a distinguished person as Jacques Delors did not seem to share the Minister's opinion and stressed in one of his last significant speeches before ceasing to be President of the Commission that the greatest agenda was the building of a Europe of the citizens. He was quite critical of the manner in which Europe had not been able to forge stronger links with the European citizenry.</P>
      <P>I find very strange the Minister's reference to the fact that &ldquo;there is an extent to which it is easy to use the catchphrase &lsquo;democratic accountability&rdquo;'. The Minister's scriptwriters might want to put the term &ldquo;democratic accountability&rdquo; in inverted commas, but it is something which should not be highlighted for derision nor described as a catchphrase. Democratic accountability is what will decide whether Europe in future is involved, participatory, vibrant and makes the very significant and necessary step from an economic Union to a Union of European citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many other points I could make but I wish to concentrate on this issue. Very few people on examining parliaments in Europe would agree with the point made by the Minister. The assumption that everything is fine in terms of democracy in Europe is dangerous. In every European country there has been a loss of power to parliament and from the realm of public accountability. In the past ten years in Britain a huge range of bodies have been established which are not accountable to parliament. There is a conduit between these and people in the public service so that amendment to legislation is less likely to take place in Parliament than to be the outcome of a consensus forged by a new union which <Col N="973" /> is not accountable to Parliament or, practically, anybody else. It has resulted in what political scientists call incrementalism in politics at the cost of parliamentary accountability. One could go through all the Parliaments in Europe and find a similar situation. Therefore, it is very significant that the European Parliament has, exceptionally, been able to focus its attention on one of the other pillars of the EU. A benign outcome to what is happening would be the movement of accountability towards the Parliament.</P>
    <P>The suggestion is that we should be happy with the formal illusion rather than the practice of power. What is important in a democracy is who frames the proposals as much as who finally assents to them. If the framing is outside democratic accountability, one does not have democracy. Viewing the exchange of bureaucratic privilege from national bureaucratic privileged elites to a new bureaucratic elite in Europe as a substitute for the citizens of Europe being able to look towards institutions in which they can have courage is very dangerous and conservative.</P>
    <P>The moment must be seized so that we move on from this achievement by the Parliament. It is important that the process of reform through the institutions of the Commission be completed so that there is no longer a shadow of suspicion in terms of practice. It is also very important that, in the context of the relationship between the Commission, the Council and the Parliament, we do not have a grudging assent, as there was in the Minister's speech, to what was included in the Treaty of Amsterdam. The Minister was director of elections at the time the Treaty of Amsterdam was put to the people. It was a product of Europe at a particular political moment. The citizens of Europe want to see, through the tiny window provided in the treaty, the creation of a Europe of citizens.</P>
    <P>In the context of the congratulations given to the different Commissioners, I contrast the enthusiasm with which deregulation was ravaged across Europe in an un-thought out way with the total inactivity in relation to the concentration of ownership in one area of industry or the media, etc.</P>
    <P>Our faith is in the people who vote and ensure accountability. They have been able to achieve a scrutiny, which is a good result, and we want the task to be completed. We wish success to Romano Prodi and the citizens of Europe who in the elections will demand a Europe of the citizens.</P>

      <P>Regarding the comments made by the Minister for Education and Science about Padraig Flynn, nobody on this side of the House has ever criticised the Commissioner for the job he did in Europe. The previous Government reappointed him at the end of his first term. My experience of him as a Commissioner during the EU Presidency was first class. We have no <Col N="974" /> problem in acknowledging his record as a social reforming Commissioner.</P>
      <P>Commissioner Flynn's problems are of his own making. They were not created by the Labour Party or Fine Gael, but by himself and unfortunately he must pay the price for mistakes he has made. We all must pay the price for mistakes we have made regardless of how good a job we have done in the past or are capable of doing in the future.</P>
      <P>The resignation of the President and the entire membership of the European Commission last week was probably the most dramatic event in the history of the institutions of the European Union since the Treaty of Rome was signed in 1957. It has raised very serious questions about accountability at the highest levels in the Union, about the relationship between the democratically elected institutions such as the Parliament and the non-elected Commission, and about the future direction of the Union.</P>
      <P>Even if it was traumatic for those members of the Commission who have resigned their positions, including Commissioners who were not accused of wrong doing, last week's events have, at least, generated the beginning of a much needed debate on these matters. In the short-term important decisions will have to be made on how to deal with the immediate crisis facing the EU at the Berlin summit this week and at the special summit to be held in Brussels in a few weeks time, but there are also longer term issues that will have to be faced and dealt with if the EU is to develop, as I hope it will, into a genuine Union of citizens and peoples. If this is to happen there is an urgent need to reform the institutions and processes of the EU and ensure there is an adequate democratic basis to the way in which the EU is structured.</P>
      <P>The resignation of the Commission was an essential first step to restore confidence in European institutions and the integration project. In many respects it was a laudable and courageous decision, bearing in mind that no Commissioner was found to have profited personally or found to have engaged in deliberate fraud and that only one, Mme. Cresson, was found guilty of corruption by favouritism.</P>
      <P>The lack of responsibility identified in the report of the expert group increases the concerns that are held right across Europe in regard to allegations of fraud and financial mismanagement in EU-funded areas, of which we have had our own experience in regard to agriculture. We should not forget that 80 per cent of all fraud involving EU spending occurs in areas directly under the responsibility of national Governments.</P>

    <P>Having said that, it is absolutely right that the political authority which failed to tackle the instances of corruption identified in the report and which happened on their watch should accept political responsibility and its consequences. It <Col N="975" /> marks a step forward for European democracy and accountability.</P>
    <P>If some of the more naive members of the Commission thought they were merely going through the motions and that the Commission would be re-appointed in its entirety, they were very much mistaken. It is clear that, when the matter first emerged, some Commissioners failed to appreciate the seriousness of the situation or the seriousness with which the members of the Parliament and a number of member Governments viewed the matter.</P>
    <P>It is clear President Santer in his initial comments and in the press conference he gave on 16 March failed to understand his responsibility in the matter. Yet it is President Santer who must accept overall responsibility for the shortcomings found by the group of experts, especially for their most damning finding that:</P>
    <P>It is becoming difficult to find anyone who has even the slightest sense of responsibility. However, that sense of responsibility is essential. It must be demonstrated first and foremost by the Commissioners individually and the Commission as a body. That concept is the ultimate manifestation of democracy.</P>
    <P>Had President Santer taken more seriously the concerns expressed by the Parliament last year, when evidence became available of a loss of financial control by the Commission over some large aid projects, the mass resignation of the Commission might have been avoided. He did not do so and attempted to continue as if nothing had happened or would happen.</P>
    <P>However, we should not fall into the trap of allowing the problems which have arisen to be used as an excuse for an all-out assault on the European Union from those who are opposed to the European project. Europhobes in Britain and our own home-grown variety, who have never accepted the verdict of the Irish people in successive referenda dating back to 1972, have been quick to latch onto these problems in an attempt to turn back the clock. We must not allow them to do so.</P>
    <P>One statement of Jacques Santer's with which I agree is: &ldquo;We must use this crisis as a catalyst for deep and lasting reform in all the European institutions&rdquo;. It was a theme taken up by Mr. Tony Blair who told the House of Commons that: &ldquo;The appointment of a new President and Commission should be the opportunity to push through root and branch reform of the Commission, its mandate and its method of operation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is clearly a mood for change and reform throughout Europe, and it is essential that this be channelled in a positive direction. However, we have yet to hear from the Irish Government what its position is on such reforms. Vital decisions <Col N="976" /> have to be made but the Government seems content to sit on the sidelines and allow others, especially the larger member states, to dictate the course of events. The motion tabled by the Labour Party is an attempt to open up a real debate in the Dáil and propel the Government into taking a more proactive approach. The weak and anaemic amendment to our motion tabled by Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats suggests the Government is content to remain a bystander in this debate.</P>
    <P>As a country of more than 25 years' standing in the EU and one which has held the Presidency with distinction under various Governments of different political hues, we should be taking a leadership position, trying to influence the nature of the debate and further the course of events. There are other countries in the EU with which we share common interests and we should be attempting to forge alliances with these. The interests and needs of the smaller countries do not always coincide with those of the larger member states. It is in the interests of the smaller countries that there should be a strong Commission, but one that is democratically accountable. The weak Presidency of the outgoing Commission was largely as a result of efforts of larger countries like the UK, especially under the leadership of the then Tory Government, which saw the former strong and decisive Commission under Jacques Delors as a threat or a rival to the power of the Council of Ministers.</P>
    <P>The primary lesson to be learned from this affair is that the powers of democratic institutions of the EU, particularly the Parliament, must be further strengthened and the operation of non-elected bodies like the Commission made more transparent and accountable to the Parliament. The Amsterdam Treaty, which has been ratified by all countries and which will come into effect in the next few months, will provide some greater power, notably the requirement that the Parliament must consent to the appointment of the President of the Commission. However, we must go further. One simple reform which could be made is to amend the treaties to allow individual Commissioners to be removed from office for wrongdoing. It is not satisfactory that the only option open to the Parliament should be to remove the entire Commission, even where it is clear that Commissioners generally had been carrying out responsibilities conscientiously and were guilty of no wrongdoing.</P>
    <P>A potentially positive outcome of this saga has been the coming of age of the European Parliament, which has unequivocally established itself as an effective watchdog which finally showed it has teeth. It must be allowed to go on to show it can call all the institutions to account and that it is capable of defending the citizens' interests on heavyweight policy issues in future which will require greater focus and stamina. It shows that <Col N="977" /> the membership of the European Parliament is important and that it is in the interests of Irish citizens and citizens of every European state to cast their vote in the elections in June and influence the political composition of the next Parliament.</P>
    <P>The European Civil Service, like the civil service at member state level, is a vital component of an effective democracy. It must above all be trusted to take decisions in the interest of the citizens and those decisions must be accepted as such, even when they are otherwise unpopular. For some years it has been evident that the Commission has been fighting off the back foot, suffering from low morale among ordinary staff and with no clear picture of the way forward. Whatever the cause of this malaise &ndash; it cannot have been helped by the attitudes and practices at senior administrative and political levels which led to political horsetrading over senior posts and contracts &ndash; it must be reversed if Europe is to have the quality, independent civil service that it needs. The current upheaval offers the opportunity for the new regime to start that process.</P>
    <P>What must be done now? The Berlin summit has certainly acted quickly and decisively to nominate a new President of the Commission. In Romano Prodi we have selected a candidate of real substance and a committed European with a proven track record of political achievement in his own country. In the exceptional circumstances that followed the resignation of Jacques Santer, it was clearly necessary for the Heads of Government to act quickly to fill the vacuum, but in the long term we need to look at new procedures for the appointment of the President of the Commission. I hope that the new powers given to the Parliament for approving the nomination of the President will be followed for Mr. Prodi, even if they are not yet legally in force.</P>
    <P>It is not desirable that Europe should be presented with a <i>fait accompli</i> from behind closed doors. There should be general consultation and discussion with the various institutions before a candidate is put forward for approval. The European Parliament and other institutions such as EcoSoc and the Committee of the Regions should be invited to express a general opinion prior to a final nomination being made. Members of the Commission should be appointed on a similar basis with member states clearly forewarned that, where individual nominees are found unacceptable by the European Parliament, the entire Commission could be rejected. The incoming President should be required to draw up a reform programme, taking account of what has already been stated by the other institutions, which would be set before the European Parliament for consideration at the time of his or her ratification in late 1999.</P>
    <P>In all the circumstances, the Labour Party believes it would be inappropriate for Padraig <Col N="978" /> Flynn to be nominated for reappointment to the Commission, given that he has continually declined to make a statement on the serious allegations made against him by Mr. Tom Gilmartin, or reply to the questions that have been posed to him in a number of Dáil debates, even though he has not been precluded from doing so by the tribunal. Fianna Fáil has now belatedly decided to ditch Mr. Flynn, and it is interesting that decision was announced in Berlin and not in the House. The next Irish Commissioner will serve through a vital period for the European Union during which the challenge of enlargement will have to be faced. It is vital that whoever is nominated is a figure of political substance and political and administrative experience who is capable of securing a significant portfolio. If a candidate of little standing or political experience is nominated, he or she is likely to end up with a nominal portfolio.</P>
    <P>It is vital for Ireland and Europe's citizens that there should emerge out of this mess a reformed but politically strengthened Commission capable of discharging its responsibilities as guardian of the treaties and <i>de facto</i> defender of the interests of the smaller member states. At the weekend summit and thereafter we should strenuously resist the emerging efforts of some member states to use this as an opportunity to trim the Commission's powers in the name of so-called subsidiarity. It is by now generally recognised that the root of most if not all irregularities identified by the committee of experts was the failure to provide the Commission with the resources, especially personnel, needed to carry out its allotted tasks. This led to the inevitable necessity to cut administrative corners to get the job done, as in the ECHO programme of crisis aid for the Third World, and the wholesale transfer to outside consultants of the control and execution of Community programmes, as in the Leonardo programme for education and training.</P>
    <P>Given what is emerging daily in Dublin Castle we should be the last to be surprised that not everything around such a honey pot smells of roses. The Council and the Parliament have responsibility for creating this situation in an institution with responsibility for a budget of about £63 billion Irish pounds, about five times Irish current expenditure, with less than half the numbers employed in our own Civil Service.</P>
    <P>There can be little doubt that the European Commission and the cause of European integration has been injured by the recent events. It could have been much worse. The committee of experts' report might have been a whitewash. I have every confidence that Europe will recover and that, in time, these months will be regarded as a watershed on the road to a stronger, more transparent and democratic Europe. This will <Col N="979" /> only be achieved if the other component institutions, the Parliament, Council and member state Governments, recognise that they were complacent about what was allowed to develop <Col N="980" /> and that some of them have even more need to put their own house in order.</P>

    <Title>Social Welfare Bill, 1999: Report Stage (Resumed) and Final Stage.</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 11:</P>
    <P Just="Center">In page 7, before line 1, to insert the following:</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ldquo;6.&ndash;The Minister shall, within 3 months of the passing of this Act, lay before the Dáil Éireann a report on the implications of paying all child benefit for children up to the age of 5 years at the rate of £20 per week.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;(Deputy J. O'Keeffe).</P>
    <P>Mr. J. O'Keeffe: I am interested in having child benefit substantially increased but I cannot table an amendment to that effect. If I did, the Minister would not have the money to pay for it. The way in which this amendment is framed encapsulates what I want to achieve. I want a report laid before the Dáil on the implications of paying child benefit for all children up to the age of five at the rate of £20 per week. This can be done and there are sufficient funds available in the Exchequer to do it, but I know the Minister does not have them within his Department.</P>
    <P>We are focusing on child benefit because the Combat Poverty Agency estimate that a substantial number of children live in poverty. There is some dispute as to the exact figure, but both the Minister and I agree it is probably around 25 per cent, that one in four children is living in poverty.</P>
    <P>It is agreed that the way to deal with that is by increasing child benefit. All the experts tell us that is the most appropriate and efficient way of dealing with child poverty. Neither does it act as a disincentive to enterprise or to people taking up work.</P>
    <P>The only matter on which we do not agree is the amount by which child benefit should be increased. Where there is a budget surplus of thousands of millions of pounds, I cannot accept that increasing child benefit by £12 this year is an adequate response to the problem I am highlighting. We should try to make a real difference. It would be very expensive to increase child benefit substantially for all children. The cost of increasing child benefit to £20 for every child up to the age of five is reasonably expensive, approximately £150 million per year. This is where we should start. The money is available so why not do it. The Minister must, at least, have a report done on the implications of such an increase.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister would like to accept this proposal if his Cabinet colleagues would give him <Col N="982" /> the money to do so. When he rejects the amendment, I expect the Minister will say, quite rightly, that reducing child benefit when children reach the age of five would present a problem. I accept that this would be so but the problem could be overcome by reducing benefit in stages after the age of five so that families do not experience a great disruption to their finances.</P>
    <P>While I present this proposal in the interests of creating a fairer society, it is also economically wise. We need more support for child care so that mothers can participate in the workforce. This measure would help those at the weaker end of the socio-economic spectrum who wish to take up paid employment. Everything supports my proposal. It will not place an immediate charge on the Exchequer and I urge the Minister to accept the proposal in the spirit in which it is offered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the proposal of my colleague Deputy Jim O'Keeffe. It has been well established by various reports on payment of social welfare benefit to families that the best way of getting money to children is through child benefit. Increases in child benefit are reflected directly in increased spending on children. It is also well known that a sizeable proportion of children live below the poverty line. When one considers that the best way of getting money to those children is through child benefit it makes great sense to concentrate resources on increasing child benefit.</P>
      <P>It is regrettable that this Government has not increased child benefit substantially. The previous Government granted a substantial increase and the Minister, Deputy Ahern, now has a golden opportunity to put right the neglect of the past few years. It is remarkable that almost 60 per cent of the recipients of child benefit, generally mothers, have no other personal income. This fact bears out the findings that money given in child benefit goes directly to the substantive carers of children in the home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have spent much time recently discussing tax relief for child care. This proposal would go some of the way towards easing the difficulties in relation to child care. This proposed increase in child benefit from approximately £8 per week to £20 per week for children aged five and under would cost £150 million per year. There are approximately 50,000 children in each year group so there are 250,000 children under five. An increase of £12 per week or £600 per year for each child amounts to £150 million. The budget surplus this year will be in excess of £2 billion. When discussing earlier amendments the Minister said he could not find the additional money required. The Minister must accept that some of the budget surplus must go to children. What bet<Col N="983" /> ter way to do this than by increasing child benefit?</P>
    <P>I am old enough to remember the time when child benefit was referred to as the half crowns. My mother used place great store on being able to draw the half crowns because she was a housewife and she regarded that money as her own few pounds. I was one of ten children and the half crowns were quite substantial. My mother regarded that money as income which she could use as she wished. Knowing that so much child benefit goes directly to children, I ask the Minister to give this amendment his special consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to be associated with this amendment. You will remember, Sir, that a Labour Party requirement in the negotiations to establish the partnership Government in 1992 was the achievement, during the life of the Government, of a basic income of £20 per week for all children. It is heartening to see another party coming to believe in the same approach.</P>
      <P>The question of increasing child benefit to children under five years was discussed on Committee Stage. Many parents will know that the needs of children in the age group six to 12 when they are developing new interests can also be very expensive. Teenagers also have very expensive needs. It could be argued that there should not be a cut-off point at the age of five.</P>
      <P>The recent Partnership 2000 child care report was a stimulating document. The Government, as usual, kicked the matter to touch and avoided taking action by appointing yet another interdepartmental group. I noted during today's debate the number of times the Minister referred to interdepartmental groups on one topic or another. All aspects of the child care report &ndash; child care providers, tax relief for child care, child benefit and registration of crèches &ndash; have been discussed in my part of country. Under the Northside Partnership we have launched a major child care project headed by the Chairwoman of the National Women's Council of Ireland, Noreen Byrne, who is a strong local leader. In all discussions I have had, both in the Northside Partnership area and nationally, I have found general agreement with the substance of this amendment, a basic income for children and a support for mothers and families. I fully endorse the sentiments of my colleagues in Fine Gael.</P>

One of the main issues not wholly addressed in the report was that of women who choose to stay in the home. I do not agree with Deputy Broughan's remarks about working groups; more working groups were set up in the tenure of my predecessor. I probably would not have set up as many working groups as others but I do not&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not play rugby. I played soccer, the working man's game. I did not set up as many working groups as my predecessor, Deputy De Rossa, but his setting up of the Commission on the Family was an excellent idea even though it overshadowed the good work of the committee of this House which was examining the issue of the family. Nevertheless, the Commission on the Family produced an excellent report and the proposal which Deputy Bruton <Col N="985" /> made with great fanfare at his Ard-Fheis, as if it were something no one else had thought of, was one of the main issues the commission put forward for discussion. The commission accepted that this issue is complicated and expensive from an Exchequer point of view.</P>
      <P>We wanted to establish an interdepartmental working group that would report back quickly so that the Government could take action in this whole area, not only on the basis of its report but also on the commitments we gave in An Action Programme for the Millennium, the report of the Commission on the Family and the report of the Forum on Early Childhood Education.</P>
      <P>The child benefit route is probably the best although it may be the most expensive. We all accept that. Looking at the issue of children in the age group up to five, the report of the Commission on the Family, launched by Deputy Bruton at the Ard-Fheis, stated that the main area which did not need a major degree of State assistance was the up to three and the three to five age groups and suggested that certain payments would be made. That makes sense but, unfortunately, when the child reached the age of five, the family would be bereft of a payment on which it relied over those years. As Deputy Broughan rightly pointed out, when a child starts school the family does not have a financial burden lifted off it. Additional financial burdens are often placed on families when children start school because they have to buy uniforms and books, despite all the assistance available to them.</P>
      <P>The Government is acutely aware of the need to examine the issue of child benefit in the context of the whole child care issue. Certain proposals will be brought forward by the Government before the year is out which will build upon the deliberations of the interdepartmental working group set up recently and which we expect will report to the Government in the near future.</P>

      <P>The past is the past. There was an increase of 60 per cent in child benefit under the short-lived rainbow Government. In the current year, for 1.2 million children, this Government has allowed an increase of £13 million&mdash;</P>

      <P>On a point of order, the proportions in relation to 25 per cent in a full year under the rainbow coalition Government's package for child care, and £40 million by this Government, would be the same in terms of the budget year cost. Deputy O'Keeffe said in our case it is £13 million this year but it would be in the region of £6 million or £7 million for the corresponding period of 1997 because in that year the increases in child benefit provided for by the then Government came into effect in September. It would be a proportion of the 25 per cent. If the Deputy divides the figure by four he will get it.</P>

      <P>I am not codding anybody. I am stating the fact that for the 60 per cent increase provided by the rainbow Government, the increase this year, for 1.2 million children, is £13 million. It averages out at approximately £12 a year each, £1 a month and 28p per week. That is the increase they will get against a backdrop of the huge surplus of moneys in the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>I know the Minister does not have any additional moneys from his ministerial colleague but I want to put down a marker in terms of the importance I attach to child benefit. I also put down a marker in the context of the debate on child care either by the lady working in the home or by somebody who goes out to work. That is why I stipulated up to the age of five. After that, children will be at school and the child care burden will be somewhat less for obvious reasons.</P>
      <P>In the context of a new approach which I hope to see adopted by all parties towards the achievement of a fairer society, I want to ensure that child benefit is an area which will get decent provision in the future. I do not want any references to the historical past when money was not available because they are about as irrelevant as the situation mentioned by my colleague, Deputy McGrath, when he referred to the children's allowance which was a half a crown in my young days. I feel strongly about this issue but to avoid delaying proceedings I will not call a vote but will put the  amendment to a voice vote.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;6.&ndash;Not later than 6 months from the passing of this Act, the Minister shall prepare and lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report on the need to amend and extend the social welfare free schemes as they apply to widows and widowers.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 12 is very similar to amendment No. 15 and draws attention to the situation of widows and widowers. We have received many submissions on this issue in recent years, particularly in relation to younger widows and widowers who have been left to support very young families. On Committee Stage I drew attention to the fact that in recent weeks, the young family of <Col N="987" /> the late Deputy Upton has been left to be looked after and supported by a young widow. This issue affects all sections of society.</P>
    <P>The substance of our amendment, which is fleshed out further in the Fine Gael one, calls on the Minister to report on the possibility of extending the free schemes to widows, particularly those with many dependent children. Last Saturday morning in Donaghmede, a young widow came to see me and was in tears recounting the difficulties she faced in supporting a number of teenage children, a couple of whom were starting college. Her chief complaint concerned the situation of people on disability benefit. She had been on disability benefit when her husband was alive and was urged by the Department to switch to the widow's pension and succeeded in getting half of the disability benefit for the following 15 months. She was just about surviving under those circumstances but in recent months, she has been cruelly cut off as a result of the Department's rules and is now struggling hard to make ends meet.</P>
    <P>This is perhaps one of the most vulnerable sectors of our society. It is an area in which the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Woods, took much interest. Perhaps it is an area at which this Minister needs to look, particularly in relation to free schemes. I urge him to consider widows like the woman I mentioned who has a good PRSI record and who feel very hard done by in that she is not entitled to continue to draw half the disability benefit for the next few years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 15 is an alternative to that in the names of Deputy Broughan and Deputy Shortall. Widows and widowers are the great forgotten people of Ireland. They suffer the loss of their spouses and the State does very little to come to their rescue. If a woman loses her husband, she suddenly finds herself on the widow's pension which the Minister admitted earlier would not do much. If she has dependent children, she will be worse off. She may have had a little more previously and had somebody to share the burdens of bringing up a family, but suddenly all of that is gone. Not only has she lost a companion, a friend, a spouse and possibly the breadwinner, she now must shoulder all the family difficulties on her own. Coupled with that, come the financial difficulties. Widows, in particular, get a raw deal in this State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also mention widowers. Recently, I came across a case of a widower with three dependent children. He was earning somewhere in the region of £24,000 or £25,000 per year. His wife had been a housewife who looked after the home. The resultant benefit from the State was that he would have to pay an additional £50 per week in income tax. Instead of coming under the double band in the tax code, he is now under the single band. Widowers and widows hit the top rate of tax at about £17,000 this year, whereas a married couple do not hit it until about £28,000. This <Col N="988" /> means he hits the higher tax band much earlier on and his tax bill increases.</P>
    <P>A bereavement allowance is in place for the first five years which is scaled back from £5,000 to £1,000. That is a help on the tax side. I know we are dealing with the Social Welfare Bill and not the Finance Bill but both should be looked at together. Perhaps the Minister will speak with his colleague, the Minister for Finance? Widows and widowers should come under the double tax band, certainly for as long as they have dependent children. It is only fair that should happen.</P>
    <P>Small benefits, including free travel, television licence and telephone rental, should be given to widows and widowers, if only by way of recognition of their special status and difficulties. I am sure the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, who, like me, comes from a rural constituency, has often met women who feel cut off and isolated when they become widows. These small benefits would be a help to them.</P>

Perhaps we should send the Minister for Finance to Cheltenham and if he comes back with a few pounds, the Minister could deliver all these things next year.</P>

      <P>It is accepted on this side of the House that more needs to be done for widows. That was one of the reasons the Minister for Finance made substantial taxation changes in respect of widows in his first budget. He continued that trend in this year's budget, although the changes were not as significant as those made in his first budget. Those changes were made in special recognition of the position of young widows.</P>
      <P>I examined the free schemes. An expenditure review of the free schemes is being undertaken in my Department in co-operation with the Policy Institute of Trinity College, Dublin. One of the issues under review is the extension of the free schemes to widows, widowers and other deserving cases. The estimated cost of extending the free schemes to widows and widowers is approximately £25 million. This year I extended the free schemes to mainly carers. The free telephone rental scheme was extended to all qualifying carers. The free fuel scheme was amended. Other changes were made in extending free travel to carers, to people in constant attendance and to those in receipt of the prescribed relative allowance. All these issues were examined and only so much can be done each year. I acknowledge the issue of young widows requires attention and I give an undertaking it will be examined in the next budget, given the expenditure report on the free schemes, which, I hope, will be available by then.</P>

      <P>In page 7, between lines 12 and 13, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;7.&ndash;The Minister shall, within 3 months of the passing of this Act, lay before Dáil Éireann a detailed report on the implications of the extension of the family income supplement to the families of persons who are self-employed.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I am in campaign mode arguing for the acceptance of this amendment. It is a fundamental injustice that the family income supplement is not available to the self-employed. The family income supplement has been beneficial to those in low paid employment. It has also provided an incentive for low paid workers with families to take up or remain in full-time employment. Approximately 14,000 people gain from that scheme. It has improved gradually over the years, but the last remaining major reform of the structure required is to provide for the self-employed.</P>
      <P>Many people perceive the self-employed to be well off, but I refer to the self-employed who are living on the margins. There are quite a number in that category. They may run a small corner shop, a service business, such as plumbing, a bicycle shop, a post office or they may be small farmers. People in urban and rural areas would gain from the extension of the family income supplement to the self-employed. Apart from the social injustice aspect of this, does it not make economic sense and for a fairer society to provide that element of support to the self-employed who are on low incomes? Does it not also make economic sense to encourage people with families, whether they live in urban or rural areas, to continue to make their own living, even if they do not get a major return from it? This extension of the scheme to the self-employed makes economic sense and is socially just. For that reason the case for its extension is unanswerable.</P>
      <P>I examined the position elsewhere and was impressed that there is a similar system in Northern Ireland and in the UK. The Minister will probably reply that the system of family credit in Northern Ireland is not exactly the same as our family income supplement, but it is analogous to it. The system of family credit in Northern Ireland extends to the self-employed. They have overcome practical difficulties in relation to income tax and tax returns. There are also practical difficulties in relation to small farmers, but they have also overcome those. Under their system, a special form must be completed before a small farmer with a family can apply for a family credit. Proposals are to be introduced next October in Northern Ireland whereby the family credit system will be replaced by the working family's tax credit system.</P>

      <P>The family credit system in the UK or in Northern Ireland does not impose any charge on our Exchequer. The peace process has not advanced sufficiently to envisage such a possibility, but I take the Chair's point. The other part of this island and our neighbouring jurisdiction have been able to introduce a system, which includes the self-employed. I do not expect the Minister to say immediately that he will extend the system. I do not expect him to put a charge on the Exchequer immediately, but I urge him to ensure that policy in this area is generally directed towards the objective I outlined. That is the basis on which I seek a report on the implications of this proposal. The case for extending the scheme to the self-employed is unanswerable. I believe it will be extended to them and I intend to push to ensure that happens. That is why I feel so strongly about this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment. The case for the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs extending the scheme to the self-employed is unanswerable. If the Department of Finance, through the Revenue Commissioners, was to highlight that a person has an annual income of £8,000 and a family of three children, the case for the Department of Social Community and Family Affairs not paying that family income supplement is unanswerable. If such a case were brought to court, I am sure it would be won.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for the family income supplement should be moved from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs to the Department of Finance. It should be an automatic payment from the Department of Finance when people are making their financial returns for the year. The Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs might be happy to lose that payment or it might feel it was being downgraded. However, it would make much more sense to base it entirely on income. The Minister should consider that when he is making his report on family income supplement.</P>
      <P>The committee which I chair, and to which the Minister referred, recently debated family income supplement. The Minister will be glad to know that some of his colleagues who sit behind him were very adamant that family income supplement should be introduced for the self-employed. At some stage we will be calling on them to vote accordingly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>I mentioned to the Minister on Committee Stage and at a recent Question Time an issue concerning unemployed people who <Col N="992" /> have become self-employed. An issue that arose frequently during our recent research on the matter was that a form of income support was necessary for those on the back-to-work and area based schemes after the three or four years was over. People who set up small businesses, such as a person who came to my advice centre recently and who had set up a small painting and decorating business, but who need support for another six months or a year are let down by the system. It is a daunting prospect for the successful graduates of those schemes to be on their own after three or four years.</P>
      <P>This amendment would be very valuable in terms of making FIS available to people coming off those schemes who have managed, through enormous efforts, to set up their own businesses. It is a heroic achievement to go from being unemployed to being self-employed. The least we could do is consider the possibility of going down this road. Deputy O'Keeffe told us yesterday at the Committee on Family, Community and Social Affairs about the British system, which merits some study.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue of family income supplement was looked at in the context of Partnership 2000 but was not regarded as a priority by any of the participants, neither the Government nor the social partners. Only one farming organisation pushed the issue of FIS for farmers at that time, although some of them became great converts to it subsequently. It is not very long since Partnership 2000 was put in place and it was not an issue. I hazard a guess that if the case is unanswerable now, it was unanswerable then.</P>
      <P>The cost of extending it is estimated &ndash; although it is more of a guesstimate &ndash; to be in the region of £70 million to £80 million. The extra £15 million put into the farm assist scheme, which is the alternative agreed by this Government with the farming organisations and others for low income farmers, would have to be subtracted from that. However, it would still be a very substantial amount of between £55 million and £65 million. This returns to the spending of the surplus we are talking about. If I had £55 million or £65 million today I might have higher priorities to spend it on, such as people with disabilities, carers, child benefit and widows and widowers. However, that is not to say there is no need to assist some self-employed people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Broughan raises a very valid point about the back-to-work allowance scheme, which is an extremely good scheme. I have given the Labour Party an opportunity to correct the record. I was astounded by its post budget broadcast, in which it gave incorrect information. It stated there was a cut in the back-to-work allowance scheme, which was not the case. I subsequently wrote to Deputy McDowell and asked him to correct the record. I am still awaiting a response.

Carers often spend 168 hours a week caring for disabled relatives. A small start was made but these amendments propose a number of further important improvements. All Members received a check list of 21 items from the Carer's Association on which it lobbied the Minister before Christmas. Carers felt that he should have gone much further in a number of areas. He extended the number of carers by 3,300 but it is estimated that there are 48,000 carers. He was asked to abolish the means test but did not introduce any change.</P>
      <P>He was also asked to consider a carer's benefit, which is the substance of amendment No. 17, particularly for those with a good PRSI record. They should be able to give up work and receive support at a reasonable rate to look after invalids in their homes. The Minister has absolutely refused to act on this.</P>
      <P>The Carer's Association requested an increase of £200 in the weekly income disregard and nothing emerged in that regard. He was asked to give medical cards to all full-time carers, but did not. The Minister stated that he would not take carers for granted, but despite modest improvements, he is still taking these heroic men and women for granted. He was asked to consider the abolition of VAT on incontinence pads and other basic care items and, again, he did nothing. It was called &ldquo;a cost of caring&rdquo; allowance but the Minister was not prepared to consider it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An extra £45 per week for all carers was proposed to help meet additional costs, such as heating in summer for older people, etc., and the Minister did nothing. He was asked to do something major on the respite care allowance given <Col N="995" /> that people work night and day. They receive £200 but it is a minimalist start in terms of what is required. The sum of £1,000 which is mentioned in the amendments is more appropriate. As a former teacher if I were giving the Minister marks, I would give him four or five out of 21, which is a very modest mark indeed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Prior to the Social Welfare Bill, 1988, the payment was known as the prescribed relative's allowance. I tabled an amendment to have it changed so that the payment would be made direct to the carer. It was accepted by the then Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Woods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Carers are fed up with being called the unsung heroes of society. They would prefer if people sang more about them in terms of reality. There are approximately 50,000 carers, three quarters of whom are not recognised by the State. I care for all of them and the system must be developed. It has grown bit by bit since it was introduced but at a slow pace. We must first give the allowance to more carers and that can be done by increasing the income disregard to £100 for a single person <Col N="996" /> and £200 for a couple. There must be a fairer system for the assessment of income on savings. In addition, there is a problem with the relaxation of the residency rules bearing in mind that 44 per cent of carers do not live under the same roof as those for whom they care.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister because last year I pushed strongly for a respite care allowance of £1,000 and I am glad the principle has been established. I have problems with it not just because it is only £200 but because it only applies to people in receipt of an allowance. Three quarters of carers continue to get nothing. There is a need for a recognition payment that could be covered under the respite allowance for those who do not qualify for the weekly allowance. Consideration must be given in the development of this scheme, and in the report to be prepared by the Minister, to extend the respite care allowance to those who do not receive the weekly allowance. In addition, home-based respite and residential care facilities and services must be developed.</P>
    <P>I wish to see another anomaly examined in the report. The income earner in a household in many instances qualifies for a partial allowance except when the income derives from a social welfare payment. For example, a widow caring for a number of elderly relatives is precluded from receiving a carer's allowance because she is in receipt of a widow's pension. That is an unfair anomaly which should be addressed in the report which I hope the Minister will prepare.</P>
    <P>There are other areas which go beyond the Minister's brief but if he is going to take responsibility for this issue he should also look at them. One such issue is carers whose mission of care has been completed, often because the person being cared for died. Under the social economy programme there should be a special allocation of 1,000 places for carers. We should also bear in mind home helps and the miserable, minimal amount paid to them. They should be paid at least the proposed minimum hourly wage. There are two problems in the tax area, the aggregation of the carer's allowance with other income and VAT on basic care items. These issues need to be teased out, costed and debated, possibly before the Committee on Family and Social Affairs, so that when we are presented with next year's budget we can make a qualitative improvement in the conditions of the 50,000 carers who do such a marvellous job. Hopefully we will not just be saying they do a marvellous job but will be doing something concrete.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>I am inclined to support the need to prepare a report. However, I cannot agree with the argument put forward by Deputy O'Keeffe. I hope the Minister and his officials will hear the call I am making in relation to the carer's scheme. My understanding is that the carer's scheme currently in place is a social welfare payment scheme. Deputy O'Keeffe referred to carers and what happens when they finish caring for a relative and then he spoke about home helps. That <Col N="997" /> could be expanded further by dealing with nursing home subventions, senior citizens&mdash;</P>

We are talking about a £6 increase for carers aged 66 and over, £3 increase for carers under age 66, once a year payment of £200 towards the cost of respite care, carers of 60 to 65 year olds will no longer be disqualified for carer's allowance where the person being cared for is not in receipt of a social welfare payment&mdash;</P>

As a result of the changes, as Deputy Callely said, an extra £80 million on top of the £45 million has been provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Broughan referred to doing away with the means test. Not all the lobby groups involved in this area believe that would be the right way to deal with the matter. I gave a figure of £140 million in relation to the abolition of the means test. The figure would be greater now because we would have to take into account the substantial amendments that were made to the carer's allowance scheme in this year's budget. It would cost in the <Col N="1000" /> region of £200 million in a full year to abolish the means test. By doing so, we would be making the carer's allowance the only allowance other than child benefit which was non-means tested and giving money to people who would not need carer's allowance. I accept that anyone who is caring for someone is in need of special assistance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you and the Minister for taking this important matter on the Adjournment. Families who have to cope with children with attention deficit disorder are under huge strain in dealing with the problems affecting their loved ones, problems caused by the lack of adequate back-up and support services. I know of one family which has to travel over 120 miles from Kildare to Clare to get treatment for their son. They do so at great personal cost, paying for travel, accommodation and the professional fees involved. This is not acceptable.</P>
      <P>Some time ago I tabled questions on this issue to the Minister for Health and Children and was informed that treatment of this disorder falls within the responsibility of the psychiatric services for children and adolescents in each of the health board areas. As parents of children with attention deficit disorder know, the level of resources provided by the health boards is far from sufficient to carry out this work in an efficient manner despite the best efforts of the staff involved. The real needs of these children and their families must be addressed. It must be done through the provision of the necessary professional expertise in the relevant health boards accompanied by proper services provided through the Department of Education and Science to deal with such cases at primary level when they arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Experts on attention deficit disorder say that if a child who has the disorder is not diagnosed before the age of seven, the damage which accompanies this syndrome is almost impossible to treat or rectify. It is essential that the Minister for Health and Children significantly increases the level of resources available to health boards to ensure the provision of the necessary psychiatric services to treat children involved and to provide adequate back-up for the families. It is imperative that the Department provides financial assistance to the ADD support group which work tirelessly with families to cope with this problem. The group has made an application to the Department of Health and Children and the Eastern Health Board for lottery funding. Due to lack of funding this group is using personal equipment, computers, telephones, stationery and stamps to deal with queries received on a 24 hour basis. I have been informed that with the best will <Col N="1003" /> in the world it is simply not possible for this group to operate under such personal and financial strain. In this context it is imperative that the Department and the Eastern Health Board grant the application for funding to the ADD support group.</P>
    <P>I have discussed this matter with the Minister for Health and Children already and he is aware of the particular problems and difficulties generated. I sincerely hope the necessary resources can be found to enable the Minister make a positive decision to assist the group. I sincerely hope he will find the necessary resources so that he can make a positive decision on assisting the group in relation to this problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>The diagnosis, assessment and treatment of attention deficit disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder normally comes within the remit of the child and adolescent psychiatric services in each health board.</P>
      <P>The development of a comprehensive child and adolescent psychiatric service in each health board area has been identified as a priority in my Department's health strategy, Shaping a Healthier Future. Each of the health boards has a dedicated, multidisciplinary child and adolescent psychiatric service led by a consultant child and adolescent psychiatrist. Shaping a Healthier Future also recognises the important role of the voluntary sector in the provision of health and social services. It acknowledges the role local support groups have to play in many instances in identifying needs in the community and in developing responses to them.</P>
      <P>In relation to the level of funding available for support groups for children suffering from ADD and ADHD, I am aware that some health boards have already provided financial assistance to support groups operating in their respective functional areas. I understand a number of health boards are in direct consultation with local support groups to discuss their needs, including funding requirements and the role the groups might have in the future development of services. These consultations will strengthen links between health boards and local support groups, thereby securing an efficient and effective utilisation of resources to respond to patient needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A draft policy document for the further development of child and adolescent psychiatric services has recently been completed by Dr. Paul McCarthy, clinical director of the child and adolescent psychiatric services in the Eastern Health Board and adviser to my Department on child and adolescent psychiatric service policy. The draft development plan, which has been circulated to all health boards for comments, includes consideration of the specific needs of children and adolescents with attention deficit disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. When the views of the health boards have been <Col N="1004" /> considered, a final report will be prepared. In the meantime, additional Revenue resources of £1.378 million have been provided in the current year to enable improvements to be undertaken in the child and adolescent services, including the development of services for children suffering from attention deficit disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.</P>
    <P>I also note the Deputy's reference to lottery funding in this context.</P>

    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to highlight the need for the Minister to increase substantially the subvention paid through the health boards to assist patients in meeting the cost of nursing home care. There is an urgent need to eliminate the grossly discriminatory funding system which the State imposes on the dependent elderly.</P>
      <P>The facts speak for themselves. The State recognises the cost of providing proper standards of care in State run nursing homes, at an average of £500 per week. As the current levels of subvention payments indicate, the State does not recognise that the same costs exist in private nursing homes. It is obvious the subvention was never intended to cover the full cost of maintenance of the elderly in home care. However, given that there has been no increase in these subventions since 1993, it is essential that in 1999, the year of the elderly, the Minister responds positively and urgently. It is not too late for him to do this.</P>
      <P>Discrimination towards the elderly is unacceptable. It costs an average of £250 per week to give care and maintenance to a patient in a private nursing home in the Western Health Board area, which includes County Galway. In the Eastern Health Board area, including Dublin, and the Southern Health Board area the charge is approximately £350. This is approximately £200 cheaper than a similar charge in a public nursing home. This discrimination must be eliminated as a matter of urgency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, throughout the country there are three levels of contribution, up to a maximum of approximately £120 per week. In most health board areas additional costs are given above this maximum arising from increased dependency levels. No such facility is provided in the Western Health Board area. This must be changed so that the elderly in County Galway and the Western Health Board area can be treated in the same way as those in the Eastern or Southern Health Boards areas. The maximum subvention, together with the pension of the elderly person, is inadequate and the savings, if any, and the property value of these people quickly becomes exhausted, causing increased and unnecessary anxiety. The pension plus the maximum subvention of £120 is the total amount available to a significant number of elderly people who wish to reside in private nursing homes. It is inadequate and there is no doubt many elderly are facing, or will face, this <Col N="1005" /> grossly unfair financial burden due to the failure of the Government to respond to elderly people in need of care and nursing.</P>
    <P>The grossly unfair system denies the elderly members of our community the basic right of a choice of where to live in their final years. Many elderly people are terrified about the future and there is a lack of commitment to them on the part of the Government. What other group has endured a freeze in support since 1993? If we had a caring Government, surely the elderly would be the last group to face such a penalty.</P>
    <P>Nursing staff working in private nursing homes cannot be paid the same rates as their colleagues in public hospitals, but their work is equally, if not more, demanding and difficult. The Minister has requested private nursing homes to provide places for patients being discharged from acute hospitals for convalescent care. This is an indication of the services provided by nursing homes to date. They are entitled to an adequate subvention. Now is the time to act and I urge the Minister, in this year of the elderly, to double the current subvention rates.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Burke for raising this issue. Since coming into office the Government has provided significant additional resources for the nursing home subventions scheme. Over £17 million was provided for the scheme in the Estimates for 1998. Additional funding of £6.9 million was provided in the Supplementary Estimates for 1998. A further £9 million was allocated to health boards this year to meet, <i>inter alia</i>, increased demand for nursing home subventions, the additional costs arising from increased dependency levels and the change in the regulation which applies from 1 January 1999. This regulation removes the provision which allowed health boards to assess the capacity of adult sons or daughters over 21 years of age to contribute towards the cost of nursing home care for their parents. The cost of this change alone is estimated at about £2 million per annum. The additional funding provided this year brings the total amount of funding available for the scheme to £33 million.</P>
      <P>One of the changes made to the subvention scheme operated under the Health (Nursing Homes) Act since its implementation permits health boards to contract beds in private nursing homes above the number contracted on 1 September 1993, and to pay more than the maximum rates of subvention in such cases. This amendment is designed to facilitate health boards which do not have sufficient accommodation in their hospitals and homes to meet the needs of those requiring nursing care and which have traditionally relied on the nursing home sector to meet this need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1999 the full year costs of contracting an additional 65 nursing home beds is being allocated to the Eastern Health Board. This will help alleviate the pressure on acute hospital beds in the major general hospitals in Dublin. It had been <Col N="1006" /> hoped to increase the rate of subvention this year but it has not been possible to do so due to having to provide additional funding of £9 million, as already referred to. We will examine the situation next year depending on the level of development funding available and the priorities in regard to services for older people.</P>
    <P>The need to develop better health and other support services for older people is regarded as a priority by the Government and the additional £10 million announced in the budget is an indication of our commitment to improving services for older people during our term of office. This, together with the figure provided for in the 1999 Book of Estimates, brings the total amount of additional funding for these services to £25 million, which is way ahead of the sums provided during the term of the previous Government. As can be seen, we are making headway by providing the money where it is required and the additional millions are proof of that.</P>

      <P>The event about which I am asking questions was very enjoyable for many hundreds of thousands of people, not only those who attended but also those who watched on television. Only those caught up in the worst of the crushing and the overcrowding which occurred during and after the fireworks display on the Saturday before St. Patrick's Day appreciate how close Dublin came to suffering a tragic disaster. It was not just that inadequate transport and stewarding caused inconvenience and discomfort, many of those caught up in the event thought they would die and feared a Hillsborough-type disaster was imminent.</P>
      <P>The event was a great success and thoroughly enjoyed by those who saw it, but the transport arrangements were inadequate and stewarding and policing arrangements after the event almost nonexistent. An estimated 250,000 people attended the event, almost four times the number that would attend an all-Ireland final in Croke Park, yet incredibly no extra public transport appears to have been laid on despite the advertisements in the media encouraging people to use the DART and bus services. Those who left their cars behind had to endure huge queues on the way and long delays on the return journey. Many families with small children did not make it home until almost midnight, and that was after having to endure dangerous and distressing crushing at bus queues and DART stations. The situation at the latter was serious, with dangerous crushing on platforms and inadequate stewarding, leading some to fear they were going to be pushed onto the tracks in the path of oncoming trains.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The stewarding arrangements after the event were equally inadequate as 250,000 people attempted to make their way home. There was serious crushing in parts of the city centre, and I have heard reports of families taking almost an hour to make their way from O'Connell Bridge <Col N="1007" /> to Parnell Square. Had the crowd not been so good humoured and controlled, anything could have happened. All it required was for a small number of people to panic or for people to begin to fall to have led to utter disaster.</P>
    <P>Since I first raised the matter last week, a number of journalists have written graphically of their frightening experiences which confirm many of the accounts given to me by letter and telephone. Niamh O'Connor reported in <i>Ireland on Sunday</i>:</P>
    <P>On Capel Street Bridge, a man had a heart attack. On O'Connell Bridge, a woman thought her baby had stopped breathing. The numbers on the Ha'penny Bridge reached such crowded levels that it will be closed off for the millennium weekend...</P>
    <P>At 7.40 p.m. the crowd on O'Connell Bridge turned from a throng into a heaving, seething mass within the space of seconds. Cars and buses were surrounded, drivers and passengers trapped inside. People pushed and shoved and got nowhere...and then there wasn't even enough room to push and shove anymore.</P>
    <P>One young woman began to get more and more frantic. She was begging people to please let her through. The ones who bothered to answer said there was nowhere to go.</P>
    <P>That is a situation which clearly could have led to serious consequences. There were other reports in <i>The Irish Times </i>and elsewhere from journalists who were on the spot and saw these things for themselves, despite the fact that the organisers, Garda and ambulance services claimed there were no untoward incidents. A report in <i>The Irish Times </i>stated it took an ambulance seven minutes to cross O'Connell Bridge. No one knows why the ambulance was trying to get across at that point. It seems crazy that an emergency service would seek to get through such a crowd when it was apparently on an emergency call. It does not make sense.</P>
    <P>Dublin was lucky a serious disaster did not occur last Saturday night week, but we cannot ignore the lessons to be learned. The Department of the Environment and Local Government should now convene a meeting of the Dublin local authorities, the Garda, Dublin Bus and Iarnród Éireann and prepare a major events management plan to ensure that, when events are held in the city centre in future, effective transport and stewarding arrangements are in place to allow them be enjoyed by the public in comfort and safety.</P>
    <P>Dublin has become a more lively and enjoyable place in which to live over the past decade. Events such as the parade and the fireworks display are welcome because they provide enjoyment and entertainment and bring people into the city centre, which is good for the business, social and cultural life of the capital. I hope they will continue, but we cannot continue to take the sort of risks which were taken on 13 March. There are other events in the pipeline and the <Col N="1008" /> millennium celebrations will bring huge crowds onto the streets at the end of the year. We must act now to ensure that they are not marred by disastrous accidents.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>The safety of persons attending any public event is a matter which concerns all Deputies. The issues highlighted by Deputy De Rossa cut across a number of Government Departments and agencies. The primary responsibility for the control of crowds and for ensuring the safety of persons attending any event rests with the person in control of the event. This responsibility arises from the common law duty of care owed by the person in control to those whom he or she has invited to participate in the event. The duty is owed to a full range of people participating in the event, from the audience who may or may not have paid an admission charge to the performers and persons working or assisting at the event.</P>
      <P>Regarding fireworks displays, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has issued guidance on organised fireworks displays to assist organisers, operators of public fireworks displays and the Garda Síochána on the measures to be taken before, during and after a display. This guidance document sets out the measures to be undertaken to ensure the safety of the public as well as the stewarding arrangements for the display.</P>
      <P>For any large event, the Garda prepares a traffic management plan in consultation with the organiser of the event, the transport authorities and the local authorities. This plan includes details of traffic diversions, parking restrictions, designation of pedestrian zones and the placing of cordons to the best advantage of spectators. In addition, the Garda and the transport authorities prepare a plan outlining the transportation arrangements for members of the public to access the event.</P>
      <P>I understand my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, granted a licence to the organisers of the St. Patrick's Festival to import fireworks for the display on 13 March 1999 subject to a number of conditions. In addition, in early January last the Garda authorities set up an event policing committee. In the preparation of the policing plan, the committee, in addition to its own regular meetings, met the festival organisers, Dublin Corporation and public transport companies and liaised with the emergency services. I understand the Garda authorities are satisfied that sufficient gardaí were on duty. The Garda air support unit was airborne on the night and provided a video downlink to the communications centre at Dublin metropolitan area headquarters at Harcourt Square.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Good planning and management are important to ensure the safe running of any event and guidance for certain public events has been published by my Department and the Department of Edu<Col N="1009" /> cation and Science. These are the codes of practice for safety at indoor concerts, the code of practice for safety at sports grounds and the code of practice for safety at outdoor pop concerts. These codes set out the minimum functional requirements for the safe organisation and management of such events.</P>
    <P>Planning any public event involves consultation with the relevant statutory authorities and other interests. The statutory authorities may advise on a number of areas. For example, the Garda Síochána may provide advice on public order, security, traffic management and policing services. Health boards may provide advice on the appropriate level of emergency medical services and public health matters. Local authorities may provide advice on fire safety, litter control and other structural aspects. The possibility of introducing a new licensing system for outdoor events is currently being considered by my Department in the context of the new planning Bill, the drafting of which has been approved by Government following a comprehensive review of the planning system.</P>
    <P>The celebrations for St. Patrick's Day and the millennium are occasions on which we can be proud of our heritage and the economic development of our country. However, it is timely that we now learn from the experience of the recent celebrations and immediately plan for the forthcoming events. I am happy to arrange for discussions between the various agencies and Government Departments involved as a means of securing the safe organisation and management of events, especially the forthcoming millennium celebrations.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for coming into the House to listen to what I have to say. I wish to ensure a District Court is available to the people of Carrigaline, County Cork. Carrigaline and the surrounding area is home to almost 20,000 people who are serviced by a farcical District Court system. The judge in the district, district No. 20, Judge Pattwell, said before the last sitting that he would no longer hold court in Carrigaline due to grossly inadequate facilities.</P>
      <P>The courtroom is situated in Carrigaline community hall. It is far too small, however, for the number who have to attend court. It has a low ceiling. There is not a holding cell for remand prisoners and no private consultation rooms, which are desperately needed, particularly when it comes to family law cases. Even the witness box is far too small. Witnesses have been known to fall out of it during court sessions. Facilities for solicitors are non-existent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will tell the Minister about what happened at the last court sitting on 11 March. If the matter was not so serious, it would be amusing. At 10.30 a.m. a family law sitting began. Those who were not involved were asked to wait in the car park. At 11.15 a.m. they were told that there was a CIE <Col N="1010" /> bus waiting to take them to the courthouse in Cobh as the judge had refused to hold court in Carrigaline.</P>
    <P>The fastest way to Cobh from Carrigaline is by car ferry across the harbour from Glenbrook. Everybody who had a car drove. The rest got the bus. The ferry operator refused to take the bus on board with the result that it had to travel around the harbour to Cobh, a distance of more than 30 miles from Carrigaline. Those who travelled by car arrived in Cobh 40 minutes before those who travelled by bus. The court finally got under way at about 12.30 p.m.</P>
    <P>The story does not end there. There was no bus to take people home after the court sitting. How can we expect people to respect the law and the court system when this farcical situation is allowed to continue? The court is due to sit tomorrow and nobody seems to know what will unfold. A judge would not take the stand that Judge Pattwell has taken if the courtroom facilities were in any way acceptable.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister not to allow this joke to continue. The people of Carrigaline need a courthouse. The Minister should make funds available to provide them with a functional courtroom which will allow the justice system to function properly so that the law can be taken seriously.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the difficulties in the accommodation used by the District Court for sittings in Carrigaline. The courts are held in the community hall which is rented by Cork County Council in accordance with the provisions of the Courthouses (Provision and Maintenance) Act, 1935. The District Court judge has recently expressed his dissatisfaction with the venue provided for District Court sittings in Carrigaline and, particularly, the lack of adequate facilities in family law cases. He has indicated that he will adjourn sittings from Carrigaline to another court area in his district, Cobh, if suitable court accommodation cannot be acquired locally.</P>
      <P>The venue in question is rented by Cork County Council. The court sits in this venue approximately 18 days per year. The facilities provided do not always equate with the requirements of a court, particularly in the area of family law business which is a sensitive issue.</P>
      <P>The current court premises are privately owned and my Department cannot allocate funding to improve the facilities. The funding available to my Department is directed towards the refurbishment of dedicated courthouses throughout the country. The Deputy will agree that a significant amount of work has been done to upgrade court accommodation throughout the country in recent years. I have provided £8.5 million this year in capital funding for the courts building programme and a further £6.5 million for the maintenance and upkeep of court buildings. This is the highest figure provided to date for the refurbishment of court accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1011" /> It is policy that priority be given to upgrading court venues which have a high number of court sittings, that is, the courthouses in county towns which accommodate the District and Circuit Courts and the High Court on circuit as well the offices of the District and Circuit Courts. On this basis the old model school in Cork city was refurbished to accommodate the District Courts and major refurbishment work is under way on the Circuit Court in Washington Street, with phase 1 almost completed. Work will begin shortly on the refurbishment of Mallow courthouse which accommodates the staff of the District Court office.</P>
    <P>Officials of my Department, Cork County Council and the District Court clerk recently visited Carrigaline to examine the present court facilities, to discuss the concerns expressed by the District Court judge and identify possible alternative court accommodation in the town. Cork County Council is responsible under the Courthouses (Provision and Maintenance) Act, 1935, for the provision of court accommodation. It has been unable to identify a suitable alternative venue in Carrigaline. My Department is continuing to review alternative solutions to the problem.</P>
    <P>I understand the District Court judge adjourned the Carrigaline District Court sitting on 11 March from Carrigaline to Cobh. This was a matter for the judge and I cannot intervene in such decisions. I recognise the inconvenience and <Col N="1012" /> hardship caused for the public in having to travel longer distances to court, particularly in this instance where I understand the District Court judge adjourned the sittings to Cobh for later that day. To alleviate the inconvenience to the public, my Department arranged to have transport available to transfer the public to Cobh and back.</P>
    <P>I am anxious to ensure suitable venues are provided at convenient locations for court users. I must take into account, however, the views of the sitting judge and the need to provide accommodation appropriate to the functions of the courts. I am considering the options open to me regarding future sittings of Carrigaline court as I am anxious to ensure the court-going public of the Carrigaline district have easy access to appropriate court facilities as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>It is recognised that there are a number of inadequate venues throughout the country, not just in this District Court area. I express my deepest appreciation to the District Court judges, members of the legal profession and the public who put up with accommodation which is less than satisfactory. </P>

      <P>The Health and Safety Authority is the State body charged with responsibility for the administration, enforcement and promotion of all workplace health and safety legislation.</P>
      <P>Due to the high-risk nature of agriculture, it has always been a priority area of activity for the authority which carries out a high number of inspections per year in the sector, and offers advice and information to farm groups countrywide in addition to making its staff available to farmers through attendance at farm shows and exhibitions including the National Ploughing Championship.</P>
      <P>In 1999 the Health and Safety Authority has planned 1,000 inspections in the farming and forestry sector. Particular attention will be paid throughout the year to the promotion of child safety with the assistance of farming organisations, the education authorities and the Garda community liaison service and an emphasis will also be placed by the authority on encouraging farmers to carry out appropriate risk assessments and to draw up safety statements. In addition, the authority will participate in a European campaign on farm safety focusing in particular on safety statements and child safety education and training.</P>
      <P>Some years ago the authority established a farm safety task force to offer guidance to the authority and to spearhead promotion activities. The members of this task force are drawn from the farming community itself, and they work closely with farming organisations such as the IFA, the ICMSA, the ICA, Teagasc, the farm relief service, and also the insurance industry, in highlighting the hazards and risks associated with farming, and the measures required to control such hazards.</P>
      <P>In the light of the number of farm deaths in 1998 and already this year, I have asked the authority to have urgent consultations at top level with the farming interests so that adequate direction is given to the efforts to reduce accidents on farms. Farm safety will continue to be a priority area of activity and attention for both myself and the Health and Safety Authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As with all sectors of employment, prevention is the key element in tackling workplace accidents <Col N="1014" /> and fatalities. Farmers must acknowledge that farming is a hazardous occupation which carries very specific risks to themselves, to their workers and, indeed, to their families. As part of the preventative process, I strongly urge any farmer, who has not already done so, to draw up a safety statement. Where such statements exist it is vital to keep them under regular review. I also appeal to farmers and farm workers to exercise constant care and vigilance in their work practices, especially where there are children on the farm and particularly with longer days and school holidays approaching.</P>
    <P>The Health and Safety Authority has an extensive range of information material available to anyone seeking advice and guidance. The authority works closely with all of the major farming organisations in their promotional activities and awareness-raising exercises. I commend both the authority and the farming organisations for their work in this regard, and I encourage all farmers to seek information from either of these sources on how best they can improve their work practices and so ensure the health and safety of themselves and their families.</P>

      <P>The Health and Safety Authority is responsible for the day-to-day enforcement of occupational health and safety and I have no direct function in this regard.</P>
      <P>The authority has informed me that the report referred to by the Deputy, sets out, in response to a questionnaire, the attitudes of 659 working adults in the age group 25 to 50. The report shows that those surveyed felt that work had adversely affected their health and contributed to an increase in their weight, less available time for exercise, exposure to other people's tobacco smoke and an increase in alcohol consumption. The report also found that respondents felt that the working day was becoming more intensive, and that those who take fewer breaks during the day and who work longer hours are more likely to believe that their health is being adversely affected by their work.</P>
      <P>While I can offer no further comment on this report, I can assure the Deputy that, in Ireland, we have comprehensive legislation relating to the general protection of the safety, health and welfare of people while at work. This legislation is administered, enforced and promoted by the Health and Safety Authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1015" /> The Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, is the principal legislation dealing with workplace health and safety. It is a detailed piece of legislation which clearly sets out the responsibilities which both employers and employees have in relation to providing and maintaining a safe working environment. The Act applies to all places of work and covers all employers, employees and the self-employed.</P>
    <P>The 1989 Act places the primary duty of care for the safety, health and welfare at work of employees on the employer in the first instance. This applies to all workplace health and safety matters including such issues as workplace stress, violence and bullying.</P>
    <P>Under section 12 of the 1989 Act, every employer is obliged to prepare a written safety statement. This statement should be based on an identification of the hazards, and an assessment of the risks, to safety and health at the place of work. The statement should also specify the manner in which the safety, health and welfare of workers is to be secured. Both I and the authority would encourage all employers to use the process of preparing a safety statement to examine the physical and psychological risks to workers and to ensure the workplace is structured and managed in such a way that workers are not placed under extreme levels of stress which may have a negative or detrimental effect on their physical well-being.</P>
    <P>The Health and Safety Authority has produced a booklet on the prevention of stress at work and it is intended that this will be revised during the current year. Stress in the workplace, in whatever form it comes, is unacceptable and is a health and safety issue. The emphasis is on the management of workplaces in a way that prevents unnecessary stress.</P>
    <P>Employees, too, have a role in ensuring they care for their own health and do not expose themselves unnecessarily to risk as a result of unhealthy lifestyles or working conditions.</P>

      <P>The local employment service is just one component of our National Employment Service function, with the other, and indeed larger, component being provided by FÁS. They have a critical role to play in helping unemployed people back into work, particularly in the context of our national action plan for employment. FÁS itself has undertaken a major reform and strengthening of its employ<Col N="1016" /> ment service and additional funding has been provided both to increase its personnel resource as well as its operating systems. Likewise the local employment service is being expanded to a further seven areas this year which will bring to 25 the number of areas throughout the country in which it is operational.</P>
      <P>I am concerned to ensure we get the best possible value from the considerable resources &ndash; amounting to around £25 million in this current year &ndash; which we are investing in our employment services. We need to achieve better co-ordination and complementarity between the two strands of the service, which I believe can best be achieved through an improved organisational structure. I am developing proposals in that regard which I will bring to Government shortly. The aim is to ensure that the further development of our employment services and infrastructure will take place in a co-ordinated and coherently planned way and, in particular, ensure that the dangers of duplication of effort and resource, which exists under current arrangements, is avoided. I would, therefore, see any further development of our employment service taking place within this framework.</P>
      <P>The Deputy's question refers to &ldquo;job creation initiatives&rdquo; and I take it the reference is to reintegration measures aimed at the unemployed. Since Partnership 2000 was agreed there has been an overall increase in labour market reintegration places under the aegis of my Department and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs for long-term unemployed persons of at least 25,000.</P>
      <P>The revised Estimate for my Department this year provides for 10,275 new places on active labour market initiatives including 875 new job initiative places, 1,500 bridging programme places to enable long-term unemployed to enter mainstream training and 5,200 job club places. In 1999 my Department will also provide for an average of 37,500 places on community employment.</P>
      <P>The Government's aim in enhancing the range of active labour market places has been to focus on programmes with the best employability outcomes and to target places at specific disadvantaged cohorts in the labour market, such as very long-term unemployed and lone parents.</P>

      <P>A Commission proposal for a Council directive establishing a general framework for informing and consulting employees in the European Community was published in November of last year but has not been placed on the agenda for the Social Affairs Council. It is at the discretion of the Presidency of the day to set the agenda for discussions by the Council.</P>
      <P>In Ireland a wide range of statutory provisions for information and consultation is already in place, which addresses areas of vital interest to employees. These provisions include: the Protection of Employment Act, 1977 (as amended by the Protection of Employment Order, 1996); covering collective redundancies; European Communities (Safeguarding of Employees' Rights on Transfer of Undertakings) Regulations, 1980; certain provisions of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989; Transnational Information and Consultation of Employees Act, 1996, which applies to large-scale multi-nationals and particular terms of the Organisation of Working Time Act, 1997.</P>
      <P>Partnership 2000 includes commitments by the social partners and the Government to the development of partnership at the enterprise level. These include the advancement of information and consultation in the workplace. Many Irish based enterprises are developing employee information and consultation as part of a competitive strategy, which recognises the role and value of employees in business development.</P>
      <P>I question the need for such a directive at this time. However, the social partners will be consulted and the text of the directive is being examined in preparation for the beginning of the consultation process.</P>

      <P>On 20 October 1998, the Government decided to establish a single regulatory authority for the financial services sector. On the same date, it also agreed to set up an implementation advisory group to make recommendations for the basis on which the new authority should be established. The group was furnished with comprehensive terms of reference and asked to report back to the Tánaiste and to the Minister for Finance by the end of February 1999.</P>
      <P>Due to the complex and wide-ranging remit which it was given and the extensive consultations which were undertaken with interested parties, the group found that it was not possible to meet its original deadline and requested a limited extension to enable it to furnish a substantive and quality report. The Government recognised the importance of adequate preparations for the establishment of the new financial regulator and, at its meeting on 23 February, approved an extension of its deadline to the end of April 1999 to enable the group to complete its work to a high standard.</P>
      <P>The group is continuing its deliberations and is attempting to reach agreement on a broad range of complex issues. It would be unhelpful of me to comment on specific issues at this stage. I await the report of the group which I expect to receive at the end of April.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16 and 18 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister with responsibility for the year 2000 problem, I launched a national business awareness campaign in May of last year. The success of this campaign is evidenced by a survey, conducted by the Irish Computer Society, which showed, in September last, that almost nine out of ten businesses were aware of the year 2000 problem. It also showed, however, that only 52 <Col N="1019" /> per cent of companies had already begun year 2000 projects.</P>
    <P>Despite the high levels of awareness, the somewhat poorer level of action is worrying. For this reason and to heighten knowledge of the need to take early and definitive action; I launched the Enterprise Ireland National Y2K Information Service in December last, specifically geared to the needs of small and medium sized companies. The new information service includes a helpline number &ndash; 1850 57 2000. Callers are provided with an information pack including a directory of Y2K consultants and service providers. In addition the service provides a series of training workshops both to companies and to intermediaries such as the county and city enterprise boards and many others.</P>
    <P>The new information service also operates a dedicated website providing updated versions of its information pack and various other relevant material. The Y2K website provides links to other suitable sites of direct benefit to SMEs.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, I am still concerned about the levels of preparedness of Irish companies to deal with the millennium bug problem. To try to accurately gauge their preparedness, Enterprise Ireland has initiated a comprehensive national survey on the levels of compliance of Irish companies. This survey will be repeated every quarter for the remainder of the year to assess the changing levels of compliance and to direct actions to stimulate compliance. The first results are expected next month.</P>
    <P>I am broadly satisfied that the awareness campaign has been a success and I reiterate the Government has no responsibility towards ensuring that companies actually take our advice and get their systems compliant.</P>
    <P>A total of £42,964 was spent on the campaign during 1998. A sum of £300,000 is being made available to Enterprise Ireland for the awareness campaign this year. A further sum of £30,000 has been included in our Department's Estimate for spending on this issue during 1999, if required. Before the current campaign got under way, £10,000 was spent in 1997 on the production of a leaflet highlighting the problem. This leaflet was distributed widely. The Government has also included £40 million in the last national budget, for public sector compliance.</P>
    <P>Continuing efforts to publicise the issue will continue during this year and I have addressed several conferences already on the subject and will continue to use every opportunity to publicise the subject. The Enterprise Ireland campaign which I have already outlined will continue throughout this year and into the early part of next year. I have arranged that the city and county enterprise boards will organise a series of events for their client companies during the year and the first of these is being launched this week. Shannon Development is organising a series of seminars next month. Various initiatives have <Col N="1020" /> also been undertaken by private sector groups and I have encouraged all of these projects.</P>
    <P>It has been made very clear over the last three years, that the role of Government has been to raise awareness for business on the issue. There is no question of State funding, including my State sponsored loan scheme, being provided to companies to defray the costs of ensuring that their systems are compliant. We do not consider that it would be appropriate for the State to get involved in such funding.</P>
    <P>Individual enterprises must identify the issues as they affect their companies and devise solutions and may have already done so. This is primarily a management issue, just like other management issues which arise all the time in the running of business. I do not consider it to have any political context. It is a matter for each individual business, and other users of computer systems, to assess the full implications of the year 2000 on their particular systems, to identify the necessary solution and take remedial action forthwith.</P>

      <P>The Health and Safety Authority is the State body charged with responsibility for the administration, enforcement and promotion of all workplace health and safety legislation.</P>
      <P>A total of 26 fatalities were reported to the authority in the construction and construction maintenance sector in 1998. There were 579 non-fatal accidents in the sector reported to the authority and these are estimated to be about a quarter of all reportable injuries sustained in the sector.</P>
      <P>The management of health and safety in all sectors of employment is based on the principles of legislation, enforcement, information and partnership. The Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, the 1993 General Application Regulations and the 1995 Construction Regulations all provide a strong legislative base by which safety standards in the construction sector can be managed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This legislation is enforced in a targeted and proactive manner by the Health and Safety Authority. However, both I and the Authority are of the firm belief that for greater health and safety improvements to be brought about in the construction sector there must be a stronger partner<Col N="1022" /> ship approach &ndash; by all the parties at all levels in the sector &ndash; to the issue of safety.</P>
    <P>During 1998 I launched the Construction Action Programme &ndash; this action programme was drawn up by the Health and Safety Authority after consultation with both sides of industry. The programme is designed to address the specific issues surrounding health and safety in the construction sector.</P>
    <P>As part of the programme, a team of inspectors was established within the authority dedicated to the inspection of construction sites. The task force has been operating in the Dublin area since September 1998 and will continue to target unsafe building sites. Other elements of the action programme include the following; all public sector clients &ndash; Government Departments and their agencies &ndash; have been asked to ensure that construction contracts are only awarded to firms or contractors with a safety statement in place; the development of a code of practice and accompanying video in safe scaffolding, both of which are expected to be ready for launch shortly; the preparation of a code of practice for fragile roofs with a view to improving safety standards; leading private sector companies who participate in the authority's good neighbour scheme will be asked to focus particularly on the safety standards of contractors undertaking construction and maintenance work for them; the authority's construction safety advisory committee, which includes representatives of both sides of industry, is continuing its work, including examination of the safety, health and welfare recommendations arising from the Forum on the Construction Industry, which was established following the strategic review of the industry commissioned by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government; the committee is also considering in detail the issue of safety representation and consultation in the construction industry and it is expected that recommendations in the matter will be submitted to the Board of the Authority shortly; the role of clients in construction safety is also being examined by the advisory committee with a view to producing practical guidelines; improvements in the training of workers is another key area of concern. In this regard, FÁS has brought together various training programmes under the construction skills certification scheme. The authority has discussed with representatives of both sides of industry ways of ensuring that training initiatives such as this have a maximum take-up.</P>
    <P>The construction action programme is an example of the pro-active approach of the authority to its statutory functions and obligations. It is a wide-ranging exercise which seeks to involve all the players, from client to workers, and to highlight their respective roles in improving site safety. In addition, the authority has continued to meet with both sides of industry as part of the drive to improve the safety culture of the construction sector at all levels.</P>
    <P>The authority's programme of work for 1999 <Col N="1023" /> plans for a further 4,300 pro-active inspections in the construction sector in 1999, compared with an outcome of 4,662 in 1998, with the main focus on safety management including training; manual handling; noise control; safety in low-rise housing and welfare facilities.</P>

    <P>Our health and safety legislation is fundamentally sound legislation which provides effective mechanisms for the proper management of workplace health and safety. Nonetheless, as the principal legislation in this area was ten years old last year, I asked the tripartite board of the Health and Safety Authority to review the legislation and report back to me on any proposals to improve it further. I look forward to receiving that report at an early date. In the meantime, the existing legislation continues to be enforced in a targeted manner by the Health and Safety Authority and is complemented by the commitment and activities of the social partners. It is through this continued commitment from all sides that we can bring about real improvement in safety standards.</P>

      <P>The level of unemployment and of long-term unemployment continues to fall with the standardised unemployment rate of 6.8 per cent. However, the Government recognises that unemployment continues to have a particular high concentration in some communities which must be tackled vigorously. In this context I have noted the recent Combat Poverty Agency report referred to by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This year I have extended the local employment service to an additional seven areas, mostly urban, increasing the total number of local employment services to 25. The particular focus of the local employment service is on persons most removed from the labour market. It is also my intention during the course of this year to ensure that the co-ordination which exists between FÁS and the LES network is further developed and improved in the interests of the users of those services. The Government's employment action plan is being implemented vigorously and is having a very positive effect in encouraging young adults into jobs and training opportunities. With effect from May 1999, it will <Col N="1024" /> be extended to persons aged 25 to 34, who are 12 months unemployed, with a view to offering them job guidance or a quality training or education place. This process of systematic engagement will in, due course, be extended to further cohorts of long-term unemployed on a phased basis.</P>
    <P>This year I have also provided for over 11,000 places on new active labour market initiatives, most of which are targeted at the long-term unemployed.</P>
    <P>Taking these together with the pro-work measures in the 1999 budget will, I believe, substantially improve the employment prospects of persons living in areas of high unemployment.</P>

      <P>The report of the authorised officer into the sale by National Irish Bank Financial Services Limited of certain insurance products had been passed to the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Revenue Commissioners. I have been advised that the Director of Public Prosecutions has referred the report to an Garda Síochána for investigation.

      <P>A legal challenge to the inspector's work by certain National Irish Bank managers was only resolved in the Supreme Court on 21 January last. In a further challenge to aspects of this case the High Court on 19 March 1999 ruled against National Irish Bank Ltd. and National Irish Bank Financial Services Ltd. in their application to prevent the inspectors from investigating the bank's compliance with deposit interest retention tax &ndash; DIRT.

      <P>The proposal referred to by the Deputy would involve the imposition, on a harmonised basis throughout the European Union, of a royalty charge on sales of works of visual and plastic art, such as paintings and sculptures, the proceeds of which would be paid to artists or to their successors in title, subject to a time limit of 70 years after the death of the artist concerned. This charge would not be a tax; rather, it would be similar in nature to a copyright royalty on literary works. Royalties of this nature are already collected in most member states of the EU, with Ireland, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Austria being the only states which do not apply the principle of artist's resale right.</P>
      <P>Successive Irish Governments have made it clear that they do not favour the imposition of an artist's resale royalty, mainly on the basis that it would appear most unlikely to achieve the objective of assisting those artists who are in most need of an income flow, especially in the context of a small art market such as Ireland. This stance has been reflected in the course of Ireland's participation in discussions on the present proposal at EU level.</P>
      <P>The question of the artist's resale right was not discussed at the Internal Market Council of 25 February 1999, the matter being remitted for discussion at a future date.</P>

      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to recent press reports of comments attributed to the chief executive of the Hibernian Group regarding a review of its underwriting criteria.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Motor insurance underwriting criteria are normally based on underwriting experience including trends in the level, frequency and cost of claims <Col N="1026" /> for particular risks and classes of risk and are a matter of judgment by individual private insurance companies. Any changes in circumstances affecting the risk insured would have to be assessed by the insurer from an underwriting standpoint and the premiums charged will reflect any material increase in the risk. Increasing use is being made by insurers of modern technology in segmenting risk categories into more discrete groupings. This technology should give insurance underwriters the necessary tools to examine claims performance with more accuracy.</P>
    <P>In the light of normal practice in this regard, I was surprised by the comments attributed by the press to the chief executive of Hibernian Insurance regarding proposed alterations in their assessment of motor risks. I was also concerned at the implications that these alterations may entail for targeted motor insurance policyholders. Accordingly, I requested our officials to urgently seek clarification on the issue from the company. I also forwarded papers regarding this matter to the Motor Insurance Advisory Board for its immediate attention and appraisal. The company subsequently assured the chairperson of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board that the Hibernian Group had no proposals to alter its standard underwriting practices; that it did not intend to inquire into any individuals personal financial circumstances or use such information as a factor in quoting for motor insurance. The company confirmed that their underwriting criteria will continue to be dependent on an individuals historic claims, car type and engine capacity, driver age and experience, gender and whether they live in an urban or rural area.</P>
    <P>In a separate letter to me, Hibernian repeated the assurances it had given to the chairman of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board and confirmed that it does not discriminate against customers in selected addresses nor do they discriminate against persons because of their personal borrowing commitments. If that were so, it would raise certain ethical questions and matters of concern in the public interest.</P>

I asked the group to take account of and advise me on how best to implement certain recommendations of the Commission on the Newspaper Industry dealing with competition issues. The recommendations concern the factors to be considered in regulating changes of ownership of newspapers, that merger law be widened to enable consideration to be given to the acquisition of control over newspapers by means other than the acquisition of shares and finally that the issue of concentration of ownership be considered on a media wide as well as on a single media basis.</P>

      <P>I intend in the very near future to bring proposals to Government to establish a new organisational framework for the employment services in Ireland. These proposals are being brought forward against a general background of falling unemployment and a tightening labour market, the development of enhanced employment/placement services by FÁS, the ongoing expansion of the local employment service, and the adoption of a preventative strategy, consistent with European employment guidelines, aimed at inhibiting extended youth and long-term unemployment.</P>
      <P>Our employment service is currently organised on a dual basis, comprising the FÁS employment service and the local employment service (LES) with each managed and operated under a separate authority. There has been an increasing convergence between the roles and client base of the two services with all the dangers that that represents in terms of potential duplication of resource and effort as well as lack of co-ordination and complimentarity in responding to the needs of unemployed people. It is essential, accordingly, that the services are organised and developed to optimal effect to ensure the best results from the resources invested.</P>
      <P>I am confident that the new organisational arrangements which I will be proposing on foot of an extensive period of consultation with all interested groups, including the social partners will for the first time, give the partnership perspective a role in the national employment service while continuing to have regard to the partnership dimension at local level in particular in relation to the operation of the LES.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may be aware that I have spoken to the House on many occasions on the subject of the relatively high motor insurance burden borne by young drivers. I would refer again to the 1996 Deloitte &amp; Touche report on insurance costs and its findings that universally motor insurance costs are high for all young drivers, relative to rates charged to more mature motorists. Adverse statistical facts of a detailed nature relating to claims frequency and claims cost for young drivers have been noted and enumerated in the House, and it is evident from available data that the key to reducing insurance costs for young drivers is to improve their standards of driving and their appreciation of road safety.</P>
      <P>As I mentioned in previous replies, a number of initiatives have been and are being taken to improve driving standards and safety awareness among young drivers. These include the introduction of a scheme of insurance premium discounts by the insurance industry, in conjunction with the driving instructors register, on completion of a required number of driving lessons and the introduction of road safety educational programmes for students and advertising campaigns by the National Safety Council to discourage speeding. I have also exhorted my Government colleague, Deputy Noel Dempsey, Minister for the Environment and Local Government, to pursue his Department's examination of a graduated licensing system for learner drivers.</P>
      <P>In addition, I have re-established the Motor Insurance Advisory Board which is to advise me on the charges for motor insurance and the methods for providing motor insurance between different risk categories of drivers having regard to accidents and claims. The expanded membership of the new board, which includes a member representing young drivers' interests, a Garda representative and members nominated by the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Environment and Local Government respectively, is broadly representative of the consumer, insurance user, and road safety and departmental interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Certain concessions to young drivers have been introduced by major insurers in the Irish market against the background of increasing underwriting losses in motor insurance. The 1997 annual insurance report prepared by our Department showed that motor insurance underwriting losses increased from £90 million in 1996 to £114 million in 1997. The deteriorating underwriting situation has led some insurers to announce increases in certain insurance categories in 1998. In those circumstances, any reductions or discounts offered to young drivers must effectively be subsidised by lower risk categories of motorists. It does not make good commercial sense, nor is it equitable, that safer drivers should subsidise less responsible drivers. That simply reduces the incentive for safe driving among all classes of motorists, leading to increased claims costs and a progressive deterior<Col N="1030" /> ation in the insurers' underwriting account. The end result is that average motor insurance premiums in the economy will operate at a higher level than would otherwise obtain if the principle of risk based premium setting is strictly applied to all motor insurance categories.</P>
    <P>There is clearly no soft option for reducing motor insurance premiums for young drivers. As a group, they represent a very high risk for insurers and many insurance companies are reluctant to quote for that risk. As in any other branch of insurance risk, reductions in premiums can only be achieved by improved safety standards and, in the case of the young Irish motorist, the inculcation of safer driving standards and education in driving skills is the key to reducing their high accident rate which in turn should lead to lower premium quotations.</P>

      <P>The Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order, 1987, covers all grocery goods with the exception of fresh fruit, fresh vegetables, fresh and frozen meat, and fish as well as intoxicating liquor and other household goods ordinarily sold in grocery shops. The order prohibits practices such as below cost selling and advertising, boycotting, and hello money and provides for controls on terms and conditions of supply.</P>
      <P>The order is enforced by the Director of Consumer Affairs who has to date investigated in depth more than ten cases and has taken three alleged breaches of the order to court since the order's commencement. A recent allegation concerning a supermarket group is currently being investigated by the director.</P>
      <P>As I said in this House on 25 February last, I am deeply concerned that there is any suggestion of a breach of the groceries order which would be a most serious development that would fundamentally be anti-consumer.</P>
      <P>Any allegations that commercial arrangements exist which may be in contravention of the Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order, 1987, should be drawn immediately to the attention of the Director of Consumer Affairs who is responsible for enforcing the order and whose job includes advising business in this regard.</P>
      <P>Precise details of any arrangement including suppliers paying extra for bonus points schemes where products are specially promoted would need to be examined in detail by the director to determine the position.</P>

The group's terms of reference are to review and make recommendations on:&ndash; the mergers legislation in the context of a legislative consolidation; the effectiveness of competition legislation and associated regulations; cultural matters in the context of the 1991 Act and in particular section 4(2) of that Act; and, appropriate structures for implementing the above legislation.</P>
    <P>The primary purpose of the review group is to make recommendations designed to further improve on our competition regime in terms of its legislative provisions and its structures including reviewing the position of the Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order, 1987 with a view to making appropriate recommendations in this regard for the future.</P>
    <P>We expect to receive the report and recommendations of the group this year.</P>

      <P>Under section 21 of the Companies Act, 1990 information obtained using section 19 powers may only be published with the prior approval of the company concerned. Such approval was sought from Garuda Ltd. earlier this year. The company has however refused permission to publish the report on legal advice. I am considering, with my advisers, the most appropriate course of action to take in this matter.</P>
      <P>With regard to Fashill Homes Ltd. I will shortly be seeking the company's approval to publish the report of the authorised officer.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 34 and 41 together.</P>
      <P>The job initiative is a work re-integration programme targeted at the very long-term unemployed, persons on the live register for five years or more and aged 35 or over. Job initiative participants have access to three years' temporary employment. The 1999 budget added an additional 875 places to job initiative provision, bringing the total number of places available to 2,875.</P>
      <P>The first 1,000 job initiative participants are in the third and final year of their programme. An independent review of the pilot programme is being commissioned and any policy decisions regarding the future of the programme will be deferred until this report is to hand which should be by the end of May 1999. On the question of a further extension for the current participants, I have to stress that the fundamental objective of the programme is to facilitate their reintegration into the open labour market. I understand a number of participants have already left the programme prior to completing three years to take up jobs. This is an encouraging sign of the programmes efficacy and of the motivation of participants.</P>
      <P>On the basis of experience gained, my hope would be that a significant number of participants should be able to get jobs in the open labour market on completion of the programme and FÁS will provide progression advice and support to all participants in the lead up to completion. Programme sponsors have particular obligations in this regard also. I accept, however, that there may be some participants who face particular problems in taking this final step and can assure the Deputy that we will seek to deal with such cases in a sympathetic way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 35 and 84 together.</P>
      <P>The progress made in relation to the Government's commitment in its programme for Government to introduce a national minimum hourly wage has been considerable. One of my first tasks as Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment was to establish the National Minimum Wage Commission to advise on the best way to implement our commitment to a national minimum wage.</P>
      <P>The commission produced a comprehensive report which was published in April 1998. It recommended,<i> inter alia, </i>that a target date of 1 April 2000 be set to implement the commitment to the introduction of a national minimum hourly wage. The commission's report has been the foundation upon which further progress on the introduction of a national minimum wage has been achieved.</P>
      <P>Following receipt of the report of the National Minimum Wage Commission the Government approved the establishment of an interdepartmental group of officials to assist in formulating proposals and a plan of action on implementation. The group has commissioned a team led by the Economic and Social Research Institute to undertake a comprehensive study of the likely impact on those sectors of the economy most affected by a national minimum wage and on the economy as a whole. The information obtained will allow the group to assess the recommendation of the commission that the initial rate set should take into account employment, overall economic conditions and competitiveness. The ESRI is expected to submit its report at the end of this month.</P>
      <P>The interdepartmental group submitted an interim report which was published in November 1998. The interim report outlines a range of complex issues addressed by the group some of which require further analysis and consideration, including the scope of the national minimum wage, variations, options for enforcement and the need to ensure that claims for the restoration of relative pay differentials following its introduction are not entertained. The interim report identified a number of issues that should be the subject of consultations with the social partners. The interdepartmental group also invited written submissions on its interim report from interested parties and these submissions have been considered by the group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Officials of my Department are currently engaged in consultations with the social partners <Col N="1035" /> arising from the interim report of the interdepartmental group and will report back to the group on the outcome. Drafting of the heads of the Bill is continuing. It is expected to publish the National Minimum Wage Bill as soon as possible after receipt of the final report of the interdepartmental group.</P>
    <P>These developments clearly illustrate and underpin the Government's commitment to the introduction of a national minimum wage in order to protect workers who are vulnerable and prone to be exploited while ensuring that its introduction does not impair the competitiveness of the economy. I intend to have a statutory national minimum wage of £4.40 per hour in place by the target timescale recommended by the National Minimum Wage Commission on the expiry of Partnership 2000 in April 2000.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 36 and 81 together.</P>
      <P>The total number of job losses during 1998 based on data compiled by IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and Shannon Development is estimated at 16,483. The total number of jobs created in 1998, as returned by the agencies, amounted to 30,728, resulting in a net increase in jobs of 14,245. A table showing the breakdown of jobs lost and new jobs created on a county by county basis is being circulated in the Official Report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Protection of Employment Act, 1997, my Department has received a total of 996 collective redundancy notifications so far in 1999. A breakdown of these notifications on a county by county basis is also being circulated in the Official Report. In addition to the notified redundancies, Fruit of the Loom has announced job <Col N="1036" /> losses of 770 in 1999 at its Donegal plant. IDA Ireland has advised of a further 320 redundancies at Arlington Ltd. in County Laois. It should be noted that notified redundancies may not actually arise in all cases.</P>
    <P>Qualifying employees are entitled to statutory redundancy under the Redundancy Acts. Any individual who is concerned about the question of redundancy entitlements should contact my Department which will be glad to assist in clarifying the position regarding entitlements. <i>Ex gratia</i> redundancy packages are a matter for the companies themselves and I am not in a position to provide details in regard to this aspect.</P>
    <P>There are many reasons why companies close or reduce the numbers employed including, for example, rationalisation, competition in the market place, especially from low-cost countries, and relocation. During 1998 and 1999, among the significant closures announced by foreign companies, relocation to Greece and Malaysia was cited as a reason in the case of two large employers.</P>
    <P>A full comparison of job announcements and closures is not available as neither Shannon Development nor Enterprise Ireland announce details of the smaller job creation projects.</P>
    <P>In the case of IDA Ireland, job announcements in 1998 amounted to 24,595. This compares with a total of new jobs created in 1998 of 15,996. The number of jobs announced would in many cases be phased in over a period of years and would not all fall to be created in the year of announcement.</P>
    <P>Employment losses must be seen in the context of overall strong economic growth, declining unemployment, and sustained employment expansion throughout the economy. Employment is dependent on the success or failure of individual firms in the market economy and it is inevitable that some firms will fail, as indeed, many will thrive and generate additional employment. 1998 was the fifth successive year of strong economic growth and this is reflected in the numbers of new jobs created with the assistance of the development agencies.</P>

      <P>I set up the Donegal employment initiative on 16 September 1998 to assess and recommend the most appropriate responses to offset and compensate for the expected job losses in particular areas of Donegal, and draw up a set of priority actions for establishing Donegal as a prime competitive and attractive location for job creation investment.</P>
      <P>Since its establishment the taskforce has met on eight separate occasions. It has set up a number of sub-committees to oversee certain tasks, including consideration of submissions made by interested parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last January, one of these sub-committees, which deals with training and support services, <Col N="1038" /> met employee and management representatives at the various Fruit of the Loom plants to brief them on the programme of work being undertaken by the task force in relation to the provision of training and employment guidance counselling to the workers.</P>
    <P>The work of the task force is now well advanced and I understand that a report on its progress should be finalised for presentation to me at an early date. The report will address the range of issues covered in the terms of reference and outline the progress made since its establishment. These issues include the work undertaken by the development agencies in prioritising Donegal as a location for industrial development, the initiatives already supported by Government action in relation to tourism and air access <i>via </i>Derry City Airport, the carrying out of a skills analysis of the workers being made redundant at Fruit of the Loom plants and also at Donegal Shirt Company, and the putting in place of a number of FÁS/Cert training initiatives.</P>
    <P>I look forward to receiving this report which is expected to include some well focused recommendations for further action in respect of a wide range of issues, including infrastructure, education, training, the availability of suitable industrial sites, the promotion of foreign direct investment and the development of indigenous enterprise.</P>
    <P>Once I have had time to study the report, I propose to submit it to Government.</P>

      <P>In addition to the formal notification procedures under the Protection of Employment Act, 1977, and the Redundancy Payments Acts, 1967 and 1991, an early warning system in relation to firms in difficulty is operated by my Department in conjunction with the State development agencies. The aim is to ensure, as far as possible, that firms in difficulty are identified in time in order to enable corrective action to be taken with a view to improving competitiveness and minimising any potential job losses. The effectiveness of the early warning system, which will continue to be monitored closely, is very much dependent on the willingness of firms to make the agencies aware of potential difficulties.</P>
      <P>Redundancies notified to my Department under the Redundancy Payments Acts amounted to 13,600 in the period 1 January 1998 to 28 February 1999, including about 8,000 for manufacturing and related industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is committed to ensuring an equitable regional distribution of job opportunities and I have impressed on the industrial development agencies &ndash; IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland &ndash; the crucial importance of making even greater efforts to provide employment throughout the country. Recent announcements in respect of locations such as Sligo, Dundalk, Clonmel, Waterford and Mallow are concrete evidence of this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of potential investment from overseas companies, the agencies introduce the companies to locations which have particular strengths or suitable conditions for the projects concerned. Every effort is made to persuade companies to consider areas which have the highest <Col N="1040" /> need for employment or are having particular problems of industrial restructuring. On occasion, my Department has arranged for special task forces to assist local committees counteract unemployment shocks which had the potential to add to economic disadvantage. However, the final decision as to where to locate is made by the companies themselves, based on their assessment of their business needs.</P>
    <P>With regard to indigenous or domestic enterprises, the question of location is determined by where new businesses are being started or existing ones are expanding. Again, the location is decided by the businesses themselves and the level of activity will depend on the entrepreneurial spirit within each region.</P>
    <P>To encourage a greater regional spread, the agencies avail of a number of policy instruments such as making available, as appropriate, increased grant levels for potential investors in regional locations; stimulating and supporting a major programme of modern advance factory construction at key locations, with the involvement of the private sector; working closely with local authorities to have quality sites available at priority locations for new industrial investment; working closely with FÁS and local institutes of technology to identify specific skills which are available in the various regions.</P>
    <P>The location decisions of any business depend on a number of factors, such as the availability of a skilled labour force, good infrastructure and efficient public utilities. Development in these areas is being addressed in the National Development Plan 1994-1999, and the forthcoming national plan will have a strong regional focus.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1041" /> I am of the view that there should be greater transparency in the affairs of those companies listed on the Stock Exchange. Recently I indicated that the remuneration of individual directors, both executive and non-executive, should be disclosed in respect of quoted companies. I did so on the basis that this action would be in the best interest of all members of a company. Appropriate decisions can only be taken by shareholders with knowledge of critical information, which includes the remuneration level of its directors.</P>
    <P>Since making that statement the Institute of Directors have sought a meeting with me to put their point of view. I expect to meet them shortly. The Stock Exchange has indicated to me that it is considering the new Irish Association of Investment Managers guidelines on corporate governance and incentivisation schemes. I am not yet aware of the outcome of its deliberations.</P>
    <P>I am hopeful that this issue can be addressed on a voluntary basis. If not, I am prepared to consider introducing legislation to require disclosure of the remuneration of individual directors.</P>

      <P>I am engaging in widespread consultation with interested parties, including the social partners, in regard to the recommendations of the Deloitte &amp; Touche report. I have made no decision in regard to these recommendations. However, I fully recognise the value of community employment generally throughout the country. I am particularly conscious of the value of the scheme to schools and voluntary and community bodies and I will be taking these factors into account in any decisions I make.</P>
      <P>In parallel to the process of consultation currently ongoing the Government in the 1999 Estimates reduced the number of community employment places by 2,500 but increased the number of active labour market programme places under my Department alone by a net 8,875. This follows a deliberate strategy of increasing active labour market programme places with the best prospect for employability and of allowing unemployed persons to access mainstream FÁS training.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been significant growth in women's participation in community employment in recent years. In 1998, 27,737 women, 51 per cent completed this programme compared with 25,704 women, 46 per cent in 1997 and 22,683 women, 42 per cent in 1996.</P>
      <P>With regard to specific provision for women who wish to return to work following an extended absence from the labour market, FÁS provides return to work courses. This programme helps participants to develop the confidence necessary to re-enter the labour force and is also an important bridging programme for progression into comployment or other FÁS programmes. The programme is delivered on a part-time basis within local communities and 1,065 women completed return to work courses in 1998.</P>
      <P>Many women returners, however, do not undertake return to work training. They move directly into specific skills training programmes and into enterprise training programmes and from there into employment or self-employment. Anyone seeking a job or a suitable training programme can avail of the FAS placement service.</P>
      <P>The 1998 quarterly national household survey shows that women who have worked in the home are accessing jobs in substantial numbers and the work-friendly nature of the 1999 budget will assist this process.</P>
      <P>A working group, representative of the social partners, is considering the issue of access by women to labour market opportunities and is likely later this year to make recommendations on enhanced access. The group is chaired by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. Changes in eligibility criteria for admission to active labour market programmes will be made on foot of the recommendations of this group.</P>

      <P>All the workers who are due to be made redundant during 1999 at the four Fruit of the Loom plants have been issued with redundancy notices. These notices are due to expire between 23 and 30 April 1999. I understand, however, depending on the volume of work on hand, that short-term contracts may be given to a number of the employees.</P>
      <P>In relation to the Donegal Shirt Company, this company closed at the end of February and a redundancy package was agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Donegal Employment Initiative, which I established last September in response to the expected job losses at Fruit of the Loom, is working closely with the development agencies in efforts to find new employment opportunities for Donegal, which, of course, includes the areas <Col N="1046" /> affected by the job losses at both Fruit of the Loom and Donegal Shirt Company.</P>
    <P>IDA Ireland has placed the Donegal region firmly in focus with its overseas marketing staff by arranging visits to the various locations and familiarising them with the resources and facilities available. Over the past six months, IDA Ireland has been bringing companies on first time site visits to County Donegal and a number of these companies have returned for a second visit. Currently, out of these site visits, there are three companies involved in ongoing detailed discussions with IDA Ireland in relation to potential new investments. I am hopeful that there will be a successful outcome to the negotiations.</P>
    <P>In addition, the development of a new 27 acre business park in Letterkenny is progressing well, with the completed new advance factory attracting significant interest. Planning application has been lodged for a second 25,000 sq. ft. advance factory. Arrangements have also been finalised for the construction of a new quality office building at Windyhill in Letterkenny. These developments, together with the quality buildings available from Fruit of the Loom at Milford, Raphoe and Malin, will enable IDA Ireland to actively market industrial sites in a number of locations throughout Donegal north-east with a view to sustaining a geographical spread of employment opportunities in the area.</P>
    <P>Enterprise Ireland is actively pursuing indigenous enterprises for the region, particularly in the fishing, food and tourism sectors. It has approved financial support of £1.7 million to companies in County Donegal in 1998 which will help create almost 200 jobs over the coming years.</P>
    <P>In relation to training, FÁS and CERT, in co-operation with the Donegal Employment Initiative, have drawn up a joint programme for retraining workers who are to be made redundant at Fruit of the Loom and the Donegal Shirt Company.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation recently announced details of a £0.5 million CERT initiative involving a range of training programmes to help the workers who are being made redundant to find new jobs in the tourism sector.</P>
    <P>The retraining of the workers being made redundant by Fruit of the Loom and Donegal Shirt Company is viewed as a key priority by the Donegal Employment Initiative. In this regard, it has established a special sub-committee to deal with training and support services. Last January, this sub-committee visited the various Fruit of the Loom plants to meet management and workers' representatives to brief them on the programme of work being undertaken by the task force. This was followed by FÁS running a series of interview sessions at the various plants in order to provide personal employment guidance counselling for each worker and to register them with a view to future job opportunities. On completion of this exercise, FÁS has compiled a workforce analysis which identifies a profile of the workers and the <Col N="1047" /> training required. FÁS has also completed a workforce analysis in respect of the ex-employees of the Donegal Shirt Company.</P>
    <P>The Donegal Employment Initiative, through FÁS and CERT, plan to co-ordinate a wide range of education and training programmes, including the provision of training courses in each community area subject to the level of demand.</P>
    <P>I am hopeful that the priority actions being taken by the Donegal Employment Initiative with the co-operation of the various State agencies will be successful in attracting a range of new employment opportunities for the entire county.</P>

      <P>The figure of 8,611 unemployed represents the January 1999 figure from the CSO live register area analysis for County Mayo. This figure is still much too high, but the trend is downwards and the total figure has been reducing for some years now. In 1996 the total live register figure for Mayo stood at 10,001. Since then there has been, in line with the national trend, a steady and continuous fall in the numbers of those signing on. I hope to see this trend maintained and Government policy is focused and concentrated to ensure that this occurs.</P>
      <P>There are a wide range of State services and initiatives in place in Mayo to ensure the maximisation of job creation potential and to assist those not already in the active labour market to find gainful employment. Both Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland are actively promoting increased job formation and inward investment, as is the Mayo County Enterprise Board in the context of small enterprises. The services of FÁS and the Mayo local employment service are also widely available to help in the general areas of job placement and assistance to the unemployed.</P>
      <P>I think the Deputy will agree that there is considerable activity and commitment from the Government and all the agencies involved to the general development of County Mayo and to addressing the ongoing problem of unemployment there. I accept that much remains to be done but prospects for the future are good, and I have no doubt that recent trends in the fall in numbers of those out of work will continue.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 66 and 76 together.</P>
      <P>In December 1998, I reconvened the High Level Group on Trade Union Recognition and addressed it on a number of industrial relations issues. On 11 March 1999, the group adopted, and submitted to me, a report which includes an agreement on industrial relations issues. I thank the group for reporting back so speedily.</P>
      <P>The group agreed that where negotiating arrangements are in place, the most effective means of resolving differences which arise between employers and trades union representing employees is by voluntary collective bargaining, that is, the existing voluntarist industrial relations system.</P>
      <P>The group's report makes four proposals which are designed to underpin the voluntarist approach to industrial relations which serves this economy so well. These areas are as follows: (1) agreed arrangements to enable the parties to a dispute to work voluntarily with the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court on the pay and conditions elements of the dispute where negotiating arrangements are not in place and collective bargaining does not occur; (2) agreed exceptional arrangements which would confirm, in legislation, the Labour Court as the court of last resort in disputes where the agreed voluntary arrangements proposed by the group are not followed; (3) amendments to the Code of Practice on Disciplinary Procedures which would reflect existing legal provisions an best practice on grievance as well as disciplinary procedures; and (4) the parties providing essential services to amend their dispute procedures to include key provisions of the Code of Practice on Disputes in Essential Services before the expiry of Partnership 2000.</P>
      <P>This is an agreed report and I would like to express my appreciation for the work of the group's members, especially the IBEC and ICTU representatives. Debate on the group's proposals has commenced, not least within the social partner organisations</P>
      <P>The proposals in the report merit careful consideration by those concerned with national social and economic partnership, industrial relations generally, the role of the LRC and the Labour Court, and investment in business and jobs. I will in due course be presenting the report to Government.</P>

    <P>The new version of the question marked a major departure from the version used in previous census since 1961. The version used in those years asked respondents to write &ldquo;Irish only&rdquo;, &ldquo;Irish and English&rdquo;, &ldquo;Read but cannot speak Irish&rdquo; or to leave blank as appropriate. Both questions refer to the population aged three years of age and over.</P>
    <P>The new version of the question was introduced following pilot testing in 1993 and had the support of the then Roinn na Gaeltachta, the Department of Education and Bord na Gaeilge. It is generally accepted as being superior to the previous version because the layout makes it easier for respondents to answer the question and for the CSO to process the completed replies.</P>
    <P>Moreover, the additional information on frequency of using Irish was not available previously. The published information from the 1996 census has been widely used and provides a valuable input to policy formulation in the Irish language sphere.</P>
    <P>Because the Census of Population involves self-enumeration, the questions on the census form have to be as simple and straightforward as possible. While the question of necessity, involve a subjective assessment, the CSO is satisfied that, given the clear language used in the questions, the data obtained gives an accurate reflection of the incidence and frequency of use of the Irish language.</P>
    <P>Qualitative research would entail a specialist survey with interviewers trained in assessing linguistic competence. The CSO currently has no plans to conduct such research.</P>

      <P>The Government supports the development of the indigenous sector by providing a wide range of financial and other supports to help companies develop a sustainable competitive advantage leading to profitable sales, exports and employment. These supports, which are administered by Enterprise Ireland, include employment, marketing, technology, research and development, business and training grants and the provision of equity finance.</P>
      <P>Enterprise Ireland, which was established in 1998, brings a new approach to the development of the indigenous sector by focusing on identifying the business needs and the challenges facing its client companies in the competitive global market. It provides a streamlined and flexible response to those needs and challenges by offering support and advice on a basis which relates directly to the key strategic business functions of firms, that is, strategy assessment and formulation; research, development and design; production and operations; marketing; and human resources and finance.</P>
      <P>While the situation of our closest competitors is kept carefully under review, the maximum levels of support for enterprise in all EU countries are subject to general EU rules on State aids. At present the development agencies can offer assistance to enterprises of up to 57 per cent of investment costs in the non-designated areas, up to 71 per cent in the designated areas and up to 75 per cent in Gaeltacht areas. In practice, of course, the assistance offered is well below these limits. The designated areas are set out in the Third Schedule to the Industrial Development Act, 1986. New aid limits will apply from January 2000 when new EU guidelines come into effect.</P>
      <P>Industrial and trade policy takes a wider view of competitiveness beyond the provision of direct supports to enterprise. It addresses issues affecting the competitiveness of the business environment, including taxation, the provision of adequate infrastructure and skills. In this regard my Department works closely with other relevant Departments as appropriate.</P>
      <P>As regards Sligo and the Border counties, I can assure the Deputy that the Government is committed to ensuring the most equitable regional distribution of job opportunities and I have impressed on the industrial development agencies the crucial importance of making greater efforts to provide employment throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>County Sligo and the Border region generally is a priority location for IDA Ireland and the agency has introduced a number of significant measures to encourage investment to the area, including: increased grant levels for potential investors, where appropriate; working closely with FÁS and local institutes of technology to <Col N="1052" /> identify specific skills which are available in the region; and investment in land and buildings.</P>

      <P>The provision of retraining opportunities for the Fingal workers is being treated as a priority issue by FÁS. The regional placement officer together with personnel from the Letterkenny based training services division are arranging with the company to hold quality registration interviews with the workforce. On completion of this exercise, FÁS will compile a skills analysis report, which will enable it to arrange training programmes to match the needs of the workers.</P>
      <P>I am very hopeful, therefore, that the priority actions which have been put in place in response to the Fingal closure announcement will be successful in finding new job opportunities for Moville.</P>

      <P>I am fully alive to the immense contribution by small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to employment creation, output expansion and export growth. Government <Col N="1053" /> policy is very much directed at ensuring the continued development of SMEs. I am also cognisant of the difficulties for SMEs in endeavouring to tender for public or private contracts.</P>
      <P>The EU funded Operational Programme for Small Business 1995-1999 provides for a specific measure to facilitate access to public markets by SMEs. Four targeted actions were introduced for this purpose. These comprise:</P>
      <P>(i) publication annually of a directory of public sector buyers,</P>
      <P>(ii) the arrangement of workshops/seminars for buyers and suppliers,</P>
      <P>(iii) a cross-Border initiative to help SMEs access public sector markets in both the South and the North and</P>
      <P>(iv) the appointment of public procurement specialists within Enterprise Ireland. In September 1998, my Department commissioned a study to evaluate the opportunities for small firms in the public sector market. The study's findings, expected next month, should provide direction on future policy.</P>
      <P>Finally, I should add that inter-agency co-ordination arrangements have been established, at my request, between Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland, to facilitate the identification and promotion of purchasing opportunities for Irish based firms, including SMEs. Enterprise Ireland is also examining ways of streamlining its linkage programmes following the amalgamation of Forbairt and An Bord Tráchtála.</P>

      <P>The Competition Act 1991 based by analogy on Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty of Rome, prohibits anti-competitive activity in the economy. Specifically it prohibits anti-competitive practices and the abuse of a dominant position.</P>
      <P>The Act applies to undertakings, an undertaking being defined as an individual, a body corporate or an unincorporated body of persons engaged for gain in the production, supply or distribution of goods or the provision of a service.</P>
      <P>Section 4 prohibits and makes void all agreements between undertakings, decisions by associations of undertakings and concerted practices which have as their object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition in trade in any goods or services in the State or in any part of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1054" /> Section 5 prohibits any abuse of a dominant position.</P>
    <P>Section 6 provides that any person aggrieved as a consequence of anti-competitive activity has a right of action in the courts for relief, by way of injunction or declaration and damages, including exemplary damages.</P>
    <P>The Competition (Amendment) Act, 1996 was enacted to strengthen the body of legislation in the competition area by two important provisions. The 1996 Act contains offences, both civil and criminal, and penalties provisions for breaches of the rules of competition as set out in the 1991 Act. In addition, it provides for public enforcement of the rules of competition. A Director of Competition Enforcement with wide powers was appointed in order to give effect to the public enforcement provisions.</P>
    <P>As a result, therefore, of the enactment of the Competition (Amendment) Act, 1996 there are now two alternative ways of pursuing allegations of breaches of competition rules: (i) take civil action under section 6 of the Competition Act, 1991, or, (ii) make a complaint to the Director of Competition Enforcement requesting him to investigate the alleged breach(s).</P>
    <P>The Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order, 1987, covers all grocery goods, with the exception of fresh fruit, fresh vegetables, fresh and frozen meat, and fish, as well as intoxicating liquor and other household goods ordinarily sold in grocery shops. The Groceries Order prohibits practices such as below cost selling and advertising, boycotting, and hello money, and provides for controls on terms and conditions of supply. The Order is enforced by the Director of Consumer Affairs.</P>
    <P>It was intended that the old Restrictive Practices Act and Orders made thereunder would be revoked when the Competition Act, 1991 came into effect. However, the Groceries Order was retained after lobbying from the retail grocery sector and the industry.</P>
    <P>While consumers have been well served by our legislation in this area, I am open to suggestions and recommendations for improvement to the benefit of consumers.</P>
    <P>To this end, the competition and mergers review group is currently reviewing the position of the Groceries Order as part of its overall work. Its terms of reference are to review and make recommendations on the mergers legislation in the context of a legislative consolidation; the effectiveness of competition legislation and associated regulations; cultural matters in the context of the 1991 Act and in particular section 4(2) of that Act; and appropriate structures for implementing the above legislation.</P>
    <P>I expect to receive the report and recommendations of the review group this year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>Production of Apples new personal computer, the iMAC, commenced in Cork shortly after the iMACs launch in August 1998. It has been a very successful product and Apple has sold 800,000 iMACs since August 1998. Unfortunately, Apple decided that the manufacture of its iMAC product is to be sub-contracted to L.G. Electronics, located in Wales. This is part of a worldwide interlinked process in the Apple Company to reduce costs. The company has decided to relocate to a lower cost production regime.</P>
      <P>Every effort was made to retain maximum employment in Apple, Cork. The IDA maintained ongoing contact with key decision-makers at Apple headquarters in California-USA. This involved detailed discussions at a meeting between IDAs chief executive and senior Apple personnel at the company's headquarters in the US at the end of January this year.</P>
      <P>I can assure you that every support to find new jobs will be given to the employees at Apple affected by this recent decision. In this respect, employment prospects in Cork are generally positive at present and everything possible will be done by FÁS to enhance the employees prospects for re-employment.</P>
      <P>Apples Cork operation is, of course, to retain the manufacture of the G3 desktop products. In addition, Apple are reviewing other functions that could be added to Cork. Possible new functions include investing in the assets to convert Cork to a configure-to-order plant, and introducing finance and operations functions to support Apples European operations and call centre activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1056" /> IDA Ireland will continue to promote Cork aggressively for overseas mobile investment. Over the past two years 28 IDA-backed projects, involving over £600 million investment, have been announced and are under way in Cork. These projects have the potential to create nearly 7,000 new jobs and over 1,000 of these jobs are to be filled this year. Just last month, two significant projects were announced for Cork, with Nycomed Ireland to create an additional 150 jobs and Siemens to also create 150 new jobs.</P>
    <P>The announcement of Apples decision to move iMAC production to Wales is clearly a major blow to the workforce. I am hopeful, however, that the skills and experience of the Apple workforce should prove an attractive base for the new emerging jobs in Cork arising from recent announcements of new investment for the area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose taking Questions Nos. 85 and 86 together.</P>
      <P>Authorisation and supervision of non-life and life insurance companies is carried out under the legal framework of the Insurance Acts, 1909-1990, and regulations enacted pursuant to EU directives in the insurance area. The primary function of insurance supervision is to ensure that life and non-life companies adhere to statutory solvency rules and requirements, thereby enabling those companies to meet their obligations to policyholders and claimants. These directives, Acts and regulations set out criteria by which companies are properly authorised and supervised on an ongoing basis. As stated, the financial supervision of insurance companies places a necessary emphasis on monitoring their solvency position. This system of monitoring, therefore, ensures that insurance companies remain solvent and are in a position to meet their liabilities which provides security for policyholders and claimants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Allied to the financial supervision of insurance companies, the Insurance Division of my Depart<Col N="1057" /> ment encompasses a role in the development of a competitive and transparent insurance market. The main activities in pursuing this role include monitoring and responding to the changing conditions in the supply of insurance products, life and non-life, in the Irish market. The conditions include the factors affecting the cost of claims and premium charges, the information provided to the consumer as policyholder, saver and investor, changing EU requirements and the impact of insurance costs on economic activity. Finally, the role of the division is to oversee the regulation of insurance intermediaries and related matters. The division is responsible for overseeing the system of self-regulation of insurance intermediaries established by the Oireachtas through the Insurance Act, 1989.</P>
    <P>Specifically, and in accordance with the business plan of the insurance division of my Department, for 1998-9 the following consumer oriented activities are being pursued:</P>
    <P>1. Insurance Market Transparency</P>
    <P>Following intensive consultations with representatives of the insurance industry, consumer interests and other relevant parties, a draft of the proposed transparency regulations on life assurance is under examination by the parliamentary draftsman. The objective is that the life assurance regulations will come into effect on 1 September 1999. The pursuance of transparency regulations in the non-life area is also being examined.</P>
    <P>2. Investigations</P>
    <P>In general terms, the contents of insurance policies are subject to contract law and in that regard are subject to substantive rules relating to agreements between parties as defined under both common law and statutory provisions. Non-compliance with the Insurance Acts and regulations and contravention of such legislation is an offence subject to various penalties depending on the circumstances of each case and the particular legislative provision concerned. Where the Minister becomes aware that a breach of insurance legislation may have occurred, the Minister may appoint an authorised officer or officers under section 59 of the Insurance Act, 1989, to investigate non-compliance or contravention of the Insurance Acts and regulations. Normally, a report is prepared by the authorised officer for the information of the Minister. The Minister may refer the report to the appropriate authorities.</P>
    <P>Recently, investigations were undertaken into the alleged sale of unauthorised life assurance products by National Irish Bank Financial Services Ltd. and the allegations of churning of policyholders by Irish Life. This involved the replacement of existing life assurance policies by other policies to the disadvantage of the consumer. The report on churning was published by me in February 1999. The recommendations of the report are being actively pursued by my Department.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1058" /> 3. Motor Insurance Cost Reduction Programme</P>
    <P>I re-established the Motor Insurance Advisory Board in September 1998 in order to monitor trends in the cost and availability of motor insurance, the factors which contribute to the cost including the frequency of motor insurance claims and to difference in cost between various categories of insured motorist. International comparisons with costs and key factors in other EU countries will be examined. I expect to receive an interim report from the board shortly.</P>
    <P>4. Special Working Group on Personal Injury Compensation</P>
    <P>The Special Working Group published its first report in 1997 regarding the establishment of a personal injuries tribunal. The group has now proceeded to Strand 2 of its remit which is to carry out a study of the personal injuries compensation systems in operation in other countries and to advise on the merits of those systems as an alternative to the present tort-based system.</P>
    <P>5. Customer service/consumer complaints and queries</P>
    <P>I am not legally empowered to compel authorised insurance companies to accept or reject individual insurance risks, to set premiums at particular levels or to include or exclude conditions in insurance policies, subject to the overall consumer legislative framework. Nevertheless, while the Insurance Ombudsman deals with complaints and inquiries within set terms of reference, the Insurance Division of my Department continues to provide a full time service to the general public in relation to direct complaints and inquiries and to liaise with the insurance industry and others including the Insurance Ombudsman's office, where appropriate, in this regard.</P>
    <P>The role of the Insurance Ombudsman is essentially that of adjudicator, not regulator. The function of the Ombudsman's office is to resolve disputes between policyholders and insurance companies through mediation and, where necessary, adjudication which is binding on the insurance company involved and not the policyholder. The Ombudsman's digest of cases adjudicated and as presented in the annual report provides an important source of information to the regulatory authority. Because of the importance of this aspect, I am pursuing with the council chairman that the Insurance Ombudsman should have full autonomy in regard to the content of her annual report akin to the autonomy enjoyed by the Public Service Ombudsman in making his annual report. Consideration of the necessity for introducing statutory provisions in relation to the existing scheme or replacing it with a statutory Ombudsman scheme would obviously have to have regard to whatever proposals and recommendations emerge from the implementation group established by the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance to advise the Government on the establishment of a single regulatory authority for the financial services sector.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1059" /> The House will be aware that the Government decided in principle to establish a new Financial Services Regulatory Authority on 20 October 1998. The decision was linked to the public disquiet about financial scandals which have reduced public confidence in the financial services sector as a whole. The report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service called for the establishment of a single, independent regulatory authority which should be given powers in relation to all commercial, friendly and voluntary bodies, which handle funds or financial transactions on behalf of third parties or institutions in Ireland.</P>
    <P>My Department's main priorities are that the new authority should be a stand alone entity and that it should encompass both prudential supervision, consumer protection and enforcement. Consumer confidence is an important determinant of stability in the financial services sector as evidenced by the potential of recent irregularities in banking to threaten stability by undermining customer confidence in the integrity of the banking system. At this stage, it would not be possible to give a precise date as to when the necessary legislation will be brought before the Oireachtas. However, it is my intention to have it introduced at the earliest possible date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, and 95 together.</P>
      <P>Ireland has consistently stressed at the Internal Market Council the need to ensure the proper functioning of the Single Market to ensure the freedom of movement of goods, services, capital and people.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the conclusions of the Dublin European Council of December 1996, the European Commission drafted an action plan for the Single Market which was presented to the European Council in Amsterdam. The plan identified key faults in the Internal Market which needed to be addressed if the Internal Market is to function more effectively and lead to increased employment and higher incomes for European business and citizens. The deadline for the implementation of the action plan was 1 January 1999, the date for the introduction of the single currency. The plan contained four strategic targets whose achievements were necessary if the Single Market is to function more effectively. Each strategic target comprised a number of specific actions; there were 66 individual actions in total.</P>
      <P>At the Internal Market Council on 25 February 1999, the European Commissioner with responsibility for the Internal Market, Commissioner Monti, presented the first evaluation of the action plan. His opinion was that, by and large, the plan's outcome could be considered a success with progress sought in the plan in most areas having been achieved. The evaluation also identified the areas where further work is still needed to build upon the achievements in the plan and, also, where targets were not achieved.</P>
      <P>Reports submitted recently by the member states and the Commission, within the context of the Cardiff Process of Economic Reform, on the functioning of product and capital markets confirm that considerable progress has been achieved in developing the Internal Market through the dismantling of barriers to trade and by opening up national markets for increased competition. The Internal Market Council concluded that this positive development is not least the result of the action plan and the clear political commitment by member states and the Commission to achieve their objectives and, in particular, to speed up the implementation of Internal Market legislation and improve its enforcement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nevertheless, trade barriers and structural <Col N="1061" /> deficiencies remain, hampering market integration and efficiency and preventing citizens and business from enjoying the full benefits of the Internal Market. In this regard, the most recent survey carried out by the European Commission in September 1998 showed that, of over 4,000 EU firms questioned, most believe that there are still barriers to doing business in the Single Market, with the majority thinking that these are due, at least in part, to the manner in which rules are applied. In particular, technical barriers to trade are seen as the major remaining obstacle to trade. National specifications, standards, certification and the operation of the principle of mutual recognition were cited as sources of difficulty.</P>
    <P>On two occasions in 1997, I complained to the European Commissioner with responsibility for the Internal Market concerning major disruptions to the free movement of goods in the Single Market; the first as a result of the French lorry drivers road blockade and the second following the blockade of ports by British farmers. On a third occasion, the European Commission was requested to carry out a formal investigation into a complaint by an Irish exporter into alleged breach of Single Market rules by French authorities.</P>
    <P>In order to ensure in an effective manner the free movement of goods within the EU, in December 1998 the Internal Market Council formally adopted a regulation on the functioning of the Internal Market in relation to the free movement of goods among member states and a resolution on the same subject, confirming the full commitment by member states to take all necessary and appropriate actions to deal rapidly with serious disruptions to the free movement of goods. It will allow for rapid intervention by the European Commission, acting on its own initiative or at the request of a member state, in disputes or protests which block international transporters' access to markets.</P>
    <P>The Single Market Unit of my Department is available to assist any business or citizen who may be experiencing difficulties in exercising their rights in the Single Market. The unit seeks to ensure that every reasonable effort is made to resolve problems in the most efficient and simple means available. In addition, my Department's website, www.irlgov.ie/entemp.market.htm, contains details of contact points for business and citizens in key areas of the Internal Market.</P>
    <P>Decisive action is called for, at national as well as Community level, in order to eliminate remaining barriers. An examination of the member states and Commission reports by an EU Internal Market working group has suggested areas for further action in a number of specific areas: the legal and administrative framework; competition and state aids; parallel trade; technical barriers to trade; public procurement; public utilities; services and SMEs. The European Commission will bring forward proposals for the future governance of the Internal Market for consideration by the Internal Market Council in June next. The <Col N="1062" /> strategy will be informed, <i>inter alia</i>, by the analysis developed in the framework of the Cardiff Process of Economic Reform as well as ongoing surveillance of the Internal Market.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 92 and 93 together.</P>
      <P>As regards mergers legislation, I am responsible for administering the Mergers and Takeovers (Control) Acts, 1978 to 1996. In recent years, the only instance of commitments or obligations being entered into by companies under national mergers legislation arose in the 1996 acquisition by Statoil Ireland Limited of Conoco Ireland Limited. I am not aware of any failure by Statoil to comply with these undertakings.</P>
      <P>As regards competition law, under the Competition Acts, 1991 and 1996, the Competition Authority is empowered to grant licences and certificates in relation to agreements if certain conditions are satisfied. The Competition Authority is the agency responsible for implementing the Competition Acts and legal remedies are available to the Authority in regard to following up any alleged non-compliance.</P>

      <Quest>and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment if all overseas based firms dealing in consumer goods are giving a fair opportunity to Irish producers and manufacturers to supply their firms; if she has identified any major areas of concerns in this regard; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The European Single Market gives the right to any firm within the European Union to establish retail outlets in other member states and to source freely their supplies from within the EU. This is a right which many Irish firms are exploiting very successfully, both in terms of establishing businesses in other <Col N="1063" /> member states and in supplying the Single Market. Once the relevant provisions of EU competition law are respected and single market rules adhered to, it is open to all companies, including Irish branches of overseas firms, to source their products anywhere within the EU.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am anxious to ensure that Irish suppliers avail of the opportunities which the increasing number of overseas firms in the Irish retail market provide. To this end, Enterprise Ireland administers a supplier development programme which determines, at an individual company level, the appropriate changes required to assist Irish suppliers to respond to the challenges arising from the structural change under way in the market and to take advantage of new opportunities arising. To date, 30 companies have expressed an interest in the programme. Of these, four are now at the implementation phase where training and development <Col N="1064" /> of staff with specific improvement projects is being addressed. The remaining companies are being assessed as regards their suitability for strategic change.</P>

      <P>In 1997, FÁS embarked on a major programme of reorganising its service delivery structures to achieve a better focus of staff resources on key customer groups and to improve the efficiency of its administrative activities. These structural changes have enabled FÁS to place a new emphasis on its employment services, consistent with Ireland's employment action plan. Through a national network of 70 placement services offices, FÁS now provides an individualised advice and guidance service for jobseekers, a pro-active recruitment service for <Col N="1066" /> employers and a referral and placement service for FÁS training courses and employment schemes. Some further structural changes with a view to developing better synergies between the FÁS employment services and the local employment service are currently under consideration.</P>
      <P>Later this year, FÁS will assume responsibility for the administration of certain employment and vocational training services for people with disabilities. FÁS's objective is to mainstream the relevant services for people with disabilities, while at the same time recognising their special needs. Approximately 70 posts will be transferred to FÁS from the National Rehabilitation Board to assist in the delivery of these services.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for certain aspects of human resource development in enterprises will transfer from FÁS to Enterprise Ireland this year. Following consultation between the agencies and staff representatives, the reassignment of relevant staff and resources will take place shortly.</P>
      <P>Given the rapid developments which are now characteristic of the Irish economy and labour market, I expect that change and adaptability within FÁS will, in future, be ongoing features of the organisations drive to deliver a quality and professional service to its customers.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware from my previous reply to his two questions of 16 February 1999 on company closures, information concerning individual firms experiencing difficulty or likely to experience difficulty, who have notified my Department about proposed redundancies, is by its very nature both sensitive and confidential. It would be the prerogative of the companies themselves to disclose such information.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that the State development agencies under my Department continue to work closely with such companies to maximise competitiveness and minimise job losses. As the Deputy will also be aware, task forces representative of the agencies and the other interests concerned are endeavoring to deal with the problems associated with company closures in a number of areas, including Donegal, Dublin, Limerick, Longford, Mullingar and Laois. Every effort is being made to attract replacement industries and to encourage expansion of existing industries. Suitable re-training for workers is provided where necessary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>In my earlier replies I detailed the requirements imposed on employers by the Protection of Young Persons Act, 1996, and how the Act seeks to protect the welfare of children, persons under 16 years of age, and young persons, 17 and 18 year olds. The Act seeks to protect the welfare of young persons in the workplace by requiring employers to keep wages and employment records detailing the hours of work of any such young persons, rest intervals, etc. The Act also lays down specific limits as to the hours that can be worked by young persons and prohibits the employment of persons under 18 in late night work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Act is administered by the employment rights division of my Department and is enforced by the labour inspectorate within that division. <Col N="1069" /> Inspections of employers' records are carried out based on complaints received about specific breaches of the Act and as a matter of routine. Breaches of the Act can be detected by close examination of these records. Inspections take place during normal office hours as the majority of employers carry on business during these hours. Enforcement experience has shown that the majority of employers found to be in breach of the Act are willing to adjust their practices to conform with the legal requirements. To ensure that corrective measures are taken by employers in such instances and that further breaches do not occur, a follow-up inspection is usually carried out after a suitable lapse of time.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the methodology adopted in relation to inspection work in relation to the Protection of Young Persons Act, 1996, is reasonable and that inspections are organised and targeted in a way that makes most efficient use of the enforcement resources available to me.</P>
    <P>In 1997, for example, a targeted campaign was carried out in licensed premises in the Dublin area and in 1998 a similar campaign was carried out in fast food outlets nationwide. From January to the beginning of March of this year an intensive information campaign was carried out in the footwear-drapery and retail grocery sectors. In all some 4,139 premises were inspected for compliance with the Protection of Young Persons Act in the course of these campaigns. The labour inspectors are due to start in April a further comprehensive, six month long, enforcement campaign, focusing on the catering sector nationwide. It is expected that 1,000 cross-legislation inspections will be carried out in the course of this campaign, particular attention being paid to compliance with the Protection of Young Persons Act, 1996.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, I am satisfied that all reasonable measures are being taken to enforce the 1996 Act with a view to safeguarding the rights of young persons in the workplace. I am conscious of the concerns expressed by various groups in relation to the exploitation by less scrupulous employers of young persons and would urge anyone with information in relation to breaches of the Act to notify the employment rights division of such breaches. I am confident that all such reported breaches will be dealt with expediently and that every effort will be made by the officials of my Department to eradicate non-compliance with this and indeed any other employment rights legislation.</P>

      <P>My Department has received from Cork County Council a detailed report by consulting engineers on the erosion problems at Youghal. The report concluded that coast protection works involving extension of the existing groynes and beach nourishment would be required, at an estimated cost of £5.1 million.</P>
      <P>This report has been assessed by my Department and a further study has been recommended to assess the most cost efficient options for improving coastal defences at Youghal. Accordingly, I recently announced that, as part of my Department's coast protection programme for 1999, financial assistance of up to £30,000 is being made available to Cork County Council towards this assessment. The funding needs for a costed programme of protection works at Youghal will be considered in light of the outcome of this assessment.</P>

A memorandum of understanding was concluded with the company in October 1998 which will provide for the continued provision of facilities for An Slua Muirí in the coastguard station area. On foot of this agreement the Department withdrew its objections to the proposed development of a marina at the harbour.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>The following groups of the type referred to by the Deputy were appointed in the Department of Defence. As part of the White Paper preparation process, an inter-departmental group has been set up to consider the defence and security environment. This group comprises representatives from the civil and military branches of my Department, and the Departments of Foreign Affairs, Finance, Taoiseach, Justice, Equality and Law Reform and from the Garda Síochána. For security reasons the detailed work of the group cannot be published, however, the results of this study will form an input to the White Paper process.</P>
      <P>Otherwise, preparation of the White Paper will be supported in an ongoing way through the work of civil and military officers to generate the inputs to the White Paper in line with the developing consultative and management process. This work is to be channelled through a joint civil military project management group. I propose to bring the White Paper to Government by summer 1999. There are no specific costs associated with this group, other than salary costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the recent Government decision on the reviews of the Air Corps and the Naval Service, it was agreed that a consultation group <Col N="1076" /> should be established to provide a forum for the input of the key stakeholders in relation to the State air and sea services. There are two broad dimensions to the required planning work. The first of these relates to the strategic issues to be covered within the White Paper on Defence, the second dimension relates to effectiveness and efficiency measures recommended by Price Waterhouse Management Consultants. The consultation group, which I chair, comprises representatives from the civil and military branches of my Department, from the Department of Marine and Natural Resources, the Department of the Taoiseach, the Department of Finance and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
    <P>There are no specific costs associated with these groups. In all cases the work involved falls within the normal work of the civil and public servants involved.</P>
    <P>In January 1998 a steering group to oversee and direct a review of the Reserve Defence Force was established. The steering group has eight members, an independent chairman, who is a specialist in the field of organisation and restructuring, three senior military officers, three senior civil servants and a serving officer of An Forsa Cosanta Áitiúil. Secretarial services are provided by a civil servant from my Department.</P>
    <P>The chairman is paid an agreed rate for his services and also receives travelling and subsistence expenses. Total payments to him up to the end of February 1999 amount to £17,200. As part of its review work, the steering group has visited a small number of Reserve Defence Force training exercises and annual camps and a small amount of travelling and subsistence expenditure was incurred.</P>
    <P>The Curragh Task Force was established by the Government in July 1998. It is composed of representatives of departmental and State agencies with an interest in the Curragh. The primary function of the task force is to report and make recommendations on the future management and development of the Curragh and is due to make a final report to the Minister before the end of March 1999. The costs involved have been insignificant and will not exceed £1,000.</P>
    <P>Mr. M.J. Nolan was appointed as an individual special adviser to the Minister. His current annual contract remuneration rate is £38,177.</P>
    <P>It is assumed the Deputy's question does not comprehend bodies, which function outside of the Deputy but are related to it, such as the Army Pensions Board or Coiste an Asgard.</P>

      <P>The person named applied for the ten <Col N="1077" /> month special beef premium scheme on 17 November 1997 in respect of four animals, one of which was ineligible on the grounds of age. He did not submit an area aid application, therefore his premium entitlements were restricted to 15 livestock units. However, as he had a milk quota of 20,950 gallons, the equivalent of 23.3 livestock units, no premium was payable on the animals in question.</P>

The residential tax incentives of a scheme such as the rural renewal scheme can be introduced prior to the business elements of the scheme receiving EU Commission approval. The EU Commission has indicated that it does not consider residential tax incentives as coming under EU state aid rules and, consequently, these reliefs can be introduced without EU Commission approval, both in the case of owner occupiers and lessors of rented residential property.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the recent report by the British Health Education Authority which claims that smokers are being misled by the way in which low tar cigarettes are packaged and promoted; his views on the matter; the action, if any, he will take as a result; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Claims have been made by the tobacco industry that consumption of low tar cigarettes reduces the risk of lung cancer for smokers. However, research carried out internationally in recent years confirms no reduction in the risk to smokers from low tar cigarettes.</P>
      <P>Regulations which control the advertising, sale, promotion and packaging of tobacco products in Ireland require that advertisements for, and packages of, cigarettes display a health warning. The tar content of the cigarettes must be indicated on the packet. The use of any statement or term which claims or implies that it is less harmful to smoke one brand of tobacco product than another is prohibited from tobacco advertisements and packaging.</P>
      <P>At EU level the marking of this type of claim about tobacco products and the maximum allowable levels of tar and nicotine in tobacco products are being considered by the Commission with a view to bringing in further measures. Ireland supports this position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on residency and means. Any person, regardless of nationality, who is accepted by the health boards as being ordinarily resident in Ireland is entitled to either full eligibility, i.e. medical card holders, or limited eligibility for health services. Health boards normally regard a person as &ldquo;ordinarily resident&rdquo; if he/she satisfies the health board that it is his/her intention to remain in Ireland for a minimum period of one year.</P>
      <P>Arrangements under EU regulations supersede the provisions of the Irish eligibility system in respect of certain categories of nationals of other EU countries. Health boards are obliged to provide health services on the same basis as medical card holders to these people on behalf of their home state, which retains responsibility for the costs involved in the provision of the services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Social security pensioners of other EU states <Col N="1086" /> who are not covered by an Irish social welfare pension, as recipient or dependant, and who are not employed or self-employed here, are entitled to receive health services free of charge and are normally issued with a medical card. Persons resident here who are insured workers in the territory of another EU state normally receive a medical card also. On production of the relevant EU liaison form unemployed persons from other EU states seeking work here are eligible to receive a medical card for a short period of time, usually about three months.</P>

      <P>Radiotherapy is a highly specialised and capital intensive service. Because of its complexity and the considerable cost involved, there are currently just two public radiotherapy facilities in Ireland. These are in St. Luke's Hospital, Dublin, and Cork University Hospital. However, I am pleased to say that a third public radiotherapy facility will be provided as part of the major development of University College Hospital Galway. I also approved, recently, the provision of a second linear accelerator for the radiotherapy unit at Cork University Hospital. There are no plans to develop a unit at Waterford Regional Hospital.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 130 and 132 together.</P>
      <P>Special arrangements have been introduced in respect of the serviced land initiative, which allow local authorities to depart from the normal procedures for approval of water services projects. These procedures are as follows:</P>
      <P>Schemes costing £250,000 or less: These schemes, which account for 55 per cent of approved schemes, are devolved fully to the local authorities who are responsible for design, procurement and implementation of the works within approval budgets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Schemes costing more than £250,000 but not <Col N="1090" /> more than £1 million: Contract documents only are required to be submitted for approval, providing the scheme does not involve an increase in treatment capacity. Tender recommendations are not required to be submitted except where it is proposed to accept other than the lowest tender.</P>
    <P>Schemes costing more than £1 million or involving an increase in treatment capacity: These schemes, which account for 15 per cent of approved schemes, are broadly subject to the normal approval procedures. However, in order to allow schemes in this category to advance quickly the preliminary report requires only the inclusion of a preliminary design, alternatives considered, route selection and cost estimate.</P>
    <P>In addition, local authorities are not required to obtain the prior approval of the Department to the appointment of consultants (where required) or for the carrying out of surveys, site inspections or studies necessary for the preparation of the preliminary report or contract documents.</P>
    <P>A special reporting system has been put in place to monitor progress on the initiative. Based on the most recent local authority returns, schemes either completed or already at construction are expected to produce almost 5000 sites. In addition, schemes which are at an advanced planning stage account for a further 40,000 sites; in general the majority of these should reach construction and the majority should be completed this year.</P>
    <P>In the case of the north Fingal area of Dublin, at the end of last year, my Department met with Dublin Corporation and Fingal County Council and got agreement from them to using temporary sewage treatment facilities in an effort to bring forward residential land into development in advance of the construction of the north fringe interceptor sewer which latest estimates suggest will be completed by mid 2002. This meeting was followed by further consultations with these local authorities as part of the Government's recent review of developments in the housing market to determine the extent of the lands in the north Dublin area that could be brought into development in the short-term using temporary treatment facilities and by providing ancillary water services. Development can be facilitated by these measures in the short-term in Kilmore, Coolock, Finglas, Ballymun, Balgriffin, Santry, Beaumont, Kilbarrack, Baldoyle and Portmarnock.</P>
    <P>On 23 February 1999, my Department issued a circular to all local authorities asking them to facilitate residential development by allowing interim and temporary arrangements for water and sewerage services, subject to necessary safeguards, pending the provision of permanent infrastructure and setting out guidelines on how this can be pursued. A copy of this circular is available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    <P>The following is a list of the number of sites to be provided under the initiative in each local authority area.</P>

      <P>I refer to my reply to Question No. 275 of 9 March 1999 in which I listed 13 potential PPP projects within my area of responsibility. All of these projects are being advanced as quickly as possible and contracts in relation to the projects, Osberstown wastewater treatment and national car testing projects were signed during the period referred to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1092" /> The possibility of a PPP approach is still at an early stage of consideration by the Department and the National Roads Authority for approximately 15 further projects. These include a number of selected road projects, water supply and waste water treatment proposals, solid waste facilities. My Department has also had contact with the house building sector with a view to advancing medium sized developer led water service projects to open up land zoned for housing development.</P>

      <P>Measures to relieve any infrastructural constraints on housing development form a key element of the Government's strategy to maximise housing supply. The recent consultants' report, The Housing Market &ndash; An Economic Review and Assessment, recommended that any roads or public transport constraints should be identified together with other infrastructural developments considered necessary to permit development. Arrangements to identify any such constraints in major growth centres will be put in place in the near future. The Government is committed to provide additional resources to remove any significant constraints to housing development with minimum delay.</P>

      <P>The draft planning guidelines on residential density have been issued for public consultation until 30 April 1999. Interested parties have been asked to submit any <Col N="1093" /> comments they may have to the Department. All submissions received will be taken into consideration before a final version of the guidelines issues as soon as possible thereafter.</P>
      <P>However, in view of the importance of the issue and the advanced state of the guidelines, my Department has requested local authorities to take them on board straight away even though they are only in draft form and to put them into effect both at development plan level, where they may be currently reviewing their plans, and at planning control level.</P>

      <P>Part E of the building regulations details the legal requirements to be met in relation to sound insulation between separating walls and separating floors of dwellings &ndash; houses and apartments. Part E requires that such floors and walls shall have reasonable resistance to airborne and impact sound. Technical guidance document E, 1997 edition, provides technical guidance on how to comply with these requirements.</P>
      <P>The guidelines for planning authorities on residential density which I launched in draft form for public consultation on 2 March 1999 set out policies and standards to guide planning authorities in achieving higher residential densities in appropriate locations. The guidelines stress that the quality of the residential environment should be paramount in considering the acceptability of planning applications for higher density schemes. Therefore, while I currently have no specific proposals to amend Part E of the building regulations, I will take into consideration any observations on this matter received during the public consultation process on the guidelines.</P>

    <P>The figures include permissions which are subject to identifiable constraints in infrastructural provision or other delaying factors which may mean that some of them may not become available immediately. The figures take account of the serviced land initiative, the beneficial impact of which will be substantially felt during 1999 and thereafter. Institutional lands, which are zoned for housing development, have only been included where there is a realistic expectation of development within the next five years.</P>
    <P>The figures quoted above give the position at end 1998 but additional lands will become available for residential development in the period to end 2000, estimated at 35,738 housing units and thereafter in the period to end 2003, estimated at a further 39,189 housing units.</P>

      <P>I have not received any proposal regarding the classification of cities; any such proposal would require legislation. Under current local government law the term county borough applies to the areas of the five centres which are commonly regarded as cities. Each has its own local authority with a city council and an organisational, financial and staffing structure entirely separate from that of its county and is responsible for the full range of local authority services. For reasons of effectiveness and cost there are no proposals to create additional such local authorities &ndash; which would effectively mean the division of a county or counties. Apart from the general local government law local practice has been that in the case of at least one local authority the term &ldquo;city&rdquo; is for local historical reasons used in respect of an urban centre which is not a county borough.</P>
      <P>A major local government Bill is currently being drafted which will, <i>inter alia</i>, provide a modern legislative basis for our local government system including the titles of local authorities. It is not intended that this would interfere with local practice.</P>

      <P>My Department has, since 1996, operated the scheme of community support for older people, the purpose of which is to provide funding for initiatives to improve the security and social support of vulnerable older <Col N="1100" /> people. This funding is provided by way of grant to voluntary groups and organisations such as community alert, neighbourhood watch, Muintir na Tíre etc. who have undertaken to identify those elderly people in need of assistance under the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the scheme grants are available for smallscale physical security equipment such as strengthening of doors and windows, window locks, door chains and locks and security lighting; and socially-monitored alarm systems, such as the &ldquo;pendant&rdquo; alarm system which is operated via the <Col N="1101" /> telephone and is worn around the wrist or neck. To qualify for assistance under the scheme, older people, aged 65 or over must be living alone or be living in households made up exclusively of older people, or of older and other people who are dependent and vulnerable and be unable to install or purchase the security equipment or alarm system themselves.</P>
    <P>No application for assistance under the scheme from any voluntary group or organisation on behalf of the person named in the Deputy's question has been received to date.</P>
    <P>I am anxious to ensure that this scheme addresses the security needs of the most vulnerable people and that it provides this assistance in the most efficient and effective way possible. In this regard, my Department has, in consultation with the Departments of Finance and Health and Children, commissioned an independent review of the scheme which will consider how the scheme is meeting its objectives and whether it is doing so in the most efficient and effective way possible.</P>
    <P>The final report from the consultants has been received and is currently being examined in my Department. The operation of the scheme in 1999 will be determined in the light of the outcome of this review.</P>

      <Quest>the reason a person (details supplied) in Dublin 8 who made over five years of full social welfare contributions post-1953 is not entitled to a pro rata pension in view of the fact self-employed people who pay 260 contributions or more now qualify for a 50 per cent social welfare pension; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The person concerned is, at present, in receipt of a mixed-insurance <i>pro rata</i> pension at the current weekly rate of £32.50, which includes a qualified adult allowance in respect of his wife. This pension, which was introduced in November 1991, enables those with a mixture of full and modified rate insurance contributions to qualify for a <i>pro rata</i> pension. The <i>pro rata </i>pension, which was introduced in November 1997, extended entitlement to those whose yearly average, based on full-rate contributions, ranged from ten to 19. The person concerned does not qualify for this type of pension as his yearly average, based on his full-rate contributions, remains unchanged at eight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the self-employed, new arrangements are being introduced to address the position of those self-employed people who were 56 years of age or over in April 1988 when compulsory social insurance was extended to the self-employed and who failed to qualify for a pension under the standard qualifying conditions as they did not satisfy the general requirement of having <Col N="1102" /> entered social insurance at least ten years before pension age.</P>
    <P>A special old age contributory pension will be paid to those self-employed people who were 56 years of age or over in April 1988 and who have, at least, five years reckonable contributions paid since then. It will be paid at a flat rate of 50 per cent of the standard, maximum rate. Increases for adult and child dependants, where applicable, will also be payable at 50 per cent of the standard rate.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, I have long stated my commitment to ensuring the most broadly feasible contributory pension coverage to as many categories as possible. A review of the qualifying conditions for the old age contributory and retirement pensions is now under way in my Department. This is paying particular attention to the operation of the yearly average qualifying condition, including the possibility of using contributions paid prior to 1953 and to the commitment given in An Action Programme for the Millennium to provide a mechanism to allow women who take time out for family reasons to continue contributions for pension. Clearly, this is a complex exercise which will also need to address questions of equity and redistribution within the social welfare system. As I have previously indicated, I will report back to the House in due course.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of the range of the Department's activities there is at any one time a range of working groups and committees involved in aspects of the Department's business. Many of these are set up on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis to address particular issues and details are not available as to the number and nature of all of these.</P>
      <P>A number of groups and committees have been set up by the Department involving representatives of other agencies and bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These include a working group on women's access to labour market opportunities; a small business users' forum; a business users' panel; a steering committee for the White Paper on supporting voluntary activity; an interdepartmental committee on the national anti-poverty strategy; a community development programme advisory committee; a community development programme technical group; a national advisory committee on the money advice and budgeting service; a disability consultative forum; an <Col N="1103" /> interdepartmental committee on an integrated social services system; a supplementary welfare allowance scheme &ndash; four working groups with the health boards on aspects of the scheme; and programme evaluation working groups, the number of which varies from time to time.</P>
    <P>In general the only additional costs which arise in connection with these groups are the incidental costs associated with the organisation of meetings and servicing the work of the groups.</P>
    <P>There is one special adviser to the Minister who has been appointed from the private sector. He is paid at the maximum point of the Principal Officer scale, currently £47,713 per annum exclusive of pension contribution.</P>
    <P>There is no programme manager which means a cost saving to the Exchequer in respect of salary of about £46,000, quite apart from the attendant ancillary costs.</P>
    <P>Nor is there a five person policy unit in existence in my Department, something which was present prior to my coming into office in June 1997, at a salary cost saving of about £95,000, quite apart from the attendant ancillary costs.</P>
    <P>There are three statutory agencies reporting to the Department, namely the National Social Service Board, the Pensions Board and the Combat Poverty Agency. There is a range of sub-committees and working groups operating under the aegis of each of these.</P>
    <P>The National Social Service Board was established in 1984 and comprises 20 members. The board is responsible for the development and provision of information and advice on social services for citizens throughout the country. The NSSB publishes an annual report each year, the most recent being published in June 1998 and covering the 1997 calendar year.</P>
    <P>There are currently three working groups and committees operating under its aegis.</P>
    <P>The Pensions Board was set up under the Pensions Act, 1990. It is a representative body comprising a chairperson and 14 ordinary members. The membership of the board comprises representatives nominated by trade unions, employers, Government Departments, the pensions industry, member trustees and professional groups involved with occupational pension schemes.</P>
    <P>The role of the board is to monitor and supervise the provisions of the Pensions Act, 1990, and pension developments generally; and to advise the Minister on all matters relating to the functions assigned to the board and on matters relating to pensions generally. There are five committees operating under its aegis.</P>
    <P>The Pensions Board published its report on the national pensions policy Initiative &ndash; entitled &ldquo;Securing Retirement Income&rdquo;&ndash; in May last. On publication, I circulated a copy of the report to all Members of the House.</P>
    <P>Following the publication of the report, I established a number of working groups to progress a number of the board's recommendations, namely, <Col N="1104" /> simplification of the tax regime for pensions, chaired by the Department of Finance; pre-funding the future costs of social welfare pensions, chaired by the Department of Finance; introduction of personal retirement savings accounts to encourage increase in supplementary pension coverage, chaired by Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs.</P>
    <P>The above groups comprise representatives of the relevant Government Departments and the Pensions Board.</P>
    <P>On foot of the report I also asked the Pensions Board to bring forward proposals in relation to increasing pensions awareness and another working group was set up to progress this under the chairmanship of the Pensions Board.</P>
    <P>The main functions of the Combat Poverty Agency are to advise the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs on all aspects of economic and social planning in relation to poverty; to initiate and evaluate measures aimed at overcoming poverty; and to promote greater public understanding of the nature, causes and extent of poverty and the measures necessary to overcome poverty. The agency was established in September 1986 and there are currently 16 members on the board. The agency also establishes subcommittees from time to time. The agency publishes a large volume of reports each year including an annual report.</P>
    <P>There are currently three sub-committees operating under its aegis.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 333 of 25 November 1998. Additional groups formed since that date include: the Consultative Committee on the Heritage of the Burren; the Special Areas of Conservation Appeals Advisory Board; and an interdepartmental committee to review the implementation of industrial development within Galway County Borough, or other areas where Údarás na Gaeltachta and other industrial development agencies operate.</P>
      <P>With regard to the cost of groups, the Special Areas of Conservation Appeals Advisory Board is estimated to cost some £10,000 in the current year. Costs will also arise in relation to the think tank for the film industry but these have not yet been determined. In the case of other groups, no major expenditure is foreseen, apart from normal costs relating to travel, subsistence, etc. The Deputy may wish to note, however, that the group formed to manage the separation of the RTÉ transmission network and the establishment of a new joint venture company to build and operate this country's digital terrestrial television infrastructure, has selected, by public competition, a consortium of consultants to act as advisers to my Department on the establishment of the new entity and the contract is being finalised at present.</P>
      <P>With regard to the cost of individual advisers, I have engaged a special policy adviser &ndash; a Principal Officer of my Department &ndash; on a current salary of £47,713 per annum and a press adviser, who is a public servant on secondment, at a salary of £46,988 per annum.</P>

      <P>I am aware of this survey which was conducted with employers in the context of the northside partnership's JOBSMATCH project.</P>
      <P>Child care is without doubt one of the issues impacting on a parent's ability to avail of work, training and educational opportunities. As the Deputy is probably aware the Government made its commitment clear in relation to the child care issue when it decided on 2 February last to establish an interdepartmental committee on child care to evaluate, cost and prioritise proposals for the development of child care which are set out in recent reports on the matter. This evaluation will address the matter raised by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The committee is chaired by my Department and comprises representatives, at senior level, of the relevant Government Departments. It is required to report back to Government within a period of six months. The committee has already met on two occasions to date.</P>
      <P>The Government also announced new measures to support child care in the budget of December 1998. The new measures provide for the introduction of a capital allowance for capital expenditure incurred on the construction, extension or refurbishment of a building or part of a building used as a child care facility. They also provide exemption from benefit in kind taxation of certain child care services provided by employers to employees on a free or subsidised basis.</P>
      <P>My Department also provides funding for the development of child care facilities through the equal opportunities child care programme which is designed to support local communities and employers who are trying to facilitate women and men who have child care responsibilities while accessing training, education and employment. It is targeted particularly at parents in disadvantaged areas and those on low pay who cannot access training, education and employment opportunities due to the lack of affordable good quality child care. The equal opportunities child care programme is administered by Area Development Management Limited (ADM) on behalf of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Funding is being provided under the following three initiatives:</P>
      <P>Capital Infrastructure</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Money is being targeted at community child care projects to enable them to upgrade-enhance <Col N="1107" /> their facilities or establish new purpose built facilities for women and men who need child care while they are at work or availing of training.</P>
    <P>Core Funding</P>
    <P>This fund is being used to provide support to meet the expenditure required for two full-time senior child care workers in community child care projects with a focus on equal opportunities and disadvantage.</P>
    <P>Employer Demonstration Initiative</P>
    <P>This is being developed in partnership with IBEC to stimulate employer interest and involvement in supporting equal opportunity child care facilities.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In accordance with the provisions of Part 5 of the Civil Legal Aid Regulations, 1996, disposable income is calculated by reference to any income which the applicant may reasonably expect to receive from all sources during the year succeeding the date of application, reduced by the aggregate of the allowances which can be offset against income. These include £1,328 for a spouse and £668 for each dependant. Reductions are also made in respect of expenses incurred in travelling to work, hire purchase payments, loan interest payments, rent, board and lodgings etc. and, in <Col N="1109" /> certain circumstances, on child care facilities. Accordingly, it is appropriate that income derived from a community employment scheme should be included as income for the purpose of determining financial eligibility for legal services under the Civil Legal Aid Act, 1995, in accordance with part 5 of the Civil Legal Aid Regulations, 1996.</P>

      <P>Under the terms of the higher education grant scheme maintenance grants are tenable in respect of approved full time undergraduate courses of not less than two years duration or a full time postgraduate course pursued in an approved institution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The two year full time course leading to the International Montessori Diploma and the three <Col N="1113" /> year full time course leading to the International Montessori Diploma in the Montessori College, (AMI) are approved courses for the purposes of the higher education grants scheme.</P>
    <P>On the basis that the student in question will be at least 23 years of age on 1 January of the year of entry to an approved course and has not been ordinarily resident with her parents from the preceding 1 October, she will be eligible to apply for a higher education maintenance grant as an independent mature candidate. The reckonable income for the purposes of the means test will be that of the candidate and her spouse, if applicable, for the year ended 5 April of the year of entry to the course.</P>
    <P>Under the existing terms of the student support schemes, the rate of maintenance grant payable is determined by reference to the distance from the student's normal residence to the college which she-he is attending. In the case of independent mature students, normal residence is defined as the address of the candidate while in attendance at college. If this address is 15 miles or less from the college which she-he is attending, the adjacent rate of maintenance grant is payable. If the address is more than 15 miles from the college, the non-adjacent rate of grant is payable. However, where an independent mature student can produce supporting evidence that she-he is maintaining a residence other than his or her address while attending college, it will be open to the awarding authority to regard that address as the candidate's normal residence.</P>
    <P>I previously indicated my concern about mature students generally and independent mature students in particular in regard to the rate of grant payable in accordance with the provisions of the schemes. With effect from the coming academic year all eligible mature students will qualify for the higher non-adjacent rate of maintenance grant. This improvement is estimate to cost £2.4 million over the next two years. This cost will be met from the additional £6.9 million which I am allocating over the next two years to tackle educational disadvantage at third level.</P>
    <P>The new arrangements will be provided for in the context of the 1999 student support schemes, which will be available later in the year. Accord<Col N="1114" /> ingly the student in question should apply, in due course, to Dublin Corporation in order to have her eligibility for grant assistance as an independent mature candidate assessed.</P>

      <P>There are 21 <i>ad hoc</i> advisory groups, three statutory committee/councils/authorities, two non-statutory committees/councils/authorities and four permanent committees currently in operation in the Department of Education and Science and ten interdepartmental committees, which are either chaired or jointly chaired by the Department of Education and Science.</P>
      <P>The majority of these committees/groups comprise public servants who generally meet as part of their work requirements, and as such these committees/groups would not have dedicated budget lines. A list of each of these committees/groups follows. Where there is a specific budget, the 1998 figures are provided.</P>

      <Quest>if, further to Parliamentary Question No. 114 of 26 February 1998, the meeting referred to took place; if so, its outcome; and if the requested secondment of funding for a teaching post to the preventative inter agency project in Dublin 7 will be provided.</Quest>

      <P>A member of my Department's inspectorate met with representatives of the Aosóg project in May 1998. The project applied to my Department for funding under the eight to 15 <Col N="1116" /> year old early school leavers' initiative. The submission from this project sought resources for the employment of two project workers and other resources such as set-up costs, part-time administration and running costs.</P>
      <P>A large number of applications was received from consortia seeking inclusion in this initiative. All applications were examined by a selection committee comprised of departmental and non-departmental personnel who have expertise in this area. A total of 14 projects areas was selected for funding on a pilot basis over the two school years 1998-99 and 1999-2000. Unfortunately, the application from the Aosóg project was not successful on this occasion.</P>
