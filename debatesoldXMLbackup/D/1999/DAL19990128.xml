        <b>:</b> When the Government published in September its list of promised legislation for between then and the end of the year, two Bills were regarded as priorities &ndash; the Data Protection (Amendment) Bill and the Proceeds of Crime (Amendment) Bill. Not alone do they not appear on the list of promised legislation for this term, they seem to have been relegated. What is the status of these Bills? Why have they suddenly been deprioritised?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the Proceeds of Crime (Amendment) Bill, since Christmas we have had a spate of gangland killings, with two cold <Col N="644" /> blooded killings in Dublin in the past 48 hours. What is the Government doing about this? Are these being taken seriously? What legislation is proposed to stamp out the spate of gangland killings which is quite obviously in full flow in Dublin at present?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The stamped copy of the Proceeds of Crime (Amendment) Bill has been received. However, there is a High Court decision pending on the matter in February, which must be awaited. The publication date for the Data Protection (Amendment) Bill is early 1999.</P>

      <P>Yesterday Deputy Howlin raised the matter of legislation on whether chairpersons of Oireachtas committees would be permitted to stand in the local elections. The Taoiseach told him the matter was being examined. When will Deputy Healy-Rae have finished his examination?</P>
      <P>I wish to ask the Minister about legislation in the Department of Enterprise and Employment. Yesterday I saw her trying to strike up a normal conversation with the Tánaiste to no effect. Did she, by any chance, ask her why the legislation section of the Department has been shut down entirely? One miserable, three section Bill has been promised for the entire term, which is equivalent to the output for the 19 months to date. What is the explanation for that?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that the local elections are to be held on 11 June, I am surprised the Local Government Reform Bill is not listed for publication in this session.

      <P>Work began on the National Parks and Historic Properties Bill in 1987. It is not being proceeded with any further.

It comes under the heading of other priorities being attended to in the Department, which means, in the current circumstances, that it is probably an &ldquo;also ran&rdquo;.

      <P>I am sure the Minister is as disturbed as I am at the lack of action in protecting rape victims. Does she intend to take the Bill in my name &ndash; it could be taken without delay &ndash; to ensure that a clear signal is sent to rape victims that the Government cares about them?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday evening I raised a number of questions which I suggested were both basic and preliminary to a discussion on whether Ireland should join Partnership for Peace. Deputy Gay Mitchell's introductory speech was valuable in that it at least summarised the position of a number of other significant countries who have arrived at a position regarding Partnership for Peace, including those countries &ndash; not all &ndash; who previously had a neutral position for a variety of different reasons, such as Austria or a number of the Scandinavian countries. It is also interesting that the two speeches on behalf of the Government emphasised the practical implications of joining and of membership, rather than engaging in inflated rhetoric about the down-side of joining or suggesting issues of principal where there are none.</P>
      <P>It is now appropriate to turn to some of the basic points made by Deputy De Rossa and to the questions I posed earlier. I have tried to be both fair and accurate in summarising the speeches given so far.</P>
      <P>If there is an intolerance at this point in the debate it is coming from those who are anxious that we would join without asking many more questions. I detect a note of intolerance on the part of those who suggest it is a limited view to be other than enthusiastic about membership of an entity which has not been subjected to the critical examination in terms of foreign policy that I have described. I also reject the suggestion that there is anything archaic or disabling about being in favour of a comprehensive approach, in a theoretical sense, to foreign policy.</P>
      <P>What I have read and heard so far about Partnership for Peace, tested against some of the fundamental principles of foreign policy, does not pass muster. It is an institutional arrangement that is elaborate but is in all senses reactive. It is a reaction to a spin on a version of history, on a reading of circumstances as they are now. I mentioned earlier that the concept of interdependence in foreign policy is a classical one that used always be counterpoised against a theory of interests. Yet, in effect, those who speak about including everybody in a common reaction speak of an ill-defined and narrow version of security, as much as it is reactive in principle. It rejects interdependence except in the most narrow sense and fits more accurately within the theory of interests. It is because it fits within a theory of interests that it leaves unexamined the glaring paradoxes and contradictions in it, such as the balance of the US-British relationship to the emerging European relationship and the entirely changed context in the world following the collapse of the Soviet Union, where a single power has an unhelpful relationship to the international institutional order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="650" /> Turning to the practical agenda as I presumed it has been debated in the Department of Foreign Affairs under different administrations, one cannot have a debate on this reactive version of a narrow definition of security without looking at the whole complex of Ireland's institutional relationships in terms of, for example, the UN, the Security Council, the balance between the General Assembly and the Security Council, the issues raised and listed in documents by Brian Urquhart and the late Erskine Childers, both assistant under-secretaries on reform of the UN, and the relationship of the mandate of the UN Security Council to different peacekeeping initiatives. It is unworthy of those who suggest that those who ask these questions are dragging their feet in the evolution from peace maintenance to peacekeeping. It is quite the opposite.</P>
    <P>Where we have to build and make peace, we want to do so out of a tradition of diplomacy that is democratic in its impulse, in its features and in its history. Lest people say this will give wonderful opportunities to the Defence Forces, I am as lost in admiration of the Defence Forces as anybody else. I visited them in Central America and elsewhere, and they would say the best gift they could get would be a clear mandate. A clear mandate comes from a genuinely representative Security Council of which we aspire to be a member, and the clarity in the thinking of the mandate and its democratic reference points are what are important, rather than an assemblage of bits and pieces, of people who want to exchange information about what weapons they are purchasing.</P>
    <P>As to the Government's position on this, it should bear in mind the reason we have any influence on the Security Council, and what is our best opportunity of influencing the urgent debate on reform of the UN. The last time we were on the Security Council it was precisely because of our record on the Decolonisation Committee. The people who wanted us on the Security Council, and who assisted us in securing the place, saw us not as some kind of cripple because of our neutrality, but as people who would speak out of the experience of anti-colonialism and whose <i>fides</i> in relation to decolonisation could be accepted.</P>
    <P>There is an interesting insert to that. I refer to the late Erskine Childers, son of the President of Ireland, covering the emergence of the African nations with the great BBC broadcaster, Dimbleby. In his unpublished book, &ldquo;Amnesia at Midnight&rdquo;, Erskine Childers writes about what the British commentator said about another country rising to join the ranks of free nations free to make its own mistakes, and because he objected he lost his job in the BBC. There is such a thing as the Decolonisation Committee. There is such a thing as the Irish record on it. There is such a thing as the Irish reputation in the UN. There is such a thing as the Irish peacekeeping forces. Moving out from that there is the balance of our relationships, for example, with the European Union. We can go to the European Union <Col N="651" /> and be positive because we have this truthful background.</P>
    <P>Then one looks at those who at the same time are participating in anticipatory bombing, exemplary bombing, people who are taking exemplary actions, as they would say it, in relation to the destruction of opportunities for humanitarian aid, people who say that no matter what happens, be it in the Middle East or in Latin America, there will always be a US-British Axis that is more important than Europe. People do not want to face the reality of a genuine European foreign policy and genuine security built on trust and implemented through diplomacy. The difficult questions are not being faced. That is why people take the easy route, where they can arrive by exchanging Meccano sets and building bits and pieces.</P>
    <P>I was morally appalled at the insufficiency of our response when lives were lost in different parts of Europe and Eastern Europe, but an uncritical rush to simply say that if we had this or that institutional arrangement it would have made a substantial difference is not the answer. It is in foreign policy genuinely thought out that we will be able to deal with issues of ethnicity and identity, and of building genuine partnership. There is no irridentist, uncritical, ancient traditional hang-up about words of semantics in relation to this. It is about the restoration of the integrity and the fullness of foreign policy of which diplomacy will be the principal instrument. It is built on a revulsion against those who strike militarily first and prepare for that and afterwards go seeking and scurrying for some gloss on a mandate. It is against those who suggest that one can speak on this with veracity and integrity and with better <i>fides</i> than those who are opposed to the armaments industry. Genuine foreign policy and the White Paper which was referred to must point to the use of the word &ldquo;security&rdquo; in terms of food security and how it is defiled by those who insist on the production and sale of armaments, often to the poorest parts of the world.</P>
    <P>Let us have this debate and not short-circuit it. We are nearly unanimous on this side on that. On the other hand, let us not fudge it. Let the debate within foreign policy start on the principles of co-operation and interdependency and of reform of the UN, moving past arms production and afterwards if necessary. We do not require that peacekeepers stand impotent in the face of challenges. The peacekeepers must be given a clear mandate that is accountable and respects rather than abuses diplomacy. It must be built on courage, the courage to face those who seek alternatives to diplomacy, who want to have the use of the means of the strong to bully and police first and explain their actions afterwards and when a whole village is murdered, say it was one of their missiles that went astray. That is immoral. It is no basis for a foreign policy. Making institutional shortcuts as a substitute for foreign policy is wasting our time. Nevertheless, I am glad this debate <Col N="652" /> is introduced here this week. I will be glad if a debate takes place around the country, but I hope it will be a morally informed debate rather than one that is made by saying that real Europeans will want to be pragmatic like this, that real Europeans will want to go to the exercises and will be exchanging shopping lists for armaments. Life as we want it in foreign policy is much more complex than that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this debate. Ireland, as a militarily neutral country has made a proud and constructive contribution to international peacekeeping, which has been widely and generously acknowledged, most recently by the UN Secretary General, Mr. Kofi Annan.</P>
      <P>The defence debate has moved on. International conditions are completely different from what they were during the Cold War. There is no frontal threat on the horizon to the security of Europe or of the European Union of the kind that existed until 1989. Collective defence in Europe, which stretches far beyond the EU to include countries as far apart as Turkey and Norway, remains the responsibility of NATO, and secondarily the Western European Union. None of our partners wish to move collective European defence out of NATO into a purely EU framework excluding the United States and Canada. There is no pressing strategic reason for Ireland to join a military alliance now, and we do not intend to do so.</P>
      <P>Our amended motion reaffirms Ireland's policy of military neutrality and our commitment to the peaceful resolution of disputes and the international rule of law. We do not want to create any misunderstandings or misconceptions about that. Four party leaders including the Taoiseach joined at the time of the Maastricht Referendum on 1 June 1992 to pledge that, if we were to be part of any European Union decision on common defence, we would hold a referendum. Any participation in a military alliance that would involve an automatic obligation to respond to an attack on an alliance partner would in any case require a referendum to change the Constitution, because, under Article 28.3 of the Constitution, &ldquo;war shall not be declared and the State shall not participate in any war save with the assent of Dáil Éireann&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In our motion, we are, therefore, so as to avoid all doubt, reaffirming the basic principles of Irish foreign policy, as they have obtained for some time past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main emphasis in defence policy, not just in Ireland, but in Europe today has moved on to international peacekeeping and conflict resolution. References to the development of a European defence policy are now to be seen more in that light. The question arises under the Amsterdam Treaty of endowing the EU through the Western European Union with an enhanced capacity to resolve conflict. Other <i>ad hoc</i> institutional mechanisms, such as the NATO-led mission SFOR, are clearly further examples of this trend. Whether a mission involves peacekeeping <Col N="653" /> or peace enforcement, the approval of the Dáil has in every case to be sought, with very minor exceptions, where the personnel involved are only a very small number.</P>
    <P>There is nothing inconsistent with neutrality, in supporting or even participating on a case-by-case basis in internationally approved collective action to discourage and deter aggression. De Valera was prepared to support such action against Italy in 1935 following the invasion by Italy of Abyssinia.</P>
    <P>The UN is increasingly confiding peacekeeping, in accordance with Security Council resolutions, to regional organisations, such as NATO, Western European Union and the OSCE. Partnership for Peace was established in 1994. Initially, for some countries it was a waiting room for full NATO membership but for different reasons all the other European neutral countries also joined, as did Russia after some hesitation. We have been virtually the only European country to stand aside, and the only neutral one. I am on record as saying in this House in a debate in 1996 that the case for Irish participation had not been made, and it is the function of a party in Opposition to articulate public fears and concerns and to put forward an alternative point of view.</P>
    <P>However, there were subsequently important developments in May 1997, too late to take account of in our manifesto but to which I referred in a campaign speech in County Limerick. In May 1997, a decision was taken at a NATO meeting in Portugal to establish a multinational framework involving PfP nations, called the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council, which is helping to co-ordinate the on-going planning of the SFOR mission in Bosnia. Ireland, as a participating country, was not included in the initial planning and co-ordination in which Partnership for Peace played an important role, placing our Defence Forces at something of a disadvantage. In an election speech in County Limerick on 24 May 1997, I specifically raised the desirability of Ireland joining the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council, whose purpose is to conduct dialogue between Europe and North America on a broad range of political and security-related issues, matters we already discuss in the European Union. Despite some inquiries I was not able to establish quickly whether this new council, which is open to all European democracies, required membership of Partnership for Peace but I said at that time that, if not, Ireland should seriously consider the merits of joining that body. I said that we had no desire to be politically isolated or to turn our backs on the United States, which has been particularly helpful to us throughout the peace process. I went on to say:</P>
    <P>Nor do we want to give the impression that the stability and security of Europe is no concern of ours. We want to make our own contribution along with our friends and partners in a way in which we feel comfortable and that is most appropriate to our political traditions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="654" /> I have quoted the speech to make the point that Fianna Fáil in Opposition did not adopt a rigid position and that I was ready to adjust it and allow it to evolve right up to the election to take account of emerging developments.</P>
    <P>When we were last in Government with the Labour Party in 1993, we took up observer status with Western European Union. When former Foreign Affairs spokesman, former Deputy Ray Burke, and I visited the European Commission in the winter of 1995 we came out with a forward position accepting and favouring participation in peacekeeping and humanitarian missions, the so-called Petersberg tasks. All along we have wished to be constructive while remaining true within a European context to the independent foreign policy ideals and traditions which the Irish people held dearly.</P>
    <P>The principal Opposition party has a different attitude. I recognise and pay tribute to the sincerity and commitment of Deputy Gay Mitchell, the prime mover of the motion. At times, he and other Fine Gael members have called for full membership of Western European Union, and have attacked the tradition of neutrality going back to World War II. That has often been their position. It is not ours. I do not believe it is the Labour Party's either, and our motion sets out a more balanced position and puts the proposal firmly in the context of continuing Irish neutrality.</P>
    <P>The former Labour Party Leader and former Foreign Affairs spokesperson, Deputy Spring, has been mentioned as a possible EU representative with responsibility for CFSP. The Government would support that, and I have made that clear to our partners. A further prudent evolution of our national policy would show that we are willing to participate in the mainstream development of a practical European security policy at the present time which centres on peacekeeping, and that Ireland, like the other neutral countries, does not wish or intend to stand apart. We must accept the organisational realities in Europe, and the settled preference of all our partners to work mainly with and through existing structures in developing the common European foreign and security policy. It is a moot point whether an independent European defence policy, which notably France has favoured from time to time, would be preferable to the status quo.</P>
    <P>I am a little surprised to have been attacked recently on the subject by the Leader of the Labour Party, and that their new Foreign Affairs spokesperson, Deputy de Rossa, is still openly opposed to Partnership for Peace membership, despite endorsing the last Government's foreign policy White Paper. It is not clear to me whether Labour is now departing from its policy under Deputy Spring, and whether it is about to adopt the more strident anti-Americanism which has been the hallmark of Deputy de Rossa's leadership of Democratic Left and the Workers' Party. I note that Deputy Spring's signature to the Labour Party motion is conspicuous by its absence, <Col N="655" /> and he did not accept Deputy de Rossa's argument last night that a referendum is required. He stated categorically in this House on 30 April 1997 in reply to Deputy Ray Burke:</P>
    <P>I wish to confirm to the House that a decision to participate in PfP would be subject to a motion on the terms and scope of any participation by Ireland being approved by the Houses of the Oireachtas. There is neither a basis nor a need for a referendum on participation in PfP, which imposes no Treaty obligation of any sort, no mutual defence commitments and which has no implications for our policy of military neutrality.</P>
    <P>Is Deputy de Rossa now signalling his repudiation of that position? It will be interesting to see which policy direction the Labour Party will now follow, Deputy Spring's or Deputy de Rossa's, as their amendment does not commit them either way. I am not sure that the Green Party's position in Europe is particularly coherent as the German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer is a leading advocate of a common European defence policy, to which the Greens in Ireland are totally opposed.</P>
    <P>In Government, we have had further opportunity to take professional advice, both from a foreign policy point of view and an operational point of view. It is the view of our professional diplomatic advisers as well as of the Defence Forces that Ireland should formally consider joining Partnership for Peace. As I said recently in UCD, I would not wish essentially ideological considerations to inhibit the operational effectiveness of the Defence Forces or hamper their valuable contribution. However, I would warn against both the hopes and the fears expressed that this will have implications for the level of defence spending. It is not the Government's intention as a result of joining Partnership for Peace to change the level of real defence spending. It would be naive to think that any decision of ours in this matter will influence one way or the other the outcome for us of the difficult and challenging negotiations on Agenda 2000. However, in the longer term it would show that we continue to be positive and constructive in all areas of European co-operation consistent with our own standpoint and traditions.</P>
    <P>As a Government, we must consult not only our respective party political instincts but make a judgment on what best serves the national interest. I have in my time set out the case against joining, and I respect the position of those who remain opposed. They are quoting many of my arguments. However, I now believe on balance that the case for joining is stronger and I am not afraid to move on. We should in this respect, as in others, take our place among the nations and work with other like-minded countries which broadly share our outlook and objectives. We are not ex-colonial powers interested in exerting power for its own sake but we want to work with <Col N="656" /> others to promote a more humane, civilised and democratic world, and in broadening zones of peace, stability and reconciliation. We desperately need a framework for human development in impoverished countries. The current debate will allow the different parties in Dáil Éireann to formulate their positions and put it before the people as part of the European election platforms. That will provide all of us, including Fianna Fáil, with a new electoral mandate in this regard. I would envisage, all going well, that Ireland will join the Partnership for Peace on a mutually agreed basis in the second half of this year, and the Government will be working towards that timetable.</P>
    <P>Those of us who are attached to the maintenance of a meaningful Irish neutrality must be prepared to adapt it to new situations. Partnership for Peace will allow us to keep a credible, viable and constructive neutrality, which has always been the character of our foreign policy. It does not mean that our foreign policy will be uncritically aligned with NATO. We shall continue to work with our EU partners and with like-minded countries in all parts of the world to defuse conflict and create a greater sense of harmony and solidarity among countries with often different traditions and interests.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to share my time with Deputies Hanafin and Ardagh.</P>
      <P>I support the concept of partnership for peace. Who could not support a partnership for peace? However, I have very strong reservations about Ireland's membership of the Partnership for Peace organisation. One of the great scandals of the current age is the continuing cycle of suffering caused by the unrestricted export of armaments and weapons of destruction throughout the world. It is quite clear that many of the members of Partnership for Peace are vigorously engaged in this unspeakable trade and the victims are always the same &ndash; innocent wretches in some of the most deprived countries in the Third World.</P>
      <P>Partnership for Peace is the creature of NATO. An application for membership of the organisation must be submitted to NATO. Without questioning the motive behind this NATO initiative, it is clear that membership of a NATO sponsored organisation raises fundamental issues in relation to Ireland's traditional and widely respected neutrality.</P>
      <P>On 15 July 1998, Mr. Richard Kirby of the political affairs division of NATO's international secretariat addressed the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs on NATO and Partnership for Peace. He acknowledged on that occasion:</P>
      <P>Indeed, allies are strong competitors with each other in supplying military equipment. The alliance espouses the principles of the free market . Obviously those who make and market military equipment are interested in selling it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="657" /> Such being the case, Ireland's membership of Partnership for Peace could be seen as an acceptance on our part of this unprincipled position.</P>
    <P>I recall a visit in 1985 to the headquarters of the Arab League in Tunis when the then Secretary General informed an Oireachtas delegation that the Iran-Iraq conflict was being sustained by the supply of arms from member states of the EU and that one member state in particular was supplying both sides with arms.</P>
    <P>Since the foundation of this State and particularly during the tenure of office as Minister for External Affairs of the late Frank Aiken &ndash; I was privileged to be one of his successors in that responsibility &ndash; Ireland has consistently opposed the spread of armaments throughout the world and has initiated many resolutions at the United Nations against the dissemination of conventional and nuclear arms. This principled position has won us international respect and recognition which is exemplified particularly by the acceptance of our Defence Forces in many UN peacekeeping operations throughout the world and, among other things, our pivotal role in the negotiations for the Lomé conventions with the developing countries of the ACP. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, has followed this very laudable tradition in seeking support from like-minded countries, most of which are neutral, for a new UN convention against the spread of nuclear weapons.</P>
    <P>While the people have unqualified admiration for the role played by our Defence Forces in peacekeeping operations, it is a matter of some concern that views are now being expressed by people other than the elected representatives of the Oireachtas in support of our projected membership, as they see it, of Partnership for Peace. These include, for example, the current Secretary General of the Department of Foreign Affairs, who has publicly expressed the view that &ldquo;It is curious that Ireland has not decided to become a member of Partnership for Peace&rdquo;. The former Chief of Staff, Lieutenant General McMahon, last weekend expressed the view and concern that we would be likely to be isolated as a peacekeeping force if we did not join Partnership for Peace. That this is clearly not the case is evidenced by the Taoiseach's statement in the Dáil yesterday that Ireland now ranks seventh among UN nations as a contributor of personnel to UN peacekeeping operations. In proportion to our population that clearly gives us the highest level of participation in UN peacekeeping.</P>
    <P>I recently had the privilege of seeing, at first hand, the work being done by Irish missionaries in poverty-stricken countries. They were very concerned at the crushing effect of the scandalous export of armaments to these troubled and deprived regions. These wonderful ambassadors for Ireland are true partners for peace and their views should be not only listened to but endorsed in our democratic decisions. Let those who would push our membership of Partnership for Peace not hold up as examples to us other neutral coun<Col N="658" /> tries in Europe whose records, either in the armament industry and the export of armaments or in international banking, have not been based on principles of international peace and justice.</P>
    <P>If and when Partnership for Peace is ready to address these fundamental and important issues and to propose effective controls and restrictions on armament exports, Ireland can then reconsider its position and engage in a true Partnership for Peace worldwide.</P>

      <P>Ireland has developed in great strides in the past 80 years. We recently celebrated the 80th anniversary of the first meeting of Dáil Éireann. In that time we have freed ourselves economically and defensively from Britain. We now view Britain, along with other members of the EU, as economic friends and allies. We are a strong country and though small in size, our Diaspora has done us proud &ndash; more than 40 million people in the US and ten million in the UK are proud to proclaim their Irish roots. Ireland must take its place and play a role on the world stage. We cannot allow ourselves sink into insignificance in the Atlantic.</P>
      <P>We must be team players. We have thrown off the poor relation image, living on the fringes of Europe. We are now a significant member of the EU and the euro club. Large numbers of young people are coming to Ireland to work in our IT industries. With the Internet and telecommunications, our offices and living rooms are adjacent to those of our friends and business contacts all over the world. Listening to Deputy Gay Mitchell last night, it appears that Irish parliamentarians are also using the Internet. In listing the aims of Partnership for Peace, it appears that Deputy Mitchell accessed the NATO site very expertly.</P>

      <P>Ireland has benefited from greater political and economic integration in Europe. On the eve of discussions on Agenda 2000, Ireland cannot always be seen to have its hand out without co-operating fully in all of the initiatives which promote greater unity and peace in Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is because of our open economy and trade with other countries that the Irish economy has continued to grow so well in the past 12 years. <Col N="659" /> We must play our part in the European team of peacemakers, humanitarians and world crisis managers. That team is best represented in the body Partnership for Peace. PfP allows us, along with the new democracies in Eastern Europe and other European neutral states such as Austria, Sweden, Finland and Switzerland, to co-operate, train and prepare to assist in those activities without compromising our military neutrality, on our terms, as the Taoiseach said.</P>
    <P>Our Defence Forces have had a very bad press recently as regards the hearing loss claims. There is a need to arrive at a solution to that problem which will minimise the cost to the Exchequer and at the same time rebuild the confidence of the soldiers, sailors and members of the airforce. I am sure that joining Partnership for Peace will allow great opportunities to our armed forces to co-operate, train and learn modern methods for deployment in peacekeeping and humanitarian missions. The armed forces have always responded generously to any call from the UN for assistance. By joining Partnership for Peace and taking into account the greater numbers involved we will continue to play an important role in the UN-mandated peacekeeping missions.</P>
    <P>The world is only a village. Not too long ago, the idea of travelling to London or New York meant emigrating from Ireland. Today our young people see these journeys in the same light as we view a trip to Galway or Cork. As can be seen from the Middle East war and the invasion of Iraq, missiles can now pinpoint targets within yards from a distance of thousands of miles. Cities can be completely wiped out in a short time, even without the use of nuclear weapons. Now more than ever we need peace to pervade societies all over the world. The EU was founded to ensure Germany and France would never go to war against each other again. It is by joining alliances and joining in partnership with other countries in pursuit of peace that conflict and war will be avoided.</P>
    <P>Partnership for Peace increases confidence and co-operation and this in turn reinforces our feeling of security. The partnership will increase stability, diminish threats to peace and build strengthened relationships by promoting the spirit of practical co-operation and commitment to democratic principles. NATO states that, at a pace and scope determined by a capacity and desire by the participating partners, it will work with its partners in concrete ways towards transparency in defence budgeting, promoting democratic control of defence ministries, joint planning and joint military exercises and creating an ability to operate with NATO forces in such fields as peacekeeping, search and rescue and humanitarian operations.</P>
    <P>It is stated in the objectives of Partnership for Peace that any contribution to the operations under the authority of the UN or under the responsibility of the CFCE would be subject to constitutional considerations. This effectively <Col N="660" /> means that our country's policy of military neutrality would be fully respected. I welcome the debate on Ireland's entry to Partnership for Peace.</P>

      <P>The greatest sign of a nation's sovereignty is that it can have an independent foreign policy. Even when Ireland was part of another jurisdiction we determined the line we would take on international events. MacBride and the Boer War a century ago is a case in point. When we achieved independence one of our first moves was to establish ourselves as an independent nation by setting up embassies abroad and joining the League of Nations. The role of de Valera and his presidency in the 1930s gave us international recognition also. It was a natural progression for us, therefore, to adopt an almost unanimous policy of neutrality in World War II. Criticisms have since been made against us that it was the policy that least divided us and that it was benevolent neutrality but it identified us as being separate and independent from all the major powers of the world at that time.</P>
      <P>It is no secret that we suffered in isolation as a result of that policy in the post war years. The historian, F.S.L. Lyons, compares our situation in isolation to a people condemned to live in Plato's cave, their backs to the fire of life and, consequently, only deriving knowledge of what went on outside from the flickering shadows thrown on the wall. We were refused entry to the United Nations, we broke away from the Commonwealth but we made a deliberate decision not to join NATO. Geographically and logically it would have been correct for us to join NATO because it was anti-communist but again we were criticised and it was said that ours was only a sore thumb policy. In the context of what was best for the Irish people and our independent sovereign policy, the refusal to join NATO was one of the most important foreign policy decisions made in this century.</P>
      <P>Despite all of the isolation, we emerged from the cave to become involved in the United Nations, the Council of Europe and eventually, throughout the 1960s, our commitment to Europe. Maintaining the policy of military neutrality has almost been as difficult since World War II as it was during World War II. The role played by Dr. Freddy Boland and Frank Aiken in the United Nations in developing a role for Ireland beyond what any small nation would be expected to do gave us recognition through our active participation in peacekeeping and our role in the Security Council and also gave us a military neutrality which is now firmly at the core of Ireland's foreign policy. More importantly, in the context of what we are discussing today, neutrality is at the heart of every young person in Ireland and it cannot be flittered away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the same way as our foreign policy has changed over the decades, an argument can be made to redefine our role and our involvement in international peace and security but always in the <Col N="661" /> context of maintaining our military neutrality. Political violence in the Balkans, the total disregard for human rights in parts of eastern Europe, ethnic cleansing, mass murders and crimes against humanity cannot be ignored. As a country we cannot remain passive. It is not enough for us to say something must be done while we remain the hurler on the ditch and leave the decisions to others.</P>
    <P>There is a definite choice to be made &ndash; passivity or engagement. We want to continue to be a contributor to peacekeeping, to defend the protection of human rights and to make a positive contribution to world peace, but in a changing world where the role of the UN is becoming more regionalised, where the security aspects of the European Union are gaining more prominence and where co-operation among a myriad of organisations is becoming the order of the day, neutrality demands active measures. One of those options is participation in Partnership for Peace. It is a voluntary non-binding organisation and is a major framework for co-operation, training and preparation for UN mandated peacekeeping, crisis management, humanitarian tasks, etc. Sweden and Finland joined Partnership for Peace in May 1994 on the grounds that it is exactly the kind of practical co-operation which in itself is confidence building and in addition adds to our capacity to carry out peacekeeping operations.</P>
    <P>Joining Partnership for Peace may be a positive effort to make our neutrality more relevant to the current situation. Our involvement in the United Nations may be enhanced by membership. Partnership for Peace will inevitably play a greater role in defining the rules, debating joint procedures and conducting actual missions. Our Defence Forces could be brought within a framework of European military co-operation but not in a military alliance. This may enhance our involvement in non-military aspects of European security policy.</P>
    <P>The blanket motion before the House that Ireland should join Partnership for Peace causes me to have some reservations. Is Partnership for Peace being used by those non-members of NATO as an ante-chamber for those who wish to join? What is the line between NATO exercises and those of Partnership for Peace? Is there any line? Is there more than a differentiation between them and their Internet site, as already cited? To what extent can we determine the parameters of our membership and how long can we confine our involvement? These issues need to be properly investigated and assurances given.</P>
    <P>I want to uphold our policy of military neutrality. Inactivity and isolation are not the same but the Irish people have come out of Plato's cave. We are stoking the fire of life but the manner in which we do this needs to be kept constantly under review.</P>

      <P>Today on our television screens we once again saw that fighting has broken out in Kosovo. We saw tragic pictures of refugees clinging to tractors, bombed out homes, hapless individuals left to fend for themselves in an appalling human tragedy. We have to find a way in which we can credibly and effectively intervene and help in such crises as we move towards the new millennium. Modern communications mean that we see the horror immediately but our effective interventions lag far behind these scenes.</P>
      <P>I am sure we would all agree that people want to see intervention and mechanisms put in place so that countries can intervene effectively. The public wants to see interoperability among the defence forces of different countries helping in a humanitarian way to deal with these situations. This must be done effectively, transparently and in a democratic way. These are the conditions that must be met in such circumstances. These are the essential prerequisites for such involvement.</P>
      <P>What is Ireland's role? How do we position our foreign and security policy in a changing world and a changing security environment? We must first critically examine the changing nature of that security, the changing and new demands of peacekeeping, the move from peacekeeping to peace enforcement and the variations on that and the new demands and opportunities for our Defence Forces to play an effective role in scenarios such as I have outlined. The evidence from research polls in this country is also interesting. It shows that Irish people would support intervention such as Partnership for Peace offers.</P>
      <P>We should not heighten fears by claiming that Partnership for Peace is something it is not. It is important to have a debate which points to the facts. I congratulate Deputy Gay Mitchell for putting down this motion. It develops the debate on this issue in an important way. I also congratulate Deputy Mitchell on the clarity with which he has approached this issue.</P>
      <P>Last week, left of centre politicians from Sweden and Finland spoke of their commitment to Partnership for Peace and their wholehearted support for it. It presented no conflicts for them. There is no way that Partnership for Peace is a gateway to NATO. It is unimaginable that the Swiss or the Russians see it in this way. These countries can set aside the past and look to co-operation in a real sense for dealing with current conflicts and tragedies. It is time for Ireland to do the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was interested to hear Deputy Michael Higgins' outline of an ethical foreign policy. I support the principles he outlined and the issues which must be taken into account when developing an ethical foreign policy, such as food security and the arms trade. These debates will continue if we become members of Partnership for Peace. Membership of the partnership does not exclude the development of an ethical foreign policy. It is an important step on the way to developing our foreign policy. Of course, these questions are critical and must be examined. They must also continue <Col N="663" /> to be at the forefront of any discussions about joining Partnership for Peace and during our membership of that organisation.</P>
    <P>It is only through membership of this association, which links the nations of the former Warsaw Pact with the western allies, that Ireland can fulfil UN Secretary General Kofi Annan's high expectations of our continued proactive commitment to peacekeeping. With up to 80 armed conflicts currently raging throughout the world, the regionalisation of peacekeeping is not just an option but a moral imperative.</P>
    <P>The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute said recently that much of the progress made in conflict management and resolution could be attributed to the growing co-operation between the UN and regional organisations, such as Partnership for Peace. It is ironic that while Africa faces up to its responsibilities, Europe dithers in a fog of uncertainty. Events in Kosovo are tragic testimony to the need to create a humanitarian space in which the unfortunate victims of these events can be effectively helped.</P>
    <P>Partnership for Peace is structured to allow each member to decide in each and every case the nature and extent of its commitment to the resolution of a particular crisis. It offers huge scope for an individual government to forge a link in a way that is most suitable to its foreign policy and most in keeping with its traditions. It, alone, offers the technical resources needed to develop a consensual approach to peacekeeping. It addresses issues of inter-operability that must be resolved if intervention is to be effective. Our membership of Partnership for Peace would do much to sustain our reputation as a reliable and dedicated partner in promoting security, stability and democratic values in the world. These are values we cherish dearly and it is incorrect to claim they would be undermined if we joined the partnership.</P>
    <P>The partnership is an extremely flexible arrangement. It allows each member to choose the areas in which it wishes to co-operate. The first step for participants in Partnership for Peace, as Deputy Mitchell outlined yesterday, is to subscribe to a framework document which sets out the basic purposes and objectives of Partnership for Peace. These purposes include the protection and promotion of human rights; safeguarding freedom, justice and peace; the preservation of democracy; upholding international law and fulfilling the obligations of the UN Charter and OSCE commitments. They support transparency in national defence planning budgets, democratic control of defence forces and maintenance of capability and readiness to contribute to operations under the authority of the UN or the responsibility of the OSCE.</P>
    <P>Surely we could have no problems with this. We should welcome it and wish to be involved by having our voice heard in the development of the partnership's objectives. We should be in the partnership, taking the best from our past experi<Col N="664" /> ences, influencing the debate and gleaning skills for more effective peacekeeping.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that there is a cap on the Defence Forces' opportunities to contribute effectively. They are losing skills and are not developing the skills needed for the changes in peacekeeping operations that are necessary at present. They are losing out in terms of training, equipment and opportunity to play an effective role in international peacekeeping. If we do not change our approach, this will continue and we will only be able to make ineffectual contributions.</P>
    <P>I support the motion. It is clear that the Fianna Fáil Party has changed its position on this issue. The Taoiseach said today that Ireland will join the partnership later this year. However, his comment that the defence budget will not require reassessment is to be regretted. If Ireland is to play a more effective role in international peacekeeping, it is inevitable that the defence budget will be affected and will have to be reviewed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion. It is timely to review Ireland's stance on this issue. Some people, many for genuine reasons, suggest that our neutrality is a sacred icon which has served Ireland well in the past. Perhaps it did but there is no conflict between that view and what is proposed in this debate. Neutrality has served this country well but time moves on and evolution overtakes such stances. Ireland has now reached a stage where it is expected to integrate, to an extent, with our European partners in taking responsibility for dealing with issues that affect the peace and security of member states.</P>
      <P>With the expansion of the European Union, which will continue for some time, there is serious concern among our eastern European partners and potential partners that neutral countries such as ours are less committed than they are to the European concept. They have good reasons for being concerned about peace and security. Partnership for Peace is a realistic means for Ireland to show it is committed to the European ideal in every sense &ndash; economically, politically and in terms of peace and security.</P>
      <P>It is easy to stand aloof from the European arena and to declare that somebody should do something about places such as Kosovo. It is easy to say that somebody should take action. However, we never seem to define who that somebody should be. It is hypocritical to suggest that it should always be somebody else and to use the excuse that Ireland is a small, neutral country to avoid our responsibility in such situations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="665" /> It is imperative to recognise that being in the European Union, receiving benefits from that Union and contributing to it also involves contributing constructively to the Union's peace and security. That does not suggest we should become part of an aggressive regime or part of the apparatus of any particular regime or any agenda with a view to being used in a bigger world game. That is not the issue. The issue concerns the smaller countries within the EU, particularly those in Eastern Europe, former Warsaw Pact countries. They have a genuine concern that the European Union, being the biggest single political entity, would be less than concerned about their interests in that area. They know we live a long way from them and that the chance of an aggressor encroaching on us is considerably less than in their case. Past events have shown their vulnerability. People will ask if I am suggesting we should accept some responsibility for what happens there. That is reality. If we pretend to stand aloof and are prepared to accept all the benefits that go with being part of the European Union and that somebody else should defend and look after us but are not prepared to accept the responsibility that goes with it, that begs the question whether we are seriously committed to the concept. The debate at this time is necessary and timely.</P>
    <P>Partnership for Peace is a methodology for addressing a changing situation. It does not go too far, yet it attempts to address something that has patently been in need of being addressed for some considerable time. Other speakers have referred to what happened in former Yugoslavia and that general region in recent years. We have all seen on our television screens and read in the newspapers what has happened there and of the unfortunate people who are the victims of such happenings. We all condemn it, wring our hands and say: &ldquo;Somebody, somewhere should do something, why don't the Americans do something?&rdquo;  Yet if they do something, we are not sure whether that was such a good idea. It is high time we made a commitment and stood for something in that area. Even though we are a small country we are, allegedly, somewhat influential in the European Union. Let us stand up and be counted and contribute to those who want to chart a constructive course. Let us show the other smaller east European countries that we as a small country recognise their position and that we, from our position of relative safety, can make a realistic and reasonable contribution to their peace and security. It is not sufficient for us to say somebody else should do something about it. This whole question of European integration and commitment is a serious business. We all know that Ireland has benefited considerably from membership of the European Union. I would like to think we have made a fair contribution as well. We have made a constructive contribution in terms of stability and in showing how improvements can be made and how good use can be made of resources. It was not all a bed of roses for us and <Col N="666" /> all the benefits did not accrue overnight. We have made many of the sacrifices other people in the wider European arena are making at this time.</P>
    <P>We have a duty to show we are serious about that part of our commitment to Europe. We have committed ourselves in every other way. The proposal set out in the motion does not conflict with our position on neutrality. We need to review our position in that direction as a matter of urgency. I strongly support the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly support the motion tabled by Deputy Gay Mitchell. It is long overdue that we take an active part in getting involved in defence commitments and in the protection of democracy in western Europe and all over Europe and maybe in the future, further afield. It is not good enough that we leave the peacekeeping role in the world to a small number of nations, such as the United States and the British. We have a moral obligation to see that innocent people are protected. The children of the American nation and the British nation are just as important as our own. I do not see why we should sneak out from under and use the issue of neutrality as an excuse not to get involved. We thrive on the benefits received from Europe and from western democracy in general and should be willing to pay the debt we owe to the world and to Europe in particular.</P>
      <P>Neutrality does not have any great significance. I was never in favour of it. Some people were not in favour of it during World War II. There was an ideological objection to it given that the country was partitioned against the will of the people. That objection has been largely overcome since all sides in this House have agreed the situation in Northern Ireland should be solved by peaceful negotiations. We then had the excuse of a Cold War and the two great power blocs in the world &ndash; NATO led by the Americans and Warsaw Pact led by the Russians &ndash; were straining at the leash to get at one another, whenever the occasion arose and that we were going to remain neutral and not get involved. That excuse has disappeared. The Warsaw Pact has disintegrated and some of its members are members of Partnership for Peace. I do not see any good reason we should stay out of movements such as the Partnership for Peace. If there has to be a referendum, let there be a referendum. I have great confidence in the citizens of this country to adopt an adult approach and to share the responsibilities with other countries throughout the world and in Europe in particular.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While one flashpoint may be resolved, such as Bosnia or Cambodia, Milosovic has and will continue to massacre people in Kosovo unless the international community takes strong steps to oppose him. We should be part of that. There is no point in saying &ldquo;let the Americans go in and get a few hundred or a few thousand people killed.&rdquo;  Why should we make that statement when we are not prepared to do it? Our armed <Col N="667" /> forces should get involved not just in peacekeeping but in peace enforcement.</P>
    <P>We should be prepared to take the risk the same as anybody else. Our Army would probably be happier to be involved than not to be involved. If we have an Army we must have a purpose for it. While its peacekeeping record is excellent and it has suffered a number of casualties we should go the full hog and get involved in peace enforcement. Tyrants such as Hitler, Stalin, Pol Pot, Amin, Milosovic and Pinochet surface every couple of years. There will always be turmoil. At the moment Africa is in turmoil and no one is prepared to take on the situation. The whole Great Lakes area is in turmoil &ndash; the former Zaire, Sierra Leone, Algeria, Angola, Sudan, the list is endless &ndash; and international forces are not willing to go in there. It is not for us, however, to dictate or advocate that other countries go in when we are not prepared to do so ourselves. Edmund Burke said that if good men are not prepared to act, evil men will take over. That is what happens in these places. If people are not prepared to get involved, evil forces will dominate.</P>
    <P>The Government should support Deputy Mitchell's motion as a first sign of showing that we are prepared to play a responsible part in maintaining world peace. I am not asking that we base our argument on the economic benefits to this country. We have a moral duty to live up to our responsibilities. I congratulate the agencies such as Trócaire and GOAL who do such wonderful work for us. We, as politicians, are not living up to our duties and we are letting them do the work which we should be doing.</P>

      <P>The Labour Party is all over the shop on this issue. It supports Partnership for Peace but there is a European election coming up and it does not want to loose its niche market in terms of neutrality. It is a completely cynical move.</P>
      <P>The whole debate has been orchestrated and choreographed. The Secretary General of the Department of Foreign Affairs has appeared before the Committee on Foreign Affairs and publicly disagreed with the stance of his Minister. The stance of Fianna Fáil at the time was that it was opposed to Partnership for Peace. It is outrageous that a senior civil servant would behave in this manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="668" /> There was also the case of RACO and PDFORRA appearing on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo;. The military was advising us on sensitive matters of foreign policy, again something which was absolutely outrageous, and no one so much as batted an eyelid. We have to ask ourselves how this could happen. Perhaps we can get an insight from the Internet. I listened carefully when people mentioned it earlier and there are some interesting cities. There is a paper by Stanley R. Sloan which I would like to read into the record. He is a senior specialist in international security policy in the Foreign Affairs and National Defence Division of the Congressional Research Service. He says:</P>
    <P>With the NATO enlargement process looming on the near horizon, Europe's former neutral states &ndash; Austria, Finland, Sweden, Switzerland and Ireland &ndash; are re-evaluating the role they should play in the changing European security setting.</P>
    <P>The word &ldquo;former&rdquo; tells us a great deal about where he is coming from. He makes an interesting statement about Sweden. So much of the debate has focused on the fact that there are neutral states in Partnership for Peace so there is therefore no problem. He states: &ldquo;Public opinion remains broadly attached to Sweden's military non-alignment but elite opinion appears to accept that Sweden will eventually find its interests best served by membership&rdquo;. The debate is being led by elite opinion. It is divorced from public opinion because public opinion wants us to retain our non-aligned status.</P>

        <b>:</b> Not only do I oppose the motion, I firmly oppose the two amendments. I am not amazed by anything the Labour Party does anymore but it has moved massively from its stated position of previous times and has now gone as far as touting its former leader, Deputy Spring, as a commissioner for some foreign and security policy position in Europe.</P>
      <P>What is Partnership for Peace? The parties in support of it and which will agree to join it shortly are trying to give the impression that it is some kind of humanitarian institution for the well-being of humanity. Let us take it from the horse's mouth. In 1996 the US Defence Department, the mainstay of NATO, issued a progress report on a Partnership for Peace which said:</P>
      <P>At its birth two years ago there were concerns that PfP was unworkably vague, or a mere way-station to NATO membership.</P>
      <P>Those fears have proved unfounded as PfP has evolved quickly from a bare concept to an active association of military and defence institutions which train, exercise and work together with NATO countries</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Confronting concern about its relevance in the post-Cold War era, NATO has reaffirmed its place at the core of transatlantic security through <Col N="669" /> its sponsorship of PfP. In other words PfP is cover for the major states, particularly the USA, to deal with a new situation in a different way when they thought they were becoming redundant. It is clearly the case that this is part of a process of bringing this country into a military alliance in Europe.</P>
    <P>It is laughable to hear Deputy Deasy bemoaning the fact that the major military powers in this world are not prepared to walk all over Africa to sort out its problems when it is precisely those powers which have caused most of those same problems. There is not a dirty dictator on the face of this earth whom the US has not sponsored in the past, to whom it has given arms, from Latin America to Africa.</P>
    <P>Peace and security in this world will not be provided by this country being dragged into an alliance with powerful states in Europe which are major manufacturers of fearsome military weaponry which they peddle around the world.

      <P>This debate has conclusively shown the wisdom of the Government's amending motion. It is right that the Government proposes that Dáil Éireann reaffirm Ireland's policy of military neutrality. It is right that Dáil Éireann should support the commitment of the Government to build on Ireland's international vocation in support of peace and security through peacekeeping, an area in which our Defence Forces have played their role with great honour.</P>
      <P>Participation in PfP on our terms, as Government speakers have made clear, is compatible with our neutrality. The previous Government, in its White Paper in 1996, recognised that this was the case.</P>

      <P>Ireland will maintain its long-standing policy on nuclear disarmament. Participation in PfP will not imply acceptance of or complicity in nuclear deterrence. Nuclear weapons have no place in peacekeeping and crisis management.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The view was stated yesterday that PfP is not a European issue as such. PfP, as has been made clear by Government speakers, has its origins in <Col N="670" /> the new situation in Europe, following the end of the Cold War, in which the practice of mutually reinforcing co-operation between the security organisations has emerged as an accepted principle of international standards. All the non-NATO PfP partner countries are European.</P>
    <P>I would like to clarify some facts about participation in SFOR in Bosnia. It is not correct that only 20 of the SFOR troop contributors are involved in Partnership for Peace. Partnership for Peace is open to all OSCE states. Of the 33 OSCE states which have participated in SFOR, 32 are participating in Partnership for Peace, the exception being Ireland.</P>
    <P>This debate has been useful as part of the ongoing debate which the Government has encouraged. In recent times European security has evolved in ways which merit close attention. The Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs held a series of informative meetings on the issue with presentations on the pros and cons. Recent replies to questions have clarified the Government's views. I hope this debate will help the Dáil to comprehend the practical choices we face and their broader implications.</P>

      <P>I am delighted that my party which has given leadership has exposed the U-turn by the Government and Fianna Fáil in particular. In 1996 the Taoiseach, then in Opposition, made the famous speech about the arrival of the French and Spanish in Bantry and Killala. Fianna Fáil has now done a U-turn. My party had the courage of its convictions to say from day one that it supports Ireland's membership of Partnership for Peace. That is the fundamental difference between my party and Fianna Fáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Three years ago, in better times, the former Minister for Foreign Affairs, Ray Burke, said that participation in Partnership for Peace would amount to second-class membership of NATO. The Defence Forces have had to wait since then for a proper indication that we will seek to join Partnership for Peace. This cute hoorism, evident <Col N="672" /> in Fianna Fáil's policy on foreign affairs, has been exposed by the excellent contribution of our spokesman, Deputy Mitchell. My party supports unapologetically membership of Partnership for Peace.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputies who contributed to the debate which has been enlightening. The Taoiseach should be sent to the Middle East more often. The flyover over the road to Damascus has resulted in a great conversion. In recent weeks he said in the House that we would not be joining.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome his commitment that Ireland will join Partnership for Peace this year.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach said that, with other Fine Gael members, I have called for full membership of the Western European Union and attacked the tradition of neutrality going back to World War II. We have not done so, we have made constructive contributions. I have not called for membership of NATO. I have, however, called for a debate on the issue. When I was reported as saying that we should join NATO I wrote to the newspapers indicating that I wanted to hear the arguments. If there is a good reason we should not join NATO, let us hear it so that the principle cannot be departed from by stealth.</P>
      <P>I participated as the Irish member of the Reflection Group in a discussion on the possible merger of the Western European Union and the European Union. I said that if such a merger was to go ahead, the Article 5 commitment should take the form of a protocol. We have to discuss the matter and negotiate because if we do not compromise, we will break and will be given a choice &ndash; in or out. That cannot happen without a healthy debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find it hard to take that opposite positions can be taken in and out of Government on something as serious as foreign policy. Some of what has been said is outrageous. In Government, after a long discussion, my party presented a White Paper. It said the overall objectives of Partnership for Peace are consistent with Ireland's approach to international peace and European security, that the Government had decided to explore further the benefits that Ireland might derive from Partnership for Peace and to determine the contribution that Ireland might make to the partnership. That is what all parties said in Government, and I note the Labour Party amendment, which has the fingerprints of Deputy De Rossa on it, does not have Deputy Spring's name <Col N="673" /> attached to it. I doubt very much that he could have gone along with the hypocrisy of it.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party manifesto said that it could be a legitimate and proper role for Ireland to participate in due course in the pan-European structure of the Partnership for Peace. Noting that this has already been joined by other European neutrals such as Switzerland, Austria, Sweden and Finland, it went on to say that this is not a military alliance and that Ireland, like all other countries, would be free to negotiate its own terms. That is what the Labour Party manifesto said, and I am more than surprised by what has been said today.</P>
    <P>Several Deputies have said the debate has been rushed. We published that White Paper on foreign policy three years ago next March, after a year of debate around the country. Deputy Spring, who was Minister, I and the then Minister of State, Deputy Burton, had a whole year of discussion on it. We have had the White Paper for three years, and Fine Gael published a document last January. How much discussion do we want? The Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs considered this matter for all of last year. How much debate do we want, and who is going to report it? The ghosts in the public gallery? We have had the debate, and it is time we told people the truth.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hayes has dealt with Bantry Bay and the Taoiseach's comments when in Opposition. The Taoiseach quoted Article 28º3 of the Constitution with reference to neutrality. What about Article 29 of the Constitution and the British-Irish Agreement? Lifford is not in NATO; Strabane is and has been since 1949. The only principle on which our neutrality has been based from the very beginning is partition. Seán McBride, the Minister who kept us out, said we would become full charter members of NATO the day after partition ended. That is the only principle that has ever been set out; if there are others let them be debated. Partition is something we have at last come to terms with, but Members on some sides are as irredentist on this as the DUP are on Catholic and Nationalist issues. It is time we opened our minds to the other side of the argument.</P>
    <P>I want to hear the other side of the neutrality argument, because I can be convinced that we should not join Partnership for Peace if I hear the argument. However, I will not be blackguarded into a corner as a militarist because I question it. That is neither right nor healthy. Much of the emotion, fear, prejudice, anti-Americanism and political gameplaying informing our approach came out in this debate.</P>
    <P>Deputy Higgins put his views sincerely, but 11 <Col N="674" /> of the 15 EU member states are led by socialist or social democratic Governments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>On 16 September 1998 the Minister for Foreign Affairs and I announced a major package of debt relief measures in favour of heavily indebted poor countries. Our motivation was simple. In our view the time had long passed when it was appropriate for Ireland merely to call for debt relief as it had done for the previous decade. We felt we should move beyond exhortation, high sounding words and rhetoric and actually do something to alleviate the crushing burden of debt on the poorest countries. The debt package announced then is the primary reason for the introduction of the Bretton Woods Agreements (Amendment) Bill. The Bill also deals with Ireland's participation in the BIS facility for Brazil and the adoption by Ireland of the Fourth Amendment of the Articles of Agreement of the International Monetary Fund. For the purpose of my speech, I will deal with the debt issue first and then provide a succinct summary of the other main provisions in the Bill.</P>
      <P>The heavy external debt burden of many developing countries has been an issue of growing international concern in recent years. The servicing and repayment of such debt diverts valuable resources from the provision of social services and hinders the economic and social development of many developing countries, including the African priority countries of the Irish aid programme. Debt owed to multilateral financial institutions accounts for an important portion of total indebtedness, particularly in the heavily indebted poor countries or HIPCs. There is widespread acceptance that farreaching and co-ordinated action is needed to tackle the debt problems, whether bilateral or multilateral, of the most severely affected countries.</P>

    <P>Ireland has long been an advocate of a multilateral response to the debt crisis in the developing world, in parallel to initiatives by individual countries, and successive Ministers for Finance have strongly advanced this policy at the IMF and World Bank over the past decade. The international pressure for action on debt culminated in the launch of the joint IMF/World Bank heavily indebted poor countries HIPC initiative in 1996 as the first debt relief scheme seriously to address the problem of Third World debt. The initiative is aimed at HIPCs who have demonstrated, through a track record of good economic management and reform, that they are capable of achieving debt sustainability in the medium term. It commits the international financial institutions to take additional action to reduce the debt burden on HIPC countries where existing mechan<Col N="678" /> isms are likely to be ineffective. The fundamental objective of the initiative is to ensure, for those countries with a track record of adjustment and reform, a robust exit from debt indebtedness and the achievement of debt sustainability.</P>
    <P>Both the World Bank and the IMF have established the means for delivering their share of HIPC assistance. The World Bank's participation in the initiative takes place primarily through the HIPC debt initiative trust fund, which provides relief on debt owed to the International Development Association, either through the purchase and subsequent cancellation of outstanding IDA credits or through servicing of a portion of the beneficiary country's IDA debt. The IMF's participation in the initiative is through the [ESAF] HIPC Trust and takes the form of special grants that are deposited in an escrow account to cover debt-service payments to the IMF under an agreed schedule.</P>
    <P>In relation to debt relief, section 4 of the Bill will enable me, or the Central Bank on my behalf, to take the necessary actions to make the payments authorised by the Government under the debt relief package announced by myself and the Minister for Foreign Affairs on 16 September 1998. The package will amount to £31.5 million over 12 years, of which £17 million will be disbursed in 1999. It consists essentially of the following three elements: debt relief of £11 million is being provided to the World Bank's HIPC debt initiative trust fund; £4 million goes to the IMF's [ESAF] HIPC Trust; and £7 million is being provided to the IMF to provide interest subsidies under the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility Trust. Ireland has also committed some £20 million to the twelfth replenishment of IDA, the World Bank's soft loan window. I will be returning to the Oireachtas with legislation to effect this contribution later in the year.</P>
    <P>It is now time for Ireland to move on from its advocacy role in relation to debt relief and to become a direct contributor to the joint IMF/World Bank debt initiative. It is important that Ireland, particularly in view of our recent economic success, should join with our European Union and IMF partners in providing finance to assist Third World countries achieve debt sustainability. The debt relief provisions in the Bill should therefore be seen as another important dimension to Ireland's overseas development efforts. Ireland needs to back-up our bilateral aid programme with initiatives in the multilateral area as well. A contribution by Ireland at this juncture will enhance our moral authority to call for increased efforts by the international community, including the multilateral institutions, to reduce the burden of debt on Third World countries to the greatest extent possible.</P>
    <P>While the package is a significant step forward in Ireland's evolving position on debt and overseas development it is, however, a first step and we look forward to making further progress in partnership with interested parties over the next few years. In this connection Deputies will be <Col N="679" /> aware that the Government has adopted a series of guidelines on future Irish policy in regard to Third World debt. These guidelines are as follows. Debt relief should become an integral part of Ireland's overall overseas development aid strategy, reinforcing the existing emphasis on the fundamental goal of poverty alleviation as well as environmental sustainability and gender equality &ndash; I note with satisfaction that the President of the World Bank has also made clear that debt relief must be firmly situated in the bank's poverty reduction strategy. Ireland will continue to emphasise the need for definitions of debt sustainability to take human, as well as economic, development into account.</P>
    <P>We will press for increased flexibility in the implementation of the HIPC initiative in particular with a view to its speedier implementation and its application to as wide a range of the heavily indebted countries as possible. We will continue to encourage the IMF to take full account of the social impact of its policies at the design and implementation phases of its macroeconomic and structural adjustment programmes. We will strongly encourage the international community, including bilateral creditors, to take a generous and flexible approach to the heavily indebted poor countries. Ireland will continue to press for deeper debt relief, so as to ease the debt burden that is imposing enormous constraints on many developing countries. We will continue to advocate a greater degree of consultation and involvement by civil society in the developing countries in the planning, design and implementation phases of IMF/World Bank programmes.</P>
    <P>We will continue to call on the IMF to maximise the use of its own resources by, for instance, the sale of its gold reserves, to fund a deeper and wider response to the debt problems of Third World countries &ndash; in recent discussions on funding HIPC and ESAF, Ireland took a strong position in favour of the sale of gold. As Minister for Finance, I will press for greater transparency in the workings of the Bretton Woods institutions. Both the Minister for Foreign Affairs and I will emphasise the importance of continued consultation with the NGO community on issues of concern in relation to debt and development.</P>
    <P>Ireland's commitment to multilateral co-operation is well founded and widely respected. The Oireachtas has over the years been supportive of deepening Ireland's involvement in the international financial institutions. In addition to approving Ireland's membership of the original Bretton Woods institutions, it subsequently approved Ireland's membership of the International Finance Corporation and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency and, more recently, endorsed Ireland's membership of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.</P>
    <P>The Oireachtas has also, on numerous occasions, overwhelmingly approved various replenishments of the International Development <Col N="680" /> Association &ndash; the soft-loan arm of the World Bank. As I said, I hope to introduce legislation in the coming session to confirm Ireland's proposed contribution of £20 million to the 12th replenishment of the association.</P>
    <P>Ireland's participation in international institutions is predicated on working co-operatively within the institutions, while remaining strongly focused on our legitimate national and international objectives. Most actors in the Irish economic and social success story fully acknowledge the importance of consultation, inclusion and participation as a critical enabling mechanism in our consensual approach to economic and social development.</P>
    <P>Our European Union partners and fellow members at the IMF aspire to equitable treatment for the low and middle income countries in economic, social, trade and development matters. We all share with them the imperative of finding an exit from the crushing burden of debt, war oppression, hunger and famine.</P>
    <P>The needs of developing countries include adequate levels of external financing, fair patterns of participation in the world economy, a strong private sector, good governance, a strong civil society, strengthened patterns of expenditure on basic needs and debt relief. These are interrelated themes that are all part of Irish development co-operation policy. They are all themes currently under negotiation in a new Lomé framework. They are why, in my view, Ireland must contribute to HIPC and to an ESAF framework already placing much greater emphasis on social needs, as African leaders acknowledge.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy O'Donnell, was in Mozambique last week and heard at first hand of the need for urgent debt relief through HIPC. Ireland must now play its part in the response of the international community to the debt needs of highly indebted poor countries in Africa and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>In this connection, and in the context of ESAF, it is instructive to note the recent resolution adopted in the UN General Assembly on &ldquo;Enhancing international co-operation towards a durable solution to the external debt problem of developing countries&rdquo;. The resolution provides a very thorough summary of the views of the developing countries on the HIPC's debt initiative, ESAF, the elimination of poverty and related matters. Of particular relevance is the resolution's call for bilateral donors to finalise their arrangements for contributing to the World Bank's HIPC debt initiative trust and the IMF's [ESAF] HIPC trust. The resolution also calls for strong support for the continuation of ESAF operations and underlines the urgency of securing ESAF's funding and sustenance.</P>
    <P>It is generally recognised that debt cancellation is only one of the many problems facing these countries. The IMF, with justification, points out that unconditional debt relief is not the right tool for promoting the ultimate goal of sustainable development and poverty reduction. These goals <Col N="681" /> are best attained by providing debt relief in a process, such as that provided by the debt initiative, which encourages the adopting of appropriate policies by the recipient country designed to stimulate private sector led growth and focuses on an improvement in social expenditures.</P>
    <P>The members of the IMF and the World Bank see conditionality as an integral part of this process. The goal is to ensure that the debt relief provided is used effectively, particularly through promoting health and education expenditures. The IMF fears that unconditional debt cancellation risks debt relief being used for purposes not related to growth and development. The Government is open to pursuing a rational debate on this important issue. Ireland will be in a stronger position to pursue the debt cancellation issue more rigorously, once we have established our credibility by bearing our fair proportion of the costs of the ESAF and HIPC initiatives.</P>
    <P>I note the strong similarity between the debt relief package announced by Chancellor Schroder of Germany on 21 January 1999 and that previously announced by Ireland. The Cologne initiative is aimed at intensifying and accelerating the joint IMF/World Bank HIPC initiative to speed up the debt relief process, so that all countries entitled to take part can ascertain the extent and date of their debt relief by 2000. It includes a call for cancellation of commercial debt and debt connected with official development aid. We fully support these proposals and note the German Chancellor's commitment to contributing to ESAF and the World Bank's HIPC debt initiative trust fund.</P>
    <P>The ESAF is the principal means by which the IMF provides financial support, in the form of highly concessional loans, to low income member countries facing protracted balance of payments problems. ESAF resources are made available to eligible members in the context of a three year structural adjustment programme.</P>
    <P>In 1994 the Government decided to contribute to ESAF. Subsequently, in 1996, the Minister for Finance decided to defer Ireland's contribution, pending a satisfactory operational implementation of the debt initiative and against a background of criticism of the severity of the accompanying adjustment programmes.</P>
    <P>In response to concerns about the social impacts of ESAF programmes, an independent panel of experts, appointed by the IMF, recently conducted an external evaluation of the facility. Their report endorsed the fundamental view that the structural reforms of the type supported by ESAF generally have positive effects on growth and income distribution in low income countries. In a similar vein, the African governors of the IMF and the World Bank have reiterated their support for the ESAF, indicating that it has been very useful in supporting the adjustment programmes of low income countries.</P>
    <P>The external evaluation, together with a review of ten years of ESAF operations prepared by staff <Col N="682" /> of the IMF, also provided valuable insights on how to make the facility more effective in supporting macroeconomic and structural reform in low income countries. Consequently, in the light of these evaluations, the IMF's executive board has endorsed proposals that are now being implemented to ameliorate adverse impacts of ESAF operations in a number of areas. These include the social impact of adjustment, improved IMF collaboration with the World Bank, promoting ownership of the programmes, increasing the level of consultation and participation of civil society and advancing reform across all sectors. Actions in these and other areas are intended to refocus ESAF to provide more effective support for economic reform in all low income countries. We will continue to encourage the IMF to advance these proposals in the planning, design and implementation of ESAF programmes. In view of the progress made under the HIPC initiative and the lessons learnt from the ESAF evaluation, I consider that it is now appropriate for Ireland to honour its proposed contribution to ESAF.</P>
    <P>Given the scale of the development challenges facing the Bretton Woods institutions, it is not surprising that all regions of the world have not received, at all times, the attention they deserved. It is understandable that, in recent times, a major effort should have been made to deal with the Asian financial crises, the crisis and institutional and political challenges facing Russia, and, latterly, the crisis of confidence in Brazil.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that the birth of the debt initiative in 1996 should have been followed by a crisis in the international financial system. The focus of attention of the world's political, economic and financial community had necessarily to be directed to mitigating the effects of the financial crisis in the countries concerned and to stop contagion effects in neighbouring countries and regions. I am pleased that Ireland for the first time has joined with its EU partners to play an active part in this process through the BIS Facility for Brazil. It is also the first time that all 15 EU member states have stepped in to participate as a union to assist a country experiencing a crisis.</P>
    <P>All the recent developments have tended to deflect attention from the other crisis, the development and poverty resolution needs of the continent of Africa. I am glad to see that this issue is now taking centre stage on the international agenda.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to work side by side with the Bretton Woods institutions in their efforts to bring about order and progress in the world monetary, financial and economic systems as the critical underpinning for community growth, social solidarity and economic development among the nations of the world. Their role is critical and the world would certainly be worse off without them. Clearly both the IMF and the World Bank are not without fault and no commentator can stand uncritically over all the actions they have taken over the years. While recognising that reform is <Col N="683" /> necessary, I favour planned evolutionary change rather than forced, coercive and revolutionary change that is based on ideological approaches alone.</P>
    <P>The Bill goes beyond the question of Third World debt. It includes provisions in section 8 to deal with Ireland's participation in the IMF arranged financial package for Brazil. It also deals in sections 2 and 3 with the acceptance by Ireland of the one-time equity allocation of special drawing rights to members of the IMF. Specifically the Bill will enable me to take the necessary actions to guarantee the Central Bank against any losses it might incur under the Bank for International Settlements' Facility in favour of Banco Central do Brazil &ndash; Ireland's participation in the facility will cover the capital element of US$50 million equivalent to IR£34.3 million and associated interest; and provide for the adoption by Ireland of the proposed fourth amendment of the Articles of Agreement of the IMF &ndash; this will enable the Central Bank to accept the one time allocation of special drawings rights agreed by the IMF at the annual meetings of the Fund and the World Bank in Hong Kong in 1997.</P>
    <P>As part of the overall US$41.5 billion international financial support package for Brazil, the Bank for International Settlements, BIS, has agreed a US$14.5 billion credit facility in favour of Banco Central do Brazil. All member states of the European Union, in recognition of the growing international financial and economic importance of the Union, are participating in the facility. The credit facility will work through the extension of a credit line by the Bank for International Settlements to Banco Central do Brazil.</P>
    <P>Ireland has agreed to participate in the package in the amount of US$50 million, £34.3 million, acting through the Central Bank. The funding is not being provided up front. The credit facility is structured in such a way that, in the event of any default by Brazil, a substitution agreement, which forms part of the facility, will be invoked under which the BIS could call on the Central Bank to pay in full or in part its proportionate share of the package up to US$50 million. The Central Bank would also be liable for any interest payments outstanding. The Minister will, in turn, provide the Central Bank with a guarantee in respect of any losses that may be incurred by it under the terms of the substitution agreement.</P>
    <P>The Minister does not have power to provide a guarantee to the Central Bank under existing legislation, so it is now proposed to include the necessary authority in this Bill to enable him to do so. The detailed terms and conditions which will apply under the guarantee itself will be worked out later, in consultation with the bank, in accordance with standard procedures.</P>
    <P>The special drawing right, or SDR, is an international reserve asset created by the IMF following the first amendment of the Articles of Agreement in 1969. Its value as a reserve asset derives, essentially, from the commitments of participants <Col N="684" /> to hold and accept SDRs and to honour various obligations connected with its proper functioning as a reserve asset. It is a purely official asset that can only be held and used by member country participants in the SDR department, by the IMF, and by official entities prescribed as &ldquo;other holders&rdquo; of SDRs by the IMF.</P>
    <P>Some IMF members have not received any SDRs, or have only participated in some of the earlier allocations, depending on when they joined the IMF. To ensure that all members receive an equitable share of cumulative SDR allocations, the Board of Governors adopted a resolution on 23 September 1997 approving a proposal for a fourth amendment to the articles which would remedy the current unequal holdings of this useful asset. The proposed amendment would not affect the IMF's existing power to make a general rather than a selective allocation of SDRs based on a finding of a long-term global need to supplement reserves as and when such a need arises.</P>
    <P>The Bill will provide for the adoption by Ireland of the proposed fourth amendment of the Articles of Agreement of the IMF, which concerns a one-time allocation of special drawing rights, SDRs, the reserve currency of the IMF, to members of the fund. The relevant provisions to enable the Central Bank to accept the SDRs on behalf of Ireland following the approval of the Oireachtas are incorporated in the Bill. Ireland's holdings of SDRs are counted as part of its official external reserves. The net effect of the one time allocation means that Ireland's external reserves will increase by 67 million SDRs, or £64 million.</P>
    <P>A number of aggregation limits are also being inserted in the Bill to deal with possible future contributions to the World Bank and IMF with regard to contributions in respect of debt relief and economic and social reform. Given the emphasis now being placed by the European Union and the international community in general to resolving the debt problems of the heavily indebted poor countries, further efforts may be made internationally to provide additional debt relief to support specific countries. I would like to be in a position to respond speedily and flexibly to any further such initiatives in the future. For this reason, I propose to include aggregation clauses in the Bill to permit further contributions to these instruments without the need for legislation.</P>
    <P>The entire debt relief package is designed to make an initial Irish contribution to the alleviation of the burden on HIPC countries. I am satisfied that the package offers a pragmatic way forward to alleviate the crippling debt overhang which has acted as a constraint on the development of the HIPC countries. It is also appropriate that Ireland should show its solidarity with Brazil in the financial difficulties from which it is suffering at present. We hope that the international support which Brazil is receiving will enable it to undertake the reforms necessary to underpin its <Col N="685" /> future economic development. The amendment of the IMF Articles of Agreement to enable the selective allocation of SDRs is also worthy of the support of the House. I, therefore, recommend the Bill for the approval of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is beyond debate that in civilised democracies Governments have an obligation to help and lift out of poverty those who are disadvantaged in society. To argue against that would be out of the question and all the western democracies have strong social programmes to ensure that persons in need have their needs attended to, either materially or in terms of programmes, and that schemes are also put in place to enable them move with the mainstream of society.</P>
      <P>It is also true that if one was to argue the case, one would say that Governments have an obligation because they must cherish all the children of the nation equally. Since everybody shares a common citizenship everybody in Ireland and in any of the western democracies is entitled to a fair proportion of the national resources. A similar argument could be made with regard to the disadvantaged in Third World countries. The justification is not that we have obligations towards citizens, because they are not our citizens, but that we share a common humanity.</P>
      <P>Increasingly, in the second half of the 20th century the concept of obligations arising because we share a common humanity has come into mainstream thinking.</P>
      <P>The debate is completed on that, and very few people would argue against the proposition that countries like Ireland that are doing quite well have an obligation to underdeveloped countries and the disadvantaged and poor of the Third World because we share a common humanity and it is an obligation rather than an exercise in international charity that we should fulfil those obligations to our overseas development programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that context it is an advance in policy that the Government would decide to bring in measures which would allow it to contribute to the reduction of debt and make that part of the development programme which, up to now, manifested itself more in terms of direct aid at times of need or in money for development in Third World countries. Our attitude towards underdeveloped countries in our programmes in recent years, which I support, has been typified by a proverb of Chinese origin to the effect that if a man is given a fish he is fed for a day but if he is taught how to fish he is fed for life. The developmental approach in that has informed the attitude of Irish overseas development aid, and we can cite projects in different parts of the world, particularly in Africa, which are designed not only to give aid for the moment, for the week, for the year of the crisis, but to position people so that they can lift themselves out of their difficult situation and become self-sufficient and look after their own needs. In that respect, where the bur<Col N="686" /> den of debt is the major inhibiting factor preventing self-sufficiency and preventing countries reaching that critical point where they can have self-sustaining programmes, it is very important that we should mark this advance in policy.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is to make the payments authorised by the Government under the debt relief package announced by the Ministers for Finance and Foreign Affairs on 16 September 1998. The total package is £31.5 million over 12 years, £17 million of which is being paid up front in 1999.</P>
    <P>I agree with the initiatives in general terms, and I agree with some specific initiatives. However, following consideration and extensive briefing from people who are particularly well informed about Third World debt, that is, the Debt and Development Coalition of Ireland which has been in correspondence with every Deputy in this House, I have serious reservations about the Government's decision to fund the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility. Because of the Government's decision to fund ESAF, I cannot support this Bill in its entirety.</P>
    <P>One of the key burdens in developing countries now is the burden of debt. That is directly related to the lack of social programmes in many countries. In Tanzania, for example, 40 per cent of people die before their 35th birthday, and Tanzania spends six times as much on debt payments as it does on health. In Zambia, servicing external debt accounts for five times the expenditure on education. In Ethiopia, more than 100,000 children die annually from easily preventable diseases, yet debt repayments are four times the amount spent on health. When the burden of debt is so onerous, agencies such as the IMF have to be very careful when taking measures to reconstruct the economies and budgetary accounts of such countries that the medicine is not too strong for the patient, that in trying to correct the problems in the economy they do not make the poor poorer so that more children die, more children drop out of education, life expectancy does not increase and sometimes diminishes. The ESAF programmes have all those faults. I ask the Minister to reconsider.</P>
    <P>Any series of measures imposed by the IMF which diverts resources away from investment and human development, from infrastructure and into debt servicing, can sacrifice people in that country. It also sacrifices future national development. It also frequently raises social tensions and fuels conflict, and that has been evident through the 1990s.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed the Government is persisting with its proposals to fund ESAF. The decision does not fit with the debt policy principles which the Government has announced. Recent reviews of ESAF have been highly critical. I will return to these criticisms later. The IMF has not addressed the issue of the necessary reforms needed in the operation of this facility both in terms of its ownership and transparency and its <Col N="687" /> content. We had been the only EU member state which had decided not to participate in ESAF funding, and any leverage we have in influencing the manner in which ESAF programmes are applied by the IMF will be gone as a result of the Minister's decision today. The Government of which I was a member decided not to contribute to ESAF in response to widespread oppos- ition around Ireland to such a contribution. The Debt and Development Coalition has been lobbying Deputies and is opposed to it. It is not good practice to run with the views of any particular lobby group, but on this occasion the coalition of people involved in the lobby group seem to be the only body of people in Ireland with any in-depth knowledge of the problems of debt in Third World countries outside of the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Department of Finance. Certainly the hands-on experience of these groups, particularly in Africa, has to be taken into account, and their opposition is quite weighty. They object to the negative social impact of ESAF. The IMF aims to reduce deficits and not poverty. Human need is not a priority in the approach of ESAF programmes. There is also a strong argument that the programmes imposed by ESAF undermine democracy, that they are designed in IMF headquarters in Washington and imposed in selected countries, and that the elected parliaments and the wider civil society in these countries are bypassed. This is undemocratic but it is also imprudent because frequently the rigour of the programmes undermines the democratically elected representatives.</P>
    <P>One significant factor about the ESAF programmes is that they are so onerous and so inappropriate that, according to the briefing I have received, three-quarters of the programmes break down. It is hard to justify funding programmes which have such a track record. The Minister should think again before he proceeds.</P>
    <P>ESAF was introduced as a response to the debt crisis but it has failed abysmally to tackle the problem. In the countries following ESAF programmes, debt has doubled between 1985 and 1995. Therefore, on the face of it ESAF as a programme does not work.</P>
    <P>I am not saying that many countries do not need to take a hard look at the way they manage their affairs. Countries spend a great deal of money on armaments and making war on each other which would be better spent on social programmes. There are countries which spend money on ridiculous flagship projects which inflate the ego and sometimes add to the stature of particular leaders but do nothing for the real needs of the people. I am not one who says that corrective financial and fiscal action does not need to be taken. However, the manner in which it is being done under the ESAF programmes is too rigorous in its application and too remote in its initiation. Frequently the programmes have no democratic support in the countries in which they <Col N="688" /> are applied and, in fact, often wreck the democratic structures there.</P>
    <P>The Government has argued that we should now contribute to ESAF and the Minister has repeated some of the points, but the connection which the IMF has made between the HIPC programmes and the ESAF programmes is particularly unfortunate. Eligibility for HIPC is linked to a six year track record on ESAF and, given the high breakdown rate of the ESAF programmes, I believe this IMF initiative is hindering debt relief. Again, on the basis of the brief I have been given, debt relief for Tanzania is being held up because of problems with ESAF. Relief for Nicaragua, one of the lowest income, heaviest indebted countries in the world, was also being held up because of problems with ESAF before Hurricane Mitch struck. The IMF refuses to provide the resources to cover its contribution to HIPC. It is calling for donations from countries, including Ireland, to cover the cost. I want the Minister to confirm that he will be urging the IMF to use more of its own resources in the implementation of its programmes.</P>
    <P>There have been reviews of ESAF and the Minister has referred to them, particularly the external review. The internal review focused on progress towards achieving macro economic targets. The results were disappointing for the IMF. Targets to reduce budget deficits or raise government revenue were not reached. There was no real overall change in inflation levels and economic growth rates remained lower than the average for developing countries. In the light of the poor results for the individual economies of the countries to which the programmes were applied and in the light of the high breakdown levels, it seems a little stubborn of the IMF to continue insisting that these programmes are effective when clearly they are not.</P>
    <P>The external review looked at two areas of great concern &ndash; social impact and the democracy or ownership of the programmes. It took a case study approach covering Uganda, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Mali, Cote d'Ivoire, Bolivia, Vietnam and Bangladesh. The review criticised the IMF for failing to take the social impact into account in designing ESAF programmes. It also criticised the fund for mistakes in the design of their programmes and the mistakes were listed on a country by country basis. According to the brief to which I referred, in Malawi, huge price rises resulted in halving the real wages of agricultural workers &ndash; a group already living in poverty. In Cote d'Ivoire, urban informal sector workers faced huge losses as devaluation squeezed consumers' incomes. In Zambia, the wrong sequencing of reform led to a credit crunch in the private sector and delayed the emergence of rural food markets when maize marketing was privatised. This destroyed the livelihood of the maize producers in remote areas. In Zimbabwe, mistakes in the order in which policies were introduced led to reductions in <i>per capita</i> expenditure on health and education. In Uganda, which is put forward <Col N="689" /> as a success story by the IMF, growth was restored and the economy stabilised but the benefits of growth were mainly in urban areas &ndash; 90 per of Ugandans live in rural areas.</P>
    <P>This external review seriously calls into question the effectiveness of ESAF programmes at a time when the Irish Government is deciding to reverse the decision made by the Rainbow Coalition Government in 1996 and fund the ESAF programmes. The external review recommended that the IMF should work with the World Bank in identifying in advance which groups may lose out through ESAF programmes. It stated that this would provide a basis for monitoring the impact of ESAF and also for putting safety nets in place. However, there is no sign that these recommendations are being taken on board.</P>
    <P>On the ownership or democracy issue, the external review is highly critical of the manner in which the IMF operates in borrowing countries. In particular, the report is critical of the inflexibility in negotiation. Standard programme drafts are imported from Washington and one fills in the spaces for individual countries. It is not enough to develop the economies of Third World countries. Democracy is a fragile flower and it must be encouraged also. Economic reconstruction programmes which undermine democracy are short-sighted in concept and doomed to failure if they undermine the better sectors of society who are committed to the development of the country. There is an insensitivity to domestic and political constraints; the IMF does not have a good image in many of these countries.</P>
    <P>I know we can argue that wilful waste makes woeful want. If one wants to build cathedrals in the jungle and dual carriageways to airports which never attract traffic and if one wants to carry on in an imperial style in countries where so many people live below the poverty line and where children die of hunger, nobody can stand over that. However, there must be an attempt at balance. Simply by throwing in their hand the policy makers in the Departments of Finance and Foreign Affairs are not helping. Frankly, if the Minister dropped his ESAF proposals in this Bill and proceeded with the rest of the Bill, he would have far more credibility the next time he goes to Washington and argues the case at the IMF. There is far more moral force in refusing to join the club because of the failure of the ESAF programme and arguing for its reform or substitution than the course adopted by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The IMF has given some response to the two reviews to which I referred. First, the general design of programmes has been changed but this seems to be more apparent than real. Work has also started with the World Bank in identifying the social groups likely to lose out when ESAF programmes are applied. This is being done by a number of pilot studies in five or six countries. Any reform or change of direction is welcome in respect of programmes which quite clearly are not working. However, the change is not radical enough and certainly does not justify the Govern<Col N="690" /> ment's change of decision to go ahead and fund the programmes.</P>
    <P>While there are many good provisions in the Bill which I welcome and while I approve of the fact that the Government will now dedicate funds directly to debt reduction as part of its package of development programmes, the question of ESAF must be looked at again. Ireland will lose its independent voice as a result of this Bill. It will not be possible to make the case against, the next time the Minister has discussions at IMF level in Washington.</P>
    <P>My party will be voting against the Bill even though we approve of a great deal in it, because we do not approve of the principles which underpin the decision on ESAF. We will vote against the Bill on Second Stage and seek to amend the Bill on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann declines to give the Bill a second reading on the ground that, while urgent measures need to be taken to address debt relief, the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF) cannot be supported on its present form and on the ground that the Bill's proposal to fund ESAF is a direct contradiction of Fianna Fáil's pre-election commitment to continue to withhold funds from ESAF pending reform of the International Monetary Fund.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>My party will also oppose the Bill on Second Stage, largely, though not entirely, because of the ESAF content. Like Deputy Noonan and the Minister, I welcome the broadening of our definition of Third World aid, which has taken place relatively gradually in the past ten or 15 years. We have moved some distance from the &ldquo;black babies&rdquo; collections of the 1960s and earlier when money was provided, in Ireland's case, to largely religious based missionaries for the relief of poverty.</P>
      <P>The contribution of Irish NGOs such as Trócaire, Concern and GOAL in looking to assist sustainable development in the Third World is something of which we are all conscious and which I compliment without hesitation. What is striking about Irish society is that even in the 1980s, 1970s and before, when we were not as flush as we are now, when the Exchequer was not as abundant, Irish people had, and still have, a singular commitment to assisting people who are dramatically less well off.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Noonan and the thrust of the Minister's speech that this is not just a moral responsibility and that we are not just making ourselves feel better because we give a few pennies, pounds or euros. It is also about political responsibility and duty. We have a responsibility to assist countries in sub-Saharan Africa which are not just poorer, but dramatically poorer than us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="691" /> When my party entered Government in 1992 in coalition with the Minister's party, our percentage of ODA had been decreasing gradually throughout the 1980s. I do not want to make a big deal of that because, as the Minister knows, we had to cut back on many social services during a difficult readjustment period of our own in the late 1980s. We made a specific and deliberate choice at that stage that we would, by conscious and measured moves in the following ten years look to advancing towards the UN target of 0.7 per cent of GNP. The record over the four or five years we spent in Government speaks for itself &ndash; we went from 0.2 per cent in 1993 to 0.31 per cent in 1997.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows this was largely supported by Fianna Fáil, with whom we were in Government for some of that time. Prior to the 1997 general election, the then leader of Fianna Fáil, the Taoiseach, gave a specific commitment that during the period up to 2002 the current Government would increase Ireland's contribution in ODA to 0.45 per cent of GNP. A move in this direction was made in the 1998 budget. This is relevant to the Bill as we are now talking about a different situation. Last autumn the Government changed its policy in a move which seems to have been deliberately orchestrated within the Department of Finance rather than the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>
    <P>It appears the Department of Finance decided that with improved economic growth, to measure our contribution purely in terms of the percentage of GNP would involve a cash increase of a variety which it regarded as unaffordable, or at least undesirable. This ignores the simple, persuasive logic of the UN target in the first place. The UN target is specifically intended to measure our contribution of ODA and that of other countries against our capacity to afford it. Surely it makes perfect sense that at a time when we can clearly afford to make a greater contribution we should do so.</P>
    <P>It is not just a matter of flinging money at the problem. In 1994, when the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, was in the Department of Foreign Affairs, we produced a plan which was intended to set out in clear terms how money would be spent as we increased our percentage contribution over the years. There has been a growing consensus in Ireland, among the NGOs, but shared by the Department of Foreign Affairs, on the way we should spend money &ndash; a consensus that we should target money in a particular way towards sustainable development but towards projects in the health and education areas which help people to help themselves, as Deputy Noonan said earlier.</P>
    <P>It is also true that over 20 years or more, Ireland has sought to aid six, seven and now eight countries, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa where projects have become bedded down and relationships with indigenous Governments have improved. Sadly, it is also true that some of the <Col N="692" /> donee countries, for example, Zambia, Tanzania and Mozambique, have during the period of our aid become less well off than they previously were.</P>
    <P>I do not understand this shift. We know what happened quite shamefully &ndash; I do not want to be too rhetorical about it, but it was shameful &ndash; in the Estimates last year. When the Estimates were published, they showed under some headings, for example, disaster relief, a specific drop in Ireland's contribution. When one takes into account the wages content of Ireland's contribution to the Third World, a significant drop was provided for in last year's Estimate. The Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, subsequently found herself a fig leaf and looked for cash limits and contributions to be spread over the next three years.</P>
    <P>However, the bald reality is that none the less, over the next three years if those commitments are met &ndash; and it is a big if &ndash; Ireland's contribution as a percentage of our GNP will be reduced from the current figure of just over 0.33 per cent to perhaps as low as 0.22 per cent or 0.23 per cent, depending on economic growth in the meantime. That is a policy for which the Government has no mandate and for which there is no logical or reasonable explanation whatsoever.</P>
    <P>As the Minister knows only too well, there was a £750 million budget surplus last year, or rather higher than that if one discounts some of the figures. It was a large surplus by any standards and the Minister has budgeted for a similar surplus this year. Nobody could conceivably argue that it would have any impact on the economy if we were to plan for substantially increasing our level of contribution to ODA by £40 or £50 million. I am convinced, as I am sure most in this House are, that such a use of the surplus moneys available to us would have the endorsement and support of the people. It is bewildering that there has been a shift to cash limits rather than the &ldquo;pay according to our means&rdquo; approach that previously dominated.</P>
    <P>I make these points about the overseas development aid budget because the choices we are making here today must be put in that context. It is appropriate that we should make some contribution towards debt relief and encourage others to make progress in cancelling debt but I am opposed to the ESAF programme for various reasons, many of which have been set out already by Deputy Noonan. I will repeat some but not all of those.</P>
    <P>It is worth recalling that in 1996 the then Minister, Deputy Quinn, my party leader, was asked to approve a subscription to ESAF and declined to do so for a number of specified reasons I can deal with later. It is also interesting to note that prior to the 1997 general election, Oxfam carried out a survey of political parties and inquired as to their attitude towards ESAF. The Fianna Fáil response was that it would continue to withhold funds from ESAF pending reform of the IMF which they believed was very important as a pol<Col N="693" /> icy issue. The response from the Progressive Democrats, and I do not want to be snide about this, is a little difficult to decipher but it at least said that the biggest problem so far as IMF policies are concerned is that it is very commercially orientated and some of the countries involved will never be able to meet some of the criteria laid down, at least not in the foreseeable future. By any standards the two Government parties, and certainly Fianna Fáil, gave unequivocal commitments before the 1997 budget that they would continue to withhold funding from ESAF pending compliance with certain conditions which they specified, though not in great detail. The Minister did not allude to that commitment in his contribution today and we can only guess whether he considers that the conditions Fianna Fáil had in mind at the time have been met.</P>
    <P>It is instructive to examine the conditions and principles set out by the Minister and his colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, last September which the Minister outlined in his contribution today. Some of them bear some examination. The first principle the Minister set out was that Ireland would emphasise the need for definitions of debt sustainability to take human as well as economic development into account. This is one of the major problems with ESAF in that the programmes implemented under ESAF are determined by macroeconomic criteria. The IMF comes in and examines budget deficits, trade balance and, to some extent, the debt burden of a country and implements a programme accordingly. It does not examine the nature of the economy generally. There is much evidence that it has not implemented programmes particular to the needs of individual countries.</P>
    <P>The external review to which Deputy Noonan referred examines case studies in fascinating detail and outlines the specific mistakes that were made in dealing with economies which at best can be termed economies in transition and, at worst, economies where there is neither a free nor controlled market. In any case it is clear that in determining whether an ESAF programme will come into place and debt relief provided, using the simple macroeconomic criteria the IMF is inclined to use has not been effective.</P>
    <P>Both Ministers emphasised that the IMF should take into account the social impact of its policies but the reality is that in the majority of cases there is little evidence that the IMF has done that. That is highlighted in both the external and internal reviews and, to some extent, in the responses to both those reviews. We need only look at Mozambique, one of the donee countries with which we have a particular relationship. I know the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, visited Mozambique last week and I would be interested to hear her reflections on her visit. In Mozambique, the IMF required &ndash; and this is a fairly standard requirement &ndash; that the state should divest itself of ownership of most of the industry in the country. A predictable result of that was that between 50,000 and 100,000 jobs <Col N="694" /> were lost at a time when private industry was not interested in taking up the slack and not capable of providing jobs for those people. The reality is that when one is dealing with countries such as Mozambique, which is ravaged by a war carried on and financed by a much wealthier and bigger neighbour and which has made a painful transition from colonialism through a measure of the command economy, one cannot simply impose the neo-liberal economic model, which seems to be so beloved of the economists who work in the IMF, and develop overnight an entrepreneurship with people capable of taking up the slack which inevitably arises when the rules previously in vogue are dismantled. There are predictable consequences from eliminating export taxes and privatising existing companies, for example, and a safety net has to be provided which in most cases has not been provided. That must be done in a way that is sustainable and that ameliorates the predictable negative social impact of those policies.</P>
    <P>I read some press reports last week that Uganda is being held up as the good boy of the class, the ideal case in terms of a country that has benefited from an ESAF programme. I read this morning the external evaluation of the ESAF programme in Uganda and while it is true that there have been some positive impacts, there have also been unintended negative impacts that inevitably contribute to destabilising the country both economically and politically. In Uganda, for example, there has been a disproportionate benefit to the small urban areas of the country where incomes are up by approximately 60 per cent. On the other hand, in the remaining 90 per cent of the country which is rural, incomes over that period increased by approximately 4 per cent. In a country which is largely rural, that is causing a destabilisation which inevitably will have political effects. We cannot ignore those political effects because countries like Uganda have a limited democratic tradition. Sometimes perfectly good governments, by objective or European standards, hold on by their fingertips. Undermining civil society in this way and causing disproportionate benefit and disadvantage to individual parts of society inevitably has an effect which makes it difficult for those governments to cope.</P>
    <P>The issue of ownership is well illustrated by the case of Uganda. There is a strong feeling in countries that have had ESAF programmes that these are being imposed by an alien orthodoxy from abroad. The IMF's image in the Third World is far more negative than that of the World Bank or individual donor countries, and the reason for this is simple. It is the social consequences of many of the programmes but it is also the way in which they go about it. There seems to be a profound feeling that the democratic processes, such as they are in many of these countries, are being completely bypassed and that economists, financiers or bankers arrive in from Washington, deal with the ministry of foreign affairs in a local hotel and come up with a plan with which parliamen<Col N="695" /> tarians and individuals who will be responsible for implementing the programme have no sense of identification or ownership.</P>
    <P>I know efforts have been made to improve consultation in advance of putting programmes in place but the reality is that they have not succeeded. Even in those few cases where it has been attempted in a serious way the IMF has not successfully managed to do the job.</P>
    <P>With reference to the conditions set out by the two Ministers last September and negotiated with some of the NGOs in Ireland, the Minister for Finance pledged to continue to call on the IMF to maximise the use of its own resources. There is a growing view that the IMF should use its own resources. There is also a view that it should dispose of its considerable stocks of gold which are estimated to be worth £40 billion. It is surprising that the IMF is only prepared to do this in particular circumstances. It seems to be willing to contemplate it in the case of Russia and, perhaps, Brazil but not in the case of ESAF or HIPC countries.</P>
    <P>That tells us something about the IMF which we probably always suspected. It has responsibility for maintaining the international economic order &ndash; we have an interest in that so I will not criticise it in that regard &ndash; but its interest in debt relief for Third World countries, much less in development for Third World countries, is a good deal less pronounced. There are people in the IMF who will happily admit that the IMF is not the appropriate body to be involved in this exercise and that we should look to the World Bank or other multilateral institutions to do the job. I am not convinced that the IMF is able to do the job effectively.</P>
    <P>I was impressed by the initiative taken by Chancellor Schröder in Cologne a few weeks ago. I read about it in the syndicated article which appeared under his name in the <i>Financial Times</i> last week. There is a clear shift in German policy which is important, given that Germany is a major contributor country. The Chancellor speaks in the article about the need to apply the HIPC initiative to countries that observe the principles of the welfare state and the rule of law and which are carrying out reform programmes in collaboration with the World Bank and the IMF. He speaks about structural and social reforms in, for example, developing primary health care and an efficient education system as well the necessary micro and macro economic adjustments. In exceptional cases, he says, the powers should consider total cancellation of commercial credits and loans.</P>
    <P>The article uses tentative language and contains a degree of conditionality. It is, perhaps, right that it should. However, the initiative being taken by Chancellor Schröder, for which he will find a good deal of support, is positive and sets out a way to progress things. We need to take account of the social side of the problem and to encourage banks and other commercial lenders to <Col N="696" /> cancel debt. More importantly, we must consider conditionality above and beyond economic conditionality.</P>
    <P>This country has taken the view in the last 15 years that we should take account of the rule of law in many of these countries and that we cannot simply discount the human rights record of countries when we consider providing them with aid. That is the correct policy. Sometimes aid can have the perverse effect of sustaining in power governments which oppress their people. That is an unintended effect of aid which we should do everything possible to avoid. Linkage with the rule of law, political reform, reform of civil society and respect for human rights is a good policy which I support. I also agree that we should seek structural reform of economies as well but we must do so in a way that is sensitive to its social cost.</P>
    <P>This is the first time the European Union has asked Ireland to contribute to an EU initiative of this type. The proposal is that we should extend or guarantee a line of credit for $50 million or 40 million euro which will come into play in the event of Brazil defaulting on its agreement with the IMF. I understood, before Christmas, that the IMF package was largely intended to sustain the value of the real. The currency has since been devalued and subsequently allowed to float with the usual consequences.</P>
    <P>An objective observer of conditions in Brazil prior to devaluation would have taken the view that this was likely to happen. It would not be difficult to be cynical about the motivation of US creditors and, to some extent, of the IMF in providing this facility and seeking to shore up the real at its then value. However, the real has been substantially devalued so the purpose of the IMF plan has been removed.</P>
    <P>I am anxious to hear the Minister's explanation of why we are proceeding with this facility. The circumstances have changed so what is its purpose? Are we still seeking to maintain the real at a particular exchange rate? Are we trying to give comfort to the Brazilian Government or are we simply sending a signal lest the contagion spread, as perhaps it might, to China or the Far East that IMF assistance will be given to maintain the value of currencies or to stem the contagion of international financial crises?</P>
    <P>How is it being organised? Is it being done within the structures of CFSP? Is it part of the Union's foreign policy to provide assistance through IMF funded packages of this nature? This is a precedent. Where will it stop? Will we be asked in a few months to contribute towards relieving the indebtedness of Russia? The IMF is considering&mdash;</P>

      <P>If we are being asked to do that, we need to know why, within which framework the decision making is happening and what the conditionality is. We also need to know whether the European Union will undertake this type of project in future.</P>
      <P>I wish to make some general remarks about the IMF. I do not doubt the need for a body such as the IMF. However, looking at some of its actions in the last two or three years, one could be forgiven for commenting that the Friedman template of the 1970s and 1980s is getting a little stale and that the IMF should wake up to that fact.</P>
      <P>South-east Asia was the good boy of the class but ultimately it did not work for reasons related, for example, to the indebtedness of the banking sector. That should have been a reasonable area for the IMF to monitor but it chose not to do that. It contented itself with the usual slogans about freedom of international capital markets, trade and so forth and allowed those countries to achieve a level of indebtedness and credit extension in their banking sectors which any objective observer would have considered unsustainable. However, the IMF clearly did not regard that to be within its remit. Liberalisation, not regulation, was its watchword. One must wonder if that is a sufficient remit for the IMF. Perhaps it should acquire a few more strings to its bow.</P>
      <P>The same applies to Russia, although I sympathise with anybody who might try to come to grips with what is happening there. I wonder about the IMF's current policy in Russia. It is contemplating making further loans to Russia to allow it to pay off its loans to the IMF. One must wonder about the good sense of that approach at a time when civil society and social provision in Russia are collapsing.</P>
      <P>I do not want to be unduly critical. It is a good that Ireland is getting involved in assisting debt relief. I commend the measure taken by Ireland in providing bilateral assistance to Mozambique and Tanzania at a time when those countries clearly need it. That is the way forward. We should seek to provide assistance, including debt relief assistance, to countries with which we have developed a particular relationship rather than contributing to the IMF ESAF programmes.</P>
      <P>The Minister argues that in order to encourage reform, we must become involved, attend the meetings in Washington and, by virtue of our financial contribution, advocate a certain course of action. Those of us who take the contrary view claim that until such time as there is reform we should not engage in such a process. Until there is reform, even for such relatively small amounts of money, especially in the context of this Government's approach to overseas development aid, there is a better way to use the money, through bilateral aid with those countries with which we have established a relationship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My party will oppose the Bill on Second Stage. I encourage the Minister to think again about the ESAF contribution element. Fianna Fáil gave a <Col N="698" /> worthy commitment before the 1997 general election and I see no reason it should abandon that commitment.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bretton Woods Agreements (Amendment) Bill and the opportunity to contribute. I welcome the debt relief package, originally announced by the Ministers for Finance and Foreign Affairs in September 1998. The package will amount to £31.5 million over 12 years, £17 million of which will be spent in 1999. Also, some £15 million is provided for multilateral debt relief, £9.5 million of which has been committed to Mozambique and Tanzania. The main concern is the £7 million being provided to the IMF under the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility. I am sure every Deputy has been briefed by the Debt and Development Coalition on its concerns about ESAF. It is concerned that as well as having the money included in the Bill there is also the question of further payments by the Minister for Finance to the IMF and the World Bank without the agreement of the Oireachtas. It is concerned that there may be no provision for accountability by the Minister to the Dáil and Seanad on policies pursued by Ireland with the IMF and the World Bank. Its point concerning harsh conditions requires an answer from the Minister. If low interest loans are made available to a developing country for education and health programmes and the local industry collapses, resulting in unemployment, these areas have to be considered. Is it necessary to impose these conditions? I do not believe they should be imposed. It is not the solution to include these conditions in legislation.</P>
      <P>The Bill gives a guarantee to the Central Bank against any losses under the settlement with the Bank of Brazil. From my information about Brazil, the experts say it is inconceivable to ask Brazil to take out loans based on these conditions. It may well be that a new Bretton Woods Agreement will have to be drawn up to help many of the developing countries who have debt problems. It is difficult to envisage debt being used by powerful countries to make third countries even poorer. Will the Minister look at the harsh conditions laid down when funding is provided to ESAF?</P>
      <P>The Bill allows the Minister for Finance to make further payments to the IMF. Will the Minister clarify the reason this is included in the Bill. One of the issues raised by the Debt and Development Coalition was the question of fair trade in coffee and bananas. It is very cruel treatment for those in developing countries to be told these goods should be produced, but because the tariffs are so high it is virtually impossible to secure outlets for those goods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="699" /> Another issue raised at the Foreign Affairs Committee was the giving of funding to countries which may be using it for arms provision and an arms struggle. This has been alleged by John O'Shea of GOAL in relation to the Government of Rwanda. He has said repeatedly that we should be very careful about funding for Rwanda. He said this should be investigated and that NGOs should be assisted in a more practical way rather than giving funding to a Government. The Debt and Development Coalition has asked why the £7 million could not be given to Irish Aid.</P>
    <P>In the last Government I was a member of the development co-operation committee, a sub-committee of the Foreign Affairs Committee. It was our privilege to visit countries particularly Tanzania, where the Irish Aid programme has been successful. Those who work on the ground in areas such as Tanzania are keen that the NGOs would be supported. The NGOs there work with the local people in difficult circumstances where access to towns is very difficult because in some cases there are no roads. They have made a voluntary commitment to work there for many years. I hope, through the Departments of Finance and Foreign Affairs, that more focus will be given to the needs of NGOs. This is an important issue in terms of the way in which loans are given to developing countries.</P>
    <P>Five years ago I observed elections in Lesotho where elections had not been held for 15 years. The Irish Aid programme is very effective in that country. Roads to the polling stations did not exist. The polling stations were in the open air. It is a tribute to the people living in those circumstances that they were prepared to fight for the right to vote and to form long queues for the purpose of voting when elections had been cancelled for up to 15 years. In Lesotho and other third countries, because of military takeovers or where dictators have cancelled elections, there is a great spirit to continue with the democratic process.</P>
    <P>Like other Deputies I welcome the bilateral aid relief for Mozambique and Tanzania which has been most effective. It is an important element in helping developing countries. In the past many Ministers in Fianna Fáil Governments called for the once off cancellation of debt in certain circumstances. We have to look at situations where that could be done and I hope the Minister will do that. Just as there was a deferral in 1996 of the ESAF programme, this matter should be continually kept under review so that a new Bretton Woods Agreement would target funding to particular countries. I hope the Minister will take these matters on board when he is replying.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill because I am concerned about particular aspects of it. It is a Bill which gives effect to the major debt relief package announced by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Finance on 16 September 1998. As other speakers have mentioned, the Bill allows for £50 <Col N="700" /> million in multilateral debt relief and £9.5 million in bilateral debt relief. It also involves the provision of £7 million for the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility of the IMF.</P>
      <P>Ireland traditionally played an important role as a neutral country in the promotion of peace, justice and basic human rights throughout the world, particularly in the Third World. That is a tradition of which we can be proud. We were never a colonial power and we have a strong missionary tradition. Irish nuns and priests went to all parts of the world to bring humanitarian relief to the poorest of the poor. Their work, and the work of the lay people involved in the various agencies, is largely understated and unrecognised. This debate raises the issue of whether there should be a moral element in Irish foreign policy or in foreign policy in general. I would be of the view that there should, and most Irish people would accept that.</P>
      <P>One of the major problems in the Third World is the crippling world debt. In this regard I give my full support to the Jubilee 2000 signature campaign of the Debt and Development Coalition Ireland for the G7 countries to cancel the backlog of unpayable debt of the world's poorest countries by 2000. It is a laudable objective and I hope some progress will be made, even in debating that proposal.</P>
      <P>This brings me to the section of the Bill which commits us to contributing to the IMF's debt relief agency, the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility. I would like to ask the Minister why this proposal is before us at this stage. Previous Governments have rejected this pending the reform of ESAF in its administration, the conditions attached and its negative impact on the people of the Third World countries involved. The Minister has accepted the need for reform of ESAF. He suggests that ownership issues, the role of civil society and social impact will be given greater consideration in the future design, planning and implementation stages of ESAF programmes. These are only proposed changes. I suggest that the provisions in relation to ESAF are worrying and a decision in this regard is premature.</P>
      <P>Why does the Minister feel we must contribute to ESAF at this time? I would like a detailed reply to that question. It is not out of a sense of embarrassment in relation to other participating countries &ndash; we are capable of making our own decisions with regard to foreign policy when it comes to an issue like this. I would like a more satisfactory explanation as to why we are proposing to participate in ESAF at this time.</P>
      <P>In return for loans, the country often has to put in place draconian economic policies. The Justice and Development Office of the Irish Missionary Union said in a recent statement:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These result in cuts in basic services, causing drops in primary school enrolment, and rising malnutrition, over-speedy removal of protective trade barriers leading to the collapse of local industry, privatisation and cuts in public <Col N="701" /> employment which lead to thousands of workers losing their jobs with no alternative employment available. ESAF programmes undermine democracy. They are designed by the IMF and imposed on borrowing countries. Elected parliaments are totally by-passed and have no say in the economic and social policies to be implemented.</P>
    <P>Is this the type of help which we want to give these countries? In the end it will hurt the poorest of the poor the most. That is not the type of help we should be giving.  </P>
    <P>In addition, the Bill gives the Minister the power to make further money available to the IMF and World Bank beyond that outlined already without the sanction of the Oireachtas. I would like to hear the Minister's view on that and his proposals for greater accountability in relation to this expenditure. There is also no provision in the Bill which would make the Minister accountable to the Oireachtas on policies pursued by Ireland within the IMF and the World Bank. In that regard I suggest that ongoing information should be given to the House about these matters. I accept that the Committee on Foreign Affairs is very active and would have a role to play in this area but we need to be clear as to the accountability mechanisms and information mechanisms put in place to inform Members of the House about the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Other speakers have mentioned the role of overseas development assistance. There is no doubt that Irish relief agencies get stuck in in these developing countries, particularly where there is famine and civil war. There is no doubt that giving money directly to some of these agencies is the best way to ensure that the money gets to the poorest of the poor. Many of these relief agencies have first hand knowledge of the situation on the ground and they could play an enormous role in the development of Irish foreign policy. We could bring our experience there to the other international institutions in which we are involved.</P>
    <P>I should not advocate that the money be given to overseas development assistance budgets. We have to contribute to debt relief but I am not sure the IMF is the forum to do that. I ask the Minister to look at this provision on Committee Stage and give a satisfactory explanation of these provisions.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's Second Stage speech. He outlined comprehensively the major role Ireland is playing on these issues. I welcome the objectives laid out. We have received many representations about ESAF from those directly involved and we owe them an explanation as to why this provision is being brought forward at this time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate on this Bill shows the stupidity of the blanket rule of limiting interventions to 20 minutes. There are Members who could do with more time and who could usefully use it to debunk the silly soundbites in the rep<Col N="702" /> resentations we have received about the Bill, some of which were trotted out again by Deputy Haughey. Let me give an example.</P>
      <P>The representations we have received from the Irish Missionary Union, the Debt and Development Coalition and various religious orders are well done. They have a valid point of view to put, but they have perpetrated some howlers. It is stated that there is no provision for accountability from the Minister for Finance to the Oireachtas on policies pursued by Ireland within the IMF and World Bank. Ministers are accountable to the House for everything they do under legislation. If they do not volunteer an account, the House is entitled to demand it. If there is no accountability, it is because Members have not demanded it. It is not true that the process of legislation does not impose it.</P>
      <P>There is concern that the Bill allows the Minister for Finance to make further payments to the IMF and World Bank beyond those detailed in the Bill without authorisation by the Oireachtas. It is disappointing that a Member should give credence to that statement. If Ministers do not have authority to do something specific, they cannot do it.</P>
      <P>We were informed before Christmas &ndash; it is probably not politically correct to say this but somebody has to say it &ndash; that there was a conspiracy on the Government side to rush this Bill through without debate. On the appropriate day I would be as eloquent as anybody else in accusing the Government of a conspiracy but only where it is real. It demeans the case to make a point such as that.</P>
      <P>We should reflect on the origins of the debt problem about which we have not heard much. They are complex. One of the main reasons for the chronic debt problem of underdeveloped countries is that some parts of the world started to develop earlier than others. This created a disjunction between the development process and trade and has meant that the world trade pattern has been skewed against a big section of the world's population, even countries which are potentially rich, well endowed and can feed themselves. The skewing of the trade pattern has created a major problem for them. They obtain only the most basic prices for their products and their avenues of development have been limited, not just for decades but for generations. They have yet to recover.</P>
      <P>Another problem is that consistently, up to and including the last round of world trade talks, the developed world has done virtually nothing to skew the trade pattern in favour of developing countries. That is disappointing and there is little evidence that the problem will be dealt with in a fundamental way in the next round of world trade talks. If it is not dealt with, developing countries will continue to face a major debt problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They are not the only reasons for the debt problem. There are increasing expectations in relation to living standards. There is pressure on the Governments of developing countries, from <Col N="703" /> within and without, to conform and to do the things that will help in the short-term to drive up living standards. We should know what is involved. The principal party in Government did things in 1977 which are still being mirrored in Government policies in developing countries. It created single-handedly an enormous debt problem for us between 1977 and 1981. In addition, there are adverse natural conditions, be they climatic or demographic, which leave many developing countries vulnerable to major episodes. Natural phenomena, for example volcanoes, occur frequently.</P>
    <P>Many of the most heavily indebted countries have the most appallingly bad record of not just bad but stupid economic management and, in others, rampant, rife, large-scale corruption in Government. There is no point dodging the issue. There are countries which are submerged in debt with major problems in funding health and education programmes which are spending substantial proportions of GNP on arms. Some believe they have no option but to do this as they are under immediate threat from their neighbours but there are others which like to see themselves as a threat to their neighbours.</P>
    <P>It is fashionable to kick the IMF but it has given bad advice. Deputy McDowell mentioned the 1970s template which is part of IMF culture but of less relevance now. IMF advice to newly independent states of central and eastern Europe was wrong. It was textbook advice to countries not in textbook situations which only made things worse.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Part L of the building regulations, which applies to the design and construction of new buildings and the reconstruction of existing buildings, sets out the legal requirements to be observed in the conservation of fuel and energy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Technical Guidance Document L, which accompanies the regulations, provides guidance on the thermal performance standards for walls independent of the materials used. The guidance also deals with the means of applying insulation <Col N="704" /> and selecting the thickness of insulation using material with various thermal properties.</P>
    <P>The building regulations do not in themselves place a restriction on the use of any particular method of construction or product, including hollow concrete blocks, provided the performance requirements of the building regulations are met. My Department is initiating a review of the insulation requirements of Technical Guidance Document L having regard to Ireland's obligations to limit greenhouse gas emissions under the Kyoto Protocol of 1997. It is too early to say definitively at this stage whether it will be possible for hollow blocks, suitably insulated, to continue in use when the revised Technical Guidance Document L is fully operative.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Why is this issue being taken by the Minister and not the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy? Why has the Department of the Environment and Local Government not prohibited the use of nine inch hollow blocks for construction when they are regarded as providing a deficient form of insulation in all new homes? Why are no local authority houses built using this methodology, and why are very few houses throughout the United Kingdom &ndash; which has a similar environment to ours &ndash; being built with this methodology? Why are no houses outside the Dublin area built according to this method? Does the Minister accept the advice of his Department on this issue?</P>

      <P>I do not know to what advice the Deputy is referring. I am not aware of advice from the Department on this specific matter. I told the Deputy that this practice would be reviewed in light of the technical documents, and it will be. If I get advice at that stage I will take it into consideration.</P>
      <P>As to the number of &ldquo;why&rdquo; questions the Deputy addressed to me, such as why this is not used for local authority housing or houses outside Dublin, that is a matter for individual contractors. I am not sure if the Deputy is insinuating there is a particular fault in the use of nine inch hollow blocks. The standards to which the local authorities build their houses arise from decisions made by those local authorities. Contractors in Dublin or outside can base their judgments on that. The building regulations place no restriction on a particular method of construction, but obviously, in light of the Kyoto Protocol and the higher standards that will be necessary&mdash;</P>

      <P>In addition, if the Deputy is advocating that manufacture of hollow blocks is discontinued, the implications of that will have to be looked at carefully. I am committed to increasing the insulation and thermal values in line with Kyoto, but there are manufacturers of hollow blocks who would be out of business. The method used by builders at present is quicker than building the solid block walls, and it would obviously take longer to build houses. Price problems would also be caused, and all of these things must be taken into consideration before a final decision is made.</P>

It is and will be part of the consultation taking place on the national strategy on greenhouse gas emissions. There is not any secret about that.</P>
      <P>On the technical guidance documents, there is a review process being done through a building regulations advisory body under the Department's auspices. That body advises me and as a result changes are made. I have clearly signalled to that body the need to consider and to give due notice to everyone of increased insulation standards. For the Deputy's information, the deadline for the review process is the end of 1999.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been many calls to Ministers over the years to declare housing emergencies or crises. Such a declaration would achieve little or nothing in terms of a response to the current situation. I am not denying that there are problems in the housing area. However, the Government has taken a range of actions since its appointment and the priority at this stage remains action rather than declarations.</P>
      <P>Housing output in 1998 reached a new record level for the fourth successive year with more than 41,500 new houses and apartments completed. The indications for a further increase in output in 1999 are positive. Increasing the supply of housing remains the key element of the Government's housing policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Social housing needs are addressed by the local authority housing programme and through a range of complementary measures funded by my Department. The local authority housing programme for 1999 is being expanded to its highest level since 1986 with a capital provision of £230 million &ndash; an increase of £35 million or 18 per <Col N="709" /> cent on the 1998 provision. This will enable an expanded programme of 4,500 starts in 1999, up from 3,900 in 1998.</P>
    <P>I have recently called on local authorities to renew their efforts to respond to housing needs in their own areas by developing to full potential the range of social housing and voluntary housing measures now available to them to supplement their local authority housing programmes. The improvements introduced over the past year to the shared ownership scheme and to grant levels under the voluntary housing schemes will facilitate increased output under these measures.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State is reluctant to describe the present housing position as a crisis. Does he accept that since he took office house prices have increased by more than 60 per cent, more than 20,000 additional applicants have gone on the council waiting list, there has been a 50 per cent increase in private rents and a 500 per cent increase in the number of tenants evicted from private rented accommodation? If that is not a crisis, how much worse does it have to get before he considers it to be one? He did not comment in his reply about the establishment of a housing commission. Does he intend to establish one? Many of the voluntary organisations have called for its establishment and he indicated prior to Christmas that he was giving it some favourable consideration?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>

There has been a substantial increase in the demand for housing, but the supply of houses has not kept pace with that demand for them. As I explained here before and this has not been denied, I inherited this problem because there was no planning for the increase in the demand for houses, which was evident for four years before that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The housing output has increased to 41,500 and the final figure will be higher than that. That is the highest level of housing output we have ever achieved and I have every expectation we will achieve a higher output next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the great difficulties with which we are confronted is a lack of planning, developments at local authority level and the lack of availability of zoned land. Some land is zoned for development but is not serviced. We will not be able to tackle <Col N="710" /> this problem until substantially increased areas of zoned land is available for future housing needs. That will help to reduce the scarcity of building land which is driving up the price of houses and, consequently, housing rents. In addition to the action being taken by the Government, we must get co-operation at local authority level. We have allocated money to the local authorities in the major areas for all the schemes they were asked to submit which will help to service lands that have already been zoned. In some cases they have only enough land to meet the anticipated demand for houses for the next three years, but that is not adequate. We need to plan much further ahead for the availability of zoned serviced land. The Government is committed to trying to match the zoning of residential land with services. We cannot be accused by the Deputy or anyone else of failing to provide funds for services where the local authorities have sought them. We have met all their demands in the major areas. We are taking all the actions we can. We have tackled the Bord Pleanála problem and the staff at local authority level. The serviced land initiative will bring up to 100,000 sites for housing onstream over the next two years provided local authorities respond to the funding we have made available to them.</P>
    <P>Housing is a complex market. It is gone out of balance. It was out of balance when we came into office, but we have taken a wide range of actions to bring back balance. There are bottlenecks in the way, one of the principle ones is the availability of zoned land. I have emphasised the social housing schemes that are available in the Department and I am encouraging local authorities to make better use of them. This would supplement the local authority houses we are funding, which have increased substantially. Adequate use is not being made of the voluntary housing schemes. There has been no shortage of funding up to this point in matching the needs of any scheme that has been put forward in the area of the capital assistance scheme or the rental subsidy scheme.</P>
    <P>I continually invite local authority members &ndash; some Members of this House are also local authority members &ndash; to be more active at local level in promoting greater usage of the voluntary social housing schemes because we are quite happy to fund them when they are put forward. We are confident we are taking action which will bring about a substantial increase in the output of houses, restore equilibrium to the market, and eliminate scarcity which is being taken advantage of through the increase in prices through the system, including the price of rents, as the Deputy said.</P>

      <P>The design and technical specification of all group schemes must comply with certain minimum standards determined by my Department and local authorities.

      <askee>Minister for the Environment and Local Government</askee>
      <Quest> if he will re-finance mortgages issued to home buyers through local authorities in order that those buyers can benefit from current interest rate levels rather than being obliged to pay interest at 12.5 per cent; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The interest rate of 12.5 per cent which applies to some local authority fixed rate house purchase loans issued before 31 October 1985 is related to the cost of long-term funds prevailing at the time the loans were advanced and is fixed for the life of the loan. While these fixed interest rate loans of up to 12.5 per cent look expensive today, they were, in fact, very favourable at the time they were advanced in the late 1970s and early 1980s, when commercial lending rates were up to 16.25 per cent. In addition, the loans involved in any case typically ranged from £9,000 to, at most, £16,000 and the average price of houses purchased with the aid of these loans was generally between £16,000 and £25,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cost of refinancing these mortgages today would be substantial and would have to be borne by the Exchequer, the Housing Finance Agency or the local authorities. However, any person with fixed rate local authority repayments for a house purchase loan or under a tenant purchase scheme is free to redeem without penalty and <Col N="715" /> refinance, if necessary, in the private sector at current interest rates. The removal of penalties for early redemption in the case of local authority fixed rate loans is a unique and valuable concession to local authority borrowers and I understand that approximately £50 million in local authority housing loans were redeemed last year. Persons with fixed rate loans from banks or building societies are, on the other hand, liable to pay a penalty of up to six months' interest if they want to redeem their loans. I do not consider that the introduction of any further subsidy to reduce the interest rates on pre-1986 loans would be warranted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TheresaAhearn" hpid="Mrs. T. Ahearn Mrs. T. Ahearn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. T. Ahearn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not just disappointed, I am devastated by the Minister of State's reply. Will he accept that when we speak about those mortgages we are talking about the lowest possible income earners who could have taken out a mortgage? We all admit that they would not have gotten a mortgage from any financial institution and that they got them from local authorities at a favourable rate at the time. However, the climate has changed and those on the most modest incomes are now paying the highest rate on their mortgages. Does the Minister of State think that is fair?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of the houses bought with these loans were bought for £15,000 or £20,000 and many of them are now worth over £100,000. The repayments on the loans for those houses are between £25 and £35 a week. When one puts it in that context, one sees it is not a huge burden. The people involved have a very valuable asset. Those who are benefiting from low interest loans today are paying £90,000, £100,000 or more for their houses. When one looks at the matter in proper perspective, it would not be right for taxpayers to have to carry the cost of reducing those loans.</P>
      <P>We have offered a facility to anyone who wants to refinance without incurring penalties. A substantial number of people have done so, and I am sure will continue to do so. It would be to the benefit of some people to do so while others are quite happy with their current situation. I do not think we could justify subsidising people who had the benefit of these loans and got houses, the capital value of which has increased in many cases by 500 per cent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TheresaAhearn" hpid="Mrs. T. Ahearn Mrs. T. Ahearn">

      <P>Will the Minister of State accept that we are dealing with a category of people who, but for their own initiative and determination to own their own houses, would have been the responsibility of the local authority, and housing them would have been a major cost to the State? Due to the fact they bought their own houses, they lost out on a very generous tenant purchase scheme and a grant which was available at that time, so they lost in every area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister of State is comparing those mortgage holders to people today who can afford <Col N="716" /> a £90,000 mortgage, I will have to bring him back to reality to a couple I know, who in 1979 borrowed&mdash;</P>

At the end of the day, they will have paid back four times the amount they borrowed to the Minister of State's Department. If they redeem the loan, which the Minister of State is suggesting and is putting forward as a good buy-out scheme, it would cost them £6,000. Will the Minister of State do something about this category of borrower, who have lost out on the double? Something should be done for them similar to what was done by the Department of Agriculture and Food for farmers who bought land from the Land Commission.

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>On 19 January the Government approved my proposals for the reform, modernisation and consolidation of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Acts and the parliamentary draftsman has commenced work on the drafting of a major revision Bill based on these proposals. My proposals represent the outcome of a major review of the planning code, which I initiated in August 1997 and which involved a very comprehensive consultation process, including a national planning convention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="718" /> In view of this and as I am anxious to publish the text of the Bill as quickly as possible, I do not intend to hold further consultations as this would only serve to delay publication of the Bill. I will, however, welcome views from the public, interest groups and public representatives on the Bill after it is published and I intend then to make arrangements to promote debate and the putting forward of views.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for that response. I assure him I do not propose that we should have a consultation period that would last anything like as long as, for example, the Dublin transportation consultation. However, I urge the Minister, when he publishes the Bill, to allow it to be in circulation for a reasonable length of time so that there can be a debate with concerned bodies, particularly local authorities, before the Bill is debated in this House. What period would the Minister consider reasonable between publication of the Bill and initiation of Second Stage debate in the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I took office on 26 June 1997 and I initiated the consultation process in August 1997. Submissions were made and on 27 November 1997 we had the national planning convention, at which the Deputy, or his representative, was present. That was the consultation period at that time and I do not think it was unduly long. It was very productive. We have spent recent months drafting as much as possible of the Bill. It will be a lengthy Bill because approximately half of it will include existing legislation, which we will not be changing, including eight planning Acts, four sets of European Communities Environmental Impact Assessment regulations and the planning Bill on architectural heritage. We also intend to consolidate this legislation. When the Deputies on the other side of the House and the interest groups see the Bill, I will be willing to agree with them a reasonable time for consideration and consultation. Second Stage will then be taken and amendments can be considered on Committee Stage. I am anxious to facilitate because of the importance of the legislation for everybody.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>If you hear me out, Sir, you will see the relevance of this. Does the Minister intend that the Bill be published and in circulation in advance of the local elections, where the issue of land rezoning is likely to be the subject matter of public debate? It would be helpful to <Col N="719" /> have the Bill published in advance so that the Government's intentions are known, the debate is facilitated and the likely future functions of members of local authorities regarding planning and zoning are known at that point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to have the Bill published as quickly as possible. Deputies on all sides of the House are aware of the timetables in the office of the Attorney General. The best estimate for publication is the middle of the year. I am advised by some that this is optimistic, however, the Government has made this priority legislation and it is being treated as such in the parliamentary draftsman's office. I do not know on what side of 11 June it will be published. I am mindful of your ruling, Sir, but if the Deputy looks at the speech I made on the opening of the planning convention in Dublin Castle on 27 November he will have an idea of the thrust of my proposals and what I wanted to be considered with regard development plans, which is basically more public participation at an earlier stage in the process.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy consults the article in the <i>Irish Independent</i> to which he refers he will find I did not say anything about groups. The activities of certain individuals was brought to my attention. More recently I heard of another case where attempts were made to blackmail developers to pay money to prevent the lodging <Col N="720" /> of objections. If somebody lodges a legitimate objection and a developer attempts, by means of financial inducements or otherwise, to get that person to withdraw the objection that amounts to corruption under the planning laws.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The difference is simple. When someone telephones a developer advising that an objection has been lodged but that if the developer makes it worth the caller's while the objection will be withdrawn it is clear to the developer who is doing the blackmailing. Both practices are equally reprehensible and I condemn both equally.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware from our sojourn on the Waste Management Bill that I have strong views on what can be perceived by the public to be an artificial division between environmental considerations, etc. That is something I wish to address in the Bill also.</P>

      <P>It is nice of the Minister to say that and there are many logical reasons why it should be so, but when he says it will be the middle of the year it will be after 11 June. In the interests of being helpful and constructive, when the Bill is published, will the Minister undertake to consult with the Opposition spokespersons about how we may handle it because it will be very important legislation. In the interests of all of us and of the local government system it would be useful to approach it as constructively as we can.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no difficulty with that. As soon as the Bill is finalised I will refer it directly to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment and Local Government to have that aspect discussed and perhaps agree a timetable. I ask Deputies on all sides of the House to be mindful that this is important legislation. It is designed to get rid of some of the bottlenecks in the planning system. I am anxious &ndash; others will verify this &ndash; to have it published before 11 June. I would like it to be published in May. It is such a signal Bill it is bound to have a good effect on the system and will be of benefit to the Government in the local elections.</P>

As to the other questions raised, we are in consultation with the Commission regularly on all these matters. In some cases we have to seek clarification from the Commission as there are sometimes different interpretations in Brussels as to the meaning of a directive. We have had some examples of that recently. Anything relating to ground water and drinking water supplies is taken very seriously and necessary action is taken as quickly as possible. There was much publicity recently about water supplies, much of which was highly inaccurate. There is a view that private group water schemes do not come within the ambit of the directive.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department consults housing authorities on their estimated capital requirements for local authority and social housing programmes embraced by subhead B.1 of the Department's Vote. The determination of the annual capital allocations to local authorities has regard to the information provided by authorities and to the provision made in the subhead for the programme. I expect to notify these allocations to local authorities next month.</P>
      <P>Advance allocation of funds is not made to local authorities in respect of two capital items included in the subhead, namely, the grants in respect of accommodation provided by voluntary bodies and mortgage allowances to tenants and tenant purchasers. In these two instances, payments are made to local authorities in response to claims submitted by them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Do the level and numbers of applicants on housing lists in the various local authorities form part of those consultations? If they do, will the Minister comment on how a decision is made on the overall allocation which results, for example, in my county, County Kildare, where there are 2,045 applicants on the housing list, with a prospect of 160 houses being built? This means that only one in 12 of those applicants has any chance of getting a new house this year. What is the process by which that figure is arrived at? To what extent can the Minister say that that constitutes consultation with local authorities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the method of allocating is as I have outlined and takes into account the assessment of needs which <Col N="725" /> is carried out every three years. The last assessment was carried out in 1996. The assessment of needs identified on that occasion are taken into account in making these allocations. In view of the substantial increase in the number of applicants for local authority houses in the intervening period, account is taken also of figures which each local authority was asked to supply which would be a rough estimate of the numbers on their waiting lists and would not be as detailed as the results of the comprehensive housing needs study which is carried out every three years. As I have announced here on a number of occasions, the next housing needs study is due to commence in March. The 1996 assessment and the most recent information provided by the local authorities are taken into account in arriving at a decision.</P>
      <P>The amount allocated also must relate to the claims which remain outstanding for work which has already been done and the on-going work. Added to that is funding in relation to the number of starts, which is what the Deputy is referring to, which may come on stream for payment during the financial year &ndash; in this case I assume we are talking about 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>That is all very interesting, especially all this business about starts, but it is all camouflage. Is the Minister aware that since the 1996, the problem has continued to increase? Is he aware that as things stand today there are more than 40,000 separate applications for housing by local authorities around the country? How many of those applications have any chance of being met this year or is the situation in Kildare, where one in 12 of 2,000 applicants has any chance of getting a house this year, typical of the country? If it is, what will the Minister do about it?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister seriously telling this House he is still basing his housing allocations on data which is three years out of date when there were 20,000 people fewer on the housing list and when couples, unlike now, could afford to buy a home of their own? Is he saying to us that he will get 6,000 allocations from the voluntary sector and from casual vacancies to make up his 10,000, which appears to me to be a totally unrealistic assessment? What was the total number of lettings last year?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of questions and I will be happy to answer them all. To return to the question of the 1996 assessment, because the Deputy is challenging the figures and his own colleague was the Minister in charge of housing in the Department at the time, the total number of households included in the 1996 assessment was 37,718.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been asked these questions about the social housing provision for 1998 and 1999. I stated that it was expected that 10,250 households would be accommodated under the social housing provision in 1999. It is to be made up as follows: local authority housing, 3,700; vacancies in existing stock, 3,900; voluntary housing/capital assistance scheme, 450; rental subsidy scheme, 500; improvement works in lieu and extensions to local authority housing, 300; mortgage allowance, 200; and shared ownership, 1,200. The total is 10,250 and the figure for 1998 was 9,252.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister now agree that this is a fair statement of the situation: as far as we can determine from local authorities around the country there are 40,000 individual applications for housing in rented accommodation by the local authorities? The Minister has just told <Col N="727" /> us that he expects that some 3,700 new units will be made available this year for renting by local authorities to those people on the housing lists. Therefore, the Minister is now telling us that less than one in ten applicants who are currently on the waiting lists will get a house this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has talked about all the other things, the social housing, the houses which become available from people moving out and the houses which become available from people giving back houses because they have bought houses elsewhere, but on the basic level there are 40,000 applicants for housing in rented accommodation by local authorities and the Minister stated that 3,700 of those will get a house to rent from a local authority this year. That is less than one in ten and the Minister has been trying to tell us he is doing everything possible about housing. He is meeting less than one-tenth of that problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised at Deputy Dukes. He is living in the past. He does not seem to realise there has been a major change in the provision. We are into a social housing programme which includes much more than local authority houses.</P>

      <P>I have given the figure for local authority house completions expected for 1999. There are other lettings. The method of assessing this has not changed over the years. What has changed is the increase in the provision through the capital assistance scheme, rent subsidy scheme, mortgage subsidy and other supports which are there to ensure that up to 10,250 households will be provided for.</P>

I know what the challenge is and we are trying to meet it through increasing the range of options for housing people and by trying to encourage greater use of the social and voluntary housing programmes&mdash;</P>

      <P>The 1999 Estimates provision of £336 million for the improvement and maintenance of national roads, which represents an increase of 17 per cent over 1998, was determined having regard to: the policy framework for the improvement of national roads as set out in the Operational Programme for Transport 1994-9 and to which regional interests, and through them local authorities, had an input; information in relation to commitments on schemes in progress available from the NRA, and assessments undertaken by the NRA such as the national roads needs study, of investment needs in the national roads network.</P>
      <P>The NRA has been assigned the role of planning and supervising the national roads programme and of allocating grants for that purpose to local authorities. Discussions on individual annual national road allocations are therefore appropriately conducted between the NRA and local authorities and my Department has no involvement in them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The process of preparing the National Development Plan 2000-2006 involves a major <Col N="732" /> input from regional interests. Local authorities have had the opportunity to contribute to these regional submissions in relation to national roads and other matters of concern to them.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the Minister's reply but unfortunately it means nothing whatsoever to the county of Monaghan where I reside and through which the M2 road runs. It has not benefited by one single penny from this massive increase at National Roads Authority level. The Minister claims he does not have responsibility for how the National Roads Authority spends its money. However, his party's Deputies in Cavan claimed full responsibility for the £10 million it received for the M3.</P>
      <P>Is there any way in which the Minister can use his influence to ensure some money is found somewhere to start some of the necessary by-passes for Carrickmacross, Castleblayney and Monaghan town? I am sure the Minister is aware that Monaghan town &ndash; where he was when he launched his document in Opposition &ndash; is in crisis. If an accident occurred &ndash;</P>

      <P>On the specific items the Deputy raised, I am aware from representations made to me, which I have passed on to the NRA through colleagues in that constituency, of the bypass to which he referred. I do not want to be accused of misleading the Dáil but I understand money has been made available to advance planning and design on some of those bypasses but I will convey the Deputy's concern directly to the NRA.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>In an ideal world with a sufficient rail network we would probably have a different balance between road and rail. If the Deputy told people living in Deputy Crawford's constituency or other parts of the country which <Col N="733" /> do not have a rail network that we should not spend money on roads, they would not agree with him. We must put this into perspective. There is a need for rebalance in the cities and larger towns where there is an infrastructure and there are viable alternatives, but there are parts of the country where roads are the only solution. As long as that remains the case I will try to ensure that everybody in the country is treated equally, not just those living in cities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I moved the adjournment I had been commenting on what I regard to be the inappropriateness of IMF advice, not only to many Third World countries but also to countries in Central and Eastern Europe that are now beginning to make new attempts to develop. In many cases the IMF is using an outdated and excessively theoretical approach to some of the development problems those countries meet. I am glad to note, however, that there are the beginnings of some changes in the way the IMF specifies the kinds of policies it lays down. The Minister dealt with those in his contribution and I will not dwell on them at great length except to say that it is important that the IMF should have <Col N="734" /> more regard for and pay more attention to the short-term social consequences of some of the policies and adjustments it proposes.</P>
      <P>The policies being complained of by some of the people who are unhappy to see the Bill can be likened to the famous Maastricht criteria. In many ways they are the kinds of policies and aims which these countries must have if they are to get themselves into a position of economically sustainable development. They are not palatable in many cases but they require choices to be made. I would have great reservations about accepting criticisms of IMF policies from countries where there is either a strong level of corruption in Government, which is not unusual, or where, notwithstanding difficult economic and budgetary conditions, there is still substantial expenditure on armaments.</P>
      <P>While I support the idea that the IMF should build a greater social awareness component into its policy specification, I would not support the calls which are sometimes made for the complete removal of conditionality from structural adjustment programmes. Conditionality is essential because objectives have to be set, results have to be measurable and, in the interests of the people of those countries, standards must be set as to how policy is to be run and results judged. If they are not set there is a danger that we will simply get into a morass of ongoing argument about policy without any direction or coherence in the way economic, development and social policies are run in those countries.</P>
      <P>The Minister set out the guidelines of the Irish approach to overseas development aid strategy and to dealing with the debt. He stated: &ldquo;We will continue to encourage the IMF to take full account of the social impact of its policies on the design and implementation phases of its macro-economic and structural adjustment programmes&rdquo;. I agree with that. The Minister went on to state: &ldquo;We will continue to advocate a greater degree of consultation and involvement for civil society in the developing countries in the planning, design and implementation phases of IMF and World Bank programmes&rdquo;. It is difficult to take exception to that and it suits the case being made by a number of the organisations that criticise ESAF, but where is the reality? </P>
      <P>It has been said &ndash; Deputies Haughey and McDowell made the point earlier &ndash; that ESAF and other programmes of this kind bypass the democratic process in the beneficiary countries and much is being made of that. That is not a contention we can simply take at face value, and I say this with a little knowledge of what actually happens. If, in practice, the democratic process in some of these countries is bypassed in the specification and implementation of ESAF programmes, the blame lies not with the IMF but with the local administrations of those countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is difficult for an agency like the IMF to negotiate a programme of this kind and arrive at an agreement with a Government without an adjustment programme while telling that Govern<Col N="735" /> ment that it will not finalise agreement or specify the implementation measures until it is satisfied that the country has democratically consulted its people or worked out some kind of agreement with NGOs.</P>
    <P>I invite those people who criticise ESAF programmes for allegedly bypassing democratic processes to follow up the logic of their concern and examine what needs to be done to democratic processes in those countries to involve them in the process because that is often where the fault lies and where the deficiency is to be found.</P>
    <P>The Minister pointed out that both he and the Minister for Foreign Affairs will emphasise the importance of continued consultation with the NGO community on issues of concern in relation to debt and development. That is laudable. However, we should examine all aspects of this problem. The NGO community has an important role in this process. It has been the source of much energy and creative thinking about the development process but the NGO community, the governments of developed countries and the IMF must be conscious that they are not the only players.</P>
    <P>They are not a substitute for the democratic process in developing countries, the direct involvement of the people of beneficiary countries or for the involvement of the democratic representatives of those people. We have been very much on our guard against taking the democratic element of those countries and trying to locate it in the NGO's and Government's programmes. In other words, it would be realistic to seek an element of democratic conditionality in these programmes. In some cases we are making substantial efforts to help with the debt crisis in countries which have little democratic reality in their internal affairs.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that this Bill is badly timed and that we should not provide a contribution to ESAF at this time. We have been advised to withhold it pending reform of the IMF or a visitation by the Holy Spirit to the IMF to make it more responsive to the democratic needs of those countries. It would be unwise to take that position. The leverage we would secure from not participating in this programme would count for nothing in changing the outlook or policy of the IMF. Now that there is a determination in the IMF to take more account of the factors about which we are correctly concerned, we will gain in leverage and influence by participating in the way proposed by the Bill rather than by abstaining.</P>

      <P>Probably. Debt relief is more than a matter of economic development; it is a profoundly moral issue. Servicing crippling levels of debt deprives developing countries of resources which would be better spent on essential social services, such as education and health.</P>
      <P>The Minister said this morning that it is time for Ireland, given its economic success and resources, to join its EU partners and other countries in assisting debt relief for those countries that need it. In Mozambique, for example, 33 per cent of the national budget is spent servicing debts whereas only 3.3 per cent is spent on education and 8 per cent on health. I welcome Ireland's contribution of $5 million on a bilateral basis to Mozambique's debt alleviation fund.</P>
      <P>In sub-Saharan Africa, the countries in Africa below the Sahara, more than 220 million people subsist on less than $1 per day. The challenges facing underdeveloped countries are enormous but the eradication of poverty and the integration of Africa into the world economic, financial and trading systems must remain central to our concerns. The Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, pointed out recently that every 1 per cent of the GDP of developing countries consisting of development assistance translates into a decline of 1 per cent in infant mortality. That is a telling statistic.</P>
      <P>With the HIPC initiative there are encouraging signs that the international community and institutions are beginning to seriously address the crippling problems of debt for developing countries. Twelve African countries have current growth levels of 5 per cent or more. <i>Per capita</i> incomes are still low, however. Poverty is deep and widespread and external imbalances are extremely large in many countries, reflecting a heavy dependence on foreign assistance. The ratio of investment to GDP remains low by the standards of other regions.</P>
      <P>Sub-Saharan Africa has not been successful in attracting private foreign capital although inflows have increased in recent years. This is a critical time for this region. The level of official development assistance, on which the majority of countries in the region have depended, is on the wane while globalisation is proceeding apace. Sub-Saharan Africa must open up and compete or lag further and further behind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Gross bilateral official development assistance disbursements to sub-Saharan Africa fell from $13.9 billion in 1990 to $10.7 billion in 1996. The decline in assistance means that opportunities for the people of the region to improve their quality of life in the future rests on their governments' efforts to attract higher private investment, both domestic and foreign. Sub-Saharan Africa has not done well with regard to foreign investment. During the period 1991 to 1997 its share of the $470 billion cumulative flow of foreign direct invest<Col N="737" /> ment was less than half of 1 per cent, $23 billion. This is a seriously disproportionate share.</P>
    <P>With structural improvement of African economies and infrastructural improvements on the ground, Africa can attract inward investment. Foreign direct investment flows to countries with stable political and economic environments, transparent and minimal regulations, good infrastructure facilities, a skilled labour force and low production costs. The challenge for sub-Saharan Africa is to try to achieve these.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the substantial amounts of aid many low income countries have received in the past 20 years, expectations have not been met. Far from taking advantage of aid to achieve high and sustained growth, many countries have become more dependent on aid. As a result of tighter aid budgets in donor countries and concerns that many aid recipients appear to be trapped in poverty, donors have been searching for ways to make aid more effective.</P>
    <P>The preponderance of evidence from the empirical literature on aid effectiveness suggests that aid has not had a statistically significant impact on growth in recipient countries. That is a fact we must accept. One such study &ndash; Boone, 1996 &ndash; found that when long-term aid is provided with little or no effective conditionality, it does not significantly raise investment or benefit the poor. It does increase consumption and the size of the government, the relatively wealthy elite prospers to a greater extent but foreign investors stay away.</P>
    <P>Recent empirical evidence also indicates that sub-Saharan African countries with relatively high levels of external grants tend to have significantly lower than average tax ratios, implying that aid has a tendency to work against fiscal discipline.</P>
    <P>Barriers to foreign trade are still quite high in most sub-Saharan African countries. Among the reasons for this is the problem of corruption. It is well recognised that corruption is a major obstacle to private sector activity, as it reduces government revenue &ndash; and therefore the base to improve infrastructure and education &ndash; tilts government investment towards large and wasteful projects and increases transaction costs. There is a negative and significant relationship between corruption and public spending on education, in a large group of developing countries. This is a finding that might be explained by the relative difficulty in collecting bribes on investment in education, compared to other types of public expenditure such as government consumption of other goods and services.</P>
    <P>African countries have suffered from civil strife, macroeconomic instability, dismal domestic markets, inward trade orientation and burdensome regulations. There has been slow progress in the areas of privatisation and infrastructure. These are among the reasons that make the impoverished countries of sub-Saharan Africa a high risk proposition for investment from foreign sources.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="738" /> Virtually all aid goes to direct consumption and bilateral aid increases the size of government but has failed to make any significant impact on human development in health and education. The lack of impact on poverty alleviation is due partly to the fact that aid does not introduce incentives into recipient countries for policies that would improve investment in health and education.</P>
    <P>Over time, this erosion in export competitiveness &ndash;  a &ldquo;Dutch Disease&rdquo;, effect of aid &ndash; may make the aid recipient even more dependent on aid. As we reach the end of the millennium, it is time to learn from the mistakes of earlier decades. There are times when bilateral emergency aid is called for, in the aftermath of unforeseeable natural disasters such as hurricanes, earthquakes and famine, but for the medium to long-term, it is important that we pursue more enlightened and informed policies.</P>
    <P>Because of the inexorable forward march of globalisation, and the continually falling levels of official development aid as the years go by, sub-Saharan Africa is at a turning point. What is needed is the pursuit of policies that will enable African countries to consolidate the gains they have made and put the region on a permanently higher growth curve.</P>
    <P>Real GDP growth averaged 4.25 per cent in 1995-7, up from 1.5 per cent in 1990-4. After a high of 44 per cent in 1994, annual inflation dropped to 13 per cent in 1997.</P>
    <P>The overall fiscal deficit, excluding grants, fell from a peak of 9 per cent of GDP in 1992 to 4.5 per cent of GDP in 1997, reflecting a fall in the ratio of government spending to GDP. The region's current account deficit widened to around 6 per cent of GDP in the mid 1990s but fell to 4 per cent of GDP in 1997. There is an improvement and the challenge is to consolidate and work on those improvements.</P>
    <P>The improved performance resulted mainly from improved policies in a number of sub-Saharan African countries. If South Africa and Nigeria is excluded, which account for half of the region's GDP but have only a quarter of the population, there is an even stronger improvement in the rest of sub-Saharan Africa. A group of the ten strongest performers has experienced average annual growth in <i>per capita</i> GDP of 7 per cent in the period 1995-7. Improved policies appear to have been the principal factor in most members of this group. Admittedly, 12 other countries experienced a fall in real <i>per capita</i> GDP in 1995-7. There were particularly sharp declines in five countries because they were affected by armed conflict.</P>
    <P>Control over government spending has improved. This has been reflected in a modest fall in the ratio of government expenditure to GDP, from a peak of 29 per cent in 1992 to 26.5 per cent in 1997.</P>
    <P>In the past two to three years, there have been increasing reasons for optimism about the economic prospects of Africa. Growth has picked up substantially, as a number of countries have put <Col N="739" /> in place policies conducive to macroeconomic stability and greater efficiency in production. In many countries, budget deficits have been reduced, inflation has been lowered, the process of privatisation has intensified and the financial sector has been liberalised. They draw the policy implication that an effective way of giving aid to developing countries might be through public expenditure programmes targeted at areas that are critical for development.</P>
    <P>An IMF paper in May 1998 &ldquo;Africa: Is this the Turning Point?&rdquo; concluded that after a long period of mediocre performance, economic performance in sub-Saharan Africa has improved markedly in recent years, resulting in renewed optimism for the future of the continent.</P>
    <P>Sub-Saharan Africa's partners among advanced countries can further help by reducing their own trade restrictions and by reducing the restrictiveness of technical regulations and product standards that apply against African products. The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, said at the last meeting of the IMF that:</P>
    <P>The most vulnerable groups in society must be protected, to the extent possible, in times of economic turmoil and financial turbulence.</P>
    <P>It is important that Ireland supports the implementation of debt measures that take full account of the social dimension, measures that embrace widespread consultation in the countries in question. Our goal must be to encourage sustainable economic development. Quick-fix remedies remedy nothing; we still have the opportunity to implement aid systems that can secure the economic future of SSA.</P>
    <P>Two recent evaluations of the ESAF facility emphasise the need for the IMF to take full account of the social impact of policies in the design and implementation phases of macroeconomic and structural adjustment programmes. The most vulnerable sections of society must be afforded special consideration, with safeguards against the most severe consequences of structural adjustment policies. It has been agreed that social development should be taken into account; I say it must be a high priority if we are to help the people of sub-Saharan Africa help themselves.</P>
    <P>The need for reform of certain aspects of ESAF programmes is clear. I am encouraged by the positive response of the IMF to the external evaluation which was recently undertaken of the facility. Development co-operation is about enabling societies to harness the skills and energies of their people, to make real social and economic progress. It is about ways of strengthening democracy and good governance, promoting greater and fairer trade and offering developing countries a reasonable chance to participate in the global economy.</P>
    <P>Ireland is making human rights and democratisation essential dimensions of our development co-operation programmes. Bilateral aid has <Col N="740" /> been shown to increase consumption and keep taxes down in recipient countries but it has also been shown to inhibit the private investment that is crucial to sustainable development.</P>
    <P>Emergency aid feeds the hungry but it can also have the effect of removing the market for domestic farmers who cannot sell their produce when food is arriving in by the container load from these agencies.</P>
    <P>A substantial portion of Government aid to developing countries must be subject to economic structural changes in those countries, as well as infrastructural changes on the ground. Through the IMF and the World Bank and the informed economic adjustments they impose on recipient nations, Ireland's donations can make a real difference. We can help the people of sub-Saharan Africa to help themselves. Otherwise the economies of the region will continue to hobble from one growth-strangling crisis to the next, and the cycle of poverty will sink sub-Saharan Africa even closer to despair. Without the necessary economic adjustments, simply channelling money into the region has been shown to be of little long-term benefit. Investment in crucial social services such as health and education must not be allowed to perish because of debt repayment obligations.</P>
    <P>This Bill can ensure that Ireland plays its part in bringing the poorest people in the world into the global economy. Our money must do more than feed the hungry today, for that is no good tomorrow. Rather we must show the poorest nations of Africa the path towards a brighter economic future and a better quality of life.</P>
    <P>I received two representations concerning this matter. One was from Our Lady of Good Counsel girls' school on the Mourne Road and the other from Debt &amp; Development Coalition Limited. The main representation was, as Deputy Dukes said, against any contribution to ESAF and in favour of bilateral aid. I hope the people who have made these representations will take on board the comments which I have made in respect of the benefit of receiving advice from bodies such as the IMF, the World Bank and friendly governments on the need to improve their economies, change their infrastructures and establish new structures so that in the future they will prosper.</P>

      <P>Tá áthas orm go bhfuil deis agam labhairt ar an ábhar seo cé nach saineolaí mé air. Tá a lán eolas faighte agam, áfach, le cúpla mí anuas mar gheall ar dhaoine ag scríobh chugam. Ní chuirfidh a n-ainmneacha mé os comhar na Dála.</P>
      <P>Tá ciall ceannaithe ag na daoine seo, na mná rialta go speisialta, a bhí thar lear ag obair sna tíortha seo. Muna raibh siadsan ann, bhí daoine eile sa chlochar leo a chaith am sna tíortha sin. Tuigim gur iontach an rud í ciall ceannaithe mar má tá sí agat sé an rud atá i gcás ná &ldquo;been there, done that&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It is important that we listen to the people who have contacted us in so many different ways to outline their objections to this Bill. It is a pity, considering that we are giving £31 million to help poorer countries, there is a question mark over the way we are doing it. Having read the correspondence I received, I could not help thinking that we are repeating the experiences of our country during the Great Famine. We were exporting corn while we had no food to keep up payments. To an extent this is the picture painted by the literature I received &ndash; we are giving money to people, making them pay back a debt and leaving them impoverished.</P>
      <P>It would be nice to think we would get the best value from the £31 million which the Government is putting up. I am not an expert but the people who have written to me know what is going on in these countries and they should be listened to. People who have been helping in these countries want to do what is best for the countries &ndash; they want to see money coming in but in a way which will be of benefit. They want poverty eliminated.</P>
      <P>The IMF has done a great deal of work around the world but it does it in a business capacity &ndash; it wants to get its money back. Paying debts at the expense of people is even more horrifying than seeing children in these countries with flies crawling all over them, in such severe poverty that they are dying of hunger. It is important to get the balance right. Deputy Ardagh's figure of 33 per cent of the budget of Mozambique going towards repaying debt was frightening. No country could survive payments of that nature while only giving 12 per cent of its budget to health, an area in which it is so badly needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference was made to corruption. I remember talking to a friend from Carlow who was helping in a professional capacity in one of the newly freed African countries. The level of corruption <Col N="742" /> was staggering. Money was disappearing which should have been going towards works in which this person was involved and people were taking backhanders. That is obviously still going on. Civil war is another problem in these countries, which are not as democratic as we are or as we would like them to be. All of these problems eat away at the money.</P>
    <P>I received a leaflet from All Hallows College in Dublin and it stated that the IMF has such a failure rate because of the conditions laid down for borrowing. Conditions are so onerous that over three quarters of programmes break down. This demonstrates that there are fundamental problems with the design and objectives of these programmes. When there were rumours that the IMF would move in here during the 1970s, it was said it would make cuts left, right and centre. The pamphlet I received stated that the policies the IMF promotes to cut budget deficits do not take human needs into account. Cuts in basic services, together with user fees, result in large drops in primary school attendance and the removal of subsidies from staple foods causing widespread malnutrition. The over-speedy removal of protective trade barriers leads to the collapse of local industry. Cuts in the Civil Service and privatisation result in thousands of workers being thrown into the informal labour market which cannot absorb such huge numbers.</P>
    <P>The IMF operates on a financial basis. It is a pity that in an effort to help these countries, things are done which do not help them at all. ESAF was introduced in response to the debt crisis but it has completely failed to alleviate the problem. The IMF extracts more money from low income countries than it makes available in lending. In 1995 alone, severely indebted low income countries transferred $1 billion net to the IMF.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to see why we should give money to this fund to have it repay debt when we could give it to NGOs. The one bright spot is that the Minister has given a commitment to continuously consult with NGOs on issues of concern in relation to debt and development. They should be directing policy. It is important that contact is maintained with them. If the IMF was not as strict in seeking to balance the books, economies might flourish.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dukes said it would make no difference if we stay out. I disagree. In handing over £31 million we are entitled to ask that changes be made. The Minister should argue the case for this but once the IMF is involved politics and debt repayment will be put before people and the alleviation of poverty, something about which those who have corresponded with us are concerned. In some instances debts should be written off. If that is what it takes to help the countries concerned, I do not think anyone would object.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil leis an Teachta Browne as ucht a chuid ama a roinnt. Tá áthas orm a chloisint go bhfuil croí daonna fós i bhFine Gael agus nach ionann gach <Col N="743" /> rud a deireann an Teachta Alan Dukes agus tuairimí bhallraíocht an pháirtí.</P>
      <P>Chuir mise ceist ar an Taoiseach ar an 9ú lá de mhí Dheireadh Fomhair 1997 an mbeadh sé ag caint leis na grúpaí deonacha, na grúpaí a bhíonn ag obair thar lear &ndash; grúpaí ar nós Debt and Development Coalition &ndash; mar gheall ar an reachtaíocht seo. Ón méid atá cloiste agam ón Rialtas is léir nach raibh siad ag éisteacht, fiú má bhuail siad leis na grúpaí sin, mar níl siad ag teacht amach leis an saineolas atá ag na grúpaí a bhíonn ag obair thar lear sna tíortha is boichte ar domhain.</P>
      <P>Ireland has a proud tradition of helping other countries in the position similar to that in which Ireland found itself in the last century. Wherever one goes Irish aid workers, missionaries and other religious groups are helping to right some of the wrongs inflicted on the majority of the world's population by the former colonial powers and multinationals which abuse the earth and its peoples in an exploitation that is immoral and economically unsound in the sense that it is unsustainable.</P>
      <P>With Ireland's proud record of involvement and standing on the side of the poorest and dispossessed this country has carried a banner of fairness and justice. By introducing Ireland's payments to ESAF &ndash; the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility &ndash; through this Bill, the Minister is taking deadly steps backwards from our honourable past. In 1996 the previous Government decided not to contribute to ESAF because of its negative impact on the peoples of Third World countries. The Government plans to reverse that decision and has introduced legislation to enable an Irish contribution soon.</P>
      <P>ESAF is an IMF programme which lends to the poorest countries at low interest rates. In return for loans the borrowing countries must implement economic policies laid down by the IMF. In general these are designed to improve macro-economic indicators and open up the countries concerned to the global economy.</P>
      <P>These policies have been shown to have negative results, such as cuts in basic services leading to lower education participation rates and increased levels of malnutrition, over hasty removal of protective trade barriers leading to the collapse of local industry, privatisation and employment cuts in the public sector leading to thousands of workers loosing their jobs. These policies have no democratic basis. Borrowing countries have no option but to comply with them to obtain low interest loans they desperately need, often to maintain the repayments on existing debts while elected parliaments have no say in their formulation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the basis of an external evaluation of ESAF, the IMF has declared that it will pay more attention to the needs of the poorest sectors in borrowing countries in designing future ESAF programmes. The Government has apparently taken this declaration at face value and has <Col N="744" /> resolved to contribute to ESAF without waiting to see if the much needed changes are made. Contributions to ESAF should be dependent on proven benefits to the poor in Third World countries.</P>
    <P>The Green Party will vote no to the proposed legislation sanctioning Irish contributions to ESAF. The money earmarked for this use could be assigned to aid which is rendered useless by such mechanisms as ESAF or used to write off debts. The Minister is well meaning but in this proposal he has been sold a dummy. He should reflect on the example where the European Union is protectionist and whether his policy can be reconciled with that of the Minister for Agriculture and Food.</P>
    <P>The Common Agricultural Policy is causing great hardship for the fruit and vegetable canning industries in South Africa and the farmers who supply them. By heavily subsidising the export of canned products to South Africa the European Union has made it impossible for South African producers to compete with their European counterparts. At the same time the European Union imposes heavy tariffs on canned produce imported from South Africa. Not for the first time the dumping of surplus food in an African country combined with restrictive tariff regimes in the European Union has had disastrous effects on local agricultural markets and food production. In the light of these policies which the Government wishes to impose on the Third World through ESAF it is ironic that it is happy to support different policies within the European Union, that is, by tariffs on imports and high subsidies on agricultural products and to subject the poorest countries of the world to a straitjacket on free trade.</P>
    <P>Every year 500,000 children die in countries where vital health services have been slashed to meet debt repayments. Africa now spends four times more servicing the interest on its loans than on health care. For every $1 allocated to an Asian country $11 is returned in repayments. This is immoral. Instead of preventing disaster by helping to set up effective health care services we are forced to act as a fire service providing emergency help when the pain of dispossession, conflict and starvation has affected millions.</P>
    <P>In the world's 37 poorest countries spending per person on health has gone down by 50 per cent and on education by 25 per cent. While we like the idea of richer countries providing help for countries in which there are injustices, it is shocking that so much is allocated in aid when we take back much more in repayments. This is cynical and has dangerous implications through global instability. In the case of Mozambique NGOs stated that the IMF had created a climate of wealth concentration rather than creation. The unfair structures within the IMF have the effect of widening the gap between rich and poor. Ireland is contributing £5 million to debt relief in Mozambique, yet the Government is to spend £7 million on the enhanced structural adjustment <Col N="745" /> facility. More direct and constructive measures would be far more appropriate. Without economic democracy and stability, how can we expect to see an end to the horrific slaughters that persist in many parts of Africa? Ireland is now part of that exclusive club of rich countries which should aim to provide aid that is constructive rather than loans which lead to exploitation of people and the pillaging of rain forests and unique natural areas on which these people depend. The conditions laid down by the IMF are so onerous and severe that three-quarters of the programmes break down. This must be an indication that the present system does not work, and we have no proof that the amendments and changes are an improvement.</P>
    <P>In 1997 the IMF carried out an internal and external evaluation of the merits of ESAF. The internal review showed that economic growth was still low, that debt had doubled between 1985 and 1995 and that there was no overall change in inflation levels. The external review criticised ESAF for failing to foresee the negative impact on poor people and also criticised the loan shark attitude of the IMF for its &ldquo;macho bargaining style.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Is this really the time for Ireland to start contributing to ESAF? It seems bizarre that, despite calls from all the major relief agencies, the Minister is hell bent on making Ireland contribute to a racist, bureaucratic and undemocratic organisation. There is a connection between structural adjustment policies and the consequent shocks to fragile economies and political institutions in developing countries &ndash; many of them in sub-Saharan Africa &ndash; which have just recovered from politically motivated conflict. The leaders in these countries have promised an economic dividend to their citizens as an important factor in building peace, but this is being obstructed by ESAF policies demanded by the IMF.</P>
    <P>When the Ministers for Foreign Affairs and Finance made their statements last September announcing their decision to reverse the previous policy not to contribute to ESAF, did they make that reversal conditional on the IMF reforming? That is the question. Are they aware that even the modest reforms proposed by their own external consultants have not been implemented? Why then are we rushing into an unproven change, endangering many people worldwide? One might say that this debt is perpetrating genocide.</P>
    <P>The world is being rallied around the Jubilee 2000 campaign to cancel international debt, and this is totally at odds with that humanitarian measure. I ask the Government to think again and not to do it.</P>

      <P>By any stretch of the imagination this has been a very interesting debate. It has focused the House on a very serious matter. I share many of the concerns voiced by the Opposition. I am not a fan of the IMF or the international monetary system. I have little belief in either the IMF or the World Bank's capacity to <Col N="746" /> show humanity when humanity is needed. If we looked at their track records they would give us pause for thought.</P>
      <P>The Minister's speech was interesting and he was right to state that the heavy external burden of debt has had a devastating impact on the economies of many developing and underdeveloped countries in recent years. The fact is that when we talk about the devastating impact on economies we should actually be talking about the devastating impact on people. The tragic reality is that in many developing countries, particularly those burdened with debt, the real burden does not fall on regimes, institutions or bankers, but on the shoulders of the poorest of the poor. These are people who eke out a humble and marginal existence, and it does the international community little credit when one considers that the real focus of these changes is on the interests of the international banking community.</P>

      <P>I wish to articulate the concerns of the Ballincollig community about their barracks, as they call it. The Minister will know that the barracks is 200 years old, and it was because of that barracks that Ballincollig evolved as a thriving town. The barracks has always been part of the heritage, culture and economy of Ballincollig and is very important to the people of the town. The geography of the site is particularly important; it dominates the town, though some people might have different views on that. However, the development of the land is important to the people of Ballincollig from the physical and visual perspectives. It has prime potential for housing, industrial, commercial or community use, and the people of Ballincollig feel they are not being consulted about what is to happen to the site. When the closure of the barracks was announced the people of the town were devastated because they were not consulted; they now feel that, due to a lack of consultation, they will again be presented with a <i>fait accompli</i> depending to whom the barracks is sold.</P>
      <P>The Minister said he would like to see a comprehensive consultation plan being put in place with the local community. I hope he can tell us if anything has happened. Has he had any difficulty with zoning for the site? Has he had discussions with the county manager or other council officials with responsibility for planning applications? Ballincollig is an important town on the outskirts of Cork with a population between 17,000 and 20,000. The sale of the land and the future of the town hinges on the input of local development groups and others who have been very active in that community.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>Ballincollig is one of the fastest growing towns in Ireland. However, unlike most urban centres, the entire town has developed on one side of the main street. This occurred because of the existence of the Army barracks on the other side. The barracks had to close last September, and the military personnel based there were mostly moved to Collins Barracks in Cork city. Most of the Army personnel accepted the need to close the barracks but were very upset about the way the closure happened. There was a rush to close the barracks with many soldiers given little or no notice as to what was happening. As a result, Collins Barracks was not prepared for the increase in numbers, and many soldiers had to live in what I am told were building site conditions after the closure.</P>
      <P>Why the rush? Nothing has been done to the barracks in Ballincollig for the last four months, and there is much bad feeling in the town as a result. During the by-election I and many others were under the impression that we would see an assessment study of the barracks grounds completed by an independent consultant before Christmas. Can the Minister explain the delay and give us a realistic timescale for the completion of the study? Can he assure me that the consultants will be independent, with expertise in town planning and development and do not have a vested interest?</P>
      <P>In addition, can he clarify whether there will be a problem with selling the barracks land? The Department of Defence does not own the land outright but merely has a long-term lease. I understand the lease is for 800 years so I assume there is no problem. However, there seems to be some confusion about this in the area and there have been rumours. I would ask the Minister to clarify exactly what is happening about the sale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government on 15 July 1998 approved a programme of evacuation and sale of six barracks which are considered surplus to military requirements. This decision is part of the relocation, refurbishment and re-equipment of the Defence Forces, as recommended in the context of the Price Waterhouse report regarding the rationalisation of military institutions generally. The Government remains fully committed to this important programme.</P>
      <P>It is expected that up to £50 million will be raised from the sale of these barracks. Sixty per cent of the proceeds will be invested in the redevelopment of other military installations and new equipment. The balance will be used to meet the cost of compensation claims and for investment in the local communities where closures take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposed sales will provide prime sites to meet housing, commercial and industrial development needs in the areas concerned. In addition, 15 per cent of the proceeds are to be devoted to community projects in the areas involved. This is a consultative process involving many Depart<Col N="748" /> ments, agencies, councils and organisations, including my Department. While preliminary discussions have taken place with local community groups, various details and arrangements still require to be sorted out.</P>
    <P>The Government decision of 15 July 1998 identified Ballincollig as one of the properties for disposal and it will be offered for sale by open tender in the near future. The property comprises 140 acres approximately held under a 999 year lease which commenced in 1805 and, therefore, it still has many years to run. Cork County Council's most recent county development plan was published in 1996. At that time, the barracks was still in military use. Draft variations to the 1996 plan published by the council in January of this year propose permitting the redevelopment of the barracks property for a variety of uses, including commercial, residential, employment, social, community and other appropriate development forms. The variations to the 1996 plan require that an integrated area action plan be drawn up for the property and be adopted by the county council in advance of it considering any applications for planning permission to the property.</P>
    <P>In relation to the appointment of independent planning consultants, I propose to advertise next week for the invitation of tenders for the preparation of an integrated area action plan for the development of these lands at Ballincollig. The tenders will be due back to my Department by early March. It is proposed to appoint consultants following evaluation of the tenders. The consultants will be required to submit their report within three months of their appointment. In addition to the maximisation of the potential of the property, the principal objectives of the project will be to define the role that the site should play in the future development of the town of Ballincollig, to provide an urban design for the resulting expansion of the town centre, to establish priorities in relation to the infrastructural development, taking cognisance of community needs, and to provide guidance in relation to development issues.</P>
    <P>The consultants appointed will be required to liaise with my Department, local community groups, the local authority &ndash; Cork County Council &ndash; and all other interested parties with regard to the formulation of an area action plan. The recommendations of the independent planning consultants will greatly assist my Department in progressing the sale of the property. In accordance with normal Government practice this process will be by way of public tender.</P>
    <P>I thank the Deputies for raising this matter on the Adjournment and giving me an opportunity to clarify the present position. There was no rush in closing the barracks; it was on the agenda for about 20 years. Most people who are realistic about the needs of the Defence Forces knew that this should happen, and it should have happened long before now. We are in the process of moving towards a sale which will involve the consultative process and enhance the town of Ballincollig. The Deputies said the town has developed in a lop-<Col N="749" /> sided way and this will provide an opportunity to create balance and development so the community can benefit from the decision we have taken.</P>
    <P>I am extremely anxious that this will proceed quickly, but I could not move on anything until it I had a clear site and only part of it has been completed. We also have to relocate the explosives. I assure the Deputies I am concerned to ensure we get the best possible deal for the State and the best prospect of enhancement for the town of Ballincollig arising from this decision. In spite of some of the political statements that have been made, I appreciate there is reasonable consensus about what we are trying to do.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are in the region of eight million cattle in this State, the highest on record. We have a grave shortage of fodder because some areas have experienced the worst weather conditions in living memory. Prices for cattle have collapsed. The price of a round bale of silage, which would normally cost £16, has increased to £30. The price for a small bale of hay which would normal cost £1 has increased, in some places to £4. This has put major financial stress on small farmers.</P>
      <P>Meat factories are turning away cattle. Cattle minus ear tags have been abandoned by farmers who could not afford to feed them. In some cases they have been forced to shoot starving cattle to put them out of their misery. We saw on the RTE news last night the horrifying sight of cattle and sheep that died of starvation.</P>
      <P>The fodder crisis was well signalled last June and July when farmers in the west were forced to feed their cattle silage because the land was too wet for them to graze on it. As a result fodder supplies were depleted well before the onset of winter.</P>
      <P>Last autumn farmers held on to cattle hoping prices would improve. They were misled by the Minister's empty promises. He promised that the Libyan market would open within a matter of weeks. The weeks have turned to months, but the Libyan market has not reopened. The question must be asked whether there was any possibility that it would reopen.</P>
      <P>In an article in today's <i>The Irish Times</i> the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, is reported to have made a promise about the Iranian market. Farmers are sick to death of false promises. They want to see these markets opening up. If they open, the Minister can then take the credit, but farmers do not want to read misleading information, such as this, in the newspapers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister and the Government's response to date has been pathetic and borders on arrogance. A half-baked fodder scheme was announced before the ploughing championships in October; it was not fully thought out, it was under-funded and it was not based on a scientific <Col N="750" /> survey. As my Fine Gael colleagues and I pointed out to the Minister, this was only a drop in the ocean when considering the magnitude of the crisis. The Minister's response in the Dáil was to fob off the crisis on to other agencies and organisations. He said that these organisations should help out with current difficulties rather than always looking to the taxpayer to foot the cost of paying compensation.</P>
    <P>The Minister seems to be persistent with his promises. In an article in today's <i>Irish Independent</i> he is reported to have promised a £30 million fodder scheme which is to be announced next week. What farmers need is a scheme, not the promise of one. I call on the Minister to carry out a proper survey of the affected areas by ensuring that all farmers who have a fodder shortage should be visited to determine their fodder requirement on the basis of cattle numbers and availability of fodder and early grazing. The last survey by Teagasc was carried out only on its clients' farms and excluded those who were not in a position to pay for the service. Therefore, many of the less well off farmers were excluded from the survey. Anything less than a £1,000 fodder grant will be of little use to many of the most hard pressed farmers at this stage. I understand the Minister's proposal to be a maximum grant of £500 in designated DEDs, but this will not suffice.</P>
    <P>The performance of the Government to date has been anti rural Ireland, probably the worst in the history of this State. The policy seems to be clear &ndash; allow market forces to determine the number of farmers who will survive with as little Government intervention as possible. This may not be the Minister's policy but it seems to be the Government's. This policy would sound the death-knell for rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>It has been estimated fairly scientifically that the cost of maintaining a herd of 20 cows from now until mid-April would be approximately £3,320. That is what the Minister must take into account when he is considering this new promised and long awaited grant scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased to have the opportunity of setting out the details of the fodder scheme and other actions already implemented to help to alleviate difficulties being faced by farmers.</P>
      <P>The unusually wet weather in summer and autumn 1998 combined with below normal sunshine resulted in reduced grass growth throughout the country. In the peaty and heavy clay soil areas of certain counties, the capability of farmers to make silage and hay was greatly reduced. While the situation improved significantly in some areas in August, the broken weather in September added to the fodder difficulty in the most seriously affected areas. In addition, farmers in such areas had great difficulty allowing animals to graze such lands and many animals had to be brought indoors, further exacerbating the winter fodder problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="751" /> Teagasc carried out an assessment of the winter fodder position on 12-13 August 1998. The results showed there were significant problems in the heavy wet land of the north-west and south-west with lesser problems in other wet land areas.</P>
    <P>Teagasc reviewed the situation in early September and a report was forwarded to my Department on 16 September 1998. As agreed in discussions between my officials and Teagasc, the report concentrated specifically on the worst affected areas. The following are the worst affected areas listed in the Teagasc report &ndash; County Leitrim, west Cavan, north Roscommon, along the rivers Shannon and Suck, north Longford, Sligo, Mayo, Donegal, Limerick, Clare, Kerry, Cork, and Galway.</P>
    <P>On 21 October 1998 I announced the details of a fodder scheme, directed at all sheep farmers with mountain grazings, suckler cow producers and small dairy farmers with milk quotas of less than 35,000 gallons in 753 district electoral divisions in the worst affected areas, based on a Teagasc survey published in September. The counties concerned were Cavan, Clare, Cork, Donegal, Galway, Kerry, Leitrim, Limerick, Longford, Mayo, Roscommon, and Sligo. The number of DEDs was subsequently revised upwards to 873 or 50 per cent of all DEDs in the 12 counties concerned. While the main purpose of the scheme was to alleviate hardship, I was conscious of the need to protect the breeding herd.</P>
    <P>The payment rates were as follows: sheep farmers with mountain ewes received £4 per ewe or hogget up to 75 head; suckler cow farmers received £40 per suckler cow up to a ceiling of 7.5 cows; and small scale dairy farmers, those with a quota of less than 35,000 gallons, received £30 per 1,000 gallons up to 10,000 gallons. Payments were made under the scheme in mid-December as follows &ndash; 43,969 suckler cow and hill sheep farmers received £10.835 million, and 6,581 dairy farmers received £1.294 million, giving a total expenditure to date of £12.129 million.</P>
    <P>Teagasc recently prepared a further report on winter fodder. The general line is that a difficult position exists on a number of farms due to continued wet weather, high stock levels on farms, earlier winter feeding because of difficult ground conditions and poor silage quality. The worst affected areas listed are Cavan, Monaghan, Clare, Donegal, Leitrim, Longford, Mayo, Roscommon and Sligo in the &ldquo;north region&rdquo;; and Kerry, west and north-west Cork, west Limerick and certain limited areas of Laois and Tipperary in the &ldquo;south region&rdquo;. It is worth noting that some parts of the country have adequate supplies of fodder. The Government has decided a further scheme should be introduced to help farmers in the worst affected areas and its details are currently being drawn up.</P>
    <P>I undertook a number of major initiatives during the latter half of 1998 to support farmers. I <Col N="752" /> mentioned the fodder scheme, which provided in excess of £12 million directly from the Exchequer; there was also £2 million in ewe premium top-up and a further £6 million in the quality ewe scheme, among other schemes. In total, some £21 million was paid out in Christmas week. Now, four weeks later, I have approval from the Government to finance and draw up a further scheme of assistance to farmers in the worst affected areas. It is not the easiest job in the world to provide money quickly, easily and effectively while at the same time targeting it at those most in need. For a fully targeted scheme we would have to advertise it, receive applications, send out inspectors, receive their reports, and instal a payment system, that would take several months. By its nature, if one wants to make a speedy payment, which I do, one has to use a fairly blunt instrument.</P>
    <P>The improvements brought about by negotiation include substantial increases in export refunds for beef, the introduction of considerable aid to private storage of sheepmeat, and improvements in access to intervention for heavier cattle &ndash; that intervention has been continued into the first three months of this year. We have also increased the rate of advance payment under the suckler cow and special beef premia, and speeded up all payments to farmers.</P>
    <P>It is worth noting that up to Christmas Day 1998 more than £1 billion was paid in cheques directly to farmers. They were entitled to those payments as compensatory payments but it is a substantial amount of money. The payments were speeded up and the increase from 60 per cent to 80 per cent made it an all time record. On top of that, we introduced a special package of almost £21 million, including £12 million in fodder payments, £6 million for mountain ewe destocking and almost £3 million in sheep headage top-up. We approved additional shipping capacity for the export of livestock &ndash; despite numerous criticisms of the lack of livestock transport facilities, more than three times as many live cattle were exported from Ireland last year compared with the two previous years.</P>
    <P>We also made intervention barley available to the feed trade. Our newspapers and television news programmes are showing underfed cattle but, apart from the fodder in the yards of those farmers who were able to store it, 20,000 tonnes of animal feed is in storage in Ireland. Last week the Department released 2,000 tonnes of that in order to help but only 300 tonnes was sought by our compounders. Some of those companies are co-ops which are owned and controlled by farmers, so it is strange that farmers, their co-ops, and farming organisations are not making more of an effort to ensure that best use is made of the adequate amount of fodder in the country. If farmers are increasing the price of bales from £15 to £30 they are affecting their neighbours who are in difficulty and this is not the best time to take advantage of cruel circumstances to make a quick buck.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="753" /> As well as those measures the Government introduced a farm assist scheme to help to those with income and cashflow difficulties in the worst affected areas. That is an effort to improve what was known as the &ldquo;farmers' dole&rdquo;. Twice as many people will qualify under the farm assist scheme as under the old scheme. The problem is that the Social Welfare Bill, under which the scheme will be regulated, will not be through the House until later in the year. Nonetheless, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs is seeing how he can expedite the introduction of the scheme to be of further assistance.</P>
    <P>All these measures have helped support farm incomes at what I recognise is an extremely difficult time, especially for small farmers and those in wetland areas. In addition to the above, a further fodder scheme is in preparation and I hope to be in a position to announce it within days rather than weeks. I do not need any convincing about the difficult position prevailing on certain farms and I have faced up to my responsibilities in that regard. My actions have been many and decisive and I will continue to take all positive steps to protect the interests of farmers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me to raise this issue. In 1997 the then Government decided to give the green light to one of the most ambitious and deserving urban renewal programmes ever proposed in the history of the State, that is, the regeneration of Ballymun. This was one of the most disastrous housing developments ever witnessed in the State. Thousands of families were housed in a bleak wasteland on the outskirts of Dublin. Poor public transport, no jobs and abysmal community facilities plagued this massive suburb from the outset. Unemployment, drug abuse and poverty have torn at the heart of the community for decades. The huge regeneration project approved in 1997 is intended to tackle these serious problems and ensure that the people of Ballymun receive the investment, services and opportunities which will nurture a living community. After decades of neglect they have a chance to shape the future of their community and fight the prejudice and ignorance that has denied them the same opportunities in education and employment as other communities in this city and beyond.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the recent European Commission decision on tax incentives for urban regeneration means the project is in jeopardy. The regeneration of Ballymun needs a strong commercial element to ensure its success. It must compete for industry and jobs with areas which are currently much more attractive to investors. The threat to double rent reliefs and rates remissions undermines this goal. Capital allowances will attract development in Ballymun but this is only part of <Col N="754" /> the picture. End-user reliefs, which will attract commercial development and, most importantly, jobs into Ballymun, are essential. It is these reliefs which are now in the sights of the Commission.</P>
    <P>There is an urgent need for the Government to make the strongest argument to Brussels for the retention of generous tax designation for Ballymun. The Government must insist that in such a disadvantaged area as Ballymun, tax designation is regarded as regional investment aid, not operating aid. A huge amount of effort by the local community and Ballymun Regeneration Limited is now threatened because of the EU objection to end-user tax reliefs. The Government cannot allow this to happen. It would represent an incredible injustice if the people of Ballymun were denied the opportunity for a new start due to the deteriorating relationship this Government has allowed to develop with Europe.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister &ndash; I regret the Minister for Finance is not here but the Minister for Education and Science is here in his place &ndash; to outline the steps the Government intends to take to retrieve the situation. To date, the Minister for Finance has shown no eagerness to fight the case of Ballymun in Europe. The Minister, Deputy McCreevy, and the Department of Finance seem to accept that the elimination of double rent relief and rates remission is a <i>fait accompli</i>. This attitude must change.</P>
    <P>The regeneration of Ballymun depends on a generous tax incentive régime being put in place. A similar régime has benefited dozens of other urban centres in Ireland over the past decade. If the Government's proposals for Objective One status are approved by Brussels, these tax incentives will be even more important and will help to provide an even playing pitch, where Ballymun can compete for investment and jobs with Objective One areas which will continue to receive the highest supports from Brussels.</P>
    <P>The successful regeneration of Ballymun now hangs in the balance. The attitude of the Government over the coming weeks will prove critical in the battle to ensure that Ballymun receives the same treatment that other urban centres have enjoyed in recent years. No other community has suffered the neglect endured by Ballymun since its construction over 30 years ago. Now a chance exists to make good the mistakes of the past and build a real community in Ballymun. The success of this project lies with the decisions and arguments that the Minister for Finance makes over the coming weeks. I hope this evening the Minister will be able to reassure me and the people of Ballymun that he is prepared to go to the wire to ensure that justice is done for Ballymun.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise for the Minister for Finance who could not be here this evening. I am also glad to represent the Minister for Education and Science, to whom Deputy Shortall referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="755" /> I am pleased the Deputy has raised this matter and brought it to the attention of the House. In my previous role as spokesman on Social Welfare, I visited Ballymun and spoke to a range of people dealing with issues such as those raised by the Deputy. I can say with some authority that the designation of urban renewal status would be one of the very best things that could happen to an area such as that spoken about by the Deputy.</P>
    <P>I live in a small rural town &ndash; there is exclusion, deprivation and poverty in rural towns as well &ndash; which was designated for urban renewal a few years ago. This has transformed the town, raised the morale of the people and given them new hope and opportunity. The Minister for Education and Science is present in the Chamber and such schemes, with the provision of vastly improved education facilities, are giving a tremendous ray of hope where there was no hope before. I greatly believe in urban renewal, either in areas such as Ballymun or in some of the towns which were decaying before people's eyes, with families leaving because they saw no future in them.</P>
    <P>Last year, subject to EU approval, the Government approved a new urban renewal scheme, which was based on the recommendations set out in the consultants' study published in December 1996 on the urban renewal schemes which have operated since 1986. The new scheme provides for a more planned, integrated and focused approach to urban renewal designations based on integrated area plans &ndash; IAPs &ndash; produced by local authorities addressing the physical and socio-economic renewal of areas.</P>
    <P>This new process is well advanced. Relevant local authorities seeking designation have prepared IAPs for parts of urban areas in most need of physical and socio-economic rejuvenation, and have identified targeted sub-areas or key developments within them for which designation is sought. The need for such designations must be justified by reference to the IAP's objectives for the area. This involves an analysis of the physical and social needs of the selected area and a vision statement as to how urban renewal could address these needs. The IAPs were submitted to the Department of the Environment and Local Government last year for assessment. The assessment procedure involves an examination of the IAPs by an expert advisory panel set up by the Department, following which the Minister for the Environment and Local Government is advised in relation to the proposals for designation having regard to specific criteria. The responsibility for selecting and prioritising areas for IAPs, and for the preparation of IAPs for priority areas, rests with the relevant city corporation or county council, and I understand that an IAP has been submitted on behalf of Ballymun.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="756" /> Under the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, the Minister for Finance is empowered, on the recommendation of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, and taking into consideration the IAPs, to designate areas within the boundaries of the IAPs for the purpose of one or more of the reliefs contained in the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, for urban renewal purposes.</P>
    <P>Unlike the urban renewal tax legislation which has existed to date, there is no blanket entitlement to all the reliefs for any particular qualifying area and the incentives may vary in mix for different areas. There is provision to discriminate as between specific types of commercial development for tax incentive purposes.</P>
    <P>On the issue of EU approval of the new urban renewal scheme, it is important tonote that the EU Commission has recently drawn up revised guidelines for the examination of tax incentives in the context of State aid for all member states. The recent difficulties in obtaining approval for this and other schemes is as a result of the EU Commission's implementation of these new guidelines and of the fact that, due to unprecedented economic growth, Ireland as a whole is moving from an area covered by Article 92(3)(a) of the EU Treaty to an area covered by Article 92(3)(c) of the Treaty.</P>
    <P>Article 92(3)(c) allows for a more limited range of tax incentives then Article 92(3)(a) and the Commission has indicated to my Department that it considers double rent relief and rates remission for an Article 92(3)(c) area as operating aids, in that they lower the taxable income of an enterprise over the ten year period for which these two reliefs apply. The EU Commission has also indicated that it is opposed, on State aids grounds, to the granting of operating aids in such areas, except for small scale activities or locally based services in areas where physical dereliction is associated with social disadvantage or high unemployment. It is not expected that there will be a problem in regard to the capital allowances. Any delays or difficulties which have arisen are due to Ireland's improved economic position and to developments at EU level of a general nature.</P>
    <P>The new urban renewal scheme and the business incentives for the rural renewal scheme were formally notified to the EU Commission on 17 September 1998. The Irish authorities have not yet received approval from the EU Commission for the new urban renewal scheme. The latest position is that the Commission has raised a series of queries arising from our initial application. A reply is currently being prepared.</P>
    <P>I would stress that this is part of the normal process associated with obtaining EU approval and that the procedure may take some time to complete. Any final decision made by the Commission in this context will be announced at the appropriate time.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="757" /> Finally, with regard to the designation of Ballymun or any other urban area for the purpose of urban renewal tax incentives, I would again stress that this is an integrated process in which several different elements, in particular the EU Commission approval, must be finalised before any designation can take place.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for being present, which I greatly appreciate. However, I may have to leave because I have an interview at 5.30 p.m., so I may not catch all of his reply.</P>
      <P>The Minister is probably aware that, not far from here, is the mythical place called Dublin 4. In our vision of Dublin 4 we think of Shrewsbury Road, Donnybrook and people who have access to power and money. As Eoghan Harris said, it is almost a state of mind. However, there is another part of Dublin 4, which I know very well, where there is 70 per cent unemployment, drug problems and deprivation. We do not hear much about that part of Dublin 4. Haddington Road school is part of that Dublin 4 and it needs the Minister's help. When Deputy Ryan and I approached the Minister in the past he was forthcoming. For example, he met the parents and teachers in connection with the City Quay area and produced the goods. I hope he has a positive response to this matter.</P>
      <P>I believe the Minister shares my views on education. It is like watering a plant. If nourishment is not provided the result will be a dead society. I believe in society; I do not believe in the Thatcherite notion that there is no such thing as society.</P>
      <P>This is a deserving case. I am sure the Minister is familiar with it because he has received correspondence on the matter. St. Brigid's national school requires a remedial teacher for fifth and sixth classes. These classes are vital because they are the years before pupils enter secondary school. Our aspiration should be that pupils will go through secondary school and have an ambition to go on to third level. However, if we do not tend the grassroots and take care of primary schools, we can forget about a vision of society because it is at that level people learn about aspiration and ambition. They are important qualities, but the Minister probably knows people in his constituency who do not have them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister to consider the way this school has been disadvantaged. He will note that it is in a catchment area. Most of the pupils are not from Dublin 4, but from Dublin 2, including areas like Pearse Street. Many go to the school in City Quay, but because St. Brigid's national school is located in Dublin 4 people take the view it is not necessary to fund it on the basis that it is a well off school. That is not the case. The school <Col N="758" /> has 11 teachers. The remedial teachers and home-school liaison service are shared. It has no resource teacher, psychological service, Department funded secretary or caretaker. In terms of facilities, the school has no hall or all-purpose room. It rents the parish hall one day a week when it is not being used by people from the parish. It has no computer room or parent meeting room.</P>
    <P>I know the parents and they are passionately concerned about the welfare of their children and the school. They want their children to receive a good education. They feel they are being pushed to one side and that they are not a priority. This is discrimination for all the wrong reasons. I ask the Minister to meet the parents if possible and to do everything he can to facilitate their request.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising the need for a remedial teacher at St. Brigid's national school, Haddington Road. As has been indicated to the House in the past, remedial education at primary level is a matter in the first instance for the ordinary class teachers. The majority of pupils with remedial needs would, therefore, be helped within the scope of the normal teaching service. However, it is acknowledged that remedial teachers constitute the main additional resource for addressing the problem of under-achievement in primary schools. St. Brigid's national school, Haddington Road, Dublin 4, has the service of a remedial teacher on a shared basis with St. Mary's boys national school, Haddington Road.</P>
      <P>I recently allocated 60 remedial teaching posts to national schools with effect from September 1998. There are now 1,302 remedial teacher posts in place in national schools. It is estimated that 91 per cent of primary school pupils attend schools which are served by a remedial teacher. Of the 405 primary schools in County Dublin, 383 have the services of a remedial teacher, either on a full-time or shared basis. This means 98 per cent of primary school pupils in County Dublin have access to a remedial teacher.</P>
      <P>My capacity to allocate additional remedial teaching posts in any given year depends on resource availability and the level of competing demands from other special needs areas. I am pleased to advise the Deputy that I recently announced a major initiative to tackle educational disadvantage at all levels. As part of this initiative I have arranged for a remedial teacher service to be made available to all primary schools with effect from September 1999. Mainstream schools with a pupil-teacher ratio of below 10:1, and which currently have no service, may apply for a service where they can demonstrate the particular needs of their pupils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Part of the issue here is an historic deficit. There are still approximately 700 primary schools with no service, not even on a shared basis. I con<Col N="759" /> sidered my priority from the budget package should be to create a service for these schools. We will look again at the situation pertaining to St. Brigid's national school. I cannot promise any- thing between now and May, but we will consider the matter again before September, given what the Deputy has outlined, to see if we can be of further assistance to the school and the area generally.</P>
    <P>I accept the Deputy's comments on percep<Col N="760" /> tions. I was not in office when the designated disadvantaged scheme was initiated. I presume the scheme did not operate on the basis of addresses or perceptions. I hope it operated on the basis of incomes, the socio-economic status of parents, etc. However, times change and situations can deteriorate. I will do what we can to be of assistance to the school in the forthcoming school year.</P>

      <P>In determining the overall size and content of my Department's annual water and sewerage services investment programme, account is taken of existing commitments and the schemes submitted for funding by local authorities. At £275 million, the 1999 programme which I announced last Monday is at a record level &ndash; 50 per cent up on expenditure in 1998 and double what was spent in 1996.</P>
      <P>Except for the rural water programme, my Department does not make annual capital allocations to local authorities under the water and sewerage services investment programme. This programme is determined by reference to individual projects submitted by local authorities prioritised on the basis of statutory obligations, EU directives, health and safety, environmental impacts, and support of economic development. The formal documentation which local authorities are required to submit in support of each project is supplemented by an ongoing process of discussions and correspondence between my Department and local authorities.</P>
      <P>The serviced land initiative for which capital is provided under the 1999 programme was determined last year on the basis of submissions from local authorities in response to a specific request for proposals from me.</P>
      <P>In the case of the rural water programme, capital allocations are made to individual local authorities on the basis of the multi-annual work programmes submitted by county councils which are updated annually to reflect changing local priorities. The recommendations of the National Rural Water Monitoring Committee are also taken into account in determining capital allocations, including block grants, to individual local authorities for devolved schemes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I received copies of the Irish Home Builders' Association's voluntary code of practice on Monday the day it was launched. Although it is a voluntary code in the sense that the industry has developed the code itself, I understand that adherence to the code will be mandatory for all members of the association. The introduction by the industry of such a voluntary code of practice was, of course, one of the recommendations of the Bacon report. The report also recommended that if this approach does not work, widening of the statutory role of the Director of Consumer Affairs in this area should be considered.</P>
      <P>The protection afforded to the new house purchaser by the prevention of an increase in price and prohibition on acceptance of any offer from any other party for a seven week period following payment of a booking deposit represents an improvement on the current situation.</P>
      <P>The Government's approach in relation to elimination of gazumping is to pursue practical measures, through support for the introduction of a code of practice, which will help to improve the situation in the short-term, while also arranging to have the possibility of any appropriate legal response carefully and thoroughly examined.</P>
      <P>To this end and following an approach by me in this regard, I understand that the Attorney General has requested the Law Reform Commission to review the procedure of payment of booking deposits and the associated practice of gazumping and to submit to the Attorney General proposals for reform in respect of those matters, if any, that the commission considers appropriate.</P>
      <P>While the effects of the Irish Home Builders' Association's code of practice remain to be seen, it is necessary to have the scope for a legislative approach thoroughly examined. The Law Reform Commission is best positioned to do this. The possibility of a legislative approach to gazumping if the voluntary approach does not work should help to ensure maximum commitment by all concerned to ensuring the effectiveness of the code of practice.</P>
      <P>It should also be noted that the action taken by the Government to curb overheating in the housing market will help to remove the conditions in which practices such as gazumping can develop and there is evidence which suggests a moderation in the rate of house price increases.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12, 16 and 55 together.</P>
      <P>Directive 94/62/EC on packaging and packaging waste requires Ireland to achieve recovery rates of 25 per cent or more for packaging by 30 June 2001 and 50 per cent or more by 31 December 2005.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the principle of producer responsibility, Repak Ltd. was established by Irish industry to promote, co-ordinate and finance the collection and recovery of packaging waste, so as to achieve these national recycling-recovery targets. Repak Ltd. is an approved body under the Waste Management (Packaging) Regulations, 1997, and businesses participating in its waste recovery scheme are exempt from obligations which would otherwise apply under the regulations.</P>
      <P>Repak Limited's activities are financed by fees from these member businesses. The income generated has to date been applied mainly to support the collection and recovery of packaging waste from the domestic waste stream. In this regard, I understand that in 1998, financial assistance amounting to over £1 million was provided to Kerbside Dublin and Gandon Enterprises Ltd., the Rehab Recycling Partnership, to assist their recycling activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that useful progress has been made by Repak Ltd. since it became operational in July 1997 but that there is considerable scope for further expansion of its packaging waste recovery activities. Accordingly, I welcome current proposals by the company substantially to develop its operations during 1999. In addition to providing ongoing support for the recovery of domestic packaging waste, I am aware that Repak Ltd. intends to significantly expand its staffing structure; arrange for the free collection of up to nearly 90,000 tonnes of in-house packaging waste generated by members; enter into contractual arrangements for the recycling of up to 112,000 tonnes of packaging waste; support the development by an appropriate urban authority of an integrated &ldquo;kerbside&rdquo; collect scheme for domestic packaging waste, and expand the advisory, <Col N="764" /> training and support services provided to members.</P>
    <P>I will continue to closely monitor developments during 1999, in constructive consultation with the company.</P>
    <P>Each local authority is responsible for the enforcement of the Waste Management (Packaging) Regulations, 1997, within its functional area, and all authorities are expected to take requisite measures to ensure that packaging producers comply with their obligations under the regulations. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government has on several recent occasions underlined to local authorities the importance which we attach to the success of this important recycling initiative.</P>
    <P>The Environmental Protection Agency has been tasked with a range of specialised and complex functions, which are either inappropriate to, or require expertise which is unavailable to, local authorities generally. On this basis, it is not apparent that enforcement of the 1997 regulations is a function which is appropriate to the agency, or that it could reasonably be expected to deploy resources equivalent to those cumulatively available to local authorities around the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 and 19 together.</P>
      <P>House price returns received to date from lending institutions for the December quarter suggest a moderation in the rate of house price increases and this is supported by views from market sources and commentators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The measures introduced in the Government's, Action on House Prices, addressed factors that were causing overheating or distortions in the market and were designed to restore a better balance between supply and demand. Measures to assist first-time buyers formed a key element of the package, including removal of fiscal incentives to investors, who had been pricing low-income buyers out of the housing market; an increase in the income limits for the local auth<Col N="765" /> ority shared ownership scheme; significant reductions in stamp duty rates, particularly at lower price levels; and measures to boost housing supply, through the serviced land initiative and increased residential density.</P>
    <P>Increasing the supply of housing remains the key element of the Government's housing policy. The measures in Action on House Prices are designed to secure a continuation of the growth in housing output and alleviate the bottlenecks or constraints on housing supply. Housing output reached a new record for the fourth successive year in 1998 at over 41,500 units, and we are actually building new houses at twice the level of 1993. The 1999 water and sewerage investment programme, launched earlier this week, is again at a record level. Over £275 million will be spent on water and sewerage infrastructural development this year and the potential for this investment to bring more residential land into service will be maximised.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the serviced land initiative should yield in the region of 100,000 additional housing sites over this year and next, through £44 million of Exchequer funding being spent on water, sewerage and roads infrastructure specifically to open up extra land for housing.</P>
    <P>Increased residential density is a further key element in the Government's strategy to increase housing supply. Planning authorities have been advised to promote higher densities at appropriate locations and planning guidelines on residential density will be published shortly in draft for public consultation.</P>
    <P>The full effect of many of these measures, particularly those designed to promote housing supply, will only be seen in the medium term. However, positive effects have already been reported by market sources, including indications of easing in house prices, investors no longer squeezing first-time buyers out of the starter home market, and increase in the number of second-hand houses coming on the market, as a result of stamp duty reductions.</P>
    <P>Ongoing implementation of the Government's strategy and monitoring of its effects remains a priority for my Department to ensure that all of the measures produce beneficial results as soon as possible.</P>

These disqualifications will be removed pending the elimination of the dual mandate pursuant to the comprehensive legislation to which I have referred.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 and 60 together.</P>
      <P>In 1998 my Department recouped £19.2 million to the four Dublin local authorities in respect of their expenditure on accommodation for homeless people and emergency accommodation for asylum seekers. The provision in 1999 for these recoupments is £20 million.</P>
      <P>A substantial part of funding provided under the voluntary housing capital assistance schemes has been used to meet the capital cost of emergency, transitional and long-term accommodation for homeless people. I recently announced substantial increases in the funding limits of the scheme designed to improve the capacity of voluntary bodies to provide accommodation under the scheme. The provision in 1999 for projects under the scheme has been increased by 10 per cent to £16.486 million.</P>
      <P>The capital funding for the provision by local authorities of hostel accommodation or other suitable short-term or transitional housing for homeless people has been increased from £2 million in 1998 to £4 million in 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Local authorities also have powers under section 10 of the Housing Act, 1988, to provide or fund the cost of accommodation for homeless people. This includes contributions to voluntary bodies providing such accommodation, meeting the cost of accommodation arranged directly by local authorities themselves or by health boards on their behalf, and funding appropriate resettle<Col N="767" /> ment and other initiatives to assist homeless people. My Department recoups 90 per cent of these costs to local authorities.</P>
    <P>The total funding available for the Dublin homeless initiative is £600,000, of which £350,000 is provided by Dublin Corporation and £250,000 by the Eastern Health Board. My Department recoups 90 per cent of the corporation's funding to the initiative.</P>
    <P>In relation to the number of homeless persons, I have asked local authorities, in guidelines issued to them on 17 November in relation to the next assessment of homelessness to be carried out in March 1999, to ensure that every effort is made to record accurately the total number of homeless people in their functional areas. To this end, I have asked them to consult and liaise with adjoining local authorities, health boards and voluntary bodies providing accommodation and services for homeless people in their areas. In addition, the guidelines suggest a survey over a period of a week rather than on a specific date, in an effort to more accurately identify the extent of homelessness.</P>
    <P>The last such assessment was in respect of the position at 29 March 1996 and details of that assessment, on a local authority basis, are contained in Part XIII of the Department's Housing Statistics Bulletin for 1996, copies of which are in the Oireachtas Library.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputies to the reply to Question No. 26 of 5 March 1998 which outlines the latest information provided to my Department by local fire authorities regarding the age of their fire appliances.</P>
      <P>The provision of fire appliances for its brigades is the responsibility of local fire authorities in accordance with the provisions of section 10 of the Fire Services Act, 1981.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department provides capital grants towards certain expenditure incurred by fire authorities including the purchase of appliances. Total capital provided in my Department's Vote in 1999 for the fire service is £6.872 million, giving an increase of £1.839 million or 37 per cent over the original 1998 allocation. It is anticipated that <Col N="769" /> approximately one third of the 1999 capital will be used to fund appliances.</P>
    <P>In 1997 and 1998, fire authorities were given approval to invite tenders for 24 new appliances.

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The EU Commission last week announced that it had approved the capital allowances for buildings in the Custom House docks area; this approval to apply to 31 December 1999 &ndash; in certain cases up to June 2000 &ndash; and retrospectively. The Commission has indicated that it regards this measure as a regional investment aid in accordance with Article 92 (3) of the EC Treaty. With regard to the wider Dublin docklands area and the general urban renewal schemes, which have not been approved by the Commission as yet, the implications of the EU decision are likely to be that capital allowances by reason of their status as investment aid can continue in use.</P>
      <P>However, the application of double rent allowances and rates remissions to commercial-industrial development are considered by the Commission to constitute operating aid and consequently are not allowable under the relevant EU treaty provisions except in limited circumstances. The extent to which these may be applied in the context of future urban renewal schemes remains to be determined.</P>
      <P>The Commission has announced that it is initiating formal proceedings in respect of these incentives as applied to the Custom House docks area since May 1993. The Government intends to strongly defend the application of these allowances when replying to the Commission and has very strong arguments against any retrospection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new urban renewal scheme was notified to the Commission last September by the Minister for Finance. The introduction of the scheme has had to be deferred pending EU approval to the proposed incentives related to commercial and industrial development. The Commission has raised with the Irish authorities a number of queries in relation to the urban renewal scheme submitted. A reply to these will be issued shortly by the Department of Finance. It is expected that <Col N="770" /> the 1994 urban renewal scheme will be discussed by the Irish authorities with the EU Commission in the context of approving the new urban renewal scheme.</P>
    <P>Pending the outcome of the negotiations with the EU the impact on the urban renewal scheme cannot be fully ascertained at this stage.</P>

In considering security of tenure issues, there is a need to achieve a fair balance between the rights of both tenants and landlords in a way that is compatible with <Col N="771" /> constitutional requirements and that ensures a continuing investment in the provision and maintenance of rented accommodation. I will be considering, in conjunction with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, what further action may be warranted and open to us in relation to security of tenure of rented accommodation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 25, 29 and 39 together.</P>
      <P>I have directed that the next comprehensive assessments of local authority housing needs should be carried out by local authorities on 31 March. Guidelines on the undertaking of the assessments have been issued to all local authorities. The assessment will provide details of the extent and nature of housing needs in each local authority area.</P>
      <P>The last statutory assessment of local authority housing needs was carried out on 29 March 1996 and disclosed that the number of households assessed then as in need of local authority housing was 27,400. Details of that assessment, including a breakdown of need by category and household structure, including the number of dependent children, is given in my Department's housing statistics bulletin for 1996 which is available in the Library. Similar information in relation to 1993 was published in the housing statistics bulletin for that year.</P>
      <P>On foot of the commitment in the Government's Action Programme for the Millennium to a continuing house construction programme by local authorities and voluntary groups and in response to increasing needs, the local authority housing programme for 1999 is being expanded to 4,500 starts. This is the highest number of starts in any year since 1986. Significantly increased capital resources are being provided for the local authority housing programmes in 1999; almost £230 million is now available, an increase of £35 million on last year. This will meet expenditure commitments on the ongoing programme at end 1998 as well as the starts authorised for 1999.</P>
      <P>In meeting social housing needs, the local authority housing programme is supplemented by a range of other social housing measures, such as voluntary housing, shared ownership, etc. It is for each housing authority to develop the full potential of the various measures open to them to respond to housing needs in their area and I have regularly exhorted authorities to do so. Improvements I have made during 1998 in the voluntary housing capital assistance and shared ownership schemes will result in increased housing output from these schemes in 1999.</P>
      <P>I expect that about 3,700 houses will be completed or purchased by local authorities in 1999. These, together with output from the complementary social housing measures and vacancies occurring in the existing housing stock, will enable some 10,250 households to be catered for in 1999 compared to 9,300 in 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="773" /> I am confident that the greatly increased provision for the social housing programmes for 1999 will considerably enhance the capacity of local authorities to meet social housing needs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 26 and 44 together.</P>
      <P>Within the framework of the DTI strategy and the DTO short-term action plan a wide range of initiatives is being taken to respond to the growth in traffic in the Dublin area. These include major infrastructural projects such as the Luas, the Dublin Port Tunnel and the completion of the Dublin C-Ring; improvements in public transport, through the provision of QBCs, additional buses, additional rolling stock for DART and suburban rail, and the upgrading of suburban rail lines and improvements in traffic and parking management.</P>
      <P>The DTO short-term action plan, which has been broadly endorsed by the Government, is designed to advance and accelerate a set of measures, consistent with the DTI strategy, which can be completed in the period up to end 2000. Its focus is on public transport enhancement, traffic and parking management and the provision of cycling facilities. Detailed objectives include: completion by end 2000 of the original 11 QBC network and the provision of a QBC serving Ballymun; provision by end of 1999 of an additional 150 buses by Dublin Bus; provision of additional rolling stock for DART; lengthening of 12 outer suburban and key DART station platforms; upgrading of Maynooth-Clonsilla rail line and completion of 160 kilometres of cycle tracks by end 2000.</P>
      <P>Implementation of the short-term action plan is being undertaken by the various local authorities and CIE under the co-ordination of the DTO. The 1999 Estimates include an increased provision of £24 million for the DTO, up from £9 million in 1998 and £7 million in 1997 &ndash; to fund key elements of the short-term action plan, and £17 million for the provision of additional buses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the publication of the short-term action <Col N="774" /> plan the Minister for Finance has also announced in the Budget Statement: an additional £2 million towards the cost of pilot park and ride facilities in the Dublin area; the inclusion in the forthcoming Finance Act of tax incentives to promote park and ride facilities and of provisions to remove BIK taxation of public transport passes provided by employers for their employees, and a review of the potential for BIK taxation of workplace parking.</P>
    <P>For the longer term, the DTO has begun the process of updating the original DTI strategy. This will lead to the publication of a revised and updated strategy for the period 2000 to 2016 and a detailed investment and implementation programme for the period 2000 to 2006. The intention is to complete this updating work by end 1999, with an interim report not later than mid-year to assist the preparation of the new National Development Plan.</P>
    <P>The general view of the principal agencies involved is that the recent Operation Freeflow achieved considerable success. The possibility of extending this initiative beyond the Christmas period is now being considered.</P>

      <P>On 9 June 1998, I announced that I had commissioned a study of the planning implications of large scale retail development in Ireland and that, as an immediate interim measure pending the preparation of detailed planning guidelines, I had made a policy directive and regulations under the Planning Acts to limit the size of supermarket developments to 3,000 sq. metres of retail floor space.</P>
      <P>Tenders were invited to carry out the consultancy and, following consideration of the tenders received, Roger Tym and Partners were appointed as lead consultants in association with Irish partners on 22 October 1998.</P>
      <P>A copy of the full terms of reference is being circulated with the Official Report but they can be summarised as follows. The consultants have been asked to address all of the planning issues in relation to large scale retail developments, including the socio-economic aspects and, in particular, to identify the amount and location of existing large scale retail and supermarket development and to estimate the amount, type and phasing of retail development needed in Ireland over the next ten years. They are also to consider the implications of large scale retail development for sustainable development and the availability of an adequate and diverse retail service for all members of the community, including those without private car transport. Relevant international experience is also to be examined. The consultants are also to report on the impact of the 1982 and 1998 directives and to recommend the policies most appropriate to Irish circumstances. On the basis of these policies they are to draw up draft planning guidelines.</P>
      <P>The budget for the consultancy is £48,550 +VAT. Roger Tym and Partners, the lead firm, is a consultancy, based in London, which specialises in property development, planning and urban and regional economics. The firm has wide experience in the retail sector internationally and has carried out retail studies in Ireland.</P>
      <P>I expect to be able to publish draft planning guidelines at the end of February 1999, to allow for public consultation and all interested parties will be able to comment before the guidelines are adopted in the final form.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 31 and 41 together.</P>
      <P>There has been a significantly increased commitment of State expenditure in recent years aimed at systematically improving our non-national roads. Total State allocations for non-national roads increased by 18 per cent in 1998 over 1997 (in relation to initial year allocations). For 1999, a total of over £237 million in non-national road grants will be provided, mainly through the new local government fund, which I have established; this will represent a further annual increase of almost 19 per cent.</P>
      <P>The Government is committed to ensuring sufficient resources to enable the restoration programme to be completed over the ten years originally envisaged. As firm evidence of this commitment, I provided over £118 million in restoration grants in 1998 as compared with £93.3 million in 1997. This has accelerated the programme and has allowed county councils to undertake almost 90 per cent of their 1999 restoration improvement schemes in 1998. During 1998 approximately 5,800 road schemes were financed across the country, with some 8,700 kms of road benefiting from the expenditure involved. Since mid 1995, when the restoration programme was launched, to the end of 1998 about 15,400 schemes were completed with approximately over 24,300 kilometres or almost 28 per cent of the county council network benefiting.</P>
      <P>In addition to restoration programme grants my Department allocated nearly £52 million to local authorities in 1998 under the various EU co-funded schemes of grants and almost £30 million to local authorities in discretionary grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I intend next week to announce details of 1999 <Col N="777" /> non-national road grant allocations to local authorities.</P>

      <P>There were 62 dog wardens, including part-time wardens, employed by local authorities at the end of 1997, the latest year for which figures are available. Under the provisions of the Dog Control Acts, relevant local authorities are required to employ one or more persons to be dog wardens for their functional area. Subject to this, it is a matter for each local authority, in the context of local circumstances and Government policy on staffing, to determine the number of persons to be employed as dog wardens.</P>
      <P>With effect from 1 February 1999, dog licence fees will be increased from £5 to £10 for an individual licence and from £100 to £200 for a general dog licence. The additional income accruing to local authorities should assist them to step up their dog control activities, where they consider this appropriate.</P>

      <P>The Dublin Taxi Forum addressed a comprehensive set of recommendations in September 1998 to a range of agencies: Government Departments, the Garda, local authorities and taxi service providers.</P>

      <P>Ireland's current commitments under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change relate to the period up to the end of the current decade. Within the context of EU climate change policy, Ireland's CO2 abatement strategy is based on the objective of limiting the increase in CO2 emissions to 20 per cent above 1990 levels by 2000. Ireland's second national communication under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, July 1997, set out policies and measures adopted towards meeting this objective, and the response to Questions Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive, on Thursday 19 November 1998 provided examples of additional measures adopted since the publication of the national communication. A copy of the national communication is in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>Under the Kyoto Protocol, Ireland's target is to limit the increase in emissions of greenhouse gases to 13 per cent above 1990 levels in the period 2008-12. I refer to the reply to Questions Nos. 684 and 690 on Wednesday 27 January 1999, in relation to the development of the national greenhouse gas abatement strategy to meet our Kyoto commitments and in regard to CO2 emissions data for 1999.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The building regulations, which have been in effect since 1992, <Col N="783" /> place a duty on persons constructing or extending public buildings to cater for the needs of disabled people. Otherwise, the regulations generally do not apply to existing public buildings. The provision of access facilities to other existing buildings is a matter for the owners and occupiers of the building concerned.</P>
      <P>Departments and local authorities have been asked by my Department on a number of occasions over the years to ensure that appropriate provision is made for access facilities for disabled people to all buildings under their control. As part of their response to Delivering Better Government, Departments have undertaken to prepare customer action plans to improve the quality of services they provide to the public; access to public offices for people with disabilities is one of the issues to be addressed in this context.</P>
      <P>Local building control authorities are responsible for monitoring and enforcement of compliance with the regulations. It is, therefore, a matter for the authority to inspect public buildings to which the regulations apply. I have no power to issue a direction requiring inspections of any category of buildings, irrespective of whether they are covered by the building regulations or not. However, since my appointment as Minister in 1997, I have been urging local authorities to appoint building control officers and have sanctioned the necessary additional posts and increased building control fees. I now understand that 31 out of 37 authorities have appointed officers and the balance are in the process of making such appointments.</P>

      <P>As stated in reply to Question No. 137 of 17 December 1998, the present speed limit regime in Ireland arises from a comprehensive review of speed limits carried out between 1990 and 1992 as well as new arrangements for the application of limits introduced by the Road Traffic Act, 1994. The Government strategy for road safety 1998-2002 makes clear that changes to this regime are not proposed in the short-term: the immediate term priority is to secure a much higher level of compliance with existing speed limits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the strategy also indicates that the option of revising speed limits downwards if enforcement of existing limits does not show good progress towards the strategy goal of reducing present levels of excessive speeding by 50 per cent. As a basis for monitoring the situation, the <Col N="784" /> National Roads Authority will carry out a comprehensive national speed survey later this year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Last Monday, I announced my Department's water and sewerage services investment programme for 1999 which contains a range of measures to expand the water supply infrastructure to meet domestic and industrial demand, to improve treatment and to conserve water supplies. This year's provision of over £275 million represents a 50 per cent increase on expenditure on these services in 1998 and is more than double the provision for these services in 1996. Between 1994 and the end of 1999 over £960 million will have been spent on water and sewerage services which, even allowing for adjustments for inflation, is well in excess of the £605 million envisaged in the National Development Plan 1994-99.</P>
      <P>This 1999 programme includes 18 major public water schemes to commence construction this year at a cost of £61 million, a further 16 to continue construction at a cost of £79 million and 27 schemes worth £152 million to be advanced through planning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A major programme of water conservation works comprising 15 schemes with a total cost of just under £50 million will also continue this year. Thirteen of these schemes are already under way and the remaining two will commence in the <Col N="785" /> short-term. The water conservation programme includes the Dublin region water conservation scheme which aims to reduce leakage in the water supply systems in the region from 40 per cent to 20 per cent of water produced within the next few years, saving an estimated 22 million gallons of water per day.</P>
    <P>I have also commissioned consultants to carry out a national water audit entailing the collection and analysis of data for each of the medium to large public water supplies which have not yet been the subject of a study to assess the adequacy of existing systems for each area served and to make recommendations as to the appropriate approach for improving inadequate supplies to cater for existing and future demand. The consultants are due to report by the end of this year.</P>
    <P>Annual EPA reports on the quality of drinking water in Ireland confirm the fundamentally good quality of drinking water supplies. These reports show, however, quality deficiencies in privately sourced group water supplies which serve about 5 per cent of households in the country. This year's investment programme includes over £28 million for an expanded rural water programme to address these deficiencies and to provide additional group and small public water supplies. The 1999 provision represents an increase of almost 34 per cent on capital expenditure on the rural water programme in 1998. The programme will fund a range of existing measures including capital grants for the new group supplies or for the takeover or upgrading of existing supplies, subsidies towards the operational costs of group supplies, individual well grants and grants for small public water schemes. It also includes £3 million, as the first tranche of a £5 million package announced in the budget, to support a much more comprehensive quality testing regime for group supplies. The outputs from this new measure will provide essential information to guide future policy initiatives aimed at redressing poor quality group supplies.</P>
    <P>The Government has also committed £39 million of Exchequer funding for the provision of water and sewerage services to support residential development through the serviced land initiative. I approved a total of 161 schemes under the initiative last year with an estimated value of £100 million which will provide over 100,000 additional housing sites within the next few years.</P>
    <P>My Department, along with other Departments, the regional authorities and the social partners, are involved in a process of prioritising investment for the period of the next National Development Plan 2000-6. The need for future investment in water treatment and distribution capacity is being assessed as part of this process.</P>

On the other hand, some local authorities may prohibit such development, allowing houses to be built for occupation only by people from the area or working in the area.</P>
      <P>Local authorities have a number of options to ensure that holiday homes purchasers do not price local house buyers out of the market, including: providing sites on favourable terms for local people with modest incomes, providing houses for sale under the shared ownership scheme and making provision in the development plan restricting planning permission to houses which will be used for full-time occupation only in the interests of proper planning and development and to protect amenities.</P>
      <P>I am aware of concerns that the seaside resort scheme has contributed to higher house prices in some areas. However, the scheme is due to terminate on 31 December next. This scheme is the responsibility of the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation who, I understand, is carrying out a review of it.</P>

In order to ensure that local auth<Col N="789" /> orities are aware of the risks posed to their services by year 2000 compliance problems and to give them guidance and assistance in dealing with them, the Local Government Computer Services Board wrote to each local authority in April 1997 advising them of the need to set up special groups to deal with the issue and to carry out an inventory of systems.</P>
      <P>The LGCSB has continued to provide advice and assistance to local authorities on the Year 2000 issue and has set up user groups and web support. A special working group has also been put in place to deal with the critical area of water and sewerage plants. The working group is monitoring the progress of year 2000 remedial work in the local authorities to ensure that all systems are made compliant. The LGCSB was also recently appointed a team of international consultants who have specific expertise in relation to water systems. These consultants will provide expert assistance to the local authorities.</P>
      <P>Individual local authorities have also engaged consultants to assist in their year 2000 preparations.

      <P>The incorporation of no claims discounts in individual policies and the implementation of the no claims discount system are designed to reward safer driving on the part of motor insurance policyholders. Insurers may set premiums and <Col N="791" /> impose loadings in the light of their underwriting experience and regulate their no claims discount systems in the light of their claims experience. There is a general misconception that no claims discounts are no blame discounts and, therefore, that no claims discounts will not be affected unless and until blame has been established against the policyholder. That is not the case, and, in the event of an accident where the insurer is committed to an outlay the policyholder may lose some or all of the no claims discount. Some insurers allow claims up to a certain value before any discount is lost. In other cases it may be more economical for the policyholder to bear the cost of the claim (e.g. car repair) where the amount of the claim is less than the loss of a no claims discount or the imposition of a loading.</P>
      <P>In the case referred to by the Deputy, payment by the insurer of a third party claim resulted in a reduction in the level of the policyholder's no claims discount from 70 per cent to 30 per cent. The insurer has confirmed that the no claims discount reduction was made in accordance with the terms of the motor insurance policy. The insurer also indicated that, normally, the no claims discount would not be reinstated immediately following an accident which results in a payment of compensation. However, in this instance, I understand that the insurer, taking into consideration the fact that it was a small claim and that their policyholder had been insured with that company, accident free, since 1972, has decided that the motorist's full no claims discount should be reinstated.</P>
      <P>In general, I have also been informed by the Information Service of the Irish Insurance Federation that certain authorised insurers may agree to grant discounts of motor premium rates where the policyholder is prepared to accept a policy excess greater than the excess provided for under a specific policy.</P>

      <P>As part of the preparations for the initial public offering (IPO) of shares in Telecom Éireann which is planned for around the middle of this year, depending on market conditions, it was appropriate for me, based on recommendations from the advisers engaged by my Department, to review the structure of the board of Telecom Éireann.</P>
      <P>My advisers strongly recommended that the board of Telecom Éireann should be strengthened, as soon as possible and in advance of the IPO, by the appointment of new non-executive members who had wide experience of board membership of major listed companies and relevant international industry/telecoms experience and of an additional executive director. The board should attract the confidence of institutional investors, whose focus would be seen as driving shareholder value into the future and which would position the company for the IPO and post flotation.</P>
      <P>Against this background, I met individually with each of the five non-executive directors and, having explained the position to them, I asked them to consider relinquishing their position on the board. As the Deputy will be aware, four agreed to resign, while one decided to remain on the board. I also met with the chairman of the board at that time who agreed to relinquish that position and to accept the position of deputy chairman of the board. It was entirely a matter for each individual concerned to consider their position and I left the matter with each of them on that basis.</P>
      <P>I should stress that my request to them to relinquish their position was in no way a reflection on the integrity, reputation or competence of the people concerned who are all of the highest standing and have served admirably as members of the board. However, the advice available to me was that I should seek to appoint new board members with particular expertise and experience and I explained this to each person when I met them.</P>
      <P>As regards the criteria for further new appointments to the board of Telecom Éireann, there is currently only one vacancy on the board. Based on the advice available to me, this position is being reserved for the appointment of a further executive director and will be filled in due course.  Furthermore, over the coming months there will be discussions with the Strategic Partners in Telecom Éireann as well as with the Union Coalition and the Worker Directors Group of ICTU in relation to the structure of the board post IPO.</P>

    <P>The fee payable to each of the new directors is <Col N="794" /> the standard fee of £5,000 per annum, while the new chairman will receive a fee of £7,500 per annum. The deputy chairman will also retain his current fee level of £7,500 per annum on a personal basis.</P>

      <P>The person concerned applied for one animal on a ten month special beef premium application on the 25 February 1998. The herdowner received £72.13, which is 80 per cent of the total amount payable. The balance of full entitlement has yet to be determined as it depends on the usage of Ireland's quota for 1998. It is expected that the herdowner will receive the balancing payment on his ten month special beef premium application in early April.

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed with the current level of cattle prices being paid by meat factories, particularly in view of the fact that the more effective intervention support arrangements, which I successfully negotiated with the EU Commission last Autumn, have been extended for the first quarter of 1999.</P>
      <P>While these improved market supports have helped to stabilise prices which were in freefall prior to their introduction last October due to the Russian crisis, I believe that there is now scope for higher prices based on current market indicators. The market imbalance between supply and demand on EU markets has been corrected for the present, at least, leading to strong cattle prices on Community markets. The demand for export licence certificates by Irish traders indicates a relatively buoyant third country trade which is being underpinned by an export refund level worth up to 51p/lb carcase weight following the 9p/lb increase last Autumn. Accordingly, I believe that these factors, in addition to the flexible intervention arrangements, should provide for a market price well above current levels.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, both my Department and Bord Bia are working together to extend the range of market outlets for Irish beef and cattle exports. I expect exports to Iran to recommence again shortly following my successful visit to that country last autumn.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of property transfers, stamp duty, at the appropriate rate, has always been levied on the full amount of the relevant value transferring. It is not correct to state that there is an anomaly in the present system. The idea of introducing a system whereby the rate of duty would be applied on successive bands of property values has been periodically examined in the past. The last such occasion on which a detailed examination was carried out was during the period 1996-97. At that time it was estimated that the introduction of such a system would cost about £40 million per annum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bacon report which examined house prices last year and which was acted upon immediately by the Government recommended a general reduction in the rates of stamp duty. The rationale behind the stamp duty recommendation contained in the Bacon report was to create mobility within the housing market. The Government accepted this rationale and as the Deputy knows, reduced the rates of duty and changed the bands <Col N="800" /> applying to all residential property of less than £500,000 in value.</P>
    <P>Given that the Government recently changed the stamp duty regime applying to residential property and because of the very significant costs that would be involved in the Deputy's proposal, I have no plans to make further changes to the stamp duty regime at this time.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 94 and 95 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision of services at St. Luke's Hospital is a matter for the South Eastern Health Board <Col N="801" /> in the first instance. I understand from the board that, in common with other acute hospitals, St. Luke's has been under pressure due to the level of activity in medical admissions at this time of year. To deal with this situation, the board has provided additional resources to increase home support services, nursing home places and increased use of district hospital beds as step-down facilities from St. Luke's Hospital. Additional staffing resources are also deployed by the board as the need arises and I understand from the board that improved communication mechanisms between primary care, G.P.'s and hospital staff has ensured appropriate use of existing facilities. The use of an at-risk register for elderly patients, together with the appointment of key workers for persons on this register has also commenced. In addition, the board is planning to up-grade facilities at Castlecomer District Hospital and to provide ten additional beds at Carlow District Hospital this year.</P>
    <P>I have provided the South Eastern Health Board with additional resources this year of £0.905 million to enable it to develop services for the care of the elderly, which will alleviate further pressure which may arise on St. Luke's Hospital and other acute hospitals in the board's area.</P>
    <P>A strategy for the development of acute hospital services has been adopted by the South Eastern Health Board and agreed in principle with my Department. This includes a strategy for <Col N="802" /> the development of orthopaedic services and is in line with the conclusion of a major review of orthopaedic services in the region which was completed in 1992 by a Joint Department of Health/Comhairle na n-Ospideál Expert Review Group.</P>
    <P>My Department is working with the board in planning the implementation of this strategy. Towards this end, a group has been established to plan the development at St. Luke's Hospital, including the development of psychiatric and elderly facilities on the St. Luke's campus.</P>

            <entry>Senior Management Development Programme. In line with the Department's Strategy Statement 1998-2001 &ldquo;Working for Health and Well-being&rdquo;, Management Development was highlighted as our priority training requirement for 1998-1999 and the area in which most investment would be made. Our objective is to provide a customised Management Development Programme to all APs, POs and equivalent professional and technical grades over the next year. The principle focus of this programme will be to provide participants with the essential people management and strategic management skills to successfully manage their respective sections in the Department. It is envisaged that between 100 and 120 staff will undertake this programme in the next eleven months.</entry>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department does not set a pay rate for this category of staff since the type of work performed varies considerably in different health board regions. It is correct. therefore, that the rate of pay applicable to staff categorised as family support workers varies throughout the country since these rates are determined by the employing authority on the basis of their particular requirements and type of task undertaken. It is a matter for the chief executive officer of each individual health board to decide on these issues. including the level of service required and the consequent rate of pay applicable. I understand that, following the lodgement of a pay claim, the health service employers agency has met with the unions representing the staff who are currently consulting their membership.</P>

      <P>The code of practice for safety at indoor concerts was published on 22 October 1998. The code, which will operate in a voluntary manner, sets out the minimum functional requirements for the safe organisation and management of concerts. It provides practical guidance and advice for promoters on a wide range of parameters relevant to crowd control such as event planning and management, crowd management, the use of barriers, stewarding, and emergency medical facilities. Other aspects dealt with include fire precautions and fire safety, structural matters, electrical installation and communications.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 108 to 112, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>Under section 8 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, a planning authority is required to keep a register in respect of all land within its functional area affected by that Act. A planning authority is not required to keep a register of exempted development &ndash; development for which planning permission is not required &ndash; and therefore would not necessarily be aware of the location of any mobile phone base stations which are exempted development under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Regulations, 1997 &ndash; S.I. No. 78 of 1997). Similarly there is no procedure whereby members of the public can submit comments to a planning authority on an exempted development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the responsibility of the planning authorities who have wide enforcement powers under planning legislation to halt and rectify unauthorised development. Anyone who feels that land is being developed or used without planning permission may contact the relevant planning authority who will investigate the matter. In addition any person may apply, in either the Circuit or <Col N="815" /> High Court, for an order restraining unauthorised development or use of land.</P>
    <P>Planning authorities do not have any statutory responsibility to inspect exempted development. All mobile phone operators are required under their licence to comply with the International Radiation Protection Association, IRPA, guidelines on non-ionising radiation or the equivalent European Pre-standard 50166-2. Monitoring of emissions from mobile telephony antennae is a matter for the Office of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation.</P>
    <P>My Department issued guidelines on telecommunications antennae and support structures to planning authorities in July 1996. The purpose of these guidelines is to assist planning authorities, An Bord Pleanála, operators of mobile telecommunications services and the general public by providing guidance on dealing with telecommunications antennae and support structures within the planning system. Therefore they give guidance on dealing with planning applications for mobile phone masts and do not relate to exempted development.</P>
    <P>The guidelines discuss the siting of masts and list the issues to be considered in agreeing on a site. For example in discussing visual impact the guidelines state that in the vicinity of larger towns and in city suburbs operators should endeavour to locate in industrial estates or in industrially zoned land. The guidelines then suggest that commercial and retail areas be explored and then state that &ldquo;only as a last resort should free-standing masts be located in a residential area or beside schools.&rdquo;  The guidelines note, however, that if such a location should become necessary, sites already developed for facilities should be considered. The guidelines, therefore, identify a hierarchy of suitable locations for new masts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department has involvement in the transfer of ownership of motor vehicles through the requirement to register such changes in the computerised national vehicle data base. Ownership change notifications fall into two categories: in the case of vehicles first registered on or after 1 January 1993, the seller is required to submit the notification of change directly to my Department. Unless there is some inaccuracy or other absent information on this notification the change is recorded within three working days and the new owner receives a vehicle licensing certificate in his or her name shortly afterwards; in the case of vehicles first registered prior to 1 January 1993 the notification of ownership change accompanied by the old style registration &ndash; log &ndash; book is initially submitted to the seller's local motor tax office who subsequently forward it to my Department for recording on the computer system. Some delays may occur with recording these transactions due primarily to the fact that the details of the change are not currently recorded where they are initially received.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy however, that my Department has been engaged in a major project to upgrade and modernise our computerised vehicle database. The initial phase of this new system came into operation in November 1998 at my Department's offices in Shannon, County Clare. This will be followed shortly by a new computer system in the Wexford motor tax office &ndash; pilot site &ndash; and subsequently by its installation in the remaining motor tax offices over a two year period. This network will facilitate the direct entry at local motor tax office level of vehicle licensing and change of ownership transactions and will avoid the existing time consuming task of transmitting such transactions to my Department for entry to the computer system.</P>
      <P>Due to the arrangements associated with the changeover to the new computer system some delays have arisen in relation to the recording of some transactions including change of vehicle ownership notifications received from motor tax offices, i.e. in the case of vehicles registered prior to 1 January 1993. However, every effort is being made to ensure that the period during which this situation exists will be kept to the minimum possible.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 118 and 119 together.</P>
      <P>The interest rate on local authority variable rate housing loans is determined by the Housing Finance Agency by reference to mortgage rates prevailing in the financial market. The rate is linked generally to building society mortgage rates and is currently being reviewed by the Housing Finance Agency in the light of reductions in mortgage rates announced in recent weeks. A further reduced rate for local authority housing loans will be announced shortly.</P>

      <P>My Department uses every method possible to make people aware of the various schemes and services it operates. These methods include information leaflets, factsheets, posters, advertising on radio, TV and newspapers, AERTEL, freephone and direct mailshots where appropriate. Technologies currently in use on the Internet, present new opportunities for the electronic gathering, organisation and publication of information. The Department's web site was established in May 1996 with the objective of providing up-to-date information directly to customers and to groups and agencies involved in distribution of information to the public.</P>
      <P>It is our aim that more customers should receive the necessary information at a local, scheme or regional level. There are designated information officers in the Department's 57 social welfare local offices. The Department places great emphasis on training our information officers and keeping them informed on the wide range of schemes that are available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our key objective is that the advice supplied is accurate, timely and relevant. We place a particu<Col N="822" /> lar emphasis on ensuring that customers are aware and avail of their full entitlements.</P>
    <P>The Department's central information services unit provides information directly to customers and also supports other areas of the Department in their dealings with customers.</P>
    <P>Leaflets and application forms are available in social welfare local offices, social welfare branch offices, public offices and some public libraries. Arrangements are also in place with An Post to display and distribute relevant leaflets and application forms through its offices. Leaflets are also available through Citizens Information Centres and in centres under the aegis of ICTU and the INOU. Information relating to particular categories of customers, for example, lone parents, emigrants, pensioners and people with disabilities, is available through their representative groups or through voluntary sector organisations dealing with the categories concerned.</P>
    <P>Co-operation between the Department and other organisations has also greatly helped the identification and addressing of specific information needs. Examples include the provision of comprehensive information guides for lone parents, the unemployed, employers, pensioners and emigrants.</P>
    <P>My Department takes a pro-active approach to targeting possible future beneficiaries of our schemes and services. An example is that persons receiving social welfare benefits are notified of their potential entitlement to retirement or old age (contributory) pension some three months before the pension becomes due at age 65 and 66 years respectively.</P>
    <P>A further example was the &ldquo;It Pays to Work&rdquo; campaign run by my Department in September 1998. Every unemployed person on the live register received a newsletter outlining the wide range of employment and educational supports available from my Department, FÁS and other State agencies.</P>
    <P>Through its agency, the National Social Service Board, the Department promotes and supports the development of independent advice and advocacy services throughout the country. These complement and enhance the information services provided at local and central level by my Department.</P>
    <P>I am continuing to examine further ways of addressing this issue so that the maximum take-up of my Department's schemes is achieved by; further developing the information service so that it is more pro-active, comprehensive and responsive and by participating in initiatives aimed at the development of an integrated approach to the provision of services, particularly information, at a local level.</P>

      <P>Under the various grants schemes, funding can be made available to community development and family support groups involved in programmes of self-help and personal development designed to tackle poverty and disadvantage and improve family life.</P>
      <P>Funding of organisations which provide rehabilitative services for offenders or ex-offenders is primarily the responsibility of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and is not a specific focus of the grants schemes operated by my Department.

      <P>During the period 1 January to 30 September 1997, my Department provided financial assistance to the Irish Refugee Council for a legal project which provided advice to asylum seekers at the first stage of the asylum process. The Irish Refugee Council then terminated their legal service to asylum seekers with effect from 1 October 1997 and a new scheme was set up by my Department to replace this service. That scheme in turn is now being replaced by a wholly independent legal service to asylum seekers to be provided by the Legal Aid Board with effect from the end of February.</P>
      <P>I understand that, last autumn, the Irish Refugee Council appointed an independent consultant to carry out a strategy review as to its future direction. The question of funding of the council's activities will be considered when this report is to hand and when the council has decided on its future plans.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 138 to 140, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>Manifestly unfounded applications for refugee status have caused significant problems for many countries and are a matter of concern to UNHCR because they cause delay and difficulties for genuine applicants. The executive committee of the UNHCR drew attention to the problem of manifestly unfounded or abusive applications for refugee status in its conclusion EXCOM No. 30 in 1983. The committee considered that national procedures &ldquo;may usefully include special provisions for dealing in an expeditious manner with applications which are considered to be so obviously without foundation as not to merit full examination..&rdquo;. EC Ministers also passed a resolution on the subject in 1992.</P>
      <P>The current procedures for processing manifestly unfounded applications are taken directly from section 12 of the Refugee Act, 1996, and take into account the UNHCR conclusion and the EC Ministers' resolution on manifestly unfounded applications.</P>
      <P>I have listened to the views of the UNHCR and NGO's in relation to appeals in cases which are deemed to be manifestly unfounded, as evidenced by the fact that I agreed to amend the procedures on 13 March 1998 to allow for an independent appeal process for cases deemed to be manifestly unfounded. The appeal is determined by an appeals authority, a person independent of myself and my Department with not less than seven years practice as a solicitor or barrister.</P>
      <P>I have no further plans to reform the procedure for processing manifestly unfounded applications at the present time.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 141 and 144 together.</P>
      <P>As I have indicated on several occasions, I am of the view that the Refugee Act in its current form is unworkable for a number of reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Act and its procedures were designed to process approximately 300 to 400 applications per year. However, we have experienced an enor<Col N="827" /> mous growth in the number of asylum seekers with over 4,600 applications recorded last year. The Act only provided for the appointment of one Refugee Applications Commissioner and one Appeal Board with no powers of delegation.</P>
    <P>I am now reviewing the 1996 Refugee Act in the light of other EU member states refugee legislation and having regard to the considerable experience subsequently gained in my Department in the operation of the refugee determination procedures over recent years.</P>
    <P>I cannot give the Deputy a precise timescale for completion of my review, but, he can be assured that there will be no undue delay in the matter.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 142, 143 and 147 together.</P>
      <P>The new refugee legal service will assist asylum seekers in exercising their legal rights in all aspects of the Irish asylum procedure. It will be an independent comprehensive service which will provide legal advice and representation for asylum seekers.</P>
      <P>The new legal service will be based at the one-stop-shop centre for asylum seekers at Lower Mount Street. It is my intention that it will be available by end February 1999. The staff for the service will be provided from the existing staff of the board and new staff to be recruited specially for this service. The recruitment process is ongoing and arrangements have been made for initial training to take place for all staff involved in the provision of this service. The refugee legal service will be ringfenced in terms of funding and resources from the existing law centre service and will not interfere with the existing commitments of the Legal Aid Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of the service, the Legal Aid Board will arrange for translation services to be made available on a contract basis. In addition, the board will also be responsible for setting up and manag<Col N="828" /> ing a facility to provide up-to-date background information on countries of origin.</P>
    <P>My Department currently provides £120 (plus VAT) per case in legal aid for asylum seekers to present their cases to the Appeals Authority. This amount is paid to the legal representatives, who are engaged independently by asylum seekers, on certification by the Appeals Authority that the representatives have acted in the case. The fee of £120 is the same as that paid by the Legal Aid Board under its private practitioners' scheme for legal services provided for certain District Court family law cases. This system will, of course, be replaced by the new refugee legal service.</P>

      <P>Because of the very wide spectrum of cases and the considerable backlog of applications which I inherited on taking office as Minister, it is difficult to identify an average time from start to finish of the asylum determination process which would have any real meaning.</P>
      <P>I can however inform the Deputy, that by the end of 1998, all applicants who had sought asylum in this State before January 1997 had been afforded the opportunity of a substantive interview. The first stage determination of asylum applications follows within a matter of weeks of the substantive interview in most cases. By July 1999 it is expected that all applicants who lodged a claim in 1997 will have been interviewed or offered an interview.</P>
      <P>Simultaneously the task force which I put in place to deal with this matter is dealing with a mixture of new and old applications. At the current rates of progress and based on current application figures, I am advised that the task force will have dealt with the entire backlog of applications by July 2000 and from that date will be processing applications within weeks of arrival.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 150 and 151 together.</P>
      <P>The probation and welfare service of my Department has developed a range of probation residences, training workshops and resource centres throughout the country to support the work of the service in the community.</P>
      <P>My Department in association with the probation and welfare service provide funding to specialised facilities. Those facilities are listed in the schedule. In 1998, £4.4 million was provided for this purpose.</P>
      <P>The majority of the projects direct their attention to the 15-25 age group and are primarily focused on those offenders placed on supervision by the courts to the probation and welfare service.</P>
      <P>The procedures and arrangements in place are as follows. Service personnel identify a need and endeavour to get co-operation from the local community through consultation. Then, a management committee is established with representation from the local community and State services, that is, gardaí, Probation and Welfare Service, vocational education committees, FÁS, professional and business community, who take responsibility for the establishment and management of the projects listed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the probation and welfare services is rep<Col N="831" /> resented on the board of management of the majority of these voluntary bodies, requests for funding are presented in various formats to this Department through the probation and welfare service. Depending on the type of project and relevance to the criminal justice system, funding of up to 95 per cent may be provided for operational purposes. In addition, occasional capital grants are paid to meet the special requirements of the projects.</P>
    <P>Weekly capitation payments are paid also to a variety of voluntary organisations who provide accommodation for offenders who have addiction problems and who are on supervision to the Probation and Welfare Service.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="832" /> Long term offenders who are on temporary release or on supervision under the Criminal Justice Act, 1960, have pre-release programmes agreed and following their release may be facilitated in a training centre or in employment.</P>
    <P>Organisations such as PACE and the Guild of St. Philip provide facilities for ex-prisoners, Priorswood House Hostel and Santry Workshop in the case of PACE. The Guild of St. Philip (St. Vincent de Paul) provide a range of services through its own facilities. The funding for all such projects in 1998 are set out also in the schedule.</P>
    <P>Also, small contributions are made to local voluntary organisations, for example, the Samaritans, at the discretion of Prison governors.</P>

      <P>Participation in education in Irish prisons is high by international standards. In recent years the number of prisoners voluntarily participating in education classes in the prison system has been consistently over 50 per cent. Development of curricula offered to prisoners, particularly those who are educationally disadvantaged, is continuing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department successfully operates two schemes with the Arts Council: writers workshops in prisons and artists workshops in prisons. The artists scheme is the more active at present and involves artists doing an intensive workshop, eight to ten days, complementing the work of the VEC art teacher in a prison. These workshops <Col N="834" /> took place in most prisons last year. This scheme is administered by the Arts Council with a designated prison teacher acting as co-ordinator-liaison person. Costs of the schemes are shared 50:50 by the Arts Council and my Department. Our contribution for 1998 was £7,000 and it has recently been agreed to increase that contribution to £10,000 for 1999.</P>
    <P>The Open University has been providing degree level courses since 1985 for prisoners who are deemed to be ready for such study and have sufficient time in their sentences to complete courses. In most years since then 40 to 50 prisoners have studied each year. There has been a significant increase in this figure of late with 70 prisoners registered for 1999. The most popular courses are in the social sciences, the arts and technology but some prisoners also study mathematics or science.</P>
    <P>The National College of Art and Design has been running a course in Portlaoise Prison for over ten years, usually involving 15 to 20 prisoners, both subversive and non-subversive. It covers painting, drawing and video production. It is seen as extremely successful with several prisoners going on to work as artists after release or going to art college. This course is administered from the director's office at the NCAD. It has recently been extended on a limited scale, two evenings per week, to the training unit, Dublin.</P>

      <P>Two psychologists employed by my Department are assigned to County Kerry. One is assigned to all the post-primary schools in the county and the other is assigned to a number of primary schools in the Tralee area. One of my key priorities as Minister is to expand current provision by establishing a national educational psychological service, to be available to all schools at both levels. On 15 September last, I launched and endorsed the report of the planning group, which has prepared recommendations for me on how a national educational psychological service may best be introduced.</P>
      <P>Financial provision has now been made for the first two years of a five-year implementation phase. It is envisaged that 200 educational psychologists should be in place by the end of the five years. Subject to the approval of Government, implementation of the report will begin in early 1999. The recruitment process will begin shortly. I am aware that there are inevitably many primary schools in County Kerry, which do not yet have access to my Department's psychological service. Attention will be paid to the needs of all areas as the psychological service is expanded.</P>

      <P>In my reply to a parliamentary question last June from the Deputy on the same issue I pointed out that in 1984, 1987 and again in 1991, three official circulars, namely, Circulars 23/84, 7/87 and 38/91, have issued from my Department to school authorities concerning the promotion and marketing of commercial products through schools. The circulars noted the Minister's concern at the pressure on schools from time to time to become involved in the marketing and promotion of commercial products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have taken careful note of the concerns expressed by RGDATA in a letter to me dated 12 January 1999. However, as I stated in my reply to the earlier parliamentary question in June last, private companies, such as the one referred to by the Deputy, are free to promote their business in accordance with accepted practices. School authorities are required to ensure, as is outlined in the circulars to which I have already referred, that pressure is not placed on parents to purchase particular commercial products. In this context, Circular 38/91 specifically requests school authorities, following consultation with staff, to <Col N="838" /> formulate agreed school policies in relation to commercial promotions. Such policies can assist school authorities to act prudently in taking steps to ensure that commercial products are not promoted and marketed through their schools. I am satisfied, therefore, that due awareness and vigilance already exist in relation to this matter.</P>

The design team for the CBS project was requested to prepare a feasibility study outlining the full extent of the refurbishment works required before initiating architectural planning of the extension. Due to the extent of the refurbishment works required at the CBS and the cost of extending both schools, the issue of rationalisation was raised.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 167 and 168 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a general rule, the question of whether a participant on an educational programme has a previous prison record would not arise in relation to participation on vocational or third level courses outside the prison system. Therefore, there is no data available on the number of prisoners, offenders, ex-prisoners and ex-offenders participating on such courses. However, there are a number of specific instances where education and training for ex-offenders is expressly facilitated by the vocational education committees, for example, in situations where a prisoner has been released but needs to complete an educational programme which started within the prison education service, on programmes specifically for ex-prisoners such as pathways and the bridge programme, or as one of the target groups within early school leaver programmes generally. In such instances, it is the practice of the VEC to liaise with staff in the prison education service and to interview the client in order to satisfy themselves as to suitability for the programme. All participants on education programmes are <Col N="840" /> subject to the code of conduct pertaining in the institutions which they attend. While information is available at centre level on the courses followed and awards issued within the prison education service, and on specific programmes for ex-prisoners, this data is not aggregated nationally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department has a range of measures in place to further the promotion of equality of access to third level education. The need for a holistic approach to promote equality rather than policies focused only on the third level sector and on the transition from second to third level, is well established. My Department provides direct funding for three access initiatives involving Ballymun Comprehensive and Dublin City University; the Southill area in Limerick and University of Limerick and eleven second level schools and Trinity College Dublin. These initiatives involve linkages between the colleges and local second level schools and incorporate supervised study facilities, extra tuition for pupils, information and advice for parents and pupils, including seminars, mentoring and support teaching in key subject areas.</P>
      <P>In relation to measures specifically targeted at third level, the Higher Education Authority has provided funding since 1996, for initiatives in a number of colleges specifically relating to disadvantaged students. These initiatives, similar to the Department's access initiatives, also involve links with second level schools and local communities. The programmes will assist some students to meet the points requirement for courses, enabling them to obtain a college place through the standard CAO entry procedure. The other aspect of the programmes is the special entry arrangements through which more flexible entry criteria are applied and various supports put in place for students entering by this method. Support for the university proposals is very firmly based on the intention of meeting targets and progress reports are submitted to the Higher Education Authority on each of the programmes funded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the technological sector, the Dublin Institute of Technology has a comprehensive set of activities in which the institute is interacting with different disadvantaged groups in Dublin city. There are currently a number of courses in place for mature students from disadvantaged backgrounds. In addition, a decision has been taken <Col N="841" /> by the Dublin Institute of Technology authorities that direct entry should occur in relation to second level students who are socio-economically disadvantaged and who do not meet the normal admission criteria. A full-time community education links co-ordinating officer has been appointed to Dublin Institute of Technology. The role of the co-ordinator is to identify, develop and co-ordinate the different initiatives of Dublin Institute of Technology in respect of disadvantaged communities in inner-city Dublin in order to increase their awareness of and participation in education, particularly at third level.</P>
    <P>In a recent survey, Dublin Institute of Technology established that 216 leaving certificate students, nationally, from disadvantaged status schools, registered in Dublin Institute of Technology courses last year. A policy document entitled &ldquo;Access to Education in the Dublin Institute of Technology for those who are Socio-Economically Disadvantaged&rdquo; has recently been adopted by the Dublin Institute of Technology. The objective of this initiative is to put in place appropriate programmes to ultimately allow access to Dublin Institute of Technology via direct entry for 100 socio-economically disadvantaged young people per year by the year 2002. The programme will target disadvantaged status schools in the inner city and its environs.</P>
    <P>A new national certificate in technology course, which was developed by a joint education/industry task force and targeted in particular at non-standard applicants, commenced in January 1998 in nine institutes of technology. This initiative is in line with the commitment in Partnership 2000 to give priority to a strategy to enable non-standard applicants to participate in third level education. Almost 300 places were approved for the programme which runs over 18 months and involves structured work-placement. A further intake of 500 on these course was sanctioned for January 1999.</P>
    <P>Full-time summer courses in Information Technology were conducted for 255 students in eight centres in institutes of technology and Dublin City University from June to September 1998. These courses were aimed at providing a new nationwide opportunity of access to rigorous introductory studies in IT. Of the students attending these courses, 103 were social welfare recipients.</P>
    <P>In August 1998, the NCEA launched a foundation certificate course designed to provide adult students who wish to embark on a course of third level study with an appropriate foundation which will provide support and extend their opportunities for admission to higher education.</P>
    <P>The institutes of technology equality network project which arose out of the EU programme new opportunities for women, is operational in <Col N="842" /> six institutes of technology. Programmes under the project are specifically aimed at encouraging more participation by women in third level education, with a specific focus on women who have been disadvantaged by a lack of educational opportunities. It is envisaged that there will be an expansion of the programmes under this project to include those colleges not already participating in the scheme. In addition, the Dublin Institute of Technology and Waterford Institute of Technology offer specific courses for second chance education for mature and disadvantaged women. There is also a pilot scheme which enables holders of NCVA level 2 awards to progress to designated certificate and diploma courses in the institutes of technology, which is an important development in establishing alternative progression pathways for students to higher levels of education and training.</P>
    <P>In September 1998, I announced that the Government had allocated £20 million to fund the capital costs of the first phase of a new institute of technology at Blanchardstown. The institute will open in September 1999 and will have 900 student places in its first phase of development. It is intended that the institute will make a major impact on improving the educational opportunities open to the community it will serve. The establishment board of the institute has been asked to ensure that a high proportion of students are non-standard entrants &ndash; mature students, people with disabilities and the unemployed. In addition to these existing measures, I have announced details of the 1998 budget package to tackle educational disadvantage, which involves a two year funding initiative to tackle educational disadvantage at all levels. Of this funding, £6.9 million is being allocated to the third level sector, of which £3 million is being specifically allocated to promote access to third level amongst students from disadvantaged backgrounds, including people with disabilities. I will announce details of the allocation of the additional resources in due course when I have fully considered how best to proceed in this area.</P>

      <P>Under the terms of the third level student support schemes, maintenance grants are <Col N="843" /> not payable to candidates who already hold an undergraduate degree and are pursuing a second undergraduate degree. Similarly, tuition fees are not payable in respect of a second period of college attendance at the same level. I understand <Col N="844" /> that, as the student referred to by the Deputy already holds a Bachelor of English and Communications degree, he is ineligible for a higher education grant or to benefit under the free fees initiative in respect of the B.SS (Social Work).</P>
