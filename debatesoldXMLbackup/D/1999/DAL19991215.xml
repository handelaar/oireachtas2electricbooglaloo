      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business I propose to deal with a number of notices of motion under Standing Order 31 from Deputies Sargent, Yates and Stagg. I propose to call on the Deputies in the order in which they submitted their notices to my office. I now call Deputy Sargent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Under Standing Order 31, I wish the business of Dáil Éireann to be suspended to hear from the Minister for Public Enterprise why industrial relations in Iarnród Éireann are in chaos today, leaving commuters stranded in freezing temperatures and mainline passengers without a service, and to allow time for reforms and meaningful investment in public transport to be discussed and acted upon.  Tá an scéal seo ag dul in olcas le fada agus níl tír sa Chomhaontas Eorpach níos measa as ó thaobh chóras taistil de.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is going beyond what was contained in his notice. I call Deputy Yates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek the Adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to debate the urgent matter of the effects of the train drivers' industrial action at Connolly Station with the consequent travel chaos for suburban and inter-city commuters and the steps the Minister for Public Enterprise is taking to seek independent arbitration and settlement of the dispute and an immediate resumption of transport services, as well as the contingency bus transport arrangements that are being put in place to alleviate hardship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>In accordance with the terms of Standing Order 31, I give notice of my intention to move the Adjournment of the Dáil to discuss the following specific and important matter of public interest requiring urgent attention, namely, the major disruption caused to mainline and suburban rail services as a result of an industrial dis<Col N="1574" /> pute involving train drivers based at Connolly Station and the need for urgent steps to secure a settlement of this dispute in view of the level of inconvenience and the heavy demand for rail services in the run-up to Christmas. In view of the importance of the matter, I hope the Chair will agree to this request.</P>

      <P>Deputy Barrett should have listened to what I said. I indicated that the motion &ldquo;shall be taken at 7 p.m. or at such other time as the Dáil may appoint.&rdquo;  It is a matter for the Dáil to appoint such a time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;clearly indicates that she is prepared to respond to the motion. On previous occasions, the relevant Minister was understandably given time to prepare for the debate. However, since the Minister in question has indicated her readiness to respond we should have the debate now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Rory O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty with Deputy Quinn's suggestion is that the matter raised under Standing Order 31 involves a motion to adjourn. Once the debate is taken, the House will adjourn. There is a long standing precedent that such motions are taken as the last business of the day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that on the final Order <Col N="1575" /> of Business of this century we might find it within our collective creative abilities to devise a Standing Order which would enable us to reconvene after the motion is taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that the debate be taken from 12 noon until 2.30 p.m., but instead of concluding it at that stage the question could be postponed to be taken at 10.30 p.m. or whenever the House is due to adjourn. If we could agree to report progress at 2.30 p.m., that would overcome the problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Under Standing Orders, only 90 minutes can be devoted to the debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

      <P>Is ceist an-phráinneach í seo agus aontaím le ceannaire Fhine Gael gur féidir í a thógaint ag meán-lae, that is 90 minutes to the break agus déanfaidh sé sin an gnó má tá an tAire sásta.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree with my suggestion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, if the Whips agree to it. Too often, when we are obliged to deal with long established Standing Orders, we change something on the floor of the House and thereby set a precedent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>This would only apply&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Standing Order and the precedent are clear, when such a motion is taken the House adjourns immediately thereafter. Neither the Minister nor I, mind when the motion is taken but, if established practice holds, the House will be obliged to adjourn thereafter. If that practice is to change, the Whips can come to an arrangement. However, I do not propose to make such an arrangement on the floor of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Standing Orders clearly state that the ordering of business is a matter for the House, not the Whips. The Taoiseach may not have heard my proposal which was that the debate should run for 90 minutes from 12 noon but instead of concluding at 1.30 p.m., the question would be postponed until the House was due to adjourn. In other words, the last speaker would report progress rather than conclude the debate. In that way we could have a conjunction of timing of the planned Adjournment of the Dáil and the final disposal of this motion. That is quite easy and something that could be done transparently in the House without necessitating a Whips meeting. Given that this issue has come up, the House should show, on the last day it meets in this mil<Col N="1576" /> lennium, that it can do its business itself without having to go off somewhere else&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Rory O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest, Deputy, that the Whips decide the matter because if the time is not decided, the motion will be taken at 7 p.m. in accordance with the Standing Order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking the Taoiseach not to decide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that you are trying to be helpful, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle but I want to convey to the Taoiseach and the Government Chief Whip, who have consulted each other as we have spoken, that the proposal made by Deputy Bruton and supported by other Members is reasonable. There should be an hour and a half debate before the lunchtime sos in order to demonstrate that we are concerned about this matter and can respond promptly. I know you are reading from the Standing Orders and the time available to you was Private Members' time or any such time, but 9 p.m. this evening does not demonstrate the sense of urgency that the House shares and which you, Sir, demonstrably shared by allowing this motion under Standing Orders in the first instance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Taoiseach to consider commencing the debate at 12 noon, conclude it at 1.30 p.m. and then adjourn it, following which we will proceed to the rest of the business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Precedent does not arise very often on this matter. We should examine the situation in light of what is before us.  Dúirt ceannaire Fhine Gael gur fearr dúinn tosú ar mheán-lae. Tá Páirtí an Lucht Oibre agus an Comhaontas Glas ag aontú leis sin agus táim ag iarraidh ort glacadh leis. Is féidir dul ar aghaidh le gnó eile an lae i ndiaidh sin.</P>

      <P>We started the debate on budget No. 1. This motion is concerned with budgets Nos. 1 and 2. This morning the executive committee of congress will debate communications from the Government, which signal the contents of a possible framework for budget No. 3. In those circumstances, the most reasonable thing we can ask <Col N="1580" /> is that at least the Minister for Finance would come into the House at some stage tonight and indicate when we might have budgets Nos. 4 and 5. Will the Taoiseach arrange, given that this will be the last time the budget is debated, for the Minister of Finance to make a statement to the House about his serial budget, which we are now discussing? Will he give an undertaking that the Minister for Finance will come in and explain either his acrobatics or his financial policy?</P>

      <P>I have no problem with it except that (ii) states that a Minister or Minister of State shall be called upon to make a statement in reply which shall not exceed ten minutes. My experience is that the statements made by Ministers of State at the end of these debates are not a reply, they are prescripted from the Department of Foreign Affairs and bear no relationship whatever to the questions that may have been raised either by the Labour Party or other speakers, or by myself, in the debate. Will the Taoiseach ensure that the Minister of State or Minister who is replying to the debate on the summit will actually reply to what is said in the debate and will not come in with a prepared script, which shows a lack of interest and respect for the effort made by other speakers to contribute constructively to a debate on the summit?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a practice that has predated the formation of this Government. Given the rapidity of communications and the ability of Ministers of State and Ministers to follow the debate, it is not an unreasonable request. Perhaps the Standing Orders should be changed because we all know &ndash; previous Administrations did the same &ndash; it is not a response to the points made by other speakers. If we are not going to change the practice, at least the wording in the proposal should be changed.</P>

      <P>I had a question tabled for the Taoiseach yesterday and today on the Helsinki summit which has been disallowed on the basis of the anticipated statements on the Order of Business today &ndash; No. 42 &ndash; on the same subject. The proposition on the Order of Business does not accommodate an opportunity for me to address the House on what is a very important issue. I have the additional problem of having my question disallowed. As this is unacceptable, will the Taoiseach make time available for those of us who have been denied our right to express our position on this very important subject?</P>

      <P>On a point of order, there is a precedent for this. When Democratic Left was in existence it was allowed make statements on summits and the Green Party has made statements previously. You can allow Deputy Ó Caoláin and the Green Party to make statements on this very important summit because we hold a different point of view, particularly in relation to defence matters.</P>

On behalf of my party, I congratulate the sub-committee. On the Order of Business may I ask the Taoiseach to do two things? Will he undertake to ensure a debate takes place at the earliest possible opportunity when the House resumes in the next century?

They spent a substantial part of the summer, not to mention recent months, working on it. Everybody in the House will want to congratulate all the members of the committee for their dedication and the officials who worked with them. I agree we should have an early debate on it in January. I agree the publication of the report should have as wide a circulation as possible.</P>

      <P>I wish also, on behalf of Fine Gael, to pay tribute to the Sub-committee of the Committee of Public Accounts, Deputy Jim Mitchell and the other members for the work they <Col N="1584" /> have done at great personal sacrifice, a sacrifice of their time in their constituencies, working in the party and in the House, and of their time with their families. We should express appreciation to them for what they have done. Apropos of that, what is the position in regard to the promised prevention of corruption legislation which was to have been introduced here before Christmas? The most recent corruption legislation in Ireland dates from 1916. We have not passed a single item of anti-corruption legislation since then. When will this legislation be introduced?</P>

      <P>In asking the Taoiseach about the Medical Practitioners (Amendment) Bill, I put it to him that we are entering the period of greatest stress on the accident and emergency services. They are already at breaking point in respect of those services in the Mater Hospital, which is in his own constituency. Before we resume in January, we will go through the most difficult period for those services. Something urgently needs to be done and the Taoiseach should take a personal interest in that flagship hospital in his constituency.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 12, to delete lines 12 to 20.</P>
      <P>The catchment management issue and the composition of the board are probably the two issues in the Bill on which much of the discussion has focused. The Minister is well aware that Deputy Bell and I fully support the spirit of what is happening regarding catchment management. In the European context, catchment management has been accepted as an ongoing feature of fisheries development. There are six pilot programmes ongoing for which the different regional fisheries boards have ultimate responsibility. The progression of those are focusing on many interesting facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One pilot project of which the Minister, the officials and all of us are aware at this stage has caused a certain amount of controversy, that is the catchment management policy for the Killarney Lakes. We met the representatives involved and we were made aware of their concerns and <Col N="1588" /> those of the other angling organisation, FISSTA, on this issue.</P>
    <P>Having discussed the issues and seen at first hand the reactions of many of the other stakeholders &ndash; the regional fisheries board, the Central Fisheries Board, etc. &ndash; to catchment management, I do not know what special meeting took place in Dublin last Thursday but my telephone was certainly hopping over the weekend. The message seemed to emanate from that dinner or meeting that I am against catchment management, and that Deputy Bell and I were making it difficult for the Minister in this regard.</P>
    <P>In the original speech I made on the Bill, I fully accepted the principle of catchment management and I said I hoped fishermen would have a pivotal role in that area. I made it clear that I was not opposed to catchment management and when I moved the relevant amendment on Committee Stage I said it would be moved again on Report Stage. If we were opposed to the idea and wished to be negative instead of being constructive with regard to the Bill, we could have forced the issue to a vote on Committee Stage, but we did not. We exercised the right to table the amendment again on Report Stage to give the Minister and his officials a chance to meet the representative organisations and others concerned in order to reach some accommodation by inserting a different wording in the amendment to meet their needs and wishes.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage the Minister indicated that he and his officials would meet the people involved. That committee meeting took place on a Tuesday and on Wednesday the departmental officials waited for the anglers to arrive, but they did not come. Later that day they issued a statement indicating they were opposed to catchment management. Since then there have been many developments in the area. I am aware of the Minister's discussion with the Killarney lakes fishermen and the Oireachtas representatives yesterday. He had a fairly long discussion not only on catchment management but also on other issues of concern that may not be encompassed within the Bill. I understand the Minister indicated that, in order to tease out the specific problems with regard to catchment management in the Killarney lakes area, both he and his officials are prepared to meet the fishermen in the new year.</P>
    <P>The matter of acquisition has emerged in recent times and forms part of the fishermen's concerns. Private angling clubs are afraid that they will cease to exist because they may be acquired by other groups under the terms of the Bill. In such a situation emotive language can often be used. I have a copy of a letter sent to D. J. Riordan by the Department assuring him about the issue of acquisition. The Minister said they need have no concerns over acquisition because he will have the final say, and I accept the spirit of what he has said. In such situations the Minister will evaluate the merits of cases and the various organisations involved. The Minister has indicated to them the position with regard to <Col N="1589" /> security of tenure and acquisition, and I hope he convinced them in his discussions yesterday that they have no need to fear outside concerns.</P>
    <P>The Bill has been amended considerably. It now fully recognises the consultation process for dealing with concerns about legislative details, not alone on catchment management but also regarding the composition of the fisheries boards. All three angling organisations and other interested parties recognise that they have been fully accommodated within the membership of the new regional fisheries boards. The Bill has gone a long way towards meeting their earlier concerns. That is because Deputy Bell and myself have adopted a constructive approach to the Bill and did not oppose sections in order to gain kudos. We were anxious to tease out all aspects of the legislation to ensure we could obtain improvements in it for the people who approached us with genuine concerns, whether they were from the regional fisheries boards, angling organisations or netmen. The Minister will acknowledge that changes have taken place in the legislation due to a vigilant Opposition tabling amendments on a constructive basis.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides an insight into a segment of the fishing fraternity that may not have been dealt with in the past. I have had discussions with many people&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>We will try to achieve that timeframe. I could say much more about the matter but the time allocation has been constrained. <Col N="1590" /> There was always a certain pressure because we hoped to get the legislation before Christmas and we have co-operated with that objective. I acknowledge the help the departmental officials have given us during the passage of the Bill. The assistant secretary of the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources, Ms Sara White, and other officials ensured that Oireachtas representatives were fully familiar with what was happening. They understood our concerns.</P>
      <P>We will not be proceeding with this amendment because the Minister has inserted in the section aspects concerning catchment management to incorporate the concerns of voluntary organisations. The word &ldquo;voluntary&rdquo; has been inserted along with the wording &ldquo;have regard to the circumstances which pertain in each of the catchment systems within this region&rdquo;. I know that goes beyond amendment No. 3 which Deputy Bell and myself moved, but it is within the spirit of catchment management. I hope that wording will deal with whatever concerns exist.</P>
      <P>In the spirit of the enhanced role of the regional fisheries boards and the principle of subsidiarity enshrined in the Bill, I hope there will be full discussion concerning the boards regarding any catchment management programme in their areas. It will come down to the management of the board itself. If this plan is to be implemented on a long-term basis, regional fisheries boards should be issued with catchment management guidelines by the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources.  In that situation, it should be monitored on an ongoing basis by the boards themselves. Problems often arise if the elected members of those boards are not consulted. It is important for the word &ldquo;consultation&rdquo; to be included in this. If this Bill and the changed direction of the regional fisheries boards are to succeed, it will be done by virtue of consultation and co-operation rather than leaving people wondering if they have proper authorisation, who is in charge of the catchment management and so on. Those aspects can undo much of the good work that can be achieved by catchment management.</P>
      <P>We will not press this amendment because we support the spirit of the Minister's subsequent amendments on the catchment management area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>My colleague, Deputy Finucane, covered most of what I wanted to say. As he said, we tabled the amendment in the hope that an agreement would emerge from the discussions the Minister had with the various groups. I am pleased our judgment was correct in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I chaired the all-party committee which dealt with the salmon task force report, the recommendations of which focused strongly on the catchment areas. Therefore, it would have been a <Col N="1591" /> pity if we had had to force a vote on an issue which was fully supported by an all-party committee prior to publication of the Bill. The insertion of the word &ldquo;voluntary&rdquo; will allay the fears in some areas, from which the Minister has met representatives, that they were being forced into something.</P>
    <P>It is a very complex area and there have been difficulties in my county in reaching agreement with the various interests in the catchment areas, even on the one river. I fully understand and appreciate that. I also understand the problems my colleague, Deputy Moynihan-Cronin, had in Killarney. She spent an enormous amount of time discussing the Bill with me and I fully understand her fears.</P>
    <P>However, I am satisfied with this, as are the Eastern Regional Fisheries Board and other boards which have contacted me and Deputy Finucane. These boards have the operational responsibility for all fisheries, including inland fisheries. They strongly support this section and emphasise the importance of maintaining it in the Bill.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Finucane said, agreement was reached on about 35 amendments and the Bill was largely rewritten as a result of our discussions here and with officials from the Department, who worked very hard to facilitate and advise both the Minister and the various bodies they met. I want to put on record my gratitude for that on behalf of the Labour Party.</P>
    <P>This very important aspect is the nub of the Bill. The insertion of the word &ldquo;voluntary&rdquo; should eliminate any fears. I have no doubt that, as Deputy Finucane emphasised, the various interests distrust not only the Department but also each other. There are warring factions in every catchment area, which I do not underestimate. This needs to be consistently monitored and they will want to be consistently consulted. We will not push our amendment and will support those of the Minister, which meet the case we made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies Finucane and Bell covered the area very thoroughly. I want to clarify the point Deputy Finucane made about the involvement of the boards and the need to consult them on the catchment management. The section gives the function to the boards, not to the managers. Therefore, there is no need to be concerned about that because, by definition, they must be involved in catchment management plans. I agree with the point made by the Deputy in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 3, 4 and 5 relate to the development of the inland fisheries catchment management plan. Section 8(a) of the Bill includes paragraph (g), which deals with the functions of regional fisheries boards, which are to encourage, promote, organise and co-ordinate, together with inland fisheries, owners, bodies and <Col N="1592" /> organisations, the development of inland fisheries catchment management plans.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 3, as Deputies Finucane and Bell said, is an amendment to section 8(a) of the Bill and involves the deletion of the paragraph. The Deputies explained they tabled the amendment to ensure further discussion of that issue at this point, which I accept and recognise. Both Deputies said they support the inclusion of catchment management.</P>
    <P>The problem is that when one wants to provide enabling powers for something new or different, people sometimes do not understand what &ldquo;enabling powers&rdquo; actually means. It just means there is a power in statute if people are prepared to work together voluntarily and that the Department and its officials have the power to take the actions requested by the boards and people in those areas. Deputy Bell pointed to one of the major difficulties, which is that individuals and groups will differ with each other in any catchment area. That is very true in this regard. We had to spend a great deal of time explaining that these are voluntary provisions and can only be proceeded with if there is agreement.</P>
    <P>In the middle of that, there is also confusion locally about leases and so on. Those issues have nothing to do with catchment management directly but need to be sorted out. A number of those issues arose in relation to the Killarney anglers. For that reason, I said I would meet them to discuss their problems which have emerged in the context of an examination of the catchment. When one examines any catchment, one begins to see the problems in it. In that regard, one either buries one's head until something blows up in one's face, which is what happens with these legalities, or one identifies them, deals with them, looks after the interests of the anglers and anticipates what might happen. Such issues have come to light in that area and will have to be dealt with.</P>
    <P>The Bill gives the regional fisheries boards responsibility jointly with all local fisheries interests to encourage voluntary development, where possible, of catchment management plans, involving and consulting with other interest groups. Catchment management is about encouraging, not forcing, local interests to work together. The six pilot projects to which Deputy Finucane referred are being assessed at present. They have confirmed the need for a flexible and open approach to specific local situations. These can be highly complex, given the traditional issues of inland fisheries ownership, management and access.</P>
    <P>One of the issues put most forcefully by a representative of the Killarney anglers was that, as far as they are concerned, not enough is being done about poaching. That is part of examining the problems and needs in the catchment area. However, the Bill does not deal specifically with poaching.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the other side of it. In effect, through the catchment management, they have discussions with local gardaí and made better arrangements, as they saw it themselves. However, there are many issues which need to be addressed. Deputy Bell correctly stated that one will get this kind of situation and it is time we addressed these issues.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 4 seeks to insert the word &ldquo;voluntary&rdquo; so that the provision would read &ldquo;The voluntary development of inland fisheries catchment management plans&rdquo;. By definition, all such plans will be developed on a voluntary basis. The catchment management process itself is based on principles of communication, co-operation, compromise and consensus, as reflected in the proposed wording. This amendment emerged from our discussions and will make it clear in the legislation that the development will be on a voluntary basis.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 5 will require the regional fisheries boards to have regard to the distinctive circumstances which pertain in each of the catchment systems in their regions in the development of catchment management plans. This amendment results from the intensive consultations we had with angling organisations and other interested parties. The requirement is inherent in the catchment management concept but I am pleased to propose the amendment to make it clear that specific and unique factors in catchment systems, such as Killarney, are taken into account. I met representatives of the Killarney Anglers Federation yesterday to discuss their concerns. I stressed the voluntary nature of catchment management and explained that the present process is a pilot scheme. I will meet the Killarney anglers in the new year to discuss their specific problems.</P>
      <P>I thank Deputies for their constructive and helpful approach to the Bill which deals with an issue which can be quite complex. There are various recommendations. For example, as regards the membership of the boards, there were strong recommendations from groups who carried out the revisions, but others wanted to leave it more broadly based. That is what we have done.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 6, line 13, to delete &ldquo;resident&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These amendments seek to broaden the definition of family status in the Bill. Amendment No. 1 represents what we are trying to achieve in other areas of the Bill whereby we are seeking to ensure that its provisions are as broad as possible in terms of the protection it gives to the various groups covered by its provisions against discrimination. We have received representations, particularly from the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, which suggest that there are carers who do not necessarily reside with the person for whom they care. This issue was also brought to my attention by the gay and lesbian community many of whose members provide care but are not resident with the person to whom they give that care. However, this also applies to other categories such as <Col N="1596" /> people with disabilities who are cared for by someone who does not live in the same house.</P>
    <P>By deleting the word &ldquo;resident&rdquo; and, as proposed by amendment No. 2, deleting the sentence which requires that the primary carer is a resident primary carer if they reside with a person with a disability, we would extend protection to those who give care but do not necessarily live in the same house as the person for whom they care.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to see the Bill on Report Stage in the House as it is an important part of the armoury to deal with discrimination. Amendment No. 1 addresses the fact that the definition of carers is restricted to a parent or a resident primary carer. Why is it necessary to restrict the protection to such a narrow group of carers? Such a narrow focus may discriminate against carers who are not included in the definition in the Bill. The aim of this amendment is to widen the definition of carer to entitle others to the protection of the Bill. Strong representations have been made on this issue by a number of groups, including the Irish Council of Civil Liberties who say the narrow focus may serve to discriminate against co-habitees who take care of their partners, for example, by working outside the home and that it will be detrimental to carers in the lesbian and gay community. Will the Minister consider this? The reason he gave previously for not extending the provision was that it was in line with the definition in the Employment Equality Act. Surely we ought to extend the range of protection wherever possible. It seems reasonable to include primary carers who may not be resident but who should have the protection of the Bill.</P>

      <P>Apart from the inclusion of pregnancy, which, for reasons arising from EU case law, is treated as gender discrimination in the Employment Equality Act, the definition of family status is identical to that in the Employment Equality Act. The proposed changes would create an unjustified divergence between the definition in this Bill and that in the Employment Equality Act. If the primary carer did not have to be resident, more than one person could be deemed to be the primary carer of the same person. I cannot, therefore, accept these amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>That problem could be overcome by designating the primary carer. As regards the Employment Equality Act definition, we are talking about services which are different from employment. The Equal Status Bill could have a different definition because the area it covers concerns other aspects of life apart from employment. We want the definition to be as wide as possible so the Bill can protect as many people as possible. This is a different issue from that dealt with in the Employment Equality Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is repeating the argument that the same definition is included in the Employment Equality Act. However, as Deputy O'Sullivan said, this legislation deals with different issues. It should not be outside the bounds of possibility to define a primary carer. Criteria could be included whereby someone could be clearly defined as a primary carer and thus be protected by the Bill. Agreement could be reached in particular cases. Will the Minister consider this?</P>

      <P>If a person is in a relationship with and living with a member of the gay and lesbian community, clearly he or she would be deemed to be the primary carer. I do not see why it should apply particularly to members of the gay and lesbian community. The same circumstances could arise as regards heterosexuals. It is not confined to one group. As I have already outlined, there can be only one carer. There must be some definition &ndash; resident carer is the term included in the legislation. This is similar to the Employment Equality Act. In those circumstances and for reasons I already outlined on Committee Stage, I am not in a position to accept these amendments.</P>
      <P>With regard to Deputy O'Sullivan's suggestion that I provide a mechanism whereby the primary carer would be designated, I think everyone would agree there must be certainty in the legislation and I cannot utilise it in that fashion.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>These amendments in my name and that of Deputy Fitzgerald propose to allow the benefits of the Bill to apply to groups as well as individuals. We had a long debate on this on Committee Stage. The argument was made, to which I still <Col N="1598" /> hold, that there are many cases in which groups are discriminated against. For example, if travellers are refused service in a public house, the discrimination is against the group not a number of individuals. They are discriminated against because they are part of a group. Similarly, this applies if an ethnic group is refused service in a restaurant or refused entry to an educational establishment. In many cases discrimination will be against a group rather than individuals. The Minister indicated that each individual within the group would be free to take an action under the legislation. This seems an impractical way to deal with discrimination against a group. As I said on Committee Stage, it would be more logical for a group to be able to take a case. One could then investigate the discrimination and there would be no repetition of cases, because in effect, each member of the group would take the same action. I do not need to go into more detail on this because it is self-explanatory. In other jurisdictions there is widespread provision for taking group actions. For example, in the US there is detailed legislation, particularly in relation to the rights of people with disabilities, whereby group actions are frequently taken under the American Disabilities Act and other legislation. In so far as I have been able to research it, there is provision for group actions to be taken under this type of legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This issue was discussed on Committee Stage. Our argument is that to give the opportunity to a group or organisation to take a case under the legislation would be a strengthening provision. Groups can take cases in other jurisdictions. If an individual is being discriminated against, it is often difficult for that person to initiate a case. I take the Minister's point that the way in which this provision is written into the legislation does not prohibit a group of individuals who belong to a particular organisation from taking a case. He made the point that legally he cannot get a definition for organisation that is meaningful in the context of anti-discrimination. This surprises me. I would have thought this would be possible. However, legal advice seems to suggest otherwise. It is often difficult for individuals to take cases. It would strengthen anti-discrimination law or the Equal Status Act if organisations knew they had the power as organisations to initiate cases on behalf of individuals. Of course, organisations can still support individuals who take cases. However, if an organisation has the legal right to initiate, different sorts of cases will be taken and organisations will initiate action before an individual may do so. It might be easier for organisations to initiate cases as opposed to an individual.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the amendments is to give more authority to organisations who work to end discrimination to take cases in their own right. I understand the new Equality Authority has had a huge number of inquiries since it began adver<Col N="1599" /> tising the work it does. There is no doubt that once the Equal Status Bill is enacted, covering areas other than employment, there will be a huge number of inquiries covering a wide range of areas. Awareness generally in relation to discrimination is growing. New rights issues dealing with refugees and asylum seekers are emerging and no doubt the Equality Authority will be to the fore on these issues. Given the changing scenario in relation to rights and discrimination, empowering organisations to initiate action under the Bill would be a progressive step despite the Minister's legal advice that organisations cannot be defined legally in a meaningful way. We all know that organisations are meaningful and take meaningful actions. In other countries they initiate anti-discrimination actions, so why not in Ireland?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to record my opinion on this matter. Unfortunately, I was not present during the Committee Stage debate. I do not agree with Deputy Fitzgerald that organisations should be given the power to take actions. People are in business to make a livelihood, irrespective of the type of business. Business people do not object to customers entering their premises unless they have good reason to do so. I feel strongly about this issue. If somebody is about to cause trouble, I assure the Deputy the regular customer will be the first to bring the matter to the attention of the owner of the business, regardless of whether it is a licensed premises or whatever. If X number of people enters a premises and the owner is aware that they may cause trouble, that business person should have the right to make a decision on the matter. If one or two people start trouble, naturally the others will join in. An owner of a business who is trying to make a livelihood will not refuse a customer unless he or she believes the person they are refusing may cause trouble. I believe this is the right of the owner of the premises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The point about somebody running a business being able to refuse a customer if they believe they may cause trouble is provided for in other sections of the Bill. This should not be a problem given the way in which the Bill is drafted in that area. This issue is slightly different. For example, we are aware of the difficulties of refugees in accessing services and that asylum seekers are very vulnerable. I am trying to highlight the case of a person who is vulnerable, isolated and marginalised in a new country and who may have language difficulties. If there is injustice or discrimination, an organisation such as the Irish Refugee Council would be in a better position to initiate action on behalf of the individual refugee or asylum seeker given their experience and information in this area. This is what I am referring to rather than somebody entering a pub and causing trouble. On many occasions when a person is discriminated against, it may be difficult <Col N="1600" /> for him or her as an individual to initiate action or to have the relevant information. It would greatly add to the legislation if an organisation which works to represent the interests of individuals could take a case on behalf of an individual. This happens in other jurisdictions. Our law should be inclusive in relation to this issue and should allow organisations to take cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>As I explained on Committee Stage, the 1997 Bill covered discrimination against organisations as well as individuals. However, when the 1997 Bill was referred to the Supreme Court, opposing counsel criticised the drafting of section 3(1) of the Bill as meaningless, a criticism which was upheld in subsequent legal advice. Since the discriminatory grounds are that one is a man and the other is a women etc., it does not make sense to apply these grounds to organisations. Not only did the inclusion of organisations present a serious drafting problem, it is also arguable that such a provision might be as protective of an all male or racially exclusive organisation as it would be of an organisation representing travellers or racial minorities. For these reasons, the present Bill does not apply to discrimination against organisations but only to discrimination against individuals. I cannot accept amendments that would attempt to reinstate organisations in the definition of discrimination. Under the 1999 Bill it will still be possible for any individual who encounters discrimination as a member, for example, of a traveller organisation, to bring a claim of discrimination on an individual basis. Organisations can resource and assist individuals to take a case but discrimination directed at an organisation cannot be the subject of a complaint.</P>
      <P>In summary, every group comprises either men or women in the context of this legislation. If there is discrimination against a group or organisation, it is open to any individual in the group or organisation to take an action by himself or herself. It is open to every member of the group or organisation to take an action. If one person brings an action and succeeds, and if all of the other people were discriminated against in the same fashion, it will be obvious that all of the others have precisely the same case and that they will succeed as well. In addition, it is open to the organisation or group to assist any individual to take a case in order to establish the precedent. On the basis that what we are dealing with here is human beings as members of a group or organisation, I propose to reject the amendments, and for all the other reasons I outlined earlier.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us take another example of discrimination on the grounds of age. If members of an active retirement group want to book a table for lunch in a restaurant, the owner might take the view that these people would have more time to spend on lunch than the busy young worker, and that he or she might make more money if the tables were kept free for a different <Col N="1601" /> type of person. I would see that as discrimination on the grounds of age against the active retirement group. If the legislation is left as drafted, one of the individuals in the group will have to initiate a complaint rather than the actual group. That is just another example of the point we are trying to make.</P>
      <P>In terms of whether one is a man or a woman, it is quite legitimate for some groups to be all male. For example, the Munster rugby team, by definition, is all male but I do not see any reason why they, as a group, could not take a discrimination case if they were kept out of some service. The argument that we are trying to protect all male or all female groups does not necessarily hold up.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 7, line 1, before &ldquo;or&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, statutory services&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason I would like to insert &ldquo;statutory services&rdquo; is to make clear that the Bill applies to services provided by the Government as well as services provided by others. On Committee Stage, the Minister undertook to get advice from the Attorney General on this matter. It was pointed out on Committee Stage that when the Stephen Lawrence case arose in England, problems in relation to policing, for example, were not covered in legislation, but the Minister told us that he had been assured that could not happen under our law. I would be interested to know if the Minister got legal advice on whether it would be possible to insert wording in the Bill to make it clear that all services provided by the State are covered and that members of the public can take a case under the equal status legislation if the discrimination occurred while they were accessing a service through a State service provider whether in relation to housing, social welfare or education. We have had reports from the Ombudsman on discrimination that can arise in relation to access to services provided by the State. It is important that &ldquo;service&rdquo;, as defined, is broadened to make it clear that State provided services are covered in the Bill. We have the phrase &ldquo;business or trade&rdquo; and I understand the intention was to include &ldquo;business of Government&rdquo;. The Bill was not designed to exclude services provided by the State from the ambit of equal status legislation. The Minister has clarified in the Bill that statu<Col N="1602" /> tory services are covered, so it is merely a question of whether the Minister would agree to this amendment. The phrase &ldquo;generally available to the public&rdquo; is meant to cover this but why can we not have a tighter definition? The insertion of &ldquo;statutory or other State services&rdquo; would ensure the public is aware that the Bill covers those areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the points made by Deputy Fitzgerald, which were also made on Committee Stage. The Minister said that our points were covered in the Bill but I want to highlight the problem that arose in the Stephen Lawrence case. The Macpherson committee investigated this case of a person being abused by the police in Britain. The key outcome of the inquiry was that &ldquo;the full force of the Race Relations legislation should apply to all police officers, and that Chief Officers of Police should be made vicariously liable for the acts and omissions of their officers relevant to that legislation&rdquo;. The report further states:</P>
      <P>Services provided by public bodies that could be provided by private individuals in the same or a similar manner, must comply with the criteria laid down in the Race Relations Act. In 1997, however, a British court ruled that even in cases where police officers provide services covered by the Race Relations Act, only the police officer concerned could be held liable. For this reason, the Home Office intends to introduce a bill to amend the Race Relations Act, and extend its application unequivocally to all areas of Government and the executive.</P>
      <P>That was the experience of the Race Relations Act in Britain. That legislation was comprehensive but it obviously contained certain faults which had to be rectified subsequently and which were highlighted in the Stephen Lawrence case. We tabled these amendments for Report Stage in the hope that the Minister would consider the matter again and ensure there were no loopholes in the legislation in relation to statutory provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said on Committee Stage, there is no doubt that the equal status legislation will apply to the State. A service is defined in section 2 as a service or facility of any nature which is generally available to the public or a section of the public. This wide definition applies to public services as well as to those provided by the public sector. The application of the legislation to public services is reinforced by the wording of section 5(1) which provides that it is irrelevant whether the services are provided for consideration or otherwise. The reference to the State in section 14(a)(iii) also underlines this point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Clearly, therefore, the Equal Status Bill applies to services provided by the State. My advice is that, following the 1993 Supreme Court judgment in Howard <i>v.</i> the Commissioners of Public <Col N="1603" /> Works, it is not necessary to state in legislation that the State is bound thereby. As has been pointed out, I undertook to go back to the Attorney General's office about the matter, and I am again advised that the Bill, by implication, applies to the State and that it is unnecessary to include an express provision in this regard. I would also point out that neither of the proposed amendments would appear to achieve express application to the State. The term &ldquo;statutory services&rdquo; and &ldquo;statutory provision&rdquo; would narrow down substantially what is understood by the State. There was a doctrine known as Crown prerogative which held that the State would not be bound by any statute which did not expressly, or by implication, bind it. However, it must be said that the doctrine of Crown prerogative did not survive the 1937 Constitution, though there was a certain amount of uncertainty as to whether that was the case. However, the matter was finally clarified in the landmark Supreme Court decision Howard <i>v.</i> the Commissioners for Public Works. The case was a landmark because it held that the State was bound by the planning Acts and was obliged to apply for planning permission before building an interpretative centre. Deputy O'Sullivan would know about this case as her late and illustrious predecessor was involved, though on a different side of the fence from me.</P>
    <P>The scope of the equal status legislation is not confined to those public services which are analogous to those provided in the private sector. Social welfare services, for example, have no counterpart in the marketplace but come within the scope of the Equal Status Bill. Deputies O'Sullivan and Fitzgerald referred to the judgments in the United Kingdom and it is important to address those issues. UK case law restricted the application of anti-discrimination legislation to public services which had a parallel in the marketplace, but I am advised that a similar limitation would not apply in this jurisdiction. The UK judgments were delivered against an entirely different legal and constitutional background from that of our jurisdiction. Furthermore, my understanding is that the UK legislation does not define a service but merely offers examples, while the Equal Status Bill defines a service as a service or facility of any nature.</P>
    <P>Section 14 states that actions which are required to be done by or under statute are exempt from the legislation. Thus, for example, distinctions in the tax code based on marital status or in social welfare legislation based on age, such as pensions, will not be regarded as discrimination under this legislation. I stress that this exemption applies only to actions which are mandatory under the relevant statute and not to the discretionary actions of statutory bodies or public officials. Lest there be doubt, even where a matter is exempt under section 14, the obligation not to discriminate would apply to the interaction between officials and the public in the delivery of the relevant statutory function.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1604" /> For example, the fact that the requirements of the tax code are exempt does not allow Revenue officials to discriminate in access to buildings and information or in advice or other forms of assistance. Not all actions of the State <i>vis-à-vis</i> members of the public can be regarded as services. There is a difference between controlling duties exercised by the State and services provided by the State. I am advised that immigration and citizenship matters, for example, are not services within the meaning of the Equal Status Bill but rather an expression of the State's duty as a sovereign power to control who it admits to the State. Controlling duties in the areas of policing, defence and prisons would likewise not be regarded as services. The service aspect of policing, immigration, defence and prisons will, however, come within the scope of the Bill. For example, while a decision to grant a visa would not be covered by the Equal Status Bill, the interaction between officials and the visa applicant and collateral services and facilities, such as access to buildings and information, would come within the scope of the legislation.</P>
    <P>In the policing area, for example, while riot control or apprehending a criminal gang could not be regarded as services, information and assistance provided by gardaí, including responding to reported crimes, would be regarded as services within the scope of the equal status legislation. Furthermore, the fact that a controlling duty of the State does not come within the scope of the legislation does not give <i>carte blanche </i>to officials to discriminate in the exercise of such duties. Discrimination or irrationality in the exercise of such controlling duties can be challenged in a High Court constitutional action or in judicial review proceedings.</P>
    <P>I am aware that there are groups which are very concerned with whether the State is covered by the legislation. I recently visited a conference organised by Pavee Point and that case was made and reinforced by a delegation from Pavee Point that I met. In order to assuage its fears and those of others, there is no doubt that the State is covered by this legislation &ndash; that is the advice I have from the Attorney General. The doctrine of Crown prerogative did not carry over after the 1937 Constitution and the case of Howard <i>v.</i> the Commissioners of Public Works made the position precisely clear. It is important to emphasise that point, though I do not want to labour it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for that detailed reply, which is useful and necessary. As he said, there was much concern that State services, statutory or otherwise, were not covered in the Bill because they were not explicitly mentioned. It was felt that a case could be made that the Equal Status Bill did not apply to those services, but the Minister made it clear that there is no legal doubt but that State services are covered by the Bill, though it is not explicit. I am surprised that no wording could be found to state this explicitly in the Bill, as that is what led to the <Col N="1605" /> confusion and concern. Obviously the Supreme Court case is critical in this regard. There is no doubt that the Bill applies to State services, which is very important. The distinction drawn by the Minister between the controlling duties the State may provide in relation to immigrants or citizenship will lead to much debate on where a case may be taken and where it may not. We will have to rely on case law to develop to see how this will work. However, I am pleased these amendments have led to the detailed response by the Minister and to clarity on the issue. It would be ridiculous if the Equal Status Bill did not cover services provided by the State, but it should have been stated explicitly in the Bill.</P>

      <P>I agree it is important to tease out this matter in detail. Will the Minister address the problem that arose in the British legislation? In that case a specific police officer, rather than the police force, was held liable in the Stephen Lawrence case. We need to be sure that a specific civil servant or police officer &ndash; whoever is carrying out the duty on behalf of the State &ndash; is not held liable, that it would be the State or Department concerned rather than the individual.</P>

In the context of implementation of the Bill, will the individuals or agencies concerned be aware of the responsibilities in the Bill?

      <P>Regarding Deputy Barnes's question, there is a clear distinction between services and duties and it will not be possible for people to say a service is a duty because that will not wash.</P>
      <P>Regarding Deputy O'Sullivan's question about the English judgment and the possibility of a police officer, prison warden or some other person being held liable against the State, the doctrine of the vicarious liability will apply. That means if a person is acting on behalf of the State in the course of his or her duties and does something that is incorrect, the State would have to carry the can. This is explicitly covered in section 42 which states &ldquo;Anything done by a person in the course of his or her employment shall, in any proceedings brought under this Act, be treated for the purposes of this Act as done also by that person's employment, whether or not it was done with the employer's knowledge or approval.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 7, line 20, to delete &ldquo;orientation.&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;orientation;</P>
      <P>&lsquo;Traveller community' means the community of people who are commonly called Travellers and who are identified (both by themselves and others) as people with a shared history, culture and traditions including, historically, a nomadic way of life on the island of Ireland.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>My amendments apply to the Employment Equality Act, 1998, and the Equal Status Bill. The use of a capital &ldquo;T&rdquo; in the word &ldquo;travellers&rdquo; was sought not only by Opposition Deputies but by traveller organisations. I undertook on Committee Stage to give further consideration to this matter and I have brought forward these amendments to meet the points raised.</P>
      <P>While it is not strictly necessary and will not have any effect on the level of protection afforded to travellers, I accept the case made by the traveller organisations for the use of a capital &ldquo;T&rdquo; in anti-discrimination legislation.</P>
      <P>I have given careful thought to how best to define the traveller community. The definition posed, which, as suggested in the Select Committee, is modelled on the Northern Ireland Race Relations Order, 1996, is the most appropriate. It is intended to cover the traditional traveller community, irrespective of place of birth or whether the person concerned currently follows a nomadic way of life. It would not encompass other groups who pursue a nomadic way of life, such as Romany Gypsies or New Age travellers.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 101 also inserts a reference to the Refugee Act and the Employment Equality Act, 1998, to which I will return when we come to discuss amendment No. 46.</P>
      <P>Traveller community is defined in the amendment as meaning &ldquo;. the community of people who are commonly called Travellers and who are identified (both by themselves and others) as people with a shared history, culture and traditions including, historically, a nomadic way of life on the island of Ireland.&rdquo;  I am pleased to bring forward these amendments following the interesting discussion we had on Committee Stage. I hope the Opposition spokespersons will find the definition to their satisfaction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's amendments. On Committee Stage we pointed out that the definition of &ldquo;traveller&rdquo; in the legis<Col N="1607" /> lation was insufficient to make the Bill workable and that it might not ratify the UN Convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination. We suggested that the Bill should amend the previous legal definition of traveller in the Housing Act, 1988. Given that there was no definition of traveller as a distinct ethnic group in legislation, we considered it important to introduce one. We had a discussion about the Northern Ireland definition in this regard, which is contained in article 5.2 of the Race Relations Act, 1997.</P>
      <P>I hope the inclusion of this definition will ensure better protection for travellers under the legislation. Once a definition is inserted in legislation, certain people are automatically excluded. The strength of this provision and its benefit to the travelling community will depend on the case law that develops. There was some concern in the North about efforts to exclude people from the definition once it was put in place. When a definition such as this is introduced, it strengthens the level of protection, but how it works in practice depends on the emergence of case law. It will be interesting to see the case law that develops in this area.</P>
      <P>It is preferable that there should be such a definition in this legislation. This is the first time we have a strong definition of &ldquo;traveller community&rdquo; in legislation by which travellers can be identified, both by themselves and by others, as people with a shared history, culture and traditions including, historically, a nomadic way of life on the island of Ireland. The insertion of this definition was sought by groups working with travellers who deemed it necessary to include it in the legislation.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister's amendments on the use of the capital &ldquo;T&rdquo; and the definition of &ldquo;Traveller community&rdquo;. I thank him for taking on board the view of Opposition spokespersons and that of the wide variety of traveller groups who contacted us about the legislation. Travellers feel strongly that the name of their group should have a capital &ldquo;T&rdquo; in the legislation. I am glad the Minister has taken that on board in his amendment.</P>
      <P>Pavee Point was one of the groups that came before the Select Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights. Its representatives referred specifically to the definition of traveller in the Northern Ireland Race Relations Act and they agreed to send us a copy of it. I am pleased the Minister used that definition in his amendment.</P>
      <P>In the context of North-South relations, it is important that both jurisdictions use similar definitions in this type of legislation so that travellers who move from the North to the South or <i>vice versa</i> are covered under the same definition in legislation in the two jurisdictions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a good addition to the Bill. It illustrates the importance of listening to the groups who represent the interests of the traveller community <Col N="1608" /> who know better than any of us how they feel about how they are described.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Sullivan and the Minister referred to the corresponding legislation in the North. Does the wording &ldquo;. a nomadic way of life on the island of Ireland.&rdquo; mean that if a group of travellers are discriminated against in the North and subsequently move to the South, they can seek redress under our legislation to combat that discrimination or must that injustice be addressed under the legislation in the Northern jurisdiction? This matter is of interest, particularly in the context of the cross-Border relationships and institutions which are being established. Would a group wishing to take a case in this jurisdiction in respect of something which occurred in Northern Ireland be allowed to do so?</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister on the definition of the term &ldquo;traveller&rdquo; which is contained in amendment No. 7. This is an historic development because it will emphasise to the travelling community the sincerity with which we intend to proceed. However, some people will continue to disagree with the definition because, when they are refused something for specific reasons, certain individuals are inclined to use the travelling community for their own ends, which is wrong. I welcome the amendment.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputies for their contributions in respect of these amendments. Deputy Barnes inquired whether the legislation in this jurisdiction would cover discrimination in Northern Ireland. The answer is that it will not because the Republic and the North are two separate jurisdictions. The existence of the cross-Border bodies will not make any difference in this respect. However, if a group of travellers enter the South and are discriminated against, the fact that they do not reside in this jurisdiction would not make any difference in terms of the legislation because they cannot be discriminated against.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 7, line 33, to delete &ldquo;but no longer exists&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;whether before or after the commencement of this section&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment, which we discussed briefly on Committee Stage, was suggested by the Irish Ladies Golfing Union and it relates to the discrimination which continues to exist in certain clubs. If the definition included the term &ldquo;whether before or after the commencement of this section&rdquo;, it could deal effectively with discrimination which occurred or will occur before, during or after the passage of the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a concern among women golfers &ndash; this could also apply to women who are discriminated against by other clubs &ndash; that we should ensure that ongoing discrimination is properly <Col N="1609" /> covered under the legislation. They believe there is a possibility that account will not be taken of past discrimination. I refer, for example, to instances where women were not allowed to hold certain types of membership, particularly full membership, of golf clubs. That discrimination needs to be taken on board in terms of the sanctions set out in the legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister, like other Members, has been presented with cogent and well argued reasons from members of the Irish Ladies Golfing Union regarding the difficulty of achieving what the Equal Status Bill is attempting to achieve in respect of full membership and full rights, which women members of golf clubs have been denied for so long. The Employment Equality Act and the Equal Opportunities Act, 1977, contained clauses which allowed, within the terms of those Acts, what would be seen as positive or affirmative action to allow steps to be taken to bring balance to unbalanced, unfair or discriminatory situations.</P>
      <P>The members of the Irish Ladies Golfing Union were wondering if we could strengthen the Bill so that influence could be brought to bear in order to insist that, given their long years of associate membership and membership of particular clubs would not, they would not find themselves at the end of a long waiting list to gain full membership or be obliged to pay exorbitant fees. The type of discrimination which did not allow these women to hold full membership continues to work against them. They believe it would take between 50 and 100 years, if not more, to achieve a balance and to obtain the full membership rights which have always been enjoyed by men, unless, as was the case with the employment legislation, some form of positive or affirmative mechanism is included in the Bill. I am anxious to hear the Minister's views on this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that what is intended by Deputy O'Sullivan's amendment &ndash; judging by her comments it is also Deputy Barnes' intention &ndash; is to ensure that golf clubs take into account the past associate membership of women rather than treating them as if they were becoming members for the first time. This is not, however, what the proposed amendment achieves, nor would it be my intention to legislate against discrimination which existed in the past. The Bill does not have retrospective effect. However, the effect of section 3(1)(f2&gt;a) is that discrimination which occurs after the commencement of the Act but which is based on a ground which existed in the past, regardless of when, will be covered by the Bill. Since associate membership is not a discriminatory ground, Deputy O'Sullivan's amendment does not achieve its intended purpose. I do not see how we can legislate to cover the position of women who have been associate members of golf clubs. Whether charging such persons full fees would constitute <Col N="1610" /> discrimination would depend on the circumstances of the case.</P>
      <P>The legislation does not prevent positive action being taken. If, for example, a club wishes to act in a positive fashion, the legislation will not prohibit it from doing so. I hope that offers the Deputy some reassurance. I cannot see how I could legislate to cover the kind of eventuality to which Deputies O'Sullivan and Barnes refer.</P>

      <P>The difficulty is that when these women would have joined their golf clubs the memberships fees would have been much lower in certain cases than they are at present. I accept that perhaps this applies more to the Dublin area than to other parts of the country. I do not know if the Minister could spell it out any more clearly that it is the intention of the legislation that golf clubs should take full account of the number of years during which people have been members. In effect, many members could only hold associate membership because they were women. Will the Minister indicate his intention that clubs should not introduce enormous entry fees in respect of people who could not become full members in the past?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to reiterate that a great number of women were not presented with a choice in respect of associate membership. Such membership was the only avenue of entry open to them and it was also an absolute discrimination against them. Not alone did it not allow them full membership, it also denied them voting rights or those rights relating to the operation or funding of their clubs, to which they contributed greatly.</P>
      <P>The Employment Equality Act contains a built-in acceptance that, in areas where women, against their will, were heavily discriminated against and where an imbalance was obvious, there could be a directive that this would not be seen as discrimination within the broad terms of the legislation but that it would actively and affirmatively rebalance an ongoing or endemic discrimination, which associate membership has been recognised as being. It was in the context of what was provided in the Employment Equality Act, 1998, that they ask that something similar could be built in.</P>

      <P>It is not always easy to make up for past discrimination. One often cannot and <Col N="1611" /> people have suffered in many areas because of discrimination. There is an appalling history in golf clubs of exclusion and discrimination and it should never have happened. The Minister stated that positive action is possible and the least one would expect is that the long period of associate membership which women have held at various clubs should be taken into account by them, together with the discrimination they imposed. The clubs argue that women pay lower fees and have special conditions, but women were not allowed to become full members whereas they are now and they face enormous costs. The clubs should not add to previous discrimination by charging exorbitant fees for women to become full members. Basic decency and common sense should be expected from the clubs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with previous speakers. My family is heavily involved in golf. However, discrimination only occurs in certain clubs. I am a member of a club where there is no discrimination. It may not have the same status as others but it has more than those in Limerick and Kerry. However, there is a line of thought among female golfers that while they wish to become full members, they do not want to pay the full fees. They must resolve that issue, but when the Bill is enacted they will become full members. I do not envisage them being charged the full fees. I would hate to be the club captain or secretary who charges full fees to women.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that certain clubs, which may be small in number but loom large in terms of the psyche of the nation, of which women are associate members do not allow them into certain areas of the clubs, such as bars etc? I find that apartheid to be so extraordinarily offensive that something should be done about it in order to prevent it from continuing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt that there was discrimination and this legislation seeks to eliminate it. I stress that section 9(2) states:</P>
      <P>For the purposes of <i>section 8</i>, a club shall not be considered to be a discriminating club by reason only that it&ndash;</P>
      <P>(a)has, for the principal purpose of promoting equality, a reserved place or places on its board or committee of management for persons who are members of a particular category, or</P>
      <P>(b)takes other measures for the principal purpose of obtaining a more equal involvement in club matters of persons who are members of a particular category.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This underlines my earlier point that there is nothing to prevent clubs from taking positive action, such as that mentioned by Members opposite. While I cannot deal in the legislation with the issue of what fees should be paid by <Col N="1612" /> female members of golf clubs, my recommendation is that golf clubs might take the opportunity of discussing the matter and how it might be best resolved with the Equality Authority and I hope that happens. With regard to golf generally, there is no danger of me being discriminated against because on the few occasions when I tried to play the game I lost the ball and I do not believe in troubling St. Anthony too often.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a shame that the Minister has not had the opportunity to play more often given all the fine golf courses in Kerry. I do not play and I have never lost a ball because I never tried to hit one. The problem in this area is that there is an entrenched culture in certain golf clubs which will be difficult to eradicate. This legislation will go some way towards that. My amendment would have forced them to go a little further. If we could retain the sanction of removing Government grants and so on from them, that would strengthen the legislation further. It is a culture that has no place in the modern world and the sooner golf clubs realise that the better. It has been removed from most other leisure activities but, sadly, it remains in certain areas. The gentlemen concerned must enter the modern world and the new millennium quickly.</P>

      <P>These amendments deal with indirect discrimination.

It has been narrowed in this legislation and deals only with indirect discrimination with regard to services. I prefer the inclusion of the 1997 definition, which included clubs, education, accommodation etc. It would strengthen the definition. My amendment proposes that one of the grounds should be refusing <Col N="1613" /> or failing to do all that is reasonable to prevent indirect discrimination from occurring in a club. That obligation should be placed on providers of services. They should make every effort and ensure that there is no indirect discrimination.</P>

      <P>This amendment would not make sense without the addition also of amendment No. 15 which is directly related. The amendments would allow indirect discrimination to cover a case where a minority group can comply with a condition but only by suffering a detriment. They may be able to comply with a condition as set out in the Bill but I want to ensure that, in complying with it, they would not suffer a detriment.</P>
      <P>Their ability to comply should not be the only criterion because they could suffer as a result of complying with a condition and this should be covered in the Bill. This amendment was requested by the Irish Ladies Golfing Union because of their detailed experience with regard to conditions with which they can comply but which cause them some pain. The purpose of the amendment is to address that aspect.</P>

The definition of indirect discrimination is equivalent to that in the 1997 Bill and follows generally accepted international norms for defining indirect discrimination. The amendment would, when considered in conjunction with section 3(1)(f2&gt;c)(iii), introduce considerable uncertainty into the definition. If a person cannot comply with a condition, it is possible to establish whether a particular category of person suffers disproportionately from the requirement.</P>
      <P>However, if, as the Deputy suggests in the amendment, the degree of compliance with the requirement is taken into account, it becomes extraordinarily difficult to determine whether the requirement has a disproportionately adverse effect on a particular category.

      <P>In page 16, line 13, before &ldquo;justified&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;objectively&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 17 states, &ldquo;In page 8, line 13, to delete &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;necessary&rdquo;. The section deals with circumstances in which discrimination shall be taken to occur. It defines indirect discrimination and the amendments call for a change in the test as set out in the Bill. The test is whether the obligation is reasonable rather than requiring that there should be justified and objective grounds unrelated to the person's sex or marital status.</P>
      <P>The amendment suggests that it should be changed to read that the obligation to comply with the condition cannot be objectively justified as being reasonable in all the circumstances of the case. I also suggest in amendment No. 17 that the word &ldquo;necessary&rdquo; should be substituted for &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo;. The amendments would strengthen the provision and objectify the position. Subjectivity is built into the measure as it stands and the amendments would make it stronger. The Irish Council for Civil Liberties suggested that this amendment would strengthen the Bill.

It is also unchanged <Col N="1615" /> from the Equal Status Bill, 1997. I do not consider that it is appropriate to amend this provision in the way suggested by Deputy Fitzgerald as it would create an unnecessary departure from the provisions of section 31 of the Employment Equality Act.</P>
      <P>It will be a matter for the Director of Equality Investigations to decide whether the conditions in question have a discriminatory effect which cannot be justified as being reasonable in all the circumstances of the case.

      <P>Amendment No. 18 arises from Committee Stage proceedings. Amendments Nos. 22 to 26, inclusive and 102 are related to amendment No. 18 and all may be discussed together. Is that agreed? Agreed.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 18:</P>
      <P>In page 8, line 35, after &ldquo;origins&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or they are of a different linguistic group&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the amendment is to add linguistic group to the ground of race, which includes whether a person is of a different race, colour, nationality or ethnic or national origin. The amendment was suggested by the Refugee Council in response to the experience of many people who have come to this country in recent years and who are of a different race, colour, nationality or ethnic or national origin. Linguistic group is a significant aspect in terms of where they feel they may be subject to discrimination. Many languages are spoken by people who are currently on this island and the Refugee Council feels strongly that these should be covered in equal status legislation.</P>
      <P>Although I may refer to them later, the subject of the other amendments was considered in detail on Committee Stage. These include the trade union membership ground and the homelessness ground, which was suggested by the Coolock Law Centre because of the problem of discrimination with regard to housing. If people are in receipt of rent allowance, landlords do not want to accommodate them. This issue has only arisen in recent years, particularly since the obligation on private landlords to register with local authorities. Many of them do not like this requirement and they do not want to accept people with a rent allowance because it would identify them as landlords. No legislation should provide cover for such activity. This is an opportunity to ensure this type of discrimination cannot be practised and that there is legislation under which people can take action if subjected to such discrimination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 24 and 25 relate to discriminatory grounds of refugee and asylum seeker. They were tabled as one amendment for Committee Stage which read: &ldquo;that one is a refugee or an <Col N="1616" /> asylum seeker.&rdquo;. In response to the Minister on Committee Stage we have submitted them as two separate amendments. We are of the strong view that we should take account of the growing number of people coming to Ireland seeking refugee status. We have separated the two areas &ndash; the refugee and the asylum seeker &ndash; on the basis that the Minister indicated there might be some confusion if we put the two areas in the one amendment. We must ensure there is no discrimination in either category in regard to access to services. There is some evidence in the media and from discussions with individuals that there may be discrimination with regard to the provision of services. We want to ensure there are no grounds for such discrimination, that it is covered by the legislation and that these people can go to the Equality Authority, if discriminated against in regard to access.</P>
    <P>There is a growing tendency for people to behave in a way that might be interpreted as racist where they are denying access to a service on grounds of race, asylum seeking or refugee. These grounds are inter-related. It is important that the legislation defines exactly where discrimination will not be tolerated and it should not be tolerated under any of these grounds. We are seeking to include these extra grounds in addition to the nine already in the legislation. The experience this year indicates that these amendments are necessary.</P>
    <P>I support amendment No. 26 dealing with a political group or ideology, in the name of Deputy Fitzgerald. Our amendment No. 102 deals with membership of trade unions, a matter on which we have spoken on Committee Stage. As a member of the Labour Party I feel strongly that a person should not be discriminated against because he or she happens to be a member of a trade union.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">

      <P>If the Minister read <i>The Irish Times</i> this morning he would have seen an article about a woman who is a lecturer in Cork who said: &ldquo;I thank God I drive to work because to walk on the streets of this country as a black person is a nightmare&rdquo;. It is clear there are racist attitudes and that many people experience discrimination because of their colour and race. We live in a society that is changing fast and we have to deal with new issues of integration, refugees and asylum seekers, all of which pose new challenges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the amendments which Deputy O'Sullivan and I have tabled we are seeking to extend the grounds covered by the Bill. Everyone in the House welcomes the extension and the nine different grounds covered, but they are not comprehensive. I assume the Department will initiate the review, which I hope will be comprehensive, in three years and five years and that the grounds will be extended because they are not comprehensive at this stage. The Minister has said this is not the time to introduce new amendments and that they require complex consideration. One <Col N="1617" /> area where we consider it should be extended is in regard to trade union membership. The ICTU would consider this an extremely important issue for trade union members who may still be discriminated against because of their membership of a trade union. Obviously this is much broader than the concept of unfair dismissal. We are also talking about the possibility that, because one is a member of a trade union, it would discriminate against people in regard to access to employment opportunities. It seems reasonable that there should be a constitutional protection in relation to this issue.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Sullivan has given a number of examples on social welfare grounds particularly in the area of accommodation which is becoming an issue. We have separated the amendments which seek to provide protection for refugees and asylum seekers. While there would be some coverage under the Bill on grounds of race or ethnicity, it is clear that if a protection is built in for the person, a refugee or an asylum seeker, there would be more comprehensive protection based on their legal status.</P>
    <P>We have already had an interesting explanation from the Minister on the duties of the State and how one has to distinguish between the duties of the State, the obligations in regard to custom duties or immigration and the services supplied. When Deputy O'Sullivan and I tabled these amendments on Committee Stage we were talking about the services as they are meant to apply to refugees and asylum seekers and were not trying to change immigration policy. The Minister commented in detail on our proposal and, I think, misunderstood it. He seemed to suggest that in terms of legal rights we were trying to open the floodgates. That was not the intention. The intention was to ensure that refugees and asylum seekers would have the most comprehensive cover possible in regard to discrimination, that they would be able to go to the Equality Authority and have the same protections relevant to their status and whatever services they are entitled to in either category &ndash; as a refugee or as an asylum seeker &ndash;  without discrimination by those delivering the services, the State or anybody else. We have tabled the amendment as two separate categories, refugee and asylum seeker.</P>
    <P>The Minister's points about immigration and the huge demand on services do not hold up in relation to this Bill. This is about giving a more comprehensive service to refugees and asylum seekers. There may be discrimination on grounds of legal status which should not happen. The people in this category should have access to the Equality Authority as it develops. Grounds of political opinion have been sought by the Irish Council of Civil Liberties which felt it was reasonable to include this in equal status legislation. The European Convention on Human Rights guarantees protection from discrimination on these grounds as well as on other grounds, for example, political or other opinions, social origin, property, <Col N="1618" /> birth or other status. It is important to note this in the context of the North-South discussions and in the context of bringing in new human rights legislation. Our legislation should aspire to come as close as possible to the European Convention on Human Rights. It also brings Irish equality legislation into line with the Good Friday Agreement. The stronger the protection we can give, through amending the grounds, the closer we will be to the European Convention on Human Rights and to other human rights legislation that it is intended to enact.</P>
    <P>We are seeking to extend the category of persons who can seek comprehensive support from an equality authority. It means that people will have more protection from discrimination. I appreciate that to introduce an amendment of this nature at this stage one must tease out the implications of it and there is a deal of work involved in doing that. It is important that this legislation be put on the Statute Book. We do not want another delay of six years. This legislation should have been on the Statute Book ten or 15 years ago and it has been a long and tedious process to get to this point. I welcome the legislation and I congratulate the Minister for introducing it and steering it through the Houses.</P>
    <P>The Equality Authority is working well in its initial stages. If we can extend the grounds and provide broader coverage, we will get much more comprehensive legislation. In a changing society, where issues of immigration and the rights of refugees and asylum seekers are to the fore and where there is concrete evidence of racism emerging and of particular difficulties which those groups are experiencing, it is important that they are covered as comprehensively as possible in equal status legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. T. Ahearn</NameTxt>
      <P>I consider this section the cornerstone of the Bill because we are defining where discrimination under the Bill, when enacted, will have taken place. We must be cautious and careful with this section. I would prefer if we erred on the side of being overly inclusive rather than having omissions. If there are omissions, experience shows that discrimination can then take place because it will not come under the legislation. Therefore, under no circumstances should we leave out definitions which we feel should be included. I congratulate Deputies Fitzgerald and O'Sullivan for trying to include these different categories.</P>
      <P>Recommendations have come from many interest groups from which I have received much correspondence. These groups have put a great deal of thought into the Bill and we should listen carefully to their submissions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is unwise to refer back to the 1997 Bill because society has changed more in the past two years than over the past decade. That is why the Minister should accept amendment No. 18, which proposes to insert the words &ldquo;or they are of a different linguistic group&rdquo;. Society is becoming more multi-cultural. Whereas it was unheard of <Col N="1619" /> before when one walked the streets of any town or city, we now hear languages which in past we would have to go to London to hear. It is important to include this amendment in the Bill and under no circumstances to allow discrimination, which we know could arise, to be covered by the Bill.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 23 in the name of Deputy O'Sullivan refers to those who are in receipt of social welfare support for rental of properties. Those of us involved in local authorities would be ignoring reality if we did not accept that such people are discriminated against at present. People who are on the waiting list for local authority houses and are in receipt of social welfare rental support find it far more difficult to find accommodation and to get landlords who will accept them than those who are in employment and are paying from their own resources. This will be an ongoing problem because there is a housing crisis. It is important that amendment No. 23 is included in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to err on the side of greater definition rather than on the side of omission. It will take too long before the Bill, when enacted, is reviewed and what we know today should be included.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>Circumstances on all levels have changed extraordinarily since the introduction of the first Equal Status Bill. Perhaps it is appropriate that the Bill is being taken now. We can strengthen it in ways which deal with circumstances which we had not anticipated would occur so quickly.</P>
      <P>People who have come to Ireland seeking refugee and immigrant status remind us of the huge amount of work on education and leadership that must be done. This is why I honour this and the other House. Legislation is the cornerstone of justice and the behaviour following from that. That is why our role, as legislators, is so important. Without the foundation stone of legislation, we do not have the capacity and influence to bring about the change in attitudes and behaviour which has happened so dramatically in other areas of equality during the past 25 years.</P>
      <P>The attitudes to women at work and to equality of pay and opportunity would never have changed and the change would not have accepted if the legislation was not put in place and the Employment Equality Agency and other agencies did not exist to win, sometimes slowly and with struggle, what was won. The important thing is that, in doing so, the legislation has changed attitudes and made a fairer and more just society.</P>
      <P>The next hurdle to be taken is in regard to present circumstances. I am optimistic because the legislation was introduced in its integrity and with the will of the Minister, which is apparent. We are setting down another foundation stone for the next challenge ahead, which is a multi-cultural, pluralist society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome amendment No. 18, which has to do <Col N="1620" /> with different linguistic groups. Indeed, while sitting here I have been wondering if we could introduce an amendment about accents in the Irish context, because there are times when people &ndash; not Kerry people, I hasten to add &ndash; living in certain areas are discriminated against because of their accent and address. However, I will not table such an amendment today.</P>

      <P>The amendment on different linguistic groups is very important. It would be used in that context and would address in-built discriminations and judgments.</P>
      <P>I welcome the amendment in the names of Deputies O'Sullivan and Fitzgerald which has to do with the trade union membership ground. With the changing economy, the great work on social partnership and the aggressive nature of economic productivity the rights of trade union membership must be protected. We have to make sure that discrimination cannot occur with regard to working conditions or accommodation due a person's trade union membership. The welfare ground has been mentioned and both the Acting Chairman, Deputy McGrath, and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform are well aware of the kind of discrimination that not only occurs but also is exacerbated by the current housing crisis.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Fourth Progress Report on the Courts and the Judiciary, published by the All-Party Committee on the Constitution on Wednesday, 24 November 1999. The <Col N="1621" /> report recommends a number of changes to the Constitution which require serious consideration.</P>
      <P>The crucial recommendations made by the committee relate to issues such as the establishment of a judicial council and the reform of the current impeachment procedure.</P>

      <P>Deputy Bruton will appreciate the Government has not examined the report yet. However, in the spirit in which he put the question, the report &ndash; most of which I have had the opportunity to read &ndash; seems excellent. It seems to be well thought out in principle. This arose from the situation last May. It would have created great difficulties. At that stage, the Ceann Comhairle wrote to me and others and we asked the all-party committee to look at it. There are recommendations on judicial conduct, removal of judges, appointment of judges and security of tenure in what seems to be an excellent report. In principle, the answer is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.</P>

Within broad limits, when does he expect to come to the House with the Government's considered view on these matters?</P>

      <P>The memorandum for the Government is being prepared. I hope the report will be before the Government in January. The Attorney General will, obviously, also have a big input into this. There are many parts to the report but the establishment of the judicial council and the reform of the current impeachment procedure &ndash; which is what the report arose from &ndash; are the two most significant issues. However, the memorandum will cover all the issues involved, such as appointments and transparency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Bruton. This is a difficult area but a great deal of time has elapsed since the original Article 35.2 was drafted. Our courts are far larger and more complex today, although some of the principles do not change. Article 35.2 states, &ldquo;All judges shall be independent in the exercise of their judicial functions and subject only to this Constitution and the law&rdquo;. The report sets out the difficulties that can arise. One of the issues we will have to look at very carefully in <Col N="1622" /> regard to judicial conduct is having a lay element on that council. That issue was well debated in public in the middle of the year. I am conscious it is a fundamental change, but it is hard to argue against it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that, as a result of what is known colloquially as the &ldquo;compo culture&rdquo;, the courts are acquiring an ever closer resemblance to a cross between a cattle market and a stock exchange, where discussions on how much money &ldquo;A&rdquo; will get and who will hold out for more are conducted by those congregating on the steps of the court before the case goes to hearing? The procedure does not necessarily give the system of justice the good repute we would wish. In addition to tackling the issue of the appointment and accountability of judges, we need to deal with the compensation culture which is causing, to a degree, a perversion of the true nature of justice in a democracy such as ours. The pursuit of money and claims, which while legal are not necessarily just, is taking over from the true role of defending the liberties of the citizen.</P>

      <P>A progress report on the implementation of the strategy is being prepared by the IFSC clearing house group. I expect that this will be completed by the end of this year and submitted to Government early in the new year. This will show good progress with the priority actions outlined in the strategy and this is reflected in the continued growth and development of the centre.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that the financial services industry is steadily moving away from the less well off? Will he also agree that, increasingly, it is only those with computers who can avail of Internet banking and those who are adept at using the new financial instruments created by the financial services sector who will be able to get the full benefit from the banking system? Is the Taoiseach aware that Allied Irish Banks is closing its Ballyfermot branch which serves a large suburb of Dublin that will no longer have a branch of the largest bank in the State? Does the Taoiseach agree that social division is being sown by the priorities espoused by the financial services industry and the manner in which it does its business?</P>

      <P>Much as I would like to talk about the AIB Ballyfermot branch which is in my constituency, this question relates to the IFSC and I do not wish to comment on domestic banks. The IFSC has continued to be a tremendous success with 2,000 new jobs being created this year. The centre has continued to devise and implement new strategies. Domestic users do not avail of the IFSC, and its mechanisms and systems are not easily understood by the public. However, the centre is doing a good job as an international centre competing against European and other markets. The IFSC's success can be seen from its rapid development, and excellent initiatives have been created. This has been another very successful year and a remarkably successful decade for the IFSC.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree there <Col N="1625" /> is a need for intervention at international level to ensure that there is a public service element in banking just as in transport and other essential services? If our banking sector is solely driven by the needs of the biggest customers with the largest amounts of money, banking will become an instrument of social division and exclusion as other services have become? Does the Taoiseach agree that the Government, the EU or some other institution needs to devise some method of ensuring that minimum services are provided for the least well off by the financial services sector, whether international or local?</P>

      <P>The IFSC is an international services industry and must compete internationally in a global market with new devices and mechanisms. It is doing so very well and there are 8,500 jobs which would not exist otherwise. I have no difficulty agreeing with the Deputy's comments on domestic banks. They should provide a service and be conscious of the local nature of their business. Banks would argue that an enormous amount of their resources are designed to make that relevant but this does not relate to the question. However, banks are vitally important to local communities.</P>

However, the outstanding matter of taxation of deposits and dividends is at issue and, if this matter was resolved, credit unions would be able to fill the gaps that AIB and others are creating.

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 4 together.</P>
      <P>My Department's strategy statement covering the period 1998 &ndash; 2001 was laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas on 1 May 1998. The major goals for the Department set out in it may be summarised as follows: facilitating the efficient functioning of Government; achieving and maintaining lasting peace on the island of Ireland and the realisation of a new agreed three stranded political settlement; developing a strategic focus for this country's interests and image at international level; working with the social partners to develop and implement national programmes of economic and social development; and the ongoing development of an efficient public service.</P>
      <P>As will be clear from recent developments and my replies to previous questions in the House, very significant progress has been made in achieving the goals, and work is ongoing on the basis of divisional business plans to achieve these. As part of the overall strategic planning process in my Department, a series of presentations of the business plans to the management advisory committee is currently under way. This will assist in the process of prioritising the work of the Department and the associated resources required. In addition, work is currently under way on a progress report on the strategy statement, as required under section 4 of the Public Service Management Act, 1997.  It is anticipated that this work will be completed early in the new year and that copies of the progress report will then be submitted to Government and will, when approved, be laid before both Houses for their information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On a related point, the strategic management initiative division of my Department is charged with the ongoing development of an efficient public service which delivers excellent services and in which authority, responsibility and accountability are clearly set out at all levels. The SMI is now moving from design to implementation, and a number of key priorities have been identified for current and future work. These are deepening the quality customer service initiative; the regulatory reform action programme; freedom of information; new financial management systems; human resource management issues, including performance management and recruitment; and gender equality. I am happy with the <Col N="1627" /> progress which is being made with regard to all of these areas.</P>
    <P>In addition, my Department has undertaken a comprehensive programme of financial management reform during 1999. This programme includes the implementation of the reforms set out in the strategic management initiative and approved by the Government during 1999, an examination of how greater value for money can be obtained from administrative expenditure, and an assessment of how information technology can be better deployed to improve the service provided by the finance unit. Professional advice has been engaged to assist with the reform process. In response to the legislative priorities of my Department for 2000, drafting of a Bill to place the National Economic and Social Council and the National Economic and Social Forum on a statutory footing is at an advanced stage. It is expected that this Bill will be published early in 2000.</P>
    <P>Overall, I consider that my Department has made a significant contribution to moving the agenda forward in relation to the key areas set out in the Department's strategy statement and I am satisfied with its performance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach identified the first function of his Department under the strategic management initiative as facilitating the efficient functioning of Government. In that context, what role did the Department of the Taoiseach play in framing Budget 2000?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach think the targets for facilitating the efficient functioning of Government were achieved in that regard, given the budget has been revised for the third time in two weeks?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department of the Taoiseach played the same role in framing the budget as it does every year and it will continue to do so. I wish to correct the Deputy regarding his notion that there has been a further revision. In the context of negotiations on what will I hope be a successful new programme, the Government, like the social partners, must take account of the issues on the agenda. That will have to be negotiated in the early months of next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Was the addition of £125 million to the budget deficit to compensate spouses in the home for being unable to freely transfer tax allowances, as was previously the case, prompted by the social partners? Given that the strategic management initiative refers to the measurement of success against quantifiable targets, what financial envelope is being provided in the ongoing negotiations with social partners? Is a particular sum available to alter or add to budget 2000?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No sum is being provided for <Col N="1628" /> any amendments. As regards what will happen over three years, the process is confidential. However, the Department of Finance has presented the social partners with what it believes the financial position will be in that three years. We must be prudent and keep within those parameters so we can continue the excellent economic growth achieved in the past ten to 12 years. At the start of the decade we had a high current budget deficit, an extraordinarily high Exchequer borrowing requirement, very low economic growth and along with Belgium, the highest Government debt-GDP ratio in the EU. We are ending the decade without a current budget deficit, Exchequer borrowing requirement, or requirement for capital borrowing and with the third &ndash; I hope it will soon be the second &ndash; lowest debt-GDP ratio in the EU and the highest economic growth, not only in the EU but also in the OECD. The Government and the Minister for Finance are conscious of maintaining this excellent position which the Minister has helped to bring about.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach will accept I am familiar with the good statistics he quoted, to which I contributed as Taoiseach in Government. This was a seamless achievement of successive Governments, not of one, as I know the Taoiseach will acknowledge. Does the Taoiseach agree his Department has two key roles &ndash;  facilitating the efficient functioning of Government and working with the social partners to develop and implement national programmes of economic and social development? With the benefit of hindsight and following due recollection, does the Taoiseach agree it might have been better to have had discussions with the social partners about the increases in allowances,<i> vis-à-vis </i>the widening of bands and the reduction of rates, before introducing the budget rather than having consultations afterwards and announcing it as a tablet of stone only to find that it is now a lump of clay?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that hindsight is an exact science and the Taoiseach is as good at it as anyone else. On reflection, does he think he might have better fulfilled the strategic management goals of his Department, including the official functioning of Government and working with the social partners, if they had been consulted about the broad lines of the tax policy in the budget before rather than after?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be glad to give a long reply if this was a debate on the issue. That would have been an interesting discussion if the social <Col N="1629" /> partners had not made it absolutely clear that the provisions of the budget would not be credited in the next round of talks. Therefore, that discussion was not relevant. It was clear to the social partners that most of the commitments given by this Government would continue to be fulfilled.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The SMI strategy from the time of its launch in 1992 has been to try to get civil servants to become involved in the formulation of policies. It was felt there should be direct Governmental and departmental involvement in agreeing a programme so that the priority of the Taoiseach's Department would be to use more of its resources to follow these practices rather than the normal legislative practice. In so far as it is possible to do so, both in terms of the strategy statement worked out by the officeholder and in the goals set down, I am trying to motivate staff at all levels in order to make the job more interesting and realistic. The strategy may not be perfect but we will continue to look at ways to improve it. This is a new practice and I am confident the implementation of the strategy in identifying our goals and objectives is working well.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that it is demoralising for NESC in regard to future reports if it finds that when it produces a carefully worked out report to achieve social justice in budgetary policy by increasing tax free allowances rather than putting all the weight on bands and rates, that the Government simply bins the NESC report and ignores it as if it was never drawn up?

      <P>Before the Ceann Comhairle rules the question out of order, I must say I am aghast at what Deputy Bruton has just said. Members will recall that when the NESC report was published some months ago, I had to try to defend those who worked on the report when Deputy Bruton said it was vague, not directed, not coherent and somewhat hopeless.

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Taoiseach believes so much in the report, why did he ignore it when drawing up the budget? There was just one recommendation in the report, that was that the Minister should go for allowances, not for bands and rates. It was vague in virtually every other area but it was clear on that issue. Why did the Taoiseach ignore the NESC report given that he defended it in this House?  </P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will recall on that day, as on many other occasions, I stated that the key issue identified by NESC, and rightly so, was the appalling situation whereby people on very low incomes drifted into the higher rate of tax because the bands were too narrow. The budget changed this for the first time in many years. The key recommendation of the NESC report has been implemented. We will continue to implement some of its other recommendations.</P>

      <P>The Central Statistics Office included a range of questions on crime <Col N="1633" /> and victimisation in the September to November 1998 quarterly national household survey and published the results on Tuesday, 23 November 1999.</P>
      <P>The CSO's report contains estimates of the level of crime over a 12 month period and also includes statistics on how people perceive crime and safety in Ireland today. The report showed that crime had affected one in every eight households over the course of the previous year.</P>
      <P>The CSO survey results are not directly comparable with the crime figures published each year by the Garda Síochána. This is because there are fundamental differences in the way the two sets of figures are compiled and classified. While the Garda report provides a detailed breakdown of indictable and non-indictable offences, the CSO survey gives a more aggregated view of the level of crime. The survey results show that not all crimes are reported to the gardaí. For example, almost 95% of vehicle thefts were reported to the gardaí, whereas the level of reporting of vandalism was under 40%. For most other types of crime, about 60% of incidents are reported. The most common reason for not reporting a crime was that it &ldquo;was not serious enough&rdquo; or that there was &ldquo;no financial loss&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>These findings are consistent with the results of the ESRI's 1982 survey on crime in Ireland, and with international experience of comparing crime surveys with police statistics.</P>

      <P>To finalise the arrangements for the period from 8 a.m. on 31 December 1999 to 8 a.m. on 2 January 2000, a Labour Court hearing was held yesterday, 14 December 1999. Representatives of the alliance of health trade unions were in attendance, as was a group comprising officials from the Department of Finance, the Health Services Employers' Agency, my Department and a number of health service providers. I await the chairperson's decision on this issue.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter for the chairman but the Deputy can take it that it will be as soon as he has had an opportunity to listen to the submissions made. I am sure his decision is imminent.</P>
      <P>I wish to give some background information for the benefit of the House. On 21 April last, the HSEA advised the chief executive officer of each health service agency that special arrangements needed to be put in place for the millennium period. Following that, each agency notified its staff. Meetings aimed at resolving this issue commenced on 5 July when the alliance of health service unions first met management in relation to both staffing requirements and pay. At a subsequent meeting on 28 July, management agreed to present the unions with service plans locally. On 28 September, the management group committed to finalising the service plans and to process annual leave applications. The alliance of health service unions officially notified the HSEA of their claim on 7 October. The unions involved were notified of the public holiday arrangements on 29 October. Both parties then met the Labour Relations Commission on 2 December and again on 8 December.</P>
      <P>The following was agreed. Staff who traditionally would have expected to be off duty on 29 and 30 December as a result of enjoying privilege or concession days and who this year attend work at the request of management on such days to meet the additional staffing requirements associated with the millennium contingency plan will receive, in respect of each such day, an alternative two days off at times to be agreed locally and on a non-replacement basis. Staff who attend for duty on 28 December and-or 3 January will be dealt with on a local custom and practice basis or in accordance with collective agreements. The option of overtime at normal overtime rates will be offered, in addition to the normal week's pay.</P>
      <P>The claim for the period from 8 a.m. on 31 December to 8 a.m. on 2 January 2000 was the subject of a Labour Court hearing yesterday and no recommendation has been made by the chairman at this point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister, first, if both sides have agreed that they will accept whatever recommendation is made by the chairman of the Labour Court? Second, will the Minister accept there is a vital public interest in ensuring that our hospital services are properly maintained over the new year period? Third, will the Minister not agree that as the millennium has been well posted, these issues should have been dealt with before the Labour Court some weeks ago, and that it is leaving it a bit late to have a Labour Court hearing on 14 December?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the <Col N="1636" /> arrangements that are made by both the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court on the timing of any hearing in respect of a claim which was submitted on 7 October is a matter for the independent institutions. In fairness, there has been much discussion and co-operation and agreement reached at a local basis on many of these matters. On the outcome of the Labour Court recommendation, it is not practice to pre-empt matters or to say anything until the Labour Court chairman has an opportunity to give his recommendation, but the Deputy will be aware of the traditional Government position on these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there a danger the recommendations may not be accepted by one side and that we could be confronted, less than two weeks before the new year, with the possibility that medical and hospital services will not be properly maintained over that period due to an industrial dispute?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>It would not be helpful to speculate on any of these matters. As I said, they are being held in a good atmosphere. Issues have been resolved at local level between the parties. It was always the case that some issues would have to be referred for independent decision. That is a normal industrial relations practice and no one should anticipate that good IR practice in relation to Labour Court recommendations will not be observed in this case as they have been in others.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that every effort is being made and contingency plans are in place and are agreed, subject to one or two outstanding matters, including this matter. A number of advertising campaigns are currently taking place to ensure accident and emergency services are reserved for appropriate cases, particularly given the level of activity that will be generated over the period, in the interests of best patient care and in the interests of staff who are making themselves available.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Health and Children</askee>
      <Quest>the steps, if any, he is taking to address the serious criticism of the psychiatric hospital services outlined in the report of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals for 1998; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[27055/99]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the concerns of the Deputy in relation to the issues raised in the report of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals for 1998. I acknowledge the crucial role the inspector plays in providing an independent and detailed analysis of our mental health services. Many of the points <Col N="1637" /> raised by the inspector relate to clinical and administrative issues associated with the provision of care, and I would expect them to be addressed by the relevant professional and management staff in the health boards and hospitals concerned. In so far as the inspector has identified the need for improvements in facilities and staffing levels, it is my intention to make additional resources available to the health boards and hospitals. I have allocated an additional £12.2 million for improvements in mental health services for the coming year, which is an increase of more than 100% on the additional funding provided in 1999, and much of this will be devoted to tackling the deficiencies identified by the inspector.</P>
      <P>The lack of multidisciplinary teams in many areas of the mental health services has been highlighted by the inspector in his report. A total of £2.9 million has been allocated for next year towards the further development of community based mental health services, including the improvement of psychology and social work services. I acknowledge that much still needs to be done in the provision of comprehensive facilities and services. It is my intention to assist health boards to provide community-based services, as an alternative to care in large institutions, in line with the widely accepted policy for the mental health services outlined in Planning for the Future through the provision of development funding, both capital and revenue, next year and in future years.</P>
      <P>In his report, the Inspector of Mental Hospitals referred to the fact that some patients in psychiatric hospitals have been in institutional care for many years and recommended the establishment of dedicated teams to develop rehabilitation programmes to facilitate their transfer to more appropriate care in the community. I have allocated £250,000 to the Western Health Board to fund such a specialist-led team which will commence a rehabilitation programme for long-stay patients in St. Brigid's Hospital, Ballinasloe. If this pilot project is successful, a similar approach will be considered for other hospitals.</P>
      <P>An additional £1.1 million is being allocated to further developments in child and adolescent psychiatry services. This funding will provide for the appointment of additional consultants in child and adolescent psychiatry and for the development of multidisciplinary teams to focus on specific areas.</P>
      <P>The increase in the number of people living to advanced old age requires the development of specialist mental health services to meet their specific needs. Old age psychiatry services have been expanding in recent years and an additional £1 million is being allocated in 2000 to further this development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision of acute psychiatric units attached to, or associated with, general hospitals to replace services previously provided in psychiatric hospitals is continuing throughout the country and 17 acute psychiatric units are now linked <Col N="1638" /> to general hospitals. A number of units are currently at various stages of development including the Mercy Hospital, Cork; Beaumont Hospital, Dublin; James Connolly Memorial Hospital, Dublin; St. Vincent's Hospital, Elm Park; Portiuncula Hospital, Ballinasloe; Castlebar General Hospital; Ennis General Hospital; St Luke's Hospital, Kilkenny; Nenagh General Hospital; Portlaoise General Hospital; and Sligo General Hospital. A further four acute psychiatric units are under consideration as part of the national development plan.</P>
    <P>In addition, £1.35 million is being provided to facilitate substantial improvements in the forensic psychiatry services in Dublin, Cork and Limerick. These funds will enable the appointment of four additional consultant forensic psychiatrists and associated support staff, with two teams to be based in Dublin and one each in Cork and Limerick. These teams will liaise with the Director of Prison Medical Services and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform regarding the provision of appropriate psychiatric services in our prisons.</P>
    <P>In addition, £1 million has been allocated towards suicide prevention programmes and £2.5 million has been provided towards the costs associated with the implementation of new Mental Health Bill which I circulated yesterday. These initiatives clearly demonstrate my commitment to bringing about real improvements in the mental health services and in tackling service shortcomings identified by the inspector.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his lengthy response and for publishing the Mental Health Bill, but does he not appreciate that there is disappointment at the narrowness of his approach to dealing with serious deficiencies in our psychiatric services as outlined by the Inspector of Mental Hospitals? What is his view of the need to have in place a strategy to deal with the requirements of the inspector's report? Will he comment on the request from the Royal College of Psychiatrists to be given the task of drawing up such a strategy with the inspector? In relation to clinical practice, the Minister cannot leave it to the professional bodies to deal with the very serious criticisms of negligence and malpractice from health professionals in the psychiatric services. Does he accept he has a responsibility to ensure that the good practice in dealing with the psychiatrically ill that exists in many places is extended to all institutions, so that patients' rights are truly protected? </P>

      <P>I reject the assertion that there is a narrowness of approach on the part of this Administration. It compares very favourably with my predecessor. During 1998 the inspectorate published guidelines on good practice and quality assurance in the mental health services which stress the areas of performance felt to be important for patient care and which, in some cases, needed improvement. The importance of <Col N="1639" /> patients' rights across a broad range of issues was stressed and the responsibility of mental health services in such matters was highlighted. The document was circulated to all mental health service providers.</P>
      <P>In relation to the matter of good practice, I am providing in the Mental Health Bill for a Mental Health Commission and a central part of its remit will be to ensure good practice across the service. Again, to negate the assertion of narrowness of approach, I am proposing that the inspector will not be an inspector of mental hospitals in the future but an inspector of mental health services, which will incorporate community services. That means a far broader remit will be given under the new Mental Health Bill than has been the case until now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>While the guidelines on quality assurance were published and distributed to hospitals, what follow-up did his Department carry out to ensure hospitals apply the guidelines? It is clear from the current inspector's report that there have been many instances of the guidelines not being applied. It is one thing to issue guidelines but, while another structure is being created, which inevitably takes time, the Department of Health and Children must monitor the guidelines it has published and ensure they are being applied by the hospitals and services under the Department's aegis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I contend that the monitoring and provision of service plans as well as the confirmation of indicators on performance targets being met on such plans provide far greater transparency than was the case in the past. It ensures that what health service providers, management and health boards set out to achieve occurs. That has been greatly assisted by the service planning that is now a central feature of the accountability system that exists as a result of the change in the health funding arrangements since 1996.</P>
      <P>The inspector's role is an important one, but I acknowledge there is a need for improvements in this area. I have set out in detail the considerable additional resources being provided in the coming year in response to the 1998 report and I have asked for the 1999 report to be provided as quickly as possible. I am indicating that there is a policy response that is far greater than was the case with any previous report. Not only were there delays in providing such reports, but they were never debated. I look forward to going into far more detail on the specific aspects of the report this afternoon in the Seanad.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The inspector recognises the professionalism of our clinicians in this area. That is not to say there are no problems in this area, just <Col N="1640" /> as there are problems in a range of areas. It is not being suggested that it should be left to the clinicians themselves to decide good practice. The Mental Health Commission will not simply be made up of psychiatrists but of people who have front line practice of best practice in this area. I hope it will be an important stimulus to ensuring that best practice is widespread and available throughout the service, as the inspector wishes to see.</P>

      <Quest>when he will introduce legislation to implement the EU directive on tobacco advertising and sponsorship; and his views on the recommendations contained in the report, A National Anti-Smoking Strategy, published by the Joint Committee on Health and Children.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Shortly after becoming Minster for Health and Children I established an expert group on the issue of tobacco and health which is usually referred to as the Tobacco Free Policy Group and comprises senior health officials. Since its establishment it has monitored a number of national and international developments in the area of tobacco and health. I have received one report from it on issues arising out of litigation in the United States and I am considering this at present. A further report dealing with wider policy issues is being finalised by the group and I hope to have it early in the new year.</P>
      <P>Each year more than 6,000 people die in Ireland from tobacco-related illnesses. They are readily replaced by new smokers, more than 80 % of whom are under legal age. There are many factors that affect this, but I am satisfied that the marketing and promotion practices of the tobacco industry are the primary cause.</P>
      <P>We have had restrictions on advertising and sponsorship by the tobacco industry here for some years, but I am advised that prohibitions on advertising are only effective when they are comprehensive. Accordingly, I am committed to the introduction of such prohibitions. It is probable that the policy review being finalised will bring forward suggestions for other additional measures, some of which may require legislation. Accordingly, I have not yet made a final decision on the most appropriate legal instrument to be used. I will not wait to act until we have completed a lengthy deliberative and legislative process. Under existing law the levels of expenditure on tobacco advertising and sponsorship by the industry have to be approved by the Minister for Health and Children each year. In exercising these powers, I have advised the industry that, in general, I do not propose approving any further expenditure on advertising or sponsorship with effect from July next year. My officials will have further discussions in January 2000 with the interests affected to finalise the details of this arrangement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1641" /> With regard to the report of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children, I have directed that this report be given careful and detailed consideration by the Tobacco Free Policy Group in the light of its deliberations. I expect the group will adapt its report to take account of any new ideas or initiatives that are included in the joint Oireachtas committee's report.</P>
    <P>I am committed to putting in place an effective public health programme in this important area of tobacco and health. I am conscious that there is an increase in the number of children smoking and that further measures are necessary if we are to make any serious progress in reversing this trend. The Government has already taken the important and practical step of introducing one of the highest tax increases ever on tobacco products, 50 pense on a packet of 20 of cigarettes. While this may hit heavy smokers particularly hard, it should be borne in mind that the single most effective instrument in preventing young people from experimenting with tobacco is high price. I have also secured agreement of the Government that the proceeds from this increase will be given to the health services in funding.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the provisions in the European Union directive that Commissioner Flynn put into place? Will he acknowledge that if we are to implement the terms of that directive in this State, legislation will be required? Will he clarify whether he proposes to introduce legislation to be effective before 1 July next to ban tobacco advertising in newspapers and to ban all tobacco sponsorship of any event in the State on any date thereafter?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not yet made a decision on what legal instrument is to be used because I want to consider the comprehensive report, which will incorporate some of the deliberations of the committee of which the Deputy is a member. Following receipt of that I can deal comprehensively with all facets of this matter. I indicated that under the directive a ban on tobacco advertising in the press can be delayed until July 2002 and a ban on general sponsorship can be delayed until July 2003. I indicated to the newspaper and tobacco industries that I do not intend to allow expenditure in that area from July 2000.</P>
      <P>In relation to general sponsorship, I indicated my general intention. I asked the industry to report back to me if it has existing contractual obligations that extend beyond that date, which I am prepared to consider on an individual basis. I have given a clear signal that we want to move ahead of the indicative times set out in the directive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that he cannot effect a total ban on tobacco advertising or sponsorship without the enactment of legislation? Is he also aware that existing legislation provides for the control of expenditure on advertising and sponsorship but not for a ban by way of statutory <Col N="1642" /> instrument? Will he acknowledge that if he intends to put in place such a ban, it will be necessary to publish legislation very early in the new year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>As I stated to the Deputy, there are a number of policy responses that may require primary legislation or a statutory instrument to amend existing primary legislation. The tap will be turned off in relation to expenditure on tobacco advertising in the press from July next year. I will deliberate on the legal instruments that will be required once I receive the full report from the Tobacco Free Policy Group, although I am not stating that primary or secondary legislation will be required as I have not yet advised on that. The industry has been notified that from July 2000 expenditure on those issues will no longer be permitted. We will need a response not only to this issue but to a range of issues, some of which are raised in the committee's report on enforcement powers etc. We must deal with those issues and we might as well deal with them comprehensively and, in the meantime, use this mechanism, effectively, to prevent tobacco advertising.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from the recommendations referred to in that report, will the Government support a motion before the House to extend the terms of reference of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children to facilitiate it to seek to compel the tobacco companies to disclose to the committee, documentation held by them concerning the marketing of tobacco products, the health dangers of such products and the manner in which advice is received by those companies, whose products are marketed in this State?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>There are policy issues in this regard that have not yet been resolved. I note the committee's view on this and the Tobacco Free Policy Group has provided me with an interim report on the US litigation issue. The question of how that information might be published by ensuring absolute privileges requires further detailed examination.</P>
      <P>I received the interim report and the Attorney General's advice on that and once I receive the report on the wider policy issues domestically, I will consider going to Government with a response to ascertain if we could deal with a range of issues, which may include that one.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of that, but reasons could be given why we would proceed on an inquiry basis before making a decision on whether litigation would take place, given some of the information that is available. I do not want to pre-empt what must be a Government decision on some of these matters.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Children First &ndash; National Guidelines for the Protection and Welfare of Children is intended to support and guide health professionals, teachers, and members of the Garda Síochána and the many people in sporting, cultural, community and voluntary organisations who come into regular contact with children.</P>
      <P>The main objectives of the guidelines, which I published in late September 1999, are to improve the identification, reporting, assessment, treatment and management of child abuse, to clarify the responsibilities of various professionals and individuals within organisations, and to enhance communication and co-ordination of information between disciplines and organisations.</P>
      <P>In order to ensure wide circulation of the document Children First, I have arranged for 50,000 copies of the guidelines to be distributed among the health boards, schools and the Garda Síochána. This is in addition to 75,000 copies of the summary publication which are available free of charge from health boards and are aimed at voluntary organisations dealing with children. I have also arranged for 133,000 public information leaflets to be distributed by the health boards. I am pleased that the feedback to date on the guidelines from the various groups and individuals dealing with children has been very positive.</P>
      <P>This Government has undertaken a broad range of measures to strengthen and further develop child care services, including child protection services. An additional £30 million in revenue funding will be provided for these services in 2000. The full implementation of Children First will take time and requires improved service delivery models. Additional resources will be required to put in place a framework that supports these new models. The additional funding allocated in 2000 includes £3.25 million specifically earmarked for implementation of Children First. This is a significant level of investment and I will continue to ensure that investment continues until full implementation is achieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An implementation group has been established by the chief executive officers of the health boards to consider the implications for service delivery and to make arrangements for the uniform implementation of Children First across all health boards. In addition, arrangements are under way for the appointment of an additional person to the Social Services Inspectorate. This will allow the Social Services Inspectorate to <Col N="1644" /> monitor the implementation of Children First at health board level. The remit of the Establishment Group on the Social Services Inspectorate is also being expanded to include the monitoring of the implementation of Children First.</P>
    <P>The question of putting Children First on a statutory basis will be examined in the context of a White Paper on mandatory reporting, which is being prepared in my Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt these guidelines are comprehensive and welcome but there is a danger that they will be left on the shelf. Until such time as they are put on a statutory basis they will not have the intended effect. I am surprised the Minister is talking about waiting for the White Paper on mandatory reporting. The guidelines fall short of mandatory reporting. Why not put them on a statutory basis and give them the force of law? Mandatory reporting can be considered later. Why not take the first step? What is the timescale for completion of the White Paper?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my intention that the guidelines will be put on a statutory footing. What is more important, however, is the proper implementation of the guidelines. It is not true to say that the work done so far will be put on the shelf. There is a very active exercise in my Department and in health boards in regard to their implementation. The fact that we have provided an extra allocation of £3.25 million this year to implement them is evidence of the Government's commitment. That deals with training, empowering professionals and children and reporting child abuse. It is only right to publish the While Paper which will deal with mandatory reporting and discuss the issue in relation to that. I do not have a timescale for completion of the White Paper but I assure the Deputy that it is being worked on in my Department. Many submissions were made and there are many issues to be addressed. I am confident the White Paper will give a very good analysis of this issue. It will be published as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>How much of the £3.25 million is for staff costs? Does the Minister accept there is a crisis in social work services, particularly in the Eastern Health Board area where almost 600 children are awaiting referral on suspicion of sexual or physical abuse or neglect? Does the Minister accept there is a real difficulty in recruiting staff? At any one time up to 10 per cent of social worker posts are vacant. What steps is the Minister taking to ensure staff will be available? Has he been in contact with third level colleges in that regard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>As the money was allocated very recently, I do not have a breakdown of the £3.25 million but there will be some staff allocations in order to recruit people to train across the spectrum. I am satisfied that for the first time, particularly in the Eastern Health Board, we are get<Col N="1645" /> ting to grips with the problem of people waiting and so on. I wish to show my appreciation to the Minister for the allocation of £32 million this year in the Estimates compared to an allocation of £8 million two years ago and £5 million three years ago of additional money. It shows there is a commitment to deal with the crisis that existed in the past and I am satisfied it is being tackled. I agree there is a serious problem in recruiting staff. I have asked some of the health boards to look at the possibility of recruiting staff in the United States and Germany. We are getting quite a good response. We have almost run dry in terms of the United Kingdom. I have spoken to third level colleges, in particular UCHG, about having a new programme for training social workers and child care workers. We find it very difficult to recruit qualified people.</P>

      <Quest>the guidelines, if any, he will issue to health boards and to each hospital concerning patient admissions following general practitioner referrals as a consequence of the judgment delivered by the Supreme Court in a case (details supplied) on 12 November 1999.</Quest>
      <QRef>[26976/99]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>In the first instance the Supreme Court has returned the case in question back to the High Court for retrial. In this context, the Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to comment in any specific detail on matters relating to the case. I would, however, propose to review the issue raised by the Deputy on conclusion of that court case.</P>
      <P>On the general question of guidelines for patient admissions, the Deputy will be aware that a decision on whether to admit a patient is taken on the basis of the judgment of the assessing clinician. Admissions following general practitioner referral in the normal course will be prioritised by the relevant consultant, whereas a patient presenting as an emergency at a hospital accident and emergency Department will be assessed by the clinician or clinicians on duty who will take a decision on the appropriate form of treatment, including whether to admit the patient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1646" /> The general issue of the responsibility entrusted in junior hospital doctors for clinical decision making is necessarily tied in with the wider issue of medical staffing structures in acute hospitals. As the Deputy is aware, this is being considered through the ongoing work of the Medical Manpower Forum. The main purpose of the forum is to improve hospital services for patients, while also benefiting hospital doctors through changed work practices, greater career opportunities and improved teaching and training.</P>
    <P>The forum has not yet submitted a report but is preparing an interim one, which I understand is nearing completion. I will be awaiting the outcome of the forum's deliberations, which I hope will reflect a consensus among all the relevant stakeholders on the way forward, before taking any policy decisions in this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister acknowledge that the decision delivered in this case by the Supreme Court in November requires the State to radically change the approach to hospital admissions in circumstances where an experienced general practitioner refers a patient to hospital recommending that he or she be immediately admitted and that it is no longer possible for any junior doctor acting as a clinician to take a different view from that of the general practitioner and refuse admission in such circumstances? If such refusal takes place and there are detrimental health consequences, the hospital and health board concerned will be liable in damages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have said, the case has returned to the High Court for retrial and must be considered <i>sub judice</i>. Most of the judgment which I have read &ndash; Deputy Shatter kindly forwarded a copy of it &ndash; refers to the liability of the original general practitioner in regard to the non-referral at that stage. Without going into specifics, issues that arise similar to this case can and must be resolved in the wider context of medical manpower planning. As I said, it has been one of my priorities to get agreement from all the stakeholders on this issue on the basis that there must be a number of changes in work practices.</P>
      <P>Quite apart from any specific issue raised in this case, I wish to deal with the generality of the question. There is need to change work practices to improve patient care in order to ensure that a quality service is provided 24 hours a day, seven days a week. For me to say any more than that at this stage would not perhaps be fair in terms of the specific case involved. However, I have stated on many occasions that we need to change the way hospitals operate in terms of manpower planning and the availability of staff, particularly in respect of providing services 24 hours a day. That is an important aspect of the forum's deliberations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The forum is close to producing an interim <Col N="1647" /> report and this should be available next month. I hope we can reach a consensus on those issues. That is the first objective.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister stating that this important Supreme Court judgment of 12 November last had not been seen by him or officials of his Department until I made it available when tabling this question on Thursday or Friday of last week? Will he acknowledge that the issue determined by the Supreme Court is not one for review, in any shape or form, in the High Court and that it is now absolutely clear that a legal obligation has been imposed on health boards and hospitals where, if an experienced general practitioner refers a patient and recommends immediate admission to hospital, no doctor below the position of consultant can properly refuse to admit? Will he further acknowledge that it is in the interests of patients that the medical assessment of experienced general practitioners concerning patients who are well known to them is not second guessed and set aside by junior hospital doctors who have a good deal less experience and lack comprehensive knowledge of particular patients' medical history?</P>

      <P>As indicated in my reply, until such time as that specific issue is dealt with I will not deal with the matters to which it gives rise. The general question to which the Deputy refers is not new and I am probably the first Minister for Health and Children to address it with the people and the medical interests concerned in order to ensure that patients receive a better level of service, 24 hours a day. That requires obtaining agreement from people who are contracted to provided services for the State to make certain changes. I am adopting an inclusive approach in that regard in the hope that a consensus approach can be arrived at so that we can proceed.</P>
      <P>No work was previously done in respect of this issue, which is at the top of my list of priorities, but many rhetorical speeches were made in connection with it. I do not wish to pre-empt the forum's report, because the objective is to see if agreement can be reached, but I hope that the issues that are raised generally by the Deputy's question will be adequately dealt with in terms of future work arrangements. It is important and in everyone's interests that this happens. I do not want to comment further on the specific case to which the Deputy referred.</P>

      <P>The submission concerned has been comprehensively reviewed by the Irish Medicines Board. Following this review and because of the serious concerns about the safety of products containing <i>hypericum perforatum</i> or St. John's Wort, together with the promotion of the use of these products for depression, which is a most serious illness, I have been advised by the Irish Medicines Board, which is the competent expert authority in the matter, that its recommendation in regard to the prescription status of products containing St. John's Wort is unchanged. As Minister for Health and Children, I am obliged to have regard to the Irish Medicines <Col N="1650" /> Board's opinion in this area and I, therefore, must advise the Deputies that no case has been made which would enable me to alter the regulatory position regarding products containing St. John's Wort.</P>
      <P>In regard to these products and the EU internal market, I am not aware that any complaint has been lodged with the Commission nor am I aware that a ruling regarding this issue is pending.</P>
      <P>The Deputies will be aware that the overall situation regarding the control of herbal medicinal products is unsatisfactory in many EU countries and that currently many herbal medicinal products are being unlawfully placed on the market in this country. As these products are unlicensed, their safety, quality and efficacy cannot be satisfactorily assured. The market for these products is increasing and as Minister for Health and Children I have responsibilities in regard to public health concerns about the current situation. As a result of these concerns, and because it is not anticipated that the current discussions at EU level will provide a resolution to these difficulties in the near future, I have asked officials in my Department to investigate the possibility of an interim national system for the licensing of certain herbal or traditionally used medicinal products. This will not alter the prescription-only status of products containing St. John's Wort but it may allow the products concerned to be licensed. I anticipate that the working group which is currently being set up by the Irish Medicines Board to consider the question of regulatory control of herbal medicinal products will be of assistance in this respect and I look forward to receiving the board's recommendations when the group has completed its consideration. I also look forward to the co-operation of the organisations representing the various interested parties and I welcome recent statements which indicate a willingness to progress along these lines.</P>

      <P>I will call Deputy Shatter first, Deputy McManus, because one of the questions is submitted in his name. The precedent is that the Members in the House in whose name questions have been tabled are called first when a number of questions are taken together.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister made inquiries with the Irish Medicines Board regarding why it believes that St. John's Wort should become a prescription only medicine when prescriptions for it are not needed in most other European Union countries? Would he agree that it might be better that the issue of herbal remedies be dealt with globally and that two or three types of remedies, one of which is St. John's Wort, should not be dealt with separately? Would it not be more satisfactory if a uniform approach to herbal remedies be taken across the European Union? To make St. John's Wort a prescription only remedy may create difficulties for people who wish to gain <Col N="1651" /> access to it. However, a person living in Dundalk can simply drive across the Border and purchase it in Newry without the need for a prescription. Does the Minister agree that the board's approach is an illogical way to deal with this issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Irish Medicines Board is the relevant statutory authority in respect of this matter and I do not believe it is appropriate for the Minister for Health and Children to interfere with the board in the discharge of its remit in relation to medicinal products, howsoever these products may be described. It is important that the terminology employed is not interchangeable. If the board becomes aware in the course of its work that there are issues of concern in respect of public health which need to be addressed, it is the board's responsibility and duty to take whatever action is necessary to protect the health of our citizens. I do not believe that the position is negotiable.</P>
      <P>It is important to point out that the basis upon which this issue arose was that the Irish Medicines Board received a product authorisation application in respect of a medicinal product which contained the herbal ingredient <i>hypericum perforatum</i>, otherwise known as St. John's Wort. The medical evaluation of that application revealed major deficiencies in the submitted information and the concerns of the board were conveyed to the applicants in the usual manner. The applicants involved decided to withdraw the application rather than respond to those concerns in the normal way.</P>
      <P>As some of the board's concerns related to the active herbal ingredient generally, it took the view that products containing St. John's Wort should be recommended for prescription control in the interests of public health. That is the basis upon which it applied a prescription only status to it. What occurs in Germany and Northern Ireland on this issue does not come under the remit of the IMB. It is the statutory authority to deal with the issue, as established by the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>Every medicinal product must be authorised and it must meet the criteria of health, safety and efficacy. This product failed on the basis of public health. It is available on prescription as an over the counter product. I must take the board's advice seriously. An interim registration system has been established for other medicines which had traditional uses. It is more simplified in terms of meeting the criteria of health and safety because there is a difficulty in some instances where other products which do not relate to this issue are efficacious in that they do what they claim. There is an absence of clinical trials in regard to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These products are unlicensed. People in the industry want regulation and licensing. I am providing an interim licensing arrangement for all those products and a working group will work <Col N="1652" /> with the IMB and other interests, which are knowledgable in this area, to deal with that specific issue, which is historical. The board made a decision based on medical and scientific grounds and public health considerations given the interaction that takes place between St. John's Wort and other medicines. It is not appropriate for me to interfere with the independence of that authority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept there can also be a common sense approach to this issue and that the IMB has taken a sledgehammer to crack a nut? Does he feel he had responsibility to ensure the full range of research was assessed by the IMB before this decision was made? I am sure, like the rest of us, he has received a great deal of correspondence on this issue. Does he agree it is difficult to explain to the public that paracetamol, for example, is on sale over the counter and is more likely to have a serious medical impact if it is inappropriately used than products, such as St. John's Wort? Does he accept that generally there is evidence to prove this is a safe product and the IMB decision was based on flimsy evidence? Does he further accept that he has a responsibility to apply common sense? Does he agree the concept of general practitioners prescribing this product is not a good use of their time and that it would be more appropriate for him to establish a separate regulatory body, including representatives of the industry and consumers, to examine these products?</P>
      <P>Nobody is arguing against regulation, particularly those involved in the industry. They have asked the Department for this for many years. Does the Minister accept that would be a more appropriate response than the inappropriate over the top reaction by the IMB based on flimsy evidence? Will he ensure further evidence, arising from a full assessment which was carried out by the Health Products Alliance and made available to the Department, will be taken on board by the IMB?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>An assessment has been carried out. It does not behove any Member to undermine the authority of the IMB. It is the relevant statutory authority, which has been given powers by the Oireachtas to deal with these matters on an objective, scientific and medical basis, quite apart from any commercial or other considerations that exist. On the question of this being an over the top response, the board has recently provided the scientific basis for this decision in journals such as <i> Lancet</i>, and other evidence is emerging. Scientific interactions are involved, about which I do not claim to have full knowledge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take the advice of the board seriously and it does not behove any of us to trivialise, for example, the seriousness of depression as an illness. It requires treatment with medical supervision. The IMB is deciding this issue as it is not a political issue, on which I decide. The decision <Col N="1653" /> was taken on the basis of objective, scientific criteria and in the interests of public health, which is within the IMB's remit. I do not underestimate the importance of its responsibility.</P>
    <P>The board has made proposals concerning the need to introduce controls on the sale of paracetamol. They are with the Department and will come into force in the coming months. The controls will relate to package size and the number of packets an individual can purchase. Paracetamol is used to treat pain. It is claimed that St. John's Wort is effective in the treatment of depression.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Whether the Deputy agrees, all medicinal products according to our law require authorisation. There are many unlicensed products in the marketplace. When the specifics of this issue came before the IMB, it was concerned about the interaction of this herbal ingredient generally and it came to a decision not to make it available but it felt, particularly in regard to the treatment of depression, it should be available on prescription only. It should be recalled that product authorisation was withdrawn and it was open to the IMB to decide on over the counter, prescription or prescription only status with repeatable authorisation. The IMB, not us, decides on this.</P>
      <P>With regard to the wider policy issue which this matter raises &ndash; it does not change the status of St. John's Wort, as designated by the IMB, having examined all the evidence &ndash; an interim licensing arrangement will be established to deal with health and safety aspects on the basis that efficacy is difficult to provide for such products. We need to be careful and recognise that these are not interchangeable terms. These are medicinal products which require authorisation.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy intends to pursue an argument on the basis that expert advice is not available to the Irish Medicines Board, he is on a weak wicket. The board is charged with dealing with the authorisation of every medicinal product in the State. It is incorrect to suggest that it is not expert in this area. As the Deputy is aware, the directive does not distinguish between pharmaceutical and any other type of product. Before the directive, Ireland did not have a licensing system for traditional use medicines unlike other countries. The idea that there is harmonisation around the corner at EU level is not a fair assessment of the situation. However, in acknowledging the unlicensed position which has developed and the need to put some interim regulations in place, I am providing a policy initiative to deal with the issue generally.</P>
      <P>The issue regarding St. John's Wort arose as a result of a product authorisation application. The IMB decided that it had concerns about its herbal ingredients generally and how it interacts. There is medical evidence in that regard. The board will make the decision, not me as the Minister for Health and Children, based on objective and scientific advice. That is the basis on which such decisions are taken. The board is acting on the basis of its concern for public health. Some emerging issues are of concern to other member states also but I deal with the IMB in relation to this jurisdiction.</P>

Will he explain why Ireland is the only EU country which is proposing to add St. John's Wort to the list of prescription only medicines? The Minister made great play of it being a health issue. Why do issues of public health not arise in other EU countries? Do other EU member states have corresponding bodies to the Irish Medicines Board? Why is Ireland unique in this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>There are different national authorisation measures for the control of medicinal products on a traditional use basis. Some countries had a licensing system prior to the issuing of the EU directive but others, including Ireland, did not have such a system. There is not necessarily uniformity of treatment in this matter. For example, in Germany certain medicinal products containing St. John's Wort require a prescription. However, no country, with the exception of Ireland, has yet placed those products on prescription. In some countries, including Belgium, France, Greece, Italy, Luxembourg, Portugal and Spain, medicinal products, including herbal medicinal products, may only be sold in pharmacies. Different approaches are applied in different countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the IMB deliberates on this issue, which arose following the submission of a product authorisation application, it will make a scientific assessment on the basis of public health concerns.

      <P>If we accept the Minister's point that the IMB will make this decision on public health grounds, does he agree that the evidence the IMB used was flimsy and inconsequential? Is he not surprised that the IMB indicated when it made this decision that it did not refer to practice in the EU? It did not check what other countries were doing. The Minister must have an interest in terms of EU harmonisation and ensure that the IMB at least considers the position in other countries which have proper research and back up facilities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I attended the European Council in Helsinki, on 10 and 11 December together with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy David Andrews, and the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy. This was the second time EU leaders had met during the Finnish Presidency. We had previously met during October for the Special European Council in Tampere on justice and home affairs. The very significant work conducted across a range of issues during the Finnish Presidency allowed for a very successful European Council meeting in Helsinki &ndash; that allowed leaders to focus, in the main, on matters of future concern to the Union in the new millennium.</P>
      <P>I begin by outlining the format of the Council. It began on 10 December, with a meeting with the President of the European Parliament, Mme Nicole Fontaine, with whom there was a useful exchange of views on the Intergovernmental Conference, Enlargement and Employment. The Millennium Declaration adopted by the Council was discussed as the first item of the morning working session which followed. A detailed discussion of enlargement formed the bulk of that session. European security and defence was the topic for discussion at the working lunch and issues such as the Intergovernmental Conference, the effective functioning of the Council and economic and employment matters were examined on Friday afternoon. A variety of external relations matters, most notably Chechnya were discussed over dinner. On Saturday morning, as is usual, leaders focused on the draft Council Conclusions. In addition, we were joined for lunch on Saturday by the leaders and Foreign Ministers of the applicant countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first item discussed was the Millennium Declaration. This is essentially a &ldquo;<i>mission statement</i>&rdquo; for the Union as it enters the next millennium. The declaration captures in a succinct fashion, the reasons for the Union's existence, the achievements to date, the challenges that lie ahead and the values that underpin our response to these challenges. It confirms that the role of the Union should be to ensure its inhabitants' <Col N="1660" /> security and welfare, as well as contributing to building a more stable, just and peaceful world.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that this European Council took a significant further step towards the enlargement of the Union. It was crucial to reinforce the momentum towards enlargement. In recent months I have had the opportunity to visit some of the accession countries and I met a number of their leaders at the OSCE Summit in Istanbul. They were looking forward to the Helsinki European Council as heralding a new stage in their accession to the Union. It did this not only by conveying a clear and positive message to these countries as to the steps necessary for accession but by agreeing on the format of the Intergovernmental Conference that will address the institutional changes necessary for enlargement to take place. I will return to the Intergovernmental Conference later. The Council decided that the accession negotiation process should now include all 12 accession countries on an equal footing and that each should be judged on its own merits. Importantly, the Council also confirmed that the Union should be in a position to welcome new member states from the end of 2002.</P>
    <P>Our discussion on enlargement recognised that the question of inclusion of Turkey as a candidate country was one of the more complex political issues on the agenda at this Council. I have long called for Turkey to be included as a candidate while recognising the necessity for all candidates to comply with the Copenhagen criteria before entering into negotiations. It was also important to reflect the concerns of Greece and Cyprus in the outcome. I am pleased to say we successfully found a formula to include Turkey as a candidate country reflecting the above considerations which were acceptable to everybody. It was a mark of the Council's determination to grant candidate status to Turkey that saw Secretary General-High Representative Solana, Enlargement Commissioner Verheugen and a Presidency representative flying last Friday to Ankara to explain the Union's position. It was particularly pleasing that we were joined on the following day by Turkish Prime Minister Ecevit. Turkey will now benefit from a pre-accession strategy to stimulate and support its reforms. Significantly, this will entail a political dialogue with a particular emphasis on human rights.</P>
    <P>It was also important that the European Council gave its support for the UN sponsored talks in New York aimed at a political settlement of the Cyprus problem. It was appropriate that Cyprus be encouraged in its accession efforts and that a signal be given that while a political settlement to the island's division would aid accession such a settlement was not a precondition. The Finnish Presidency is to be congratulated for its work on the enlargement portfolio and I look forward to the European Conference planned for the latter part of next year, during the French Presidency; and to the consideration of the next regular progress reports on all candidates at the EU Council in December 2000.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1661" /> It had been agreed at Cologne that an Intergovernmental Conference would be convened early in 2000 to resolve the institutional issues left over from the Amsterdam Treaty that needed to be settled before enlargement began. The Finnish Presidency has been invited to submit a report on the Intergovernmental Conference, on its own responsibility, to the Helsinki Summit. The approach in the Presidency's report coincided largely with our own position. It suggested a limited agenda for the conference focusing on the Amsterdam leftovers and a small number of other institutional questions.</P>
    <P>At Helsinki, EU leaders agreed that the Intergovernmental Conference should be convened in early February and conclude by December 2000. The conference will examine the three Amsterdam issues &ndash; size and composition of the Commission; the weighting of votes in the Council; and the possible extension of quality majority voting &ndash; as well as a small number of related institutional changes. In addition, the Portuguese Presidency will report to the European Council on progress by the conference and may propose additional items that could be considered for the agenda. Arrangements were agreed for the close association and involvement of the European Parliament in the work of the conference. The candidate countries will also be regularly informed of progress and have the opportunity to put their points of view. The scope of the Intergovernmental Conference agenda, which we decided, provides a realistic basis for the conference and should enable it to complete its work by the end of next year.</P>
    <P>During the process itself, in common with many other member states, we will continue to insist on the continued right of all member states to nominate a full and equal member of the Commission. Any new weighting of votes in the Council must be accompanied by the larger member states giving up their second Commissioner. Ireland will also be seeking assurance that the equality within the Commission thus achieved would be maintained in the future. The special summit in Lisbon in March will provide Heads of State or Government with a first opportunity to review the process.</P>
    <P>In addition to the Treaty changes to be considered by the Intergovernmental Conference to prepare for enlargement, changes in the working methods of Council are also necessary. As a result, the General Affairs Council submitted to Helsinki specific proposals for improving the operation of Council with a view to enlargement. These proposals, which were adopted, generally reflect a realistic assessment of where improvements in the working methods of the Council are possible. It was also agreed to reduce the number of Council formations to a maximum of 15 through discontinuing or merging certain formations &ndash; at present there are 22. All of these efficiency related changes can be made within the existing Treaty provisions.</P>
    <P>Following from the Cologne European Coun<Col N="1662" /> cil, an issue of key interest to Ireland at the summit was the Common European Policy on Security and Defence. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, will return to this issue in more detail in his concluding statement. This is an issue on which we have continued to remain vigilant so as to ensure that any progress continues to be acceptable to Ireland and to our fellow neutral partners. That the final outcome on this issue at the summit was acceptable to us is due in no small part to the Minister, Deputy Andrews, and his very active involvement in this issue at the General Affairs Council.</P>
    <P>The discussion on this matter at Helsinki acknowledged the good work that has been done on non-military aspects of crisis management in tandem with work on the military aspects. In addition, the report by the Presidency on this issue rightly made clear that the EU's engagement relates to the Petersberg Tasks and not to the so-called Article 5 issues of mutual defence. It was important for us that the EU at the highest level be seen to support the UN, and recognise the primary role of the UN Security Council for the maintenance of international peace and security. I am pleased to say that at my request the Conclusions reflect that fundamental point.</P>
    <P>Two main areas were addressed, from Ireland's point of view &ndash; capabilities and decision making structures. As to capabilities, it was agreed that member states would be able by 2003 to deploy a force of 50,000 &ndash; 60,000 capable of the full range of Petersberg Tasks. Participation by any member state will be on an entirely case by case basis as individual missions arise. I also emphasise that what is involved is not a standing European Army and the Conclusions from the Council explicitly recognise this fact at Ireland's request.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach yield? I want to ask him a question.

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There are three separate committee groups. There is the political group, which would normally consist of the Foreign Affairs Ministers but which will be joined by the Defence Ministers also. There have already been some of those committees so Ireland will be participating in those. There will be the military committee, which will probably involve the Minister for Finance and the Chief of Staff.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">

      <P>Sorry, the Minister for Defence and the Chief of Staff, and we would be involved in those. It has not yet been decided how the technical working groups will work.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer is &ldquo;yes&rdquo; except in some mission in which Ireland would not be involved.</P>
      <P>The Portuguese Presidency will take forward work on the question of improved decision-making structures for Petersberg Tasks, in the light of the conclusions reached at Helsinki.</P>
      <P>In an EMU context, in a Single Market and in an increasingly globalised economy, effective economic policy co-ordination must be a key priority for all of us. In this context, I was pleased to give my support for the emphasis which the Presidency and the Commission have been placing on streamlining procedures and avoiding duplication which thus allows more time for all of us to concentrate on the really important and difficult economic policy issues. I welcome the support which the European Council has given to the further development of the synergy between the broad economic policy guidelines, the employment guidelines and the monitoring of structural reform.</P>
      <P>The conclusions also recognise the need to manage the economic impact of the Union's ageing population. Given the demographic profile of certain member states, there are potentially serious budgetary implications. In the case of Ireland, I am pleased to recall that the Government recently began the process of making financial provision so that the whole cost of future pension payments would not fall on the next generation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Looking ahead to the Lisbon special European Council in March, the opportunity was taken to emphasise the need for Europe to adapt to the information society to support competitiveness, employment and social cohesion. Ireland obviously welcomes the holding of a special European Council on this theme. Encouragingly, the Finnish and the incoming Portuguese Presidencies have made an early focused start to the preparatory process. I welcome the intention to build on the various programmes already under way and to identify specific areas requiring atten<Col N="1664" /> tion such as the growing demands placed on labour markets by the information society.</P>
    <P>I have suggested that the March summit give priority to considering how in the area of new technologies and e-commerce the Union's competitiveness in the global market might be improved in the interest of enterprise and consumers. I also took the opportunity recently of writing to Prime Minister Guterres to highlight the employment potential of e-commerce and Ireland's success in using specialised training as a means to integrate into the labour force those who have been long-term unemployed. In this context also, I welcome the recent e-Europe initiative from President Prodi as important to this debate. I look forward to a progress report from the Commission on the e-Europe action plan at the Lisbon summit and its presentation to the Council next June.</P>
    <P>The summit also considered a package on which, as was widely reported in advance, it proved difficult to reach a conclusion. Unlike many of our partners, we were prepared to consider seeking agreement on the individual items in the package, namely, the code of conduct group the draft directive on the taxation of income from savings and the draft directive on the abolition of withholding taxes on interest and royalties. However, most partners pressed for the package to be agreed in its totality or not at all. In the end, Britain continued to have reservations on the draft directive on the taxation of income from savings. These concerns stem from a view that the directive could directly impact on the eurobond market in London.</P>
    <P>As a result, the European Council has established a high level working group to consider how best citizens resident in a member state of the Union should pay the tax due on all their savings income. The group will report to ECOFIN with possible solutions on the tax on savings and on the other items in the tax package and ECOFIN will report to the European Council in June at the latest. Ireland will continue to play its full part in seeking a successful outcome in this area.</P>
    <P>I was pleased that the European Council also took the opportunity to review the Union's policies aimed at the integration of environmental considerations into wider programmes and activities of the Union. Strategies in the agriculture, transport and energy sectors have already been agreed. In this context, the European Council examined a number of reports submitted by the Commission. We agreed that the ongoing involvement of the European Council was essential for solid progress to be made in advancing the integration of environmental considerations into other EU activities and asked that this work be finalised and brought to the European Council in June 2001 under the Swedish Presidency of the Union.</P>
    <P>Before turning to a number of foreign policy items, I want to highlight the forthcoming Commission White Paper on Food Safety and the Portuguese Presidency report on its implementation <Col N="1665" /> which will be considered by EU leaders in June next.</P>
    <P>The current situation in Chechnya, which the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, will address, was a major issue at Helsinki. The Council adopted a declaration on Chechnya against the background of the serious concern of leaders at the deterioration of the situation in Chechnya and the shocking ultimatum issued by Russia to the remaining civilians in Grozny to leave the city by 11 December or be considered to be terrorists and killed. The declaration makes clear to Russia that its actions in Chechnya are totally unacceptable and requests immediate positive action. In support of its request, the European Council decided on a number of measures, which the Minister, Deputy Andrews, will outline. He will also address the issue of the common strategy for Ukraine.</P>
    <P>Leaders also discussed progress in relation to the Western Balkans Stability Pact. Discussion focused on how the stability pact can be given additional impetus at a time when increasing doubts are being expressed by the countries of the region that the high expectations which they had when the pact was launched last July are not being met. I know from my recent visit to the south-eastern European region that disillusionment and impatience is growing rapidly and the people there are waiting for concrete signs of real commitment by the international community. In the event, it was agreed that under the aegis of the pact, the Union would seek to take a leading role in promoting stability, security and economic development in south-eastern Europe.</P>
    <P>The European Union continues to be a strong supporter of the Middle East Peace Process. On this occasion, the Council welcomed the resumption of negotiations on the Syrian track between President Assad and Prime Minister Barak. It also called for steady implementation by all parties of the obligations under the Sharm El-Sheikh Understanding.</P>
    <P>As has become traditional, I met Prime Minister Blair immediately prior to the start of the summit on the evening of Thursday, 9 December, in Helsinki. We discussed a range of issues relating to Northern Ireland, including security issues and decommissioning. We also took the opportunity to discuss arrangements for the inaugural meetings of the institutions under the Good Friday Agreement. In addition to matters related to Northern Ireland, we discussed the key issues on the agenda for the Council.</P>
    <P>I was gratified that the European Council took the opportunity to recognise the significant recent developments in Northern Ireland. In particular, the European Council congratulated the political parties in the North, the British and Irish Governments and Senator Mitchell on the progress. Once again the Council affirmed its continuing political and practical support for Northern Ireland and for co-operation between North and South.</P>
    <P>I again commend President Ahtisaari and <Col N="1666" /> Prime Minister Lipponen and all involved in the Finnish Presidency for hosting a successful summit and, more generally, on the success of their first Presidency. Finland has proved, once again, that it is possible for a smaller member state to successfully hold the Presidency of the Union and to make progress on the key portfolios. The Union faces into the new millennium more certain of its roles, both within the Union and globally, and more capable of exercising these roles for the benefit of its citizens.</P>

      <P>This was a very successful summit. A huge number of decisions were taken, as is evident from the Taoiseach's speech. However, I am unhappy that the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who will be replying to points made by Deputy Quinn and me, will clearly come in here with a prepared speech, which will ignore virtually everything we say. If he is to deal in his speech with all the matters with which the Taoiseach said he will deal, he will not have time to reply to anything we say. In a sense it does not enhance one's feeling of worth in this House for having put effort into preparing a speech, as I have done for this occasion. That is the only sour note I want to strike because this was a successful summit. I hope the next time we debate a summit there will be a slightly better format with a little more interchange and a greater sense that the concerns being stressed here are getting a hearing.</P>
      <P>It is said that the two attributes of sovereignty in a state are the issuing of its own money and the managing of its own defence. It could be said that the Maastricht Treaty gave the European Union the right to issue its own money and that the Helsinki summit gave it the means to manage its own defence. At Helsinki, the EU also agreed to double its geographic area and to improve its internal decision-making. The power to issue money and to demand the sacrifices necessary for defence requires political legitimacy. In modern terms, political legitimacy requires electoral support. The electorate must feel part of the European Union if the project is not to fail the first time the electorate is asked to make any sacrifice for it, whether it be an economic sacrifice to support the common currency or a military sacrifice to support the common defence policy that was agreed in Helsinki.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the House will know from speeches I have made here, I am a committed European federalist. I believe a federal Europe of multiple allegiances, national, local and continental, is a formula for peace in Europe, but I am worried about the fact that the electorate in Europe is so little involved in what is being done in its name. No great European issue is decided by the electorate at the polls in a European election which is just a personality contest or a domestic political issue. In the European elections, no European political party offers one vision of Europe as an alternative to that offered by another. Little or nothing changes as a result of European elections, <Col N="1667" /> other than a few faces in the European Parliament.</P>
    <P>National elections, except perhaps in Britain, are not fought on European issues. If referenda take place, as in Ireland, the people can only say yes or no to a<i> fait accompli</i>. Outside the elite there is no ongoing consultation and little possibility of influencing what happens in the European Union. Therefore, the Government was wrong in Helsinki to press successfully for a limited intergovernmental conference. That conference should have been extended at least to include how a greater degree of ongoing democratic legitimacy could be given to the European project. The intergovernmental conference should have been extended to strengthening the European Commission's role in regard to international trade in services.</P>
    <P>In 1962, Seán Lemass said: &ldquo;We are prepared to go into this integrated Europe without any reservations as to how far it will take us in the field of foreign policy and defence&rdquo;. The present leadership of Fianna Fáil does not speak as openly or frankly about European defence as Seán Lemass did. Our Constitution states that: &ldquo;War shall not be declared and the State shall not participate in any war save with the assent of Dáil Éireann&rdquo;. That provision should not and need not change, but it does not prevent us from giving political commitments to defend the values we share alongside our European neighbours, subject to the ultimate sanction of the Dáil.</P>
    <P>Among the proposals agreed by the Government at the Helsinki summit was the setting up for the first time of permanent military bodies within the European Union structure. There is now to be a military committee of the European Union composed of chiefs of staff of the armed forces of the member states, including Ireland. There will also be military staff, including Irish military staff, within the civil service of the EU Council of Ministers. This is a huge step that has been taken, fulfilling something that Seán Lemass spoke of almost 40 years ago.</P>
    <P>The purpose of these new arrangements at this juncture in European history is to help the EU to perform its role in conflict prevention and crisis management by using force if necessary. The EU will use military means &ndash; force &ndash; in accordance with the principles of the UN charter, as the Taoiseach has said. There is absolutely no requirement, however, in the Helsinki communiqué for prior UN approval. All that is required is that it should be in accordance with the principles of the UN charter. These arrangements will not place an obligation on EU members to participate in any peacekeeping or peacemaking operations agreed at EU level. In that sense, Irish neutrality is preserved. On the other hand, Ireland, as an EU member, will be part of the decision-making structure and will have political co-responsibility for the consequences of any EU military decision in which it takes part. Even if it does not take part in the military operation but takes part in the <Col N="1668" /> decision, it will have political co-responsibility. Following Helsinki we will share policy responsibility for the mistakes as well as for the successes in EU defence policy. In that sense, we will cease to be, and are ceasing to be, neutral. If we are part of the decision-making structure which decides to launch a military operation then we are hardly neutral in regard to that military operation.</P>
    <P>There is a tendency in debates in the House to play down how much Ireland has already committed itself to European defence. On 14 October, the Taoiseach told the Dáil, &ldquo;A mutual defence pact is not even on the agenda of this European Union's common foreign and security policy&rdquo;. True, but the Taoiseach also made the following statements along with other EU heads of Government: &ldquo;We the members of the European Council intend to give the European Union the necessary means and capabilities to assume its responsibilities regarding a common European policy on security and defence. We are determined to foster the restructuring of the European defence industries among the states involved&rdquo;. That statement was made by the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach also approved a report issued at the Cologne summit which said: &ldquo;The focus of our efforts, therefore, would be to ensure that the European Union has at its disposal the necessary capabilities, including military capabilities and appropriate structures for effective decision-making in crisis management within the scope of the Petersberg Tasks&rdquo;. The Petersberg Tasks are defined in that report as including &ldquo;tasks of combat forces in crisis management including peacemaking&rdquo;. I stress that peacemaking, as well as peacekeeping, is included in the Petersberg Tasks. Peacemaking means imposing by force peaceful conditions under terms laid down by the peacemaker. I would ask Members of the House to distinguish peacemaking by force from war-making. The only distinction is that of the subjective motivation of the person undertaking the operation, which is highly elastic. The Petersberg Tasks are not just about military policemen manning checkpoints or setting up field hospitals for refugees; they can also involve imposing order by force. The Government should tell people that because it is the truth.</P>
    <P>In telling them that, it is important to explain why the European Union is now getting into military matters at all. It is doing so because members of the European Union want to be able to look after their own business, including defence. They are not happy to depend so completely on the United States as they have done up to now. Ireland has gone along with this approach of the European Union and I commend the Taoiseach for that. The present defence situation of the European Union, which is unsatisfactory, was described as follows by Jimmy Carter's former national security adviser, Zbigniew Brezinski: &ldquo;The actual fact is that western Europe is now an American protectorate with its allied states reminiscent of ancient vassals and tributaries&rdquo;. In <Col N="1669" /> other words, the current arrangement for European defence is that the US keeps the peace in Europe and it does so on American terms. The NATO war against Yugoslavia which got United Nations approval only after it was all over, was run by the Americans. They selected the targets, including the Chinese embassy in Belgrade. It was deliberately selected and was not an accident.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>And the central heating system of the city. The Europeans had no say in the selection of targets undertaken by the Americans in the name of Europeans. They did not know about the targets until after the event.</P>
      <P>Up to now, Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina, a charming man whom I had the pleasure of meeting, has had more influence on the practicalities of European defence than the head of Government of a medium sized EU state, including EU members of NATO. This is not a satisfactory situation from the European or democratic point of view because Senator Jesse Helms, Al Gore and George W. Bush do not have to seek votes in Europe.</P>
      <P>Ireland is in Europe and should have a say in how the peace of Europe is preserved, including its preservation, if necessary, by military means. That is the significance of the commitment given by the Taoiseach in Helsinki. It means Ireland will now have a say in the way Europe is to be defended. That is a huge change for Ireland and any Irish Government. I do not know if the House realises the importance and significance of this change in policy in Helsinki, on which I commend the Taoiseach and which I support.</P>
      <P>The EU is now taking back control of the defence of its continent. We cannot take for granted a permanent US commitment to European defence. After 100 years of isolationism, the United States was actively involved in regulating the peace of Europe for just two years, between 1917 and 1919. When the United States Congress rejected the Treaty of Versailles, the US relapsed into isolationism until it was attacked at Pearl Harbor by Japan in 1942. It was during that period of US isolationism between 1919 and 1942 that the Nazis took over most of continental Europe, including many neutral countries, without any military response from the United States.</P>
      <P>There is no reason to be certain that the indifference the United States showed to developments in Europe until it was attacked itself will not recur during the next century. Furthermore, as US economic interests move towards the Pacific basin, it is increasingly likely that the United States will concentrate its strategic interests there. The growth of armaments in east Asia is a matter of grave worry to the United States. We should remember that the United States was attacked from across the Pacific, and not the Atlantic, in 1942.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is for these geostrategic reasons that Europe must equip itself to defend itself in the 21st cen<Col N="1670" /> tury and to maintain security in and around its borders. That is why what was decided at Helsinki was necessary and prudent, from both an Irish and European point of view. The development of EU defence policy is sensible contingency planning. The issue for Ireland is a simple one &ndash; do we want to have a voice in it? This brings up arguments about Ireland's military neutrality, what it means, where it leads us and its costs and benefits.</P>
    <P>Ireland's neutrality has been up to now, in essence, a modestly armed one. Unlike other neutrals, such as Sweden and Switzerland, which guaranteed their neutrality by developing large armies and armaments industries, Ireland has chosen to have a small, and soon to be even smaller, Army. We did not have a navy or merchant fleet large enough to guarantee our own supplies at the outbreak of war in 1939, and we do not have such a fleet in 1999 either.</P>
    <P>Éamon de Valera was always realistic about the limitations of neutrality, especially if one is relying on belligerent nations for supplies, as we would inevitably be. Nowadays, we are one of the most open economies in the world. We depend on other countries for supplies and other countries depend on us. Some Deputies speak in this House about neutrality as if we were completely isolated from events on the mainland of Europe and the neighbouring island. They have romanticised de Valera's achievement in maintaining neutrality between 1939 and 1945, in a way that de Valera himself never did.</P>
    <P>Five factors preserved Ireland's neutrality between 1939 and 1945 &ndash; the fact that in 1939 we were more economically self-sufficient than we had ever been, then or now; the good fortune of our island status; the fortuitous defeat of the Luftwaffe over Britain in 1940, because if they had won the Battle of Britain they would not have stopped at Newry; the timely diversion of Germany's energies towards Russia in 1931; and the American entry to the war in 1942, without which Britain would probably have been eventually overrun. If these five factors had been absent, and if Ireland had been attacked at any stage between 1939 and 1945, we would not have been neutral.</P>
    <P>The Government was right to give its commitment, in principle, in Helsinki to European defence. However, I would like to express three concerns. First, is the European Union defence policy overextended? Second, what are the principles for its operation and are they clear? Third, how and by whom will European defence be paid for?</P>
    <P>In regard to the first point, I see a tension between the very significant EU military arrangements that were put in place in Helsinki and the simultaneous decision to have a huge enlargement of the scope and size of the EU to the east. If we give EU membership to east European countries, including Turkey, where there are unresolved boundary or minority problems, European defence could become chronically <Col N="1671" /> over-stretched and drawn into situations where the overwhelming majority of member states have no vital interest.</P>
    <P>In regard to the second point, there is a difficulty in creating a military mechanism at EU level without being more precise about the purposes for which it is to be used. The Petersberg Tasks are just a set of tasks. They are not a set of principles or rules to govern or limit military commitment. These principles and rules should be set out if the EU is not to be led into military entanglements without first taking any proper strategic view of the essential interests and principles it is trying to defend. That sense of principles to underlie European Union defence policy is absent from the Helsinki summit conclusions.</P>
    <P>In regard to the third point, the Helsinki communiqué gives little or no information on the financial aspects of common defence. Will Ireland be paying towards the new EU arrangements for defence? How much will we pay? Can we expect a say in decisions if we do not contribute, financially or otherwise?</P>
    <P>In terms of political union, I have concerns about the political cohesiveness of the proposed European Union, whose borders are to extend from Syria to Norway and from Belarus to the Azores. As I said at the beginning, a political union can only function effectively if the people within it think similarly and are brought along with what it is doing. Within broad limits, Irish people and Spaniards think alike, as do Germans and British people. However, will the political reflexes of the electorate of the newly enlarged Europe be sufficiently similar to enable the European Union's political leadership to work to a common agenda that has real political legitimacy? Is there a sufficient amount in common between the inhabitants of Anatolia in eastern Turkey, northern Finland, the west of Ireland and northern Spain for there to be a genuine sense of political identity, for which people will be willing to make sacrifices?</P>
    <P>Ultimately, EU membership is not just about benefits but must also be, from time to time, about sacrifices. Sacrifices can only be demanded in a modern democracy of an electorate that has had a say. I do not believe the Irish, Swedish, French, German or British electorates feel at the moment they have an adequate say in the decisions being made in Europe. I do not think, successful as the Helsinki summit was and as effective as the Taoiseach may have been in his interventions there, some of which I might not agree with, that the Irish people feel they really had a say in what happened. I certainly do not feel that when they voted in the European elections last June they had any sense they were giving a mandate for anything in particular. They were making a choice between Alan Gillis or Avril Doyle if voting for Fine Gael, or between Labour, Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael and they were making a judgment about domestic politics. They were not making <Col N="1672" /> an important choice about the shape of Europe. Neither were they consulted in the recent European elections about whether we wanted Turkey as part of the EU or about the commitments on European defence in the sense that they are coming forward. The people do not feel a part of this process and we have to be mindful of the fact that the majorities in EU referenda have been decreasing, not because people do not necessarily agree, but because they feel they are being taken for granted.</P>
    <P>The EU has a real problem in that it is an elite project. It could be argued that it would never have been set up if it was not for elitism, and Jean Monet was, perhaps, the greatest elitist of all time. He believed that one changed things by talking to very important people whom one got to know and the electorate was informed later. That is fine in the formative stage of setting up an economic unit &ndash; a coal and steel community and a common market. It may even be fine in the setting up of a single currency. However, when one is dealing with issues such as defence, where people may have to give their lives, or emotive political issues like food safety, people must feel they have been part of the decision-making structure. This is why it is essential the European Commission is elected by the European Parliament and not selected by the Governments. This would mean European elections would be about a choice between a socialist Commission, a Christian democrat Commission, a coalition of both, a Commission comprising nationalists or whatever other groups may contest the election. Such a system would ensure that when people vote every five years in European elections they feel that they are giving, or denying, a mandate for this development.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach may have better ideas about such a system, though I did not see any circulating when I was in Government, perhaps they have evolved since. There will be a crisis in the EU unless some means is devised to associate the people with the project. As someone who believes deeply in this project, I am concerned. The Helsinki summit was one of the most successful summits for many years in terms of all the issues brought together and dealt with in two days. However, the people do not feel a part of the process. In his contribution today, the Taoiseach seemed to glide over some of the issues concerning European defence where it would have been better had he been more explicit. People are waiting for a lead on this issue and they are willing to follow that lead. Politicians must give that lead but this is not happening in Europe.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not often a summit of European leaders can be described as being genuinely historic but the summit in Helsinki was such an occasion. The acceptance of Turkey as a candidate for membership dramatically broadens the boundaries of the Union and, more importantly, its potential for making an impact on the world <Col N="1673" /> stage. This development must also hasten the improvement of human rights in Turkey, particularly the treatment of minority communities such as the Kurds. If it does not achieve this, Turkey's accession should be firmly resisted.</P>
      <P>There should be no doubt that the invitation to join the European Union extended to 12 accession states, including Turkey, will radically transform the European Union. It will make the Union truly European as opposed to its current western European bias, ending the historic divisions caused by the Second World War and the subsequent Cold War. That fact alone will impose new obligations on the Union to act in its own name and to become the Continent's guarantor. Certain moves were made at the summit in this regard to which I will return.</P>
      <P>This move will have profound implications for Ireland to which, sadly, the Taoiseach did not refer. Since the conclusion of the negotiations on the current round of Structural and Cohesion Funds, for which I gave the Government credit, I have argued that we had come to the end of an era in terms of our membership of the European Union, and that we should begin planning for a new era. In that respect I concur with some of Deputy Bruton's sentiments but not necessarily his views. If my remarks were pertinent at the time, then the decision on enlargement taken at the weekend makes them all the more so today. I specifically referred to the good job done by the Government on the issue of Structural Funds because its performance since then has been very poor.</P>
      <P>I am not alone in identifying the nature of Ireland's new realities in Europe. Writing in <i>The Irish Times</i> last Saturday, Paul Gillespie, stated:</P>
      <P>As a result of these changes, Ireland's position and interests will alter significantly, requiring real political leadership to carry public feeling along. The existing Irish style has been well defined as informal efficiency. It has been based on an enviable capacity to survive by the seat of the pants, skilled general diplomacy and limited bureaucratic resources.</P>
      <P>In a larger and more diverse EU there will be a need for a more strategic and analytical approach, based on more formal interdepartmental co-ordination within Government and a more careful ranking of priorities across issues. This would bring Ireland into line with other smaller EU member states. Paul Gillespie also pointed out that, at present, Ireland is by far the most under-represented State diplomatically.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could not put the challenge facing us any better. Whether we rise to it or not depends on our ambition but, sadly, I do not hear any ambition coming from the Government. Are we merely going along for the ride or do we really want to influence Europe's direction? We can choose to amble along, accepting the general direction in which Europe is being driven by others. Alternatively, we can choose to mobilise all our energies to exercise our influence and values in Europe <Col N="1674" /> and in so doing punch a political weight beyond our size. The Labour Party believes we have transferred so much sovereignty to Europe that it is incumbent on us to do our utmost to influence the direction of the European Union, not just in our short-term national interest but in the broader interest of Europe, its citizens and humanity in general.</P>
    <P>We should make no mistake that to do so will require a fundamental change in our attitude. Our financial dependence on Europe may be coming to an end but the Irish attitude to Europe, which I have labelled the &ldquo;béal bocht&rdquo; mentality, shows signs of lasting well beyond its sell by date. Over a year ago I put the case that it was imperative that we expand our diplomatic representation in the states seeking to join the Union. If we are to be influential within the Union, developing strong diplomatic ties with the aspiring members is an imperative, regardless of cost. Without blowing our own trumpet, we have an expertise, acquired over 26 years, in working the institutions of the Union that is of interest to the accession states. As a smaller state, we will share an interest with them in ensuring a fair balance within the Union between the smaller and larger member states as the Union's constitution evolves.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that we have failed to do so. This failure is symptomatic of a more general malaise that now exists at the heart of the Government's policy towards Europe which began with its failure to appoint a Minister with specific responsibility for European affairs. I have raised this issue on more than one occasion with the Taoiseach on Question Time but to little avail. Most recently I raised the question of Slovenia, given the Taoiseach's recent visit to that country, but my question hardly elicited a response, other than the Taoiseach's comment that Slovenia was probably top of the league in terms of qualifying to join the Union. The Union will have up to 30 members when it has finally reached its natural boundaries, and 27 on the basis of the current proposals. The importance of securing representation and building relationships for the future has yet to dawn on this Government.</P>
    <P>We have resident embassies in four of the 12 states invited to join the European Union &ndash; Turkey, where an embassy was established in the last six months, Poland which was our first embassy behind the former Iron Curtain and Hungary and the Czech Republic where ABT and the Department of Foreign Affairs established an embassy in both capitals. However, we have no resident representation in the remaining eight countries, including Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia and Slovenia. This does not take into account Norway or other countries. Based on my calculations and recent analyses, the cost of establishing an embassy on the scale of that in the Czech Republic or Hungary would be about £400,000. The annual operational cost is, coincidentally, £400,000. This would provide for two <Col N="1675" /> and a half Irish diplomatic posts and back-up support &ndash; very modest resources for people who work remarkably hard. The total cost, that is the capital start-up and operating cost, of establishing resident embassies in the eight states to which I referred, over a three year period, is £6.4 million. Twelve embassies would operate at a cost of £5 million or £6 million per year.</P>
    <P>This is against a background of a current budget surplus for 2000 of £4,850 million while the net surplus at the end of this financial year will be £16,000 million. While in the past financial resources were a serious impediment, no one could argue they are now. That is not to say the Department of Finance will not see it in those terms. However, it is the reality. The Minister for Finance seems to have no difficulty in finding money for every other lobby group. Perhaps if the Minister for Foreign Affairs gets the staff in his Department to ring Marian Finucane and Joe Duffy regularly he might receive the necessary allocation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>We need to construct new relationships in an evolving and enlarging union. We cannot begin to do that if are not represented there. We could do that on a modest basis, in a planned and structured way. I urge the Minister to indicate the Government's thinking on this. I am not aware of any expansion programme in eastern Europe. I am aware, from my previous experience in Government, of other areas of competing demand such as Latin America and parts of south-east Asia where, happily, we have increased representation. However, we must focus on Europe and its enlargement. We have time to address that issue and I suggest we do so urgently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The decision made in Helsinki last weekend merely provides that the Union prepare itself for eventual accession from 2002 onwards. In the meantime the debate will resume on the reform of EU institutions to ensure enlargement is possible. We now face the prospect of two possible Intergovernmental Conferences to discuss treaty reform over the next few years as the Amsterdam Treaty commits us to another Intergovernmental Conference when membership of the Union exceeds 20 or five additional members. The Taoiseach was correct when he was quoted over the weekend as saying that the question of treaty changes would ultimately arise. Of more concern is the passivity of his view that Ireland should not &ldquo;go around looking for treaty changes&rdquo;. This is a worryingly indifferent stance for a Taoiseach to adopt given his acceptance of the inevitability of changes. &ldquo;Little or nothing to do with us&rdquo; seems to be the attitude. I would like the Minister for Foreign Affairs to address this. It is in stark contrast to the work undertaken by the previous Government in lobbying for the inclusion of a <Col N="1676" /> chapter on employment in the Amsterdam Treaty. Considerable scope exists for more improvements in this area. Deputy Bruton referred to other areas. Institutional change will happen in the EU. Ireland has a choice &ndash; we can either sit back, as successive Governments have done, decide whether it affects us and passively go along with it or we can indicate what we would like and look for political support for that formulation. It is time to move to a more proactive stance on the future shape of Europe.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach's<i> laissez faire</i> approach has been to the fore in the position, or non-position, being adopted towards the most profound policy development within the EU for years, namely, the rapid evolution of the common and foreign security policy under the co-ordination of Mr. Solana. The need to co-ordinate foreign policy within the Union has been clear for many years, so it should not be a surprise to the Government. The Union's ineptitude in the early years of this decade, and most latterly this year, in the face of genocide at its back door, is probably its most profound failing in its 40 years existence. In that context, I was pleased at the reasonably strong stance taken by the summit with regard to the current Russian bombardment and flagrant abuse of human rights in Chechnya. Europe cannot be silent in the face of human rights abuses of this order and I support strong economic measures to bring our opinion to bear on the Russian authorities. We have strong economic muscle to bring to bear. It is important that the Russians are hit where it hurts and are not left with the impression that it is business as usual.</P>
    <P>The appalling situation in Chechnya represents the first real test of the new common foreign and security policy under High Representative Solana. I have been critical of the evolution of security policy since Mr. Solana took office and I am surprised the Taoiseach has not been more so. A couple of weeks ago at Question Time on budget day, the Taoiseach told this House that the Anglo-French moves to put in place a rapid reaction force had little or nothing to do with the EU and represented an Anglo-French initiative. The reality is different as was indicated at the summit. Agreement was reached, with Ireland's acquiescence, to the creation of a rapid reaction force of up to 60,000 personnel, capable of being put in the field for a year. The logistics of that, as the Taoiseach knows but which has not been put on record, is a standing reserve of 150,000 soldiers which is the personnel needed to have a permanent presence for a year. The Taoiseach was at pains to explain that the decision had nothing to do with Irish neutrality and for good measure mentioned the reference to EU support for the UN in the communiqué. I am still far from clear about Ireland's attitude to this force. The Taoiseach clarified some points in response to Deputy Bruton. However, we need more information than what is on the record of the House so far.</P>
    <P>I can only conclude that the Taoiseach's position is more than a little confused on this issue. <Col N="1677" /> While his definition of neutrality seems contingent on the existence of UN mandates, his Government supported NATO actions over Kosovo despite the absence of a UN mandate. He knows, as we all do, the difficulty of securing UN mandates. The Minister of Foreign Affairs is waging a campaign to have Ireland deigned a member of the Security Council. Do we have any views on reform of the Security Council?</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach has only succeeded in giving the impression of a man running to stand still. The waves may be crashing all around him but he gives the impression of standing manfully with his finger in the dyke. For a man who seems uneasy about the evolution of CFSP, he has had little to say about it up to now, particularly in Europe. Closer to home he has been less reticent. In a recent exchange with Deputy John Bruton and me, the Taoiseach was so animated by this issue that he practically referred to the now largest group in the European Parliament, the European People's Party, as war mongers. He expressed particular concern about the establishment of a NATO within the European Union.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Such opposition has not been carried on to the European stage. Quite the opposite. Given his and his party's position, one might expect that he would have signalled his opposition to the message being sent out by the appointment of Mr. Solana to the directorship of the Western European Union. Not at all. Not a word.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy was against it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I was against Mr. Solana becoming &ldquo;Mr. CFSP&rdquo;. I conveyed my views at the meeting I attended. The Taoiseach was silent on the matter. It was done by unanimity. There was no word either about the message conveyed by the appointment of a former Secretary General of NATO to the position of the European Union's High Representative on Common Foreign and Security Policy. He is nice but that has nothing to do with the issue. It is irrelevant that he is one of my political family. That is to confuse the two issues.</P>
      <P>I want to refer to the points made by Deputy Bruton in relation to defence and the question of peace enforcement and peacemaking. We must move beyond the 19th century concept of defence unions and the idea that people will go to war, particularly that nations will go to war against each other. The European Union must establish a security policy and a recognition that we are more likely to have the problem of wars and instability within nation states, rather than nation states going to war against each other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Such as Turkey, for example.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly. That is a good example. Deputy Bruton will not get the kind of public support to which he referred for this if we talk about it in terms of security rather than defence. Ireland's personnel &ndash; from a neutral nation &ndash; have made sacrifices in peace enforcement and peacekeeping over the years. We should not be talking about the armaments of a defence policy but the instruments of conflict resolution in countries such as Turkey and elsewhere, based on our European experience in general and the unique experience on the island of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have indicated my party's preparedness to take part in a debate about the evolution of European security arrangements. While there probably is general agreement about the desirability of such, there is an array of differences of view on the precise nature and type of the arrangements. We have indicated a preference, not shared by the Taoiseach obviously, to see Europeans, in co-operation with the United States, being responsible for the peace and stability of their own continent. The Taoiseach is more than aware of the recommendation in the report from President Prodi's three wise men that the West<Col N="1679" /> ern European Union should merge with the European Union, specifically incorporating its mutual defence obligations. The Taoiseach is also aware that the report of the wise men, while not live, is not dead yet. The weekend newspapers referred to the European Union's new military presence.</P>
    <P>It is clear where this debate is leading but the Taoiseach, as Fianna Fáil did over Partnership for Peace, will not engage in it. Let me make a prediction. If the Government remains in power, Fianna Fáil will eventually crawl to the Irish people in a referendum to allow us to keep up with the rest of Europe on this issue.</P>
    <P>My party's view is that the appointment of Mr. Solana should have been resisted. It sends out the wrong signal about the EU's relationship with NATO and undermines the purpose of having an independent common foreign and security policy. It has placed the issue of mutual defence far higher up the priority list than it should be. The reality is that the issues that may have to be addressed by Europe in the next century will all be security related. New age threats, like environmental terrorism, make conflict resolution skills, not military action, the premium of the new age. It is imperative that Europe should concern itself in security related issues in its own back yard. I have no difficulty putting together a force capable of doing so.</P>
    <P>I accept that the fine linguistic line between peacekeeping and peace enforcement is not as simple in practice, as Kosovo proved and continues to prove, particularly in a context when international law has yet to satisfactorily resolve the balance between respecting State sovereignty and vindicating human rights. These are the issues we need to discuss. It is particularly poor that the Government of a country seeking membership of the Security Council effectively refuses to engage in these discussions in this House, whatever about its discussions on the campaign trail.</P>
    <P>The current position is that Irish Ministers should not travel across Europe acting like political ostriches. On the other hand, European security is our business; human rights abuses are our business. Our people have views on these issues and we should be making them known publicly and now. The debate that takes place should be more public than the fiasco the Government recently presided over on our membership of Partnership for Peace.</P>
    <P>I have said before that the Government is making a series of decisions that will have long-term implications for the Irish people. The Minister, Deputy McCreevy, talked a lot about Europe in his budget speech and then proceeded to deliver the most profoundly anti-European philosophical statement since we joined the EU in 1973. His preference for the American or Californian social model is clear from his projected public spending figures set out over the next three years. The reality is that the Taoiseach's newly stated politi<Col N="1680" /> cal philosophy of constitutional republicanism and his recently renewed sense of nationalism are rapidly becoming isolationist in Europe. If narrow and limited notions of national self-interest are at the heart of that philosophy, I want no part in it.</P>
    <P>I am passionately concerned about Europe's future and Ireland's place in it. We live in a global society and membership of the European Union is a key bulwark against the loss of total accountability to citizens. As much as Tony Blair, Lionel Jospin, Jacques Chiraq or Gerhard Schröder, we have the right to determine its future and we should not be afraid of letting our voice be heard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>Having listened to the previous speaker, I am strongly of the view that we should have a day long debate in this House on the future of Irish foreign policy, particularly in the context of what the Deputy said. Much of what he said could be described as misinformation. I urge the Whips to get together to have such a debate.</P>
      <P>As a matter of record, in the last two years, this Government established new embassies in Mexico and Turkey. We will shortly open an embassy in Singapore. We have opened new consulates in Edinburgh and Cardiff. It has been decided to open new consulates in Shanghai and Sidney as part of the new strategy for Asia as well as strengthening the staff of existing embassies in Tokyo and Beijing. In addition, the consulates in New York, Chicago, Boston and San Francisco are being upgraded by raising the rank of the head of mission. We have created a resident mission in the Council of Europe in Strasbourg. What is the Deputy talking about? This is the record of the Government to date.</P>

      <P>I realise that and that is my difficulty. Any point I cannot reach in the context of the time available to me I will deal with seriatim with the Deputies who raised them.</P>
      <P>In relation to the Security Council campaign, I want to again record that during the United Nations General Assembly towards the end of September, I met more than 60 ministers for foreign affairs in that period. During my meeting with those individual ministers, I set out Ireland's strategy for the reform of the Security Council. The record will show that. I have outlined that stragegy in successive parliamentary questions and will outline it again in the debate called for by the Leader of the Labour Party. I am pleased to be able to announce to the House that our strategy and our ongoing campaign for the Security Council membership is going well.</P>

I will be delighted to outline the strategy of the Department of Foreign Affairs in the debate called for by the Leader of the Labour Party.</P>
      <P>I do not agree with some of what Deputy Bruton said, although I agree with the sentiments he expressed. Deputy Bruton is committed to the European project, and I bow to his involvement in that regard over the years and into the future. He referred to the question of bringing Europe nearer to the people. That has been talked about for years and it has been described as subsidiarity &ndash; bringing Europe closer to the people. We are talking about a Europe of 375 million people in the context of the 15 member states, and 500 million people in a Europe of 27 or 28 member states. That is the reality.</P>

I do not disagree with the Deputy that in the last major electoral <Col N="1682" /> test in that regard we could have done more to make the issues more understandable, but the project is so complex and diverse that it is sometimes difficult in those circumstances to bring an understanding, in the time available, to the people in an election campaign.

      <P>I have no problems about my critics. I have always had many critics and I have no difficulty in responding to them.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to report to the House that the Helsinki European Council was a success. Finland, in its first Presidency, has discharged its Presidency role admirably. It has the satisfaction of having shaped and ultimately secured a number of decisions of real import for the future development of the Union. Like the Taoiseach, I offer warm congratulations to the entire Finnish team.</P>
      <P>As the Taoiseach has already told the House, the Helsinki European Council was particularly successful in adding momentum to the enlargement process. The decision taken at Helsinki to open negotiation with a further six applicant countries will have positive reverberations right through the next century in terms of stability and improved living standards for all the people of Europe.</P>
      <P>In expanding the negotiation process from six to 12 countries, the Helsinki European Council also signalled the beginning of a more focused process, which should allow all applicant countries proceed towards accession at the pace most suited to their needs and abilities.</P>
      <P>In addition, Helsinki, in granting status to Turkey, resolved the heretofore controversial question of how best to advance that country's application for membership of the European Union. This new status for Turkey puts in place a strategy which should mean that, further down the road, Turkey can fill the Copenhagen criteria for opening negotiations.</P>

      <P>I know Chechnya was mentioned at the Helsinki Summit but has it been left at that or has the Minister in recent days, as chair<Col N="1683" /> man of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, again taken an initiative in that area? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with that matter quickly. I understand the Deputy may have tried to raise it in the House today but for some reason better known to others, the matter was not taken.</P>
      <P>The crisis in Chechnya is a matter of the gravest concern and was the focus of the meeting in Helsinki. The Chechen capital, Grozny, is now surrounded by Russian forces, and sporadic fighting is taking place in the suburbs. Some 20,000 to 40,000 civilians are understood to be still in the city, and a further 350,000 Chechens have been displaced in the conflict to date. As the Taoiseach indicated in his contribution, the European Council at Helsinki took a strong stand on the situation in Chechnya and conclusions have been conveyed by Finnish Prime Minister Lipponen to Prime Minister Putin.</P>
      <P>The Government remains deeply concerned about the situation in Chechnya, particularly the plight of the refugees. It has allocated £220,000 in humanitarian assistance to Chechen refugees. This is additional to Ireland's share of the European Union's aid package of 1.2 million euros.</P>
      <P>Since the beginning of the conflict our concerns about the civilian population have been made known to the Russian authorities on numerous occasions and at the highest level. The Taoiseach expressed our views directly to President Yeltsin on the occasion of the OSCE summit in Istanbul in November.</P>
      <P>On 8 December I called in the Russian Ambassador. I made clear that the Government remains very disturbed by the tragic effect on the civilian population of the military campaign in Chechnya and stressed the need for an early restoration of peace and stability in the region. I indicated, in my capacity as chairman of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, that I would do everything possible to assist this, including the possibility of a visit to the region. I am pursuing this matter with the Russian authorities.</P>
      <P>The Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights, Mr. Gil Robles, visited the Northern Caucasus on 1 December and his report is under consideration by the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe in Strasbourg today. The Secretary-General of the Council of Europe has written to Russian Foreign Minister Ivanov asking Moscow to give explanations about the human rights situation in Chechnya under Article 52 of the European Convention on Human Rights.</P>
      <P>I will discuss the Chechen conflict with the Political Affairs Committee of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe in Paris tomorrow, including my offer to visit the region. I intend, as chairman of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, to make every effort to assist a peaceful political solution to the crisis in Chechnya.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1684" /> The OSCE is also actively engaged in efforts to promote a political solution. The Chairman-in-Office, Norwegian Foreign Minister Vollebaek, is in Chechnya today and he will report to the OSCE Permanent Council tomorrow. The Government calls on Russia to use the facilities of the OSCE and the Council of Europe to help bring about a lasting peaceful solution in Chechnya.</P>
    <P>The Heads of Government welcomed the joint report from the Presidency and the Commission on the Stability Pact for South East Europe which emphasised the key areas for future work. They agreed that the success of the stability pact will depend on the clear and visible commitment of the states of south-eastern Europe to co-operate in order to achieve their common political priorities. On Kosovo, the Heads of Government, while reaffirming the Union's commitment to rehabilitation and reconstruction in Kosovo, made clear that UN Security Council Resolution 1244 must be fully implemented by all parties. Heads of Government also expressed support for Montenegro's political and economic reform programme.</P>
    <P>Foreign Ministers had an intensive discussion about the situation in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and Serbia and how, in particular, the EU can assist the opposition leaders there to act more effectively. We endorsed a proposal that an EU troika with the United States should meet with the opposition leaders in Berlin on 17 December in the margins of the G8 meeting to reaffirm our strong support for democratic forces in the FRY and for their demand for free and fair elections under international supervision. The European Union adopted a common strategy on the Ukraine to assist that country in the process of overcoming the difficult political and economic problems it faces.</P>
    <P>The European Council reaffirmed the Union's full support for the Middle East peace process. It welcomed the renewed momentum in the peace process arising in particular from the decision taken by Israel and Syria to resume their negotiations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>We had a substantial debate on Committee Stage regarding proposals for additional grounds and my position remains the same. The nine grounds are in line with those of the Employment Equality Act and there is much to be done in eliminating discrimination in Irish society on the nine existing grounds. I am not ruling out the possibility of additional grounds in the future. Section 2(4) of the Bill provides for a review of the measure within two years after the provisions of the Act have been brought into operation to assess whether there is a need to add to the nine specified discriminatory grounds. The same provision is in the Employment Equality Act, 1998.</P>
      <P>Given the complexity and broad scope of this Bill, additional grounds cannot be added simply by way of change to section 3 without assessing their detailed implications and their relationship with the rest of the Bill, including possible exemptions. This can be done in the context of the review, by which time there will be substantial experience of the operation of the Act.</P>
      <P>I note Deputies O'Sullivan and Fitzgerald no longer treat asylum seekers and refugees as one discriminatory ground and I welcome their recognition that these are not the same. However, even when the two categories are treated separately, the proposed amendments relating to refugees and asylum seekers are not workable. If an asylum seeker is to be given the same rights to services as everybody else, the State could not make any distinction in its services between asylum seekers and everyone else, including citizens and refugees. I understand the Deputies' intention in tabling these amendments, but they are not workable. I emphasise that asylum seekers and refugees will be able to bring cases based on the race ground.</P>
      <P>We, therefore, have already in the legislation a ground for discrimination that relates to a person's race. Deputy Fitzgerald used the example of a person going into a shop and being refused on the basis of colour or being badly treated while on the street and that is something I would greatly deplore. We must ensure that that is eradicated, but if a person is refused service on the basis of race, that clearly comes within the scope of the legislation. That applies whether the person is an asylum seeker, a refugee or a visitor. The point is that the race ground is still there.</P>
      <P>It is being argued that I should extend the scope of the legislation to include asylum seekers as opposed to refugees, but that is not possible. I am being asked to extend the same rights to services to asylum seekers that I would to citizens and refugees, but I simply cannot do that. It would be tantamount to conferring citizenship on people whose status might be deemed to be illegal. I am unaware of any other jurisdiction where this would happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very necessary to guard against emerging <Col N="1686" /> racism as there is no more vile attitude to have. The race ground as set out in the Bill covers many of the circumstances Deputies have in mind, but it is far different to have the race ground and to extend the rights of Irish citizens to all persons, irrespective of their legal status in the State. That is not desirable or workable. If I were to ground a claim or discrimination on the basis that someone was an asylum seeker, it stands that I would have to ensure that the same services were given to an asylum seeker that would be given to a citizen or refugee. That in turn would have implications for persons with a different status. It would mean that the individual concerned, who might be deemed an illegal immigrant, would be entitled to the same services as a citizen of the State. The amendment is not thought out. A person who might be found to be an illegal immigrant would have the same right to a third level education grant as an Irish citizen or a refugee. I cannot think of circumstances where this would be possible or logical. That is not to say I am advocating that asylum seekers should be treated with less dignity than anyone else, certainly not. Throughout my Ministry I have tried to ensure that asylum seekers are treated with the dignity which is to be expected of any civilised society. There may have been times when this did not happen when queues formed but, if so, it was not intentional. We are doing our best to make absolutely sure people are treated with dignity. That is different from inserting a ground of discrimination in this legislation on the basis that an individual is an asylum seeker for the reasons I outlined, but I again stress that discrimination targeted at asylum seekers could be the subject of racial discrimination since, by definition, asylum seekers are non-nationals.</P>

      <P>We have covered this ground before. While I accept there will be a review, there is discrimination on some of these grounds at present. There is discrimination in the area of welfare benefits in the case of people on rent allowances. The is also discrimination on the ground of race against refugees and asylum seekers, which has been highlighted in the newspapers. While there is discrimination on the grounds of race, refugees and asylum seekers are specifically discriminated against. We will press these amendments.</P>

      <P>I am disappointed the Minister has not accepted any of the grounds in these amendments. I do not accept his analysis of the amendment on refugees and asylum seekers. These amendments do not seek to grant these people the same citizenship rights as citizens of the State. In reply to an earlier amendment, the Minister clarified the point about where the State has a duty as opposed to providing a service. The thinking behind these amendments is to ensure that if there is discrimination against refugees within the circumscribed rights to which asylum seekers and refugees are entitled at present, they <Col N="1687" /> should be entitled to take a case under this legislation.</P>

      <P>There is a good deal of discrimination against these people at present. We are seeking to ensure the Bill copperfastens people's rights, particularly those of refugees, asylum seekers and immigrant workers, in this and other legislation. We are seeking to ensure in this legislation that a person who fears he or she is being discriminated against under this legislation or other legislation would have a means of redress. This legislation may be more user friendly and accessible because of its content and direction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I made the position clear over the number of debates. Deputies may not agree, but it is clear that it is not possible to extend to asylum seekers the same rights to services as those enjoyed by our citizens or people who are deemed to be refugees for the simple reason that the categories are different. I outlined that an Irish citizen is entitled to a third level education at the taxpayer's expense, but until a person's application is determined it would not be proper or economically viable for me to extend those rights to asylum seekers. People deemed to be refugees are in a different category because they have rights arising out of their status. Those rights are set out in great detail in section 3 of the 1996 Act.</P>
      <P>This is not a question of prejudice on my part but one of common sense and logic. It is a question of knowing that if one confers a right on an individual that is not merited by his or her status in the State, it will give rise to several difficulties that have not been thought out. If a person is deemed to be a refugee, that is different. I outlined <i>ad nauseum </i>that any person in the State who is discriminated again on the grounds of race can bring forward his or her claim and, if it is well founded, it will be dealt with in good faith in the context of the legislation.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Today I am presenting to the House, for Second Stage consideration, the Wildlife (Amendment) Bill, 1999. I regard this as an extremely important item of legislation which will considerably strengthen the protection that is afforded to our important natural habitats and our wild flora and fauna. The Bill has, for various reasons, had a long gestation period of 15 years. Deputies will be aware that during that time its publication has been called for by politicians from all sides and by a wide range of conservation groups and people interested in conservation issues. I was one of those politicians who called for publication of the Bill while in opposition and it is a source of great satisfaction to me, therefore, to present it to the House.</P>
      <P>Despite the delay in introducing the Bill, the final product is a good one which seeks to approach the sometimes very complex issues arising in nature conservation in a measured and balanced way, but also in a way that will effectively achieve the desired objectives.</P>
      <P>Ireland has been no different from most of the rest of the world over the years in that its natural environment has come under increasing pressure. Increased industrialisation, other development pressures, more intensive farming and a young and ambitious population that quite legitimately seeks to better its material standard of living have contributed to an increasing level of encroachment on all elements of the natural environment, including wildlife. There are a number of encouraging signs, however, that the tide has turned, or is at least turning, at global level and key international initiatives illustrate this. For example, the UN Convention on Biological Diversity, CBD, is an initiative to stop the wholesale loss of species and habitats on a global basis, which has been progressing at an alarming rate in recent years. Ireland has ratified this convention, to which the Bill specifically refers, and we are committed to its effective implementation.</P>
      <P>The EU Birds Directive was given effect in Ireland in 1985 and in 1997 the EU Habitats Directive was transposed into Irish law. These two directives provide a comprehensive system of protection for wild habitats and species that are important from a European Union perspective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We in Ireland are perhaps better off than many other countries in that we still have a great deal that is worth protecting from the environmental perspective. As the Minister responsible for the conservation of Ireland's wildlife, I am committed to doing what is necessary to that end and this Bill is a key element in that effort. Effective conservation does not mean disregarding human needs or the need for ongoing development. The objective is to achieve a satisfactory balance whereby <Col N="1692" /> the needs and concerns of all can be reconciled. Conservation is achieved by ensuring human activity takes due account of the needs of conservation and is sustainable, but this in no way implies people should be excluded from ecologically important areas or that it should become progressively more difficult for people to live in such areas.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a logical development and extension of our wildlife conservation effort and seeks a balanced and effective solution to some of the major issues before us. Broadly, it seeks to provide a mechanism for the statutory protection of natural heritage areas &ndash; NHAs; to make use of the NHA mechanism to provide statutory protection for the first time for important geological and geomorphological sites, including fossil sites; to generally strengthen the provisions for the protection of wildlife species and their habitats; to enhance, in the interests of conservation, a number of existing controls in respect of hunting; to introduce new provisions to regulate the activities of commercial shoot operators; to ensure and strengthen compliance with international agreements, in particular, to enable Ireland to ratify the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species &ndash; CITES &ndash; and the African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds Agreement &ndash; AEWA; to increase substantially the level of fines for contravention of the Wildlife Acts and provide, for the first time, for the imposition of prison sentences, where appropriate; to provide mechanisms to allow me, as Minister, to act independently of forestry legislation, for example, in regard to the acquisition of land by agreement; to strengthen the protective regime for special areas of conservation &ndash; SACs &ndash; by removing any doubt that protection will in all cases apply from the time of notification of proposed sites; and to give specific statutory recognition, in light of Ireland's commitment to the UN Convention of Biological Diversity, to my responsibilities, as Minister, for the conservation of biological diversity, which is a key concept of global ecology.</P>
    <P>As this is amending legislation, it is relatively complex and I acknowledge that certain parts of it are quite technical in nature. I do not propose, therefore, to speak about every provision in it, but rather to concentrate on the main areas where it will make a difference and where public interest has been concentrated. I will begin with NHAs. One of the most significant impacts of this Bill will be the establishment of a system to afford permanent legal protection to NHAs against destruction or significant damage and provide for a system of compensation and appeals for NHAs similar to that already in place for SACs.</P>
    <P>Members will be aware that NHAs are sites that have been identified as being among the most important areas for nature conservation from a national perspective. They differ in this from SACs and special protection areas &ndash; SPAs &ndash; which represent our contribution to the EU conservation network, although national and Community priorities coincide to a significant <Col N="1693" /> degree. When I took up office, the provisions included in the draft Bill proposed that protection for NHAs would consist of a six month moratorium on works backed up by compulsory purchase powers. There were grounds for believing that such an approach might not be the optimum one and I asked that a fundamental reappraisal of the NHA provisions take place as part of an overall review of the Bill.</P>
    <P>As a result, there has been a major shift in emphasis from a six month temporary protection regime, backed up by compulsory purchase powers, to a system of permanent protection for NHAs which provides for restrictions on damaging activities and a compensation mechanism, and dispenses with the need for compulsory purchase. The provision of such a permanent protective system for NHAs is the right way forward. However, I was concerned at the proposal to include specific powers for compulsory purchase in the draft Bill. I was pleased, therefore, in light of the Government's agreement to provide for permanent legal protection against significant damage to NHAs, to agree to the deletion of the proposed provisions to allow for the compulsory purchase of land for wildlife conservation purposes. The fact that the European Commission had decided that the same level of financial incentives under REPS should be paid for both SACs and NHAs strengthened the logic of applying similar prescriptions to SACs and NHAs.</P>
    <P>On the general issue of farming and conservation, there are frequent reports about the environmental impacts of farming and such reports are often couched in negative terms. It must be acknowledged that farming, as the principal activity in our countryside, has the capacity to exert a major influence on our natural heritage. However, I do not believe that most farmers want to damage their land or compromise the richness of what they can pass on to succeeding generations. It must always be remembered that the bulk of the areas that we are trying to protect consist of semi-natural areas, which have already been to some degree modified by human activity. These areas are often the result of traditional farming methods and yet they are now seen as among our most valuable ecological areas and worthy of preservation. Such areas require the continuation of sustainable farming activity for their survival and this must always be borne in mind when conservation regimes are devised.</P>
    <P>The proposals in this legislation for the designation and protection of NHAs will be of interest to the farming community. The proposed package offers an equitable and effective way of safeguarding our nationally important sites of ecological and geological significance, while balancing the requirements of both the farming community and the environment. Farmers and other landowners should be assured that the designation of their land as NHAs will be dealt with fairly by the provision of incentive payments through REPS, or, in cases where it is not applicable or availed of, and where losses can be shown, <Col N="1694" /> by direct compensation through an Exchequer funded system. The new system will have no effect on land ownership.</P>
    <P>The appeals mechanism that has been put in place for SACs, can, if necessary, be extended to cover any NHA appeals that might arise. The provision of such a mechanism for compensation and appeals &ndash; similar to that already in place for SACs &ndash; should be seen as a signal to landowners and farmers that the State intends to deal with them in a fair and reasonable way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend that the process of designating NHAs will take place on a phased basis and that it will be based on the procedures adopted and on the lessons learned in the context of the work that has taken place to date regarding the designation and notification of SACs.</P>
      <P>Until now, there has not been a specific provision for the protection of areas or features of geological and geomorphological interest. These elements are an important part of the natural environment and, in particular, fossil records are an invaluable source of information about the distant past. We all heard with great interest of the fossilised tetrapod footprints found at Valentia, County Kerry. These footprints are now considered to be of world-wide importance. Perhaps as long as 400 million years ago, this creature left its footprints in a shallow tropical stream and the fossilised record of this event is now one of the threads from which scientists are trying to weave a fuller picture of our planet's past.</P>
      <P>Our prime geological and geomorphological sites, including our fossil records, are extremely important and well worth protecting. As with our wild flora and fauna, we have an obligation to protect such sites and to pass them on to future generations in as intact a state as we can possibly achieve. My Department has had extensive discussions in this regard with the Geological Survey of Ireland &ndash; GSI &ndash; which has and will retain primary responsibility for this area. As I said earlier, this Bill makes provision for the designation and protection of NHAs selected, on the advice of the GSI, on the basis of their geological or geomorphological importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill includes a number of provisions which significantly strengthen the level of protection afforded to protected wild birds and animals. For example, in relation to wild birds, the Bill permits the destruction or removal of a nest from an occupied house only if it does not contain the eggs or young of a protected wild bird. The examination and inspection of protected wild birds' eggs or nests, the taking of such eggs for hatching out for re-population or re-introduction to the wild, or the taking of photographs or videos on or near a nest containing such eggs, will also require a licence. The possession of an injured or <Col N="1695" /> disabled wild bird or its young while tending it and awaiting its release back into the wild will be subject to a licence, as will the continued possession of a wild bird that, for reasons of disability or other reasons deemed reasonable by me as Minister, would be unlikely to survive unaided if released to the wild.</P>
    <P>Protected animals are also given additional protection. The existing exemption where it is not an offence to destroy a breeding place of a protected wild animal in the course of construction or other work is qualified by the addition of the word &ldquo;unintentionally&rdquo;. Protection is now extended to include not only the breeding places of such animals but also their resting places which will particularly benefit bat roosts and other similar resting places. Zoology and other scientific pursuits will no longer be exempt from controls in relation to disturbance of breeding places as it is considered that even genuine zoological and scientific activity should appropriately be regulated in this way and the definition of what constituted genuine activity was open to broad interpretation and potential abuse. Provision is made for the possession under licence of a disabled wild animal, or the dependent young of a protected wild animal, to tend it in preparation for release back to the wild.</P>
    <P>Considerable concern has been expressed in recent years about the loss of hedgerows and, in particular, about the unnecessary cutting of hedgerows during the critical bird-nesting period. Deputies will appreciate that the overall issue of the loss of hedgerows is not one that falls to be dealt with in the context of this Bill. I have, however, proposed a number of amendments to the existing provisions for the protection of birds nesting in hedgerows which I hope will help to encourage a more positive approach to the problem.</P>
    <P>For example, I propose extending the period during which hedgerows may not be cut by changing the start-up date from 15 April to 1 April, thereby offering protection to birds who are breeding earlier than previously &ndash; the closing date remains 31 August; specifying that hedgerows may only be cut during that period by public bodies, including local authorities, for reasons of public health or safety, thereby seeking to ensure that routine maintenance in the cutting of hedgerows is avoided and that no unnecessary destruction of hedgerows occurs during the nesting period; and providing that, in cases where indiscriminate hedge-cutting appears to have taken place during the nesting period, I will have the power to request a statement from the local authority or other public body concerned seeking the reasons for the cutting and an explanation of the public health or safety factors involved. Hedgerows may still be cut outside the specified nesting period. However, during the nesting period, cutting may only take place for reasons of public health or safety or in the course of various <Col N="1696" /> exempted activities, for example, agriculture, forestry, land or other construction work.</P>
    <P>Issues arising in the context of hunting, particularly those relating to animal welfare, have generated, and undoubtedly will continue to generate, considerable public debate. It is important to emphasise again that my statutory remit is specifically focused on conservation and I have no such remit in relation to animal welfare. That is principally a matter regulated under the Protection of Animals Acts, which are implemented by the Garda Síochána with ministerial responsibility resting with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development.</P>
    <P>Deputies will know that a distinction was established under the Wildlife Act, 1976, between a licence to hold a gun and a licence to hunt game. The Bill provides that I as Minister may in the future make regulations requiring hunting licence applicants to demonstrate competence in relevant areas. Any such regulations would also apply to applicants for firearm certificates issued by the Garda Síochána which are deemed, by means of a suitable endorsement, as licences to hunt game birds and hares. The demonstration of competence by applicants would involve them showing knowledge of both wildlife legislation and certain species of fauna.</P>
    <P>Other related provisions will enable me as Minister, if I deem it appropriate, to make regulations to control the illegal hunting of animals and birds, in particular deer, by issuing licensed hunters with tags to affix to the animals or birds they shoot; to provide that controls on hunting over State-owned foreshore and over inland lakes vested in the State are focused primarily on protected wild animals and birds, but include a mechanism whereby non-protected species may, by regulation, be brought within the scope of this provision; and to modify the existing controls on certain hunting practices, and the kinds of weapons and devices that may be used for hunting, in line with best modern international practice, for the purpose of safeguarding the conservation status of relevant animals and birds.</P>
    <P>The Bill includes a totally new provision for the regulation of commercial shoot operators. Such operators either own or have access to shooting rights on lands which they use to provide hunting on those lands to others &ndash; usually non-resident tourist hunters &ndash; on a commercial basis. There are approximately 70 commercial shoot operators in the State, ranging from individuals or small-scale concerns to large-scale operations, and the sector is worth a substantial amount in tourism revenues.</P>
    <P>Many of the issues arising in this context were discussed last year when the House passed the Firearms (Temporary Provisions) Bill, 1998. That Bill was a temporary response to a High Court ruling which found that, while my obligations as Minister in relation to licensing were being adequately discharged, the procedures adopted in the assessment of the suitability in regard to nature conservation of applicants for hunting licences ordinarily resident outside the State were <Col N="1697" /> insufficient. In this regard, my Department is collaborating with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform on the preparation of new firearm legislation arising from the report of the Firearms Legislation Review Group, which was established by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and included representatives of my Department. It is intended to introduce a new Bill next year that will, <i>inter alia</i>, further amend section 29 of the Wildlife Act, 1976, on the issue of hunting licences to non-residents.</P>
    <P>The main elements of the system proposed for the regulation of the business of commercial shoot operators will address the concerns expressed by Members when these issues were debated last year. I appreciate the co-operative approach shown during the process of formulating these provisions by groups with a particular interest in this area &ndash; especially the Association of Game Shoot Operators.</P>
    <P>The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora was adopted in Washington in 1973 in consequence of a recommendation by the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment. The convention entered into force in 1975, having been ratified by ten countries. It aims to control international trade in certain species of wild animals, birds, and plants where such trade threatens such species with global extinction or where any state, being a party to the convention, requires the co-operation of other states to control trade in such species. To this end, the convention provides for a system of permits and certificates for regulating international trade by control of imports and exports, including re-export of specified species of wild fauna and flora. It also requires that national measures be taken, including the penalisation of trade in, or possession of these species. Species covered by the convention include species of tigers, parrots, snakes, cacti and pitcher plants, ivory and coral. It provides for a strict regime on import-export and re-export of endangered species of fauna and flora and their products.</P>

      <P>Ireland signed the convention in 1974. The EU adopted the terms of the CITES Convention by way of regulations in 1982, with revised and improved regulations taking effect in 1997. My Department has actively participated in the enforcement of these EU regulations, and will continue to do so, but our legal advice was that ratification by Ireland was not possible under current legislation, which is inadequate in relation to provisions for the seizure of specimens and the imposition of adequate penalties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of provisions in the Wildlife (Amendment) Bill are designed to correct this situation and to allow the ratification of CITES to proceed. The Bill provides specifically that I, as Minister, be designated as the management auth<Col N="1698" /> ority with primary authority for implementing the CITES regulations in the State. It also empowers me to designate additional management authorities and one or more scientific authorities for the purposes of CITES. In addition, the Bill sets out the circumstances in which it is an offence to contravene the CITES regulations. Strengthened provisions in relation to seizure and the imposition of penalties will meet the specific shortcomings that existed in the past that prevented the ratification of the convention by Ireland.</P>
    <P>Other provisions of the Bill relating to trade in wildlife are being amended with both our own domestic requirements and the requirements of CITES in mind. These provisions will, <i>inter alia</i>, extend restrictions on the sale, purchase, and possession of protected wild animals and wild birds in the context of wildlife dealing; curb the unlawful advertising for sale of protected species of wild birds and wild animals and allow the application of restrictions, by regulations, to other non-protected species; empower me, as Minister, to further regulate and control, in the interests of wildlife conservation, the business of wildlife dealing, including the purchase and sale of protected wild birds and protected wild animals, together with their parts, products and derivatives; provide new machinery for the issuing of wildlife dealer licences, which will henceforth be issued directly by me, as Minister; allow a wildlife dealer whose application is refused to appeal the refusal to the District Court; and allow that where a wildlife dealer is convicted of particular offences under the Wildlife Acts, the courts may, in addition to any other penalty, revoke that person's wildlife dealing licence.</P>
    <P>It is my intention that Ireland will proceed rapidly to ratify CITES, following enactment of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for other important issues. For example, the scope of the legislation is being widened greatly. All fish species and aquatic invertebrates, whether from marine or freshwater ecosystems, were excluded by definition from the scope of the 1976 Act, and only a small number of species were brought within the ambit of the legislation by Ministerial Order. This meant that many thousands of species were left completely outside the Act's protective system. The new Bill will bring all animal and plant species within its remit, with the exception of a number of prescribed commercially valuable fish and invertebrate species.</P>
    <P>To act as an effective deterrent and to reflect growing public concern about our wildlife, the Bill provides for substantially increased penalties, including custodial sentences, for those convicted of offences under the Acts. At present, the maximum penalty on summary conviction is £250 and the maximum penalty on conviction on indictment is £500. There is no provision for prison sentences. This amendment will increase substantially the level of fines that may be imposed on indictment to a maximum of £50,000 for the most serious offences. It will also introduce a pro<Col N="1699" /> vision for the imposition of prison sentences to a maximum of two years in certain circumstances.</P>
    <P>Apart from the provisions relating directly to CITES, the Bill contains a variety of provisions which are important for wildlife conservation in the context of trade in wildlife and related issues. Alien species and the threats they pose to biodiversity are an increasing cause of concern worldwide and Ireland is no exception. Stronger provisions are being included in the Bill allowing controls to be exercised over the importation of all alien species into Ireland, and the release and establishment in the wild of alien species that threaten biodiversity.</P>
    <P>I will refer to the extensive consultations that have taken place with interested parties since publication of the Bill and to express my appreciation to all those who made submissions on various aspects of it. In the course of the consultation process, a number of issues have been brought to my attention where a case for adjustment appears to exist. I propose to make a number of changes to the Bill on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Section 46 proposes a ban on the use of lamps and similar devices in hunting any animal. A strong case has been made that this would restrict an existing practice whereby landowners control certain pest species. I propose to apply this control only in respect of protected species. I also propose to change section 51, which would have made it an offence to hunt with a dog, ferret or bird of prey, or to have control of a pack of hounds, on land without the owner's permission. It has become clear that this would impose new controls on existing legal forms of hunting, which were never intended, and I, therefore, propose to remove this change.</P>
    <P>A number of other amendments &ndash; the majority of them technical &ndash; are being considered in consultation with the Attorney General and I will bring these forward on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The Government and I are trying to provide for the protection of elements of our country's resources that we simply cannot do without or replace. There should be no debate about nature versus infrastructure, or any suggestion that protecting our environment and heritage, and particularly those parts of it which merit protection for the common good, will hinder our progress as a nation. Wildlife conservation and environment has never had a higher profile or greater popular interest and support than it has today. Neither have we ever been economically better off.</P>
    <P>I have referred on a number of occasions to my efforts at achieving balance in this legislation. When I say balance, I do not mean balance in the sense that we will protect some parts of our heritage and allow others to be lost for any short-term gain, whether real or perceived. By balance I mean not only must we strive to ensure we deliver on our wildlife conservation objectives, but that we must, in so doing, seek to have regard to the economic and social well-being of people &ndash; most especially of the local people who live in, <Col N="1700" /> and, in many cases, have created and maintained, the areas of greatest importance to our natural heritage. We must seek to ensure that all interests can go forward hand in hand in a mutually supportive way.</P>
    <P>All sides of this House will agree that it would be unthinkable for us to allow the most precious aspects of our natural heritage to be damaged or destroyed &ndash; not only our heritage, but that of future generations to whom we surely have a duty. We have to aim to guarantee their conservation and this I have sought to do in the Bill. Such conservation is an imperative, not only for wildlife conservation and for environmental reasons, but also for reasons relating to our economic well-being and quality of life.</P>
    <P>This Bill is an important contribution to our nature conservation system which will make a real difference and which approaches the issues raised in a balanced and pragmatic way.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>This side of the House does not intend to hold up this Bill unduly. The Wildlife (Amendment) Bill, 1999, was published on 29 June and it has come into the House in the closing days of December. I am not sure whether that is a reflection of the importance attached to this by the Government, the priority attached to it by the Minister or her ability to convince the Government Whip that this should have been taken before now. Whichever is the case, it is here now and the fact that the Minister, who is under severe pressure from the Commission in respect of not conforming with all of its directives, has been able to make her Second Stage speech here this evening will allow for the sending of diplomatic replies to Brussels to say that the matter is being dealt with and that the fine in question should not, therefore, be levied.</P>

      <P>I welcome the publication of this important Bill in which I have a personal interest. It is a Bill which will effectively change and reinforce the ways of life in rural Ireland, in particular, and of many aspects of nature in urban Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recall being here by will of the people in 1976 when we dealt with the principal Act, the then Wildlife Bill, 1975. One of the principal contributors to that Bill was the former Taoiseach, <Col N="1701" /> Charles Haughey, who gave extensive briefings from his undoubted experience and knowledge of many aspects of nature. It was an important principal Act.</P>
    <P>I understand that 23 years later it is important to update that Act, change certain aspects of it and set down a legal base for the future. I share the Minister's view that it is important that we pass the Bill having had as full and proper a discussion as we think appropriate so that those who come after us will have a legal base on which to experience the joys of nature and the thrill of wildlife.</P>
    <P>I hope the Bill is not just aspirational but will be backed by Government resources to see that it is implemented. Personnel and staff are important, otherwise the Bill, which may be fine in law, could become a sham.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to go into any great detail because we only have a few minutes this evening but I will make a few general observations.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister's proposals to deal with sections 46 and 51. Of all the correspondence which other Deputies and I received, by far the largest volume of complaint was in respect of this. While the Minister has not actually published the wording, I must take it in good faith that the consequences of what she had proposed were not intended by the Department. I fully accept that. She is putting at ease a great number of people involved in falconry, hawk hunting, hunting with packs of hounds, etc. The previous Government, of which I was a member, went to extensive lengths and had a great deal of consultation in the area of entry on to land, trespass with or without permission, visitor status, etc. It is quite a complex area and former Deputy Mervyn Taylor was the Minister dealing with it. That was accepted after a great deal of consultation with the farming bodies and it would not do to have that changed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. D. Carey Mr. D. Carey">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be that somebody in the Department put that to her and it got into the <Col N="1702" /> Bill, but I am sure her officials did not do that intentionally.</P>
      <P>Some 25 years ago I was secretary of a newly formed gun club in my part of the country. One learned a great deal about the mechanics of tendering for forestry/Land Commission lettings, the breeding of pheasants for release, the general activities of commercial shooting, gun licences, the types of shooting, the quantity and variety of species which were available, etc. Those 25 years have seen many changes in the nature of that kind of activity. The issue of the control and policing of gun licences and commercial shooting is important having regard to the different way they do business on the continent. Some 8,000 full-time or part-time farmers went out of business in County Mayo between 1987 and 1997 and many of those would be small farms with fields of rushes, stone walls, scrub land, etc. These should be a hive of activity for many forms of wildlife and in many cases they are. The consequences of the Bill, if properly implemented, could see a resurgence of the corncrake and other species in many of these areas.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the issue of hedgerows, which really are corridors of wildlife. I have had meetings with various groups who are interested in this. The local authorities, for reasons of public safety, feasibility, etc., have, under contract in some cases, cut these hedgerows and the quality of the cutting has ranged from neat to environmental savagery. I am glad to see that the Minister proposes to regulate this. In Britain, the regulations are much stronger. The species and licence requirements are identified and one just cannot cut at random because it is seen as a social and criminal offence to stray outside the legislation in that regard. We may need to discuss all of these areas at some length on Committee Stage. For instance, the Minister specified that hedgerows may only be cut during certain periods by public bodies, including local authorities, for reasons of public health or safety. When the people of village X or Y get on to a hard pressed local authority, it will send down the flail-cutter to cut hedgerows, saying it had to do it for public health or safety because the people were complaining. The legislation must be much tougher and regimented here in the sense that local authorities should be under no illusions that there are times specified in the Bill during which hedge-cutting and trimming may be legitimately carried out. We do not want environmental savagery to which I referred to take place in the middle of the nesting season on the excuse that it is for public safety or health.</P>
      <P>I recall being a member of Mayo County Council in the mid-1970s when a then independent member, the late Councillor Nellie Robinson from Ballina, introduced a by-law, the first lady member in Ireland to do so, whereby no hedge-cutting should take place during the nesting season. She was before her time in that sense and I am glad to see that this kind of thing is now being recognised here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1703" /> On Committee Stage we may have to discuss all of these issues in considerable detail. Deputy Deasy has been the guardian of the song birds over the years. A man of capacity and undoubted talent, he has a particular interest in the preservation of this aspect of nature and conservation. He has been unfailing in his duty to the song birds of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Many people have been concerned about the issue of hunting and I am glad the Minister has changed the provision so that those who hunt by lamp at night for fox, etc., are only affected where it involves protected species.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that he should go back to Clare and do that on the local authority, but not in the national Parliament.</P>
      <P>The future development of social partnership must be seen in the context of a comprehensive framework of policies which we are putting in place. These include the review of An Action Programme for the Millennium which sets out clear goals to provide the political basis for Government action until we complete our term in 2002, the consolidation of peace and of a new democratic dispensation by the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, and the national development plan which provides the resources to radically transform our economic and social infrastructure over the next seven years. The meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council on Monday marked an historic step forward in this process and I am delighted to have been part of it. Taken together, these policies provide us with an unprecedented opportunity to shape our own future.</P>
      <P>These vital decisions are not taken in a vacuum. Our approach is based on a coherent and ambitious view of what Ireland can become &ndash; a vision recently articulated by the National Economic and Social Council. Among the most important aspects of the council's vision are: economic inclusion based on full employment; social inclusion, reflecting full participation in those activities which constitute the norm in society; and successful and continuing adaptation to change. This vision is shared by all the social partners and Fianna Fáil is wedded to this approach. Making it a reality is the task the Government now faces.</P>
      <P>Above all, we must realise the full potential of our people. Social exclusion with its ever present companions of poverty, poor educational achievement, alienation and crime, is the major constraint we must overcome if we are to realise our full potential as a people. The budget introduced by my colleague, the Minister for Finance, will meet these challenges. It will improve living standards for all and invests in social services. It will maintain a strong and stable macro-economic position. It will contribute to the realisation of a socially inclusive and successful society, while supporting sustained competitiveness in a globalised economy.</P>
      <P>Our policy will help to ensure continued strong economic growth, with growth in GNP expected to average 5.75% over the next three years. Unemployment is expected to fall to about 4.5% of the labour force by 2002. Alongside the national development plan, this budget provides a further important step towards the delivery of our vision of a new Ireland. The figures demonstrate that current spending has increased by 26% over last year, while capital spending on public and social housing increased by 160% since 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The budget delivers a record social inclusion <Col N="1706" /> package of £485 million in a full year, with more than £400 million in the area of social welfare, family and community development. It provides a carefully measured package designed to give a balanced approach across all sections of our community. It takes up again the themes which I have focused on in my first two budgets to date, and which I will continue to focus on in the next two budgets. These are, securing the future for all our older people; improving the living standards of everybody on social welfare; particular support for people with disabilities and carers and supporting families and communities.</P>
    <P>The social welfare budget day package of £398 million, together with an additional allocation of £5 million to my Department for child care provision, and a further approximately £15 million for pensions provisions in relation to the pre-1953 issue, in the forthcoming Social Welfare Bill, amounts to a total investment in a full year of more than £418 million &ndash; a record social welfare allocation by a very long way. To put the size of this investment in context, the equivalent figures for my previous two budgets were £316 million in 1999 and £225 million in 1998. The 1997 budget introduced by the previous Government was worth some £215 million as opposed to £485 million this coming year.</P>
    <P>We have provided an increase of £7 per week, up to 9%, in maximum personal rates for pensioners, and £11.70 for a couple on contributory pensions. I suggest that anyone who dares to criticise that £7 should look across the water where old age pensioners were recently given a 75p rise in the UK budget.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1708" /> These improvements are an important step forward to building an inclusive society as set out in the NESC vision. We all recognise that more has to be done over time in relation to all aspects of the NESC report. We in Fianna Fáil recognise that social partnership is the way to achieve this objective. As the Taoiseach has made clear, in the context of a new agreement, the Government would be prepared to agree the timetable for moving towards agreed objectives by way of improving the position of those on low incomes through the tax and social welfare systems.</P>
    <P>Social partnership has been the engine that has driven the economic and social transformation of Ireland over the past 12 years. The evidence is compelling. During the period 1988 to 1998, the economy has grown by almost 6% a year. Ireland's average growth for the past six years has been the highest of all OECD countries.</P>
    <P>Since social partnership was adopted, total employment in the economy has grown by almost 2% <i>per annum</i>&ndash; twice the OECD average and six times the EU average. Over the same period, the unemployment rate has fallen from 16% to 5%. On top of all this, living standards increased by more than one third in the 12 years to 1999. All social welfare rates have increased more rapidly than the growth in average industrial earnings. That is what social partnership is about &ndash; building a better Ireland for all our people.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Party is a national movement and, like many of the social partners, is a broad church. We gave commitments to the people in our election manifesto, which we intend to deliver on over the lifetime of the Government.</P>
    <P>While each social partner brings its own priorities and concerns to the negotiating table, a robust appreciation exists on all sides, of the successes delivered by the partnership model and of the potential to build on that good work. I am confident that, as with previous agreements, a consensus will emerge this time which will see the continuance of social partnership and which will launch the process into the new millennium. The Government will, in the context of moving to a new national agreement, continue to address the social welfare priorities set out by the NESC in a measured and balanced way.</P>

      <P>&mdash;arrangements has again been underlined by our approach to Partnership 2000. Although this agreement was concluded under the rainbow Government, when we came into office we lost no time in setting about delivering on the commitments which had been made to the social partners. In the area of social inclusion, for example, we have delivered a combined package worth more than £1 billion in our three budgets so far. For a sharp contrast, one need look no further &ndash; as my colleague, Deputy Dermot Ahern, has done &ndash; than the Opposition parties and their approach to social partnership.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>All of us who were in the House at the time can recall the Leader of Fine Gael being very disturbed by the fact that the social partners could walk into Government Buildings and put forward their case on the range of issues that came within the partnership agreements. Due to a frighteningly poor understanding of the nature and dynamics of social partnership, he seemed to see such arrangements as, in some way, posing a threat to the role of the Dáil.</P>
      <P>Against this background, it is interesting to read the apparent concern for the future of social partnership in this Fine Gael motion. When, I wonder, did it have its Road to Damascus conversion to the social partnership gospel? I wonder if it has really bought into the idea or if its motion is only a surface dressing which it applied because it suits it, concealing the anti-social partnership agenda which lurks beneath.</P>
      <P>Whatever the truth, the important point is that Fine Gael is not in Government. Therefore, we do not have to worry about the fate of social partnership being in its hands, which is just as well. The fundamental flaws in the analysis underlying its recently published &ldquo;Vision for Ireland&rdquo; show that Fine Gael in 1999 is about as clued into reality as it was in the mid 1980s. It is so ill-equipped to address social partnership issues that its lecturing from the Opposition benches brings the concept of &ldquo;brass neck&rdquo; to a new plane.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1712" /> We also hear many pious words on social partnership from the Labour benches. It is a great pity the Labour Party does not practice what it preaches. For example, the area of housing is now accepted as a key component of the partnership discussions. The two current members of the Labour Front Bench who were directly responsible for housing under the rainbow coalition sat on their hands as clear warning signs emerged on house prices. Yet, since they were consigned to the opposite side of the House, they seem to have miraculously found all the solutions. We often hear them talk about the need for more zoned land and social housing and affordable housing. However, when proposals are put forward at local authority level to deal with these issues, it is the left wing councillors, usually led by the Labour Party, who are the first to object. Such hypocrisy is frightening.</P>
    <P>The true level of commitment to social partnership of the main Opposition parties is, at the very least, highly questionable. Their record in Government in the mid-1980s is still painfully fresh in the mind. To many it seemed as though they became confused between running the country and ruining it, and their recent performance in Opposition suggests they still cannot tell the difference. On the other hand, Fianna Fáil pioneered social partnership and has remained faithful to it since. We have carefully nurtured social partnership to its current level of sophistication. The electorate can have every confidence in the Government's commitment and capacity to go forward into the new millennium and to develop an even stronger social partnership which spreads the benefit to all our people.</P>

      <P>I read a letter which appeared in one of the national newspapers at that time which stated:</P>
      <P>I had great interest in the general election, but I wasn't voting, because I wasn't in my own country. I'm living in the USA, and have been since October.</P>
      <P>What brought me here? Need brought me here. The need to earn a living. The need to have a better way of life and a better standard of living. The need to be a useful member of society.</P>
      <P>Unemployment brought me here. My enforced absence from the Irish workforce lasted four years, and I regard my exile as an escape from the prison of unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1713" /> I don't speak on anybody's behalf but my own, though I am sure lots of people share the same sentiments. When historians come to write about the '80s, they'll mention unemployment and emigration, just like what was written in the '50s and the early '60s. Have the thoughts and feelings of any emigrant Irishman or woman ever been recorded?</P>
    <P>I'd like my views on politicians, unemployment and emigration to be heard. I regard myself as a rejected and forgotten member of Irish society.</P>
    <P>I joined the expanding ranks of the unemployed in September 1982. Later on that year, Garret Fitzgerald's Coalition Government came into office. They were elected with a reputation of untarnishable integrity.</P>

      <P>I helped elect one member of that government.</P>
      <P>In my home town we used to have one employment exchange. Before I left we had two. One for each of the Coalition TDs who represented us.</P>
      <P>Politicians have rarely spoken honestly about unemployment. Oh, they'll mutter the usual phrases: &ldquo;It's sad and something needs to be done&rdquo;. Their utterances are nothing more than gratuitous concern. Politicians only care about people when it affects their election chances. Our present representatives can't convince people otherwise.</P>
      <P>Despite their numbers, the unemployed aren't a strong lobbying force. They aren't privileged and prominent, like many other groups in our society.</P>
      <P>What do politicians know about the unemployed? Can they even try to imagine what it's like to be unemployed? Do they know how it feels to face each new day without work? Would they relish the thought of spending years of their lives in idleness? Do they know what it is like to try and exist on parsimonious unemployment assistance? Do they know how it feels to be utterly penniless and in debt? They don't have a mandate to pursue policies that will consign people to long years of unemployment. Nor do they have a moral right to do so.</P>
      <P>No TD in Government, or in opposition, can stand innocent. All of them knock on our doors and request our support at election time.</P>

      <P>I apologise for being a little late as I was contributing to a debate in the Seanad which was running behind schedule. I am delighted to support the Government motion on social partnership. It is interesting, and it would be amusing if it was not so serious, to be lectured on social partnership by Fine Gael which, in that famous coalition Government with the Labour Party between 1982-87, left everyone outside the door and told us all that the great guru, Garret, would sort it all out, but left us on the brink of bankruptcy. It galls Fine Gael that the 1987 Administration, of which you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, were an eminent member, showed that the political capacity to deal with the magnitude of the problems facing the country could only be taken on board by a party with the political leverage throughout social partnership to build a consensus which was totally absent as we headed into that Administration. Were it not for the enlightened leadership of a now discarded leader of Fianna Fáil that partnership would have met with limited success, but that is what happens to prophets.</P>

      <P>We are here to discuss social partnership and it is sometimes important to acknowledge the contribution people make, even if it is not fashionable to do so. I do so unreservedly. In the run up to negotiations for the renewal of social partnership agreements, difficulties often arose because leverage was being sought by all parties to get their priorities included in the deal. When Partnership 2000 was being negotiated, Democratic Left tabled a motion lamenting the imminent collapse of discussions and calling on the Labour Party, of which they are now eminent members, to pull back on the 1% levy imposed and claiming they wanted social welfare cuts changed before there could be any discussions.</P>

Social partnership has transformed this country. The ability to do business better is why we have achieved unprecedented success in economic and social terms. I also acknowledge the vision and leadership shown by the trade union movement as a corporate entity. It has discarded the old adversarial ways which sought to restrict the influence of labour to wages and conditions. In so doing, it has recognised the social and economic advantage for its membership and their families, and for those political constituencies it seeks to represent &ndash; the unemployed and socially excluded &ndash; have been achieved under successive social partnership agreements under successive Administrations. Let this be the context in which the negotiations are resumed and I am confident that everyone will recognise this as the big picture. The maintenance of competitiveness is fundamental to ensuring our economic progress is sustained. This Government is committed to ensuring the socially excluded are part of the economic improvement and we now have the resources to meet, agree our priorities and proceed together, as we have done in the past, to the benefit of all.</P>

      <P>I welcome the contribution of the Minister of Health and Children, Deputy Cowen. The shallowness of the contribution of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, shocked me. I have soldiered with him in Meath but it was amazing to hear someone so trapped in a time warp who can see no one in step but his Johnny. Fortunately, probably no one was watching but the public would think he does not have the substance to be a Minister. His contribution was shocking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe in social partnership and nothing the Government says will shake that belief. However, when the Minister for Finance rose on 1 December, one month away from the new millennium, it was an unprecedented opportunity. When he sat down barely an hour later he had sown the seeds which have almost derailed social partnership. We should not fool ourselves &ndash; the Minister squandered a huge opportunity. As the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs said, the NESC report outlined the basis for social partnership which underpins social and economic policy. This included the development of a negotiated consensus on key economic and social issues. What happened to this? No one was consulted. We have heard that several Ministers, probably including the Minister for Health and Children, did not know what was going to happen. The NESC recommended the development <Col N="1716" /> of a policy framework which generates social inclusion in tandem with economic success. This was not evident in the extra £4 given to the unemployed and the £50 given to double income couples.</P>
    <P>The NESC also suggested that tax reform must be used to promote social cohesion. It set out key policy priorities and attached a high priority to increasing the standard rate of personal allowance as the most effective way to help the low paid. It favoured an increase in child benefit which would be neutral in respect to child care choice and the labour market position. It supported the introduction of new types of family leave which would enable employees to balance work and home responsibilities. The NESC had a vision although not the type of vision which was behind the budget which envisioned a scramble for money and the creation of traps in the tax code which will force people into work.</P>
    <P>The NESC report was a consensus. It recommended that tax benefit should be concentrated on the low paid, that substantial increases should be made to support children, and that the workplace should accommodate the balancing of home and work responsibilities. The Minister kicked over the traces of all those principles of social partnership in his search for glory. He used tax policy to damage social cohesion &ndash; as we heard angry people say daily on the airwaves &ndash; and divide families. He abandoned negotiated consensus for developing positions on taxation. This provision was not suggested by trade unions, employers or any of the third strand &ndash; none of them were consulted. The Minister did the opposite and inverted the tax priorities which were agreed by the Government, employers and trade unions. He provided trivial support to children. This unresolved issue is of great importance and it will return to haunt us.</P>
    <P>It is startling how quickly this Government has lost touch with the reality facing families. The Government decided to concentrate its tax concessions on those earning £30,000 and more &ndash; these benefits reach a maximum of £50 per week for an income of £50,000. This formula was designed by the Government &ndash; at least by the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance as other Ministers seem to be trying to distance themselves from it. Do Ministers know the average industrial wage? Do they know what a woman working in industry earns? Less than £12,000 &ndash; that is the average industrial wage. Such women were given £5 a week in this budget. That was the concession of the Celtic tiger economy to those who have been the backbone of social partnership which has brought us this far.</P>
    <P>A woman who is a dependent spouse on her husband's unemployment assistance was given £3.80, bringing the total allowance to a princely sum of £47 a week.</P>
    <P>What about those on a minimum wage? The tax paid by someone on a minimum wage will be £17 next year &ndash; 10% of what was to be a subsistence wage. The Taoiseach boasts about how won<Col N="1717" /> derful this idea is. It is no wonder this budget made the public angry and that SIPTU was the first of other organisations to pull out of social partnership. It was provoked beyond what it could bear by this budget. This was no accident. By failing to address the issue of low pay, we are creating problems. In crude economic terms, the low paid will look to their employers for what they did not get in the budget. There will be huge pressure in industries such as textile and clothing where average wages are barely ahead of the minimum wage. The formula of social partnership &ndash; giving tax cuts instead of giving in to high pay demands &ndash; has been dispensed with as far as the low paid are concerned.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach sought to defend his actions by quoting the ESRI. I have not ever seen such a blatant example of the devil quoting scripture. The ESRI had the last laugh when it demonstrated its recommendations were in the context of recognising women in the home and substantial increases in child benefit. It also illustrated that the 20% of the population who earn the least gained less than 1% while those earning the most gained 4% on an already better income.</P>
    <P>Budgets are about values. The values which underpinned this budget had nothing to do with social cohesion. It was a misjudged attempt to feed the Celtic tiger. It badly misfired because it was not thought through and there was no negotiated consensus. It deliberately kicked over the traces of social partnership. Organisations such as CORI, which is one of the pillars of social partnership, have excoriated this budget, which is not surprising.</P>
    <P>This budget should have provided a framework whereby people, particularly woman, could make choices. It did not do that and instead it traps people into making choices which makes it more difficult for them to balance home and work responsibilities. For a mother at the low end of the income scale, the decision to take up work will carry an extra penalty of unrelieved child care costs, the loss of the £3,000 allowance and none of the other benefits. No thought was given to double income couples at the lower end of the scale. At higher income levels the decision to give up work will carry an extra penalty of the loss of £28,000 in the tax band. This is unbelievable. The State should have tried to facilitate and encourage employers, trade unions and workers to create a workplace which allows flexibility. It should not have used the tax code to trap people into making choices.</P>
    <P>As far as families are concerned, the principles underpinning this Budget are totally wrong. They suggest that caring for children full-time in the home is a luxury that should be taxed. That is at the heart of this budget. They suggest that working and paying for child care is consumption and should not be relieved by tax concessions or child benefit. Some of my constituents are paying £90 a week for child care and they were given £2 a week in tax relief. It is ridiculous.</P>
    <P>The decision of a single parent to live with his <Col N="1718" /> or her partner will carry a tax penalty of £40 per week and for many the loss of the one parent family allowance. We are setting up a code to drive people apart instead of creating a tax and welfare code to support stable families. The Minister is making decisions on the importance of children without regard to any form of partnership. Married women have lost out and they are angry about their position. There was a unique opportunity to resolve this in the budget. Instead the Minister set family against family. This is the tragedy and the memory the budget will leave behind.</P>

      <P>The Government has shot itself in the foot and virtually torpedoed the prospect of a successor to Partnership 2000. During my time as a lawyer and politician, I believed that any negotiations to be successful require trust and confidence in the participants. The Government has shattered this trust and confidence by its incompetent mismanagement of the budget. Trust and confidence in the Government has been destroyed on virtually every conceivable front.</P>
      <P>In my budget speech I referred to Article 41 of the Constitution dealing with the rights of the family. Even with the proposed changes to the Budget Statement, at a minimum there is a major question mark over Article 41 of the Constitution. At the very least, there is a constitutional uncertainty &ndash; the Supreme Court will decide on this one way or the other &ndash; arising from the budget which seriously undermines the foundations on which any agreement will be built.</P>
      <P>There is further uncertainty as to the terms of the budget. I deal with the social affairs brief and, frankly, I do not know what the social welfare provisions are at this stage. I hear leaks and rumours about an additional £125 million. I am not sure whether this is true. Perhaps the Minister for Finance will confirm whether there will be an additional £125 million and if this is for the year 2000 or on a full year basis. As opposition spokesperson in this area, I would be interested to receive some clarification, because there is only uncertainty. Social affairs normally deals with people on the margins of society who are unemployed, on pension or disabled. I hear that the £125 million has something to do with the low paid. Is this concentrated on the family income supplement? All we have is uncertainty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not clear if there will be a further package for the low paid. I am not aware of what the Taoiseach committed in a letter to congress today. Again there is further uncertainty. The major issue for the Government is its display of a combination of political misjudgment and muddled mismanagement. This is compounded by a series of climb downs coupled with devious tactics involving its own backbenchers and Independents. The net result is that we are entering hugely important negotiations on behalf of the country and we are being represented by a Government on which no one can rely. Any <Col N="1719" /> Government would have to convince the social partners of its bona fides in any serious negotiations. There is now a real danger that these social partners will be reluctant to conclude any agreements with such an unreliable negotiating partner. Already, there is evidence of a reluctance to even begin negotiations. The ending of the first crisis today may, I hope, be confirmed tomorrow by SIPTU. This is just lurching from one crisis to another.</P>
    <P>I listened earlier to the rubbish emanating from the Minister for the Environment and Local Government when he was revising history. He carefully omitted the input of his former leader, Mr. Haughey, to the politics of the eighties. Let us be fair to the Minister for Health and Children, he at least had the grace to refer to him. He referred to Fine Gael's leader in the late eighties, Deputy Dukes, and his contribution. Let us be clear, all parties in this House have seen the enormous economic success over the past decade which has been largely attributable to a series of national agreements. I am concerned that in one fell swoop this Government has put in jeopardy our future economic growth path. This could have serious consequences for the country. In these circumstances, the Government should consider whether it has outlived its usefulness. From the vast Exchequer resources, its treatment of the low paid and the &lsquo;no paid' has been unforgivable. What hope is there for the vindication of the rights of the socially excluded in any new agreement negotiated by the Government? On the basis of the Government's track record and of the previous history of the Minister for Finance, there is little likelihood of the Government being able to conclude an agreement. Even if it manages to cobble something together, it will have little credibility among those who are marginalised in society. Paragraph 1.11 of Partnership 2000 reads:</P>
    <P>Facing the challenge of the 21st Century also requires a new focus on equality, which implies the adoption of a strategic approach.for the full integration of women and of people with disabilities, Travellers and other groups experiencing discrimination. It includes the promotion of access, participation and outcomes for all marginalised groups in our society.</P>
    <P>What has the Government done to promote access, participation and outcomes for the marginalised groups in our society? It has ignored and paid lip service to them. It has given them platitudes. In relation to carers and people with disabilities, this budget has deigned to offer them the crumbs from the rich man's table. The Government's actions speak louder than words. The reaction to the budget by those who in the context of social partnership represent the marginalised and the socially excluded has ranged from lukewarm to downright condemnatory. CORI described the budget in the following terms:</P>
    <P>Budget 2000 was unfair, lacked vision and <Col N="1720" /> squandered the substantial resources which were available to the Government.. This is a scandalous squandering of resources and is indefensible in the context of the poverty and social exclusion that is so prevalent throughout the country.</P>
    <P>One of the voluntary groups representing the interests of carers said to me that Deputy McCreevy should no longer be Minister for Finance but Minister for Poverty, because that is what he is promoting for many people in society. The reaction of many of the voluntary groups of people with disabilities and their advocates and carers has been one of quiet resignation as they face into another year of broken promises. In the meantime, those who were promised much and received little, will continue to live lives of quiet desperation. How can people have confidence in this Government and Minister for Finance who last year favoured the needs of racing punters over those of carers? How can people have confidence that this Government will successfully negotiate a partnership agreement which will provide for a more egalitarian society? In the first edition of this year's budget, this Government has given an additional £77 per week to couples earning £100,000 per year. The contrast is £7.80 per week to couples surviving on disability assistance. The Government is not even ashamed of this. The employee pillar of the partnership is doubtful. I hope it will get into negotiations. The social and voluntary pillar of the partnership is already crumbling. The Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance by their actions may yet bring the House down around our ears.  </P>
    <P>It is only through social partnership that the rights of the marginalised and excluded will be vindicated. It would be unforgivable if the Government were to fail to conclude an equitable, meaningful and credible agreement. Given the posturing, equivocation and the sleight of hand practised by the Government, I fear it fails to inspire confidence in the social partners. The damage done may not be fully repaired &ndash; at least until there is a change of Government.</P>

      <P>This day two weeks ago, the Minister for Finance introduced a budget. There was a budget follow-up last week. On the News tonight, Des Geraghty said that changes will be introduced in the Finance and Social Welfare Bills. I am pleased to hear this. I hope this will bring employees on board because they threatened to withdraw from the social partnership and the next round of talks with the Government.  </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is unfortunate that we had to hear about these matters from a news programme. The leaks and the reaction in the media are unfortunate also. As we debate this motion tonight we still do not know what he was talking about in terms of the proposed changes, or what the Taoiseach has promised congress. I hope there will be some move forward in an attempt to patch up a budget that has been divisive and which has undermined partnership. People now realise that if they feel <Col N="1721" /> strongly about an issue in the budget, they can threaten to object to it and walk out of talks, and then the Minister will change the budget as he sees fit.</P>
    <P>This budget has undermined partnership. Partnership is about workers, spouses, those on welfare payments, people with disabilities and many other aspects of our society, and SIPTU is right to speak out about those they represent. IBEC and the economists will have their view, but politics is about representing all of the people all of the time and giving everybody a fair share. It is not just about representing one sector over another, which we saw in Budget 2000.</P>
    <P>This budget has been divisive in terms of the contribution of women who work in the home. We all heard the reaction to that issue over the past two weeks, and I read an article which stated that there may be a challenge to the budget because it threatens the family as enshrined in the Constitution. Women make up 75% of those who are paid below the minimum wage. I have received correspondence from the INOU to the effect that the £3,000 additional tax free allowance announced last week by the Minister will discourage women from taking up low paid employment. A total of 19,700 women work between one and nine hours per week, while 61,500 work between ten and 19 hours per week in part-time, low paid jobs as cleaners in supermarkets and restaurants. Women who take up such low paid employment will lose the £3,000 additional tax free allowance announced last week. The implications of this measure have not been thought through. We are now lurching from crisis to crisis. There is no concept of what these changes will mean.</P>
    <P>Social partnership is necessary. The National Economic and Social Council commended the previous partnership process. Improved competitiveness in conjunction with favourable external economic development has played a crucial role in converting strong economic growth into the remarkable job gains achieved in recent years. It has helped to deliver industrial peace and moderate pay settlements.</P>
    <P>Partnership 2000 was negotiated by a Fine Gael led Government and it has worked well. It worked well because it included everybody and it had the confidence of all those involved in the partnership. I suspect that partnership has been undermined.</P>

      <P>Success generally comes when all players act as a team, each recognising that <Col N="1722" /> they have a contribution to make to the overall benefit of the common objective. So, too, has success come to modern Ireland when it realised that every sector counts, that the era of each for themselves was over and had no place in the Ireland of today. Employers worked with employees, supported by Government policy, taking account of those who were not in the employment market and those self-employed or involved in agriculture.</P>
      <P>That common embracing partnership was, and still can be, a recipe for success today but that team spirit is under attack by the Minister for Finance who, by his work and the budget, has created the basis of division and social disadvantage as he stokes the fires of greed. There is no need for any Minister to go down this road. By simply applying the current formula, taking account of the needs of the labour market while ensuring that the low paid were removed from the unacceptable position where those earning less than £6,000 per year are dragged into the payment of income tax, it was possible to build and strengthen social harmony and partnership.</P>
      <P>This country needs to find a balance. It is important that all are encouraged and enabled to benefit from the prosperity of the nation. It is not in the interest of partnership that Government sets one married couple against another, or that it enhances the spending power of one sector while not recognising the needs of the other. Government policy is such as to be the cause of social division when it is well recognised that we need social partnership to make Ireland flower. It is important that every factor in the equation is treated fairly, that all are given the opportunity to partake of the benefits which flow from any partnership agreement. Partnership is about winning. It is not about conferring some additional advantage on a particular sector.</P>
      <P>While it is important that we ensure that companies and investors make a profit, it is also important that those in employment benefit. The withdrawal of SIPTU, the largest trade union, from the partnership table due to the unfair nature of the Government's adjusted playing pitch requires immediate measures. We cannot allow the partnership of recent years to unravel, rather we must work to maximise the cohesion, ensuring that all players are eager to continue working together.</P>

      <P>For the Fianna Fáil backbenchers to have voted for the disastrous budget, as presented by Deputy McCreevy on 1 December, would have been like turkeys voting for Christmas. The Government believes it has <Col N="1723" /> now saved its Deputies from what I would regard as a seasonal roasting, but if it has done so it has also exposed its own total lack of commitment to real social inclusion and taxation justice.</P>
      <P>With specific reference to the motion before the House, Sinn Féin, in our pre-budget submission, pointed out that the series of agreements between Governments, trade union leaderships, farming organisations and employers &ndash; I am glad that amused the Minister &ndash; have operated to the disadvantage of most workers. The ability of the labour force to mobilise its strength was thwarted, and the wages of many workers were kept artificially low. However, given that the majority of trade unions have voted to enter the negotiations, it is vital that the balance is now redressed. There must be real pay increases which benefit low paid workers most of all, and any new agreement must make the elimination of poverty its first priority. Budget 2000 was a test of the Government's willingness to deliver on that priority. It failed abysmally and it now faces that test again in the reconvened negotiations.</P>
      <P>I will support the motion before the House, although I do not share the Fine Gael Party's interpretation of social partnership. We in Sinn Féin seek a real social partnership where the wealth of this nation is distributed according to need, and certainly not to greed. This Government has shown it has no intention of adopting such principles and deserves the censure of all in this House for squandering what was the best opportunity for any Government to eliminate poverty in our society.</P>

      <P>SIPTU has pulled out of the talks and commentators are now claiming credit for having seen the flaws in the budget. The first person to see the flaws was our finance spokesman, Deputy Noonan, who replied immediately to the budget. Make no mistake, the lower paid are suffering under this budget. The Minister has raised the limit before which low paid workers come into the tax net to just £110 and the budget is three times more beneficial to high wage earners than it is to low wage earners. Fine Gael proposed an income limit of £170 per week before a worker entered the tax net, but when the Minister introduced this budget, he saw an economy rather than a budget &ndash; that was his major mistake. He defended the budget bravely until the weekend, saying he was not in favour of turning. However, when his backbenchers came back from their constituencies they went onto the plinth, led by Deputy Roche, a frequent user of that location, and the Minister saw the light, or someone saw it on his behalf. The most hardened Opposition politician could not help but feel sorry for the Minister, who was forced to see he was in favour of turning.</P>

      <P>The successes achieved by this country over the period of the four national programmes are well known to all Members. Those in employment, those seeking work and those relying on the State for assistance have all gained from social partnership. Our record speaks for itself. Those at work have received significant increases in their take-home pay. The increases in real income have been particularly high over the period of Partnership 2000 &ndash; some 15%, compared with about 5% during each of the first three programmes, the Programme for National Recovery, the PESP and the PCW.</P>
      <P>Since 1993 we have seen a 25% increase in the number of people at work in Ireland and a fall in our unemployment rate from about 15.5% to just over 5%. We now have net immigration, whereas not so long ago thousands of our young people had to emigrate to find work. Employment creation remains the most effective route out of poverty. Progress made in that regard has transformed the poverty position during the recent years of social partnership. There has also been significantly increased spending on social inclusion measures and public services to the benefit of all citizens.</P>
      <P>It was only by turning away from the old approach of non-competitive and inflation-creating income increases that scope emerged for employment gains. In addition, pay moderation allied to employment growth enabled tax reform which produced still stronger gains in take-home pay for all. It is this interdependence between different groups in society and this interaction between different elements of public policy that is at the heart of social partnership and at the root of the improved living standards delivered over recent years.</P>

      <P>Earlier this month I brought in a budget which contained the biggest tax and social welfare package in the history of the State at £1.5 billion. Although most of the focus has been on the tax element, this budget also increased all old age and related pensions by £7 per week and all other personal rates by £4 per week; gave the biggest increase ever in child benefit of £8 per month for the first and second child and £10 per month for the third child and subsequent children; increased the qualified adult allowance and brought in a new insurance-based carers benefit; increased health, mental handicap and education spending substantially; and launched a major programme of grants and assistance to increase the supply of child care places.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House will be aware of the Government's decision to introduce a national hourly minimum wage from 1 April 2000, a measure which will clearly assist with and have a positive effect on the alleviation of poverty. Last year the Government standard-rated the basic personal allowances and made them of equal value to all tax<Col N="1725" /> payers. The Government did this because we thought it fair and proper. It allowed us to target resources on the lower paid. Under my three budgets I will have removed more than 175,000 persons from the tax net, nearly five times the number so removed in the three budgets prior to that. Our commitment to easing the burden on the low paid is shown in what we have done already in this regard. The move to standard rating and the subsequent increase in personal allowances in the 1999 budget was acknowledged in the NESC strategy report as a key mechanism for delivering tax reductions to the lower paid.</P>
    <P>One consequence of the tax credit policy move, however, is that personal allowances no longer act to keep taxpayers off the top rate of tax. The only way to get the numbers on the top tax rate down is to widen the standard rate tax band. This reality was also accepted in the recent NESC report, which identified an increase in the income level at which people become liable for the higher tax rate as a significant priority.</P>
    <P>Slowly but surely the percentage of taxpayers on the higher rate has been increasing, from 37% in 1996 to 38% in 1997, 39% in 1998 and 44% this year. Next year it would have increased to 46% if nothing was done and the percentage would soon have been over 50%. At that stage the top rate would have become the standard rate. The best way to widen the standard tax band is to put this band on an individual basis and to tax persons on what they earn as individuals, whether single or married. I have always believed that taxpayers should be given the facts openly and fairly, and the facts are that under this budget the number of taxpayers on the top tax rate will fall by 125,000 next year; by the end of the process, some 350,000 taxpayers will have been removed from the top tax rate, a reduction from 550,000 to 196,500; and the percentage on the top tax rate will come down from 46% to 17%, or to 12% when one includes those exempt from tax on low incomes.</P>
    <P>The benefits of this policy move are that it recognises that we need a modem tax system for a changed society; it treats taxpayers as individuals based on what they earn and not on their marital status; it rectifies the imbalance in the tax system against most taxpayers who are single or two income earners; it takes a great number of middle income taxpayers off the top tax rate; it gets many single workers &ndash; 90,000 of them next year alone &ndash; off the top tax rate; and it puts up to £20 per week in the pay packet of those on average earnings.</P>
    <P>The move to individualisation is the right way to go. I believe that the trade union movement recognises there is a case for individualisation. However, I recognise the strength of feeling that has been generated on this issue and on what taxpayers perceive as an unequal approach to stay-at-home spouses and two income families. Consequently, the Government decided to bring forward a £3,000 per annum tax allowance at the standard rate for taxpayers in respect of those <Col N="1726" /> spouses of married one income families who work in the home caring for children, the aged or handicapped persons. This fulfils a promise made by the Government in the joint Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats statement issued prior to the June 1997 general election of an allowance, then set at £2,000, for families in these circumstances.</P>

      <P>I am convinced, notwithstanding the current controversy, that those who reflect on these matters and who analyse the changes we have begun have already taken these points on board. I am more than prepared to assist social partnership by tax measures and tax reform to meet the goals we share in common &ndash; a better, fairer and sounder tax system for all. These goals are also the foundation for the Government's programme, for which a democratic mandate was received from the people and which we have a duty to implement.</P>
      <P>I want to make it clear that the Government and I, as Minister for Finance, wish to and are ready to negotiate a successor agreement to Partnership 2000. I freely acknowledge the role the social partnership approach has played in the past in tackling the problems of unemployment, inflation and the public finances. Social partnership is also the way to address the new challenges that face us now; problems associated with rapid growth, maintaining our competitiveness into the future and sharing the fruits of growth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Faced with these challenges, we need to ensure <Col N="1727" /> that we retain the true spirit of social partnership, with its inherent mutual commitments and trade-offs. The best way to proceed and the way that is most in keeping with the problem-solving approach that has underpinned social partnership is for all the social partners to resume their discussions on a successor to Partnership 2000, and I am glad that today the ICTU has decided to do this.</P>
    <P>The overriding consideration for all involved must be the continuation of sustainable economic growth. Our successful performance to date is testimony to the sound economic policies we have put in place. If we can agree a new national programme based on implementing the vision and strategy in the recent NESC report and the Government programme, in a realistic and balanced way, we should be well placed to meet the challenges ahead. That should allow us to continue on a relatively strong growth path capable of delivering further solid increases in employment and living standards.</P>

      <P>An expression comes to mind, clichéd and all as it might be but appropriate under the circumstances, &ldquo;Oh how the mighty have fallen&rdquo;. The last few weeks should have been a PR man's delight in terms of what he would have expected for the Government. There were major increases in Exchequer returns from tax revenue, a reworked Government programme between Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats Party &ndash; all nice and cosy with Mary tied in again for another couple of years and no danger that she would slip under the net and get away &ndash; a national plan with £40 billion promised in spending and, to cap it all, a budget on 1 December, the anticipation of which had backbenchers quivering with excitement that the fires would be burning on the hilltops to welcome them home to their constituencies because of all the goodies that would be in the budget. They thought it could not go wrong because there was so much money available to the Minister for Finance, but sadly and irresponsibly it did go wrong. The same backbenchers who were quivering with excitement found their way quickly to the plinth and to RTE programmes to express their concerns and state that they needed changes made to the budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What has happened with this budget is extremely dangerous and serious. A budget must have credibility for it to be worked by the <Col N="1728" /> Government that introduced it. Instead we have a completely discredited system under the budget. We had budget mark one on 1 December and budget mark two when an announcement was made, which the Minister, in a most weak way, tried to defend tonight by saying the £3,000 PAYE allowance was in the Fianna Fáil-Progessive Democrats programme. He knew that on 1 December, he just forgot it and he is now trying, in a <i>post hoc </i>way, to defend what the Government has done. We got an indication there would be a budget mark three in that an additional £125 million would be allocated for social welfare changes, which I though we might have heard about tonight but there was not a dicky bird. The Minister hinted tonight that more money would be available and that there would be more changes to the budget to ensure that the partnership talks commence properly. That would be budget mark four. That is not the way to bring in a budget. The Minister, with his intelligence, realises he has brought the budgetary system into disrepute. He will rue the day he did that.</P>
    <P>There is a macabre irony to this in that the man who built his reputation as being &ldquo;a consensus builder&rdquo; and a good negotiator is presiding over the most socially divisive budget ever introduced in this State. This man, the Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, led the 22 merc. team across the Border last Monday to Armagh to meet their counterparts in the Northern Ireland Assembly, to manifest to the world how divisions of long standing were being cast aside and replaced with co-operation, harmony, peace and a sense that people wanted to work together. While he did that, he has failed dismally, as a leader and a Taoiseach in this Republic, to ensure that the resources and the assets we have in abundance were not more equitably and evenly divided between those most in need. The low paid, the unpaid &ndash; the women in the home &ndash; the widows, the widowers, the handicapped and the homeless are some of the forgotten sectors. None of those sectors was properly helped in the budget. One of the main points of Partnership 2000 is contained in paragraph 11.14 of Chapter 11. It states that all social partners accept that the benefits of economic growth should be shared by all citizens in a manner that reflects this country's commitment to social solidarity and a better quality of life not for some but for all our people. This budget has failed dismally to live up to the principle of partnership and the terms of Partnership 2000.</P>
    <P>I would almost feel sorry for the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, if this matter was not so serious. He is present and he had some support a few minutes ago from the bouncer of the Fianna Fáil Party, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, and he is now joined by a backbencher who was used recently as a voice to express concern and then quickly went back into <Col N="1729" /> his box. I feel sorry for the Minister because he will have to take the flak and shoulder all this on his own. It is clear the Taoiseach has not been supporting him. The Taoiseach is more interested in his TAM ratings, his glad handling and being seen by as many people as possible. Show him a barber shop that is being opened, a hotel or an extension that needs the ribbon cut at its opening, a bonny baby contest and the Taoiseach is the man, he will there in a flash. No opening is too small for our Taoiseach. Shame on him for his lack of leadership, understanding and care, that his divisive budget would do so little to tackle the real needs of so many of our people.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the most serious element of the failure of this budget is the major risk it has created for the prospects of a new partnership programme. While partnership programmes have been rightly praised in this House, they have also become a model for many other economies in Europe and elsewhere. In a recent interview with a Chinese newspaper, I was asked how our social partnership system commenced and why it worked so well.</P>
    <P>In light of the budget, it is little wonder that the unions and the Irish National Organisation for the Unemployed are extremely angry and sceptical about negotiating a new deal when this budget did little or nothing to advance social inclusion for the low paid. Deputies opposite have been praising themselves because the Government intends to introduce a minimum wage in April 2000. It is a scandal the Government is considering doing that while it intends to leave the tax level as it is. That means that a person on a minimum wage will have to pay tax after earning £110.</P>
    <P>I want to spell out what the Minister did with the extra money he had. The social welfare increases funded by taxation represent only 8.9% of new resources. Those funded by PRSI represent 6%, the health care package represents 2.9%, but in contrast, public sector pay equals 43% of the additional resources and income tax reduction equals 35%.</P>
    <P>It is not that people do not like getting increases in their pay packets when they are well paid. Everyone likes to get a few extra pounds but this budget has divided family against family, sister against sister and brother against brother, where families have different working arrangements. Many people who will benefit from the budget &ndash; I do not deny there are some who will benefit &ndash; have said they would rather see the extra £40 they get on a wage of £40,000 being given to those on £10,000 who will benefit by only £2 per week as that would be more equitable. Such people have helped to build the economy.</P>
    <P>According to CORI's assessment of the budget more people are below the poverty line than a decade ago. One in ten is consistently poor despite the growth levels; 95% were unemployed <Col N="1730" /> on the list for February 1999 and this excludes anyone who worked even one hour per week; 23,000 more people are on employment schemes; expenditure on social welfare decreased from 27% in 1996 to 23.6% in 1999, the lowest after Portugal, yet the number of recipients and beneficiaries has increased. In 1996 there were 33,000 family units on housing lists. That has increased to over 40,000 which means that more than 100,000 people are on housing lists. Some 4,000 to 5,000 people are considered to be homeless. That number has doubled in three years despite our growth and affluence.</P>
    <P>Last night the Tánaiste had the gall to move an amendment recognising the importance of negotiating a new partnership programme. How dare she have the gall to say that when the Government has put in jeopardy the chances of a renegotiated partnership. We on this side hope there will be a renegotiation, but the Government has not helped the matter. During the summer, in the quiet weeks of July when she thought no one would notice, the Tánaiste tried to change the community employment scheme and indicated that the social partners had been consulted and had agreed, a wrong, untrue and devious action by the Tánaiste which, because of a Private Members' motion tabled by Fine Gael, she had to quickly change in the middle of September to ensure she did not breach the terms of the social partnership.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste quoted figures to defend herself. We all accept that the statistical basis of some of the measurements of our economy are looking good, but what about the quality of life, the value of people's lives who are still living below the poverty line and those living on reduced incomes, those on health care who cannot get their operations? The Government has done severe damage to the budgetary system by its equivocation and lack of leadership and the fact that the Minister for Finance, with, I would imagine, great anger which he has not displayed, has had to make changes to the budget, which we still do not know about. Neither do we know whether they will help ensure a renegotiated partnership.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The budget undermined social partnership because it neglected the central tax recommendation of the body that was the originator of social partnership, the NESC. In the interests of equity for the low paid, the NESC recommended that priority in this budget should be given to increasing basic tax credits. It did that knowing that tax credits had already been introduced. That approach would have given equal benefits to the well off and less well off. Instead the Government ignored that recommendation and opted to reduce the rate of tax and widen the bands, and so gave relatively little benefit to the low paid and very much greater benefit to the better paid. In so doing the Government substan<Col N="1731" /> tially increased inequality in our society. There is no basis in partnership for that approach.</P>
      <P>The difficulties the Government is now facing were entirely foreseeable. It is not an excuse to say that tax credits changed the tax code last year. They did, as the Minister pointed out, but knowing that the NESC still recommended that the priority should have been for the low paid and for increasing credits rather than widening the bands or reducing the rates. The Minister, irresponsibly, ignored that recommendation. That was a serious political error for which this country and the Government will have to pay a high price and deservedly so.</P>
      <P>The Government says it is introducing individualisation in the tax code. Most commentators use that term as if it was accurate. It is not an accurate term to describe what it is doing. Individualisation already exists in the tax code as an option but not in our social welfare code. Couples can already opt for individual tax assessment as it is, but they have unlimited freedom to transfer tax allowances and lower rate tax entitlements to one another within a family. The budget is taking away that freedom. The tax proposals should have been called family allowance pooling restrictions, not individualisation. We already had individualisation, the restrictions are new.</P>
      <P>One area where there is no right to individualisation is in the social welfare code. Women could have benefited hugely if they were given the right to apply individually for social welfare payments or medical cards irrespective of their husband's income or <i>vice versa. </i>This proposal was not put forward in the interests of individualism, which the Minister espouses. Why? It is in the answer to the question why individualism is the banner for the better off but is ignored by the less well off that the true political philosophy of Fianna Fáil is revealed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fianna Fáil recognises high income individuals as individuals so long as they work outside the home, but it does not recognise social welfare recipients or medical card applicants as individuals. They have to have their income pooled with whoever lives in the house with them. For Fianna Fáil, social welfare applicants or medical card applicants are just a category, a class, a household unit. They are not individuals, but if you have a high income you are an individual in the eyes of Fianna Fáil. I refuse to accept this divisive and selective approach. We should choose. We must either accept the family as the unit for all taxation and social and other entitlements or alternatively accept the individual as the unit for taxation and all entitlements. You cannot have a halfway house that imposes individualisation for the taxpayer for the benefit of the better off but does not give it to social welfare applicants who are less well off. That fundamental inconsistency shows that it is not actually individualism that <Col N="1732" /> Fianna Fáil believes in but privilege for those who are better off.</P>
    <P>I resent the fact that the letter from the Government to congress inviting it back into negotiation has not been tabled in this House. The House is sovereign as far as the public purse is concerned. Any communications committing this House should be on the floor of the House. They should not be available to RTE and others outside it but to Members.</P>

If the social partners are entitled to be consulted, women and men working in the home are also entitled to be consulted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the opportunity to speak on this excellent budget. Too much comment on it has inevitably focused on stay at home spouses because of the controversy and subsequent climb-down in which the Government engaged in regard to their tax treatment versus double income couples. There has been unhealthy debate on this issue, with Opposition Members trying to set so-called family values against double income couples.</P>
      <P>Some constituents who contacted me adopted a tone which was quite insulting to such couples. They believed that somehow such couples of necessity could not bring up a child properly and were rearing a generation of neglected latchkey children. I am a member of a dual income couple, as are many others in our dynamic, growing workforce. Couples must work because Ireland is much wealthier today than it was 30 years ago.</P>
      <P>What people could afford 30 years ago cannot be afforded now. This is why women are going out to work.</P>
      <P>Another reason women are anxious to go out to work is that for years they were discriminated against. They were not allowed to work. They were subjected to the discriminatory Civil Service ban under which they had to cease work once they married. The Irish rate of female participation in the workforce is lower than the European average. I may not be entirely accurate but I suspect that the Irish rate is approximately 5% lower than the European average.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, for his brave effort to address this problem through the tax code. A difficulty has existed in Tallaght in my constituency for the past two years. At almost every clinic in that time and also on the street, women have told me that they wanted to take up part-time jobs but they would be taxed to the hilt if they did so. This was unfair and a discrimination against women who wanted to go out to work because their families were reared or their spouses were ill. In one case, a woman wanted to work in a supermarket but if she worked a small number of hours to top up her family's income because her husband was on a disability allowance, she would lose many bene<Col N="1736" /> fits and also most of the money in tax. This was an unjust discrimination against women and the Minister attempted to address this inequity through the tax code.</P>
    <P>There is an enormous disparity between the people that I meet as I do my duties in my constituency and those who telephone radio talk shows. The politics of the late 20th century is being driven by chat shows, talk show hosts and 'phone-ins. This is not appropriate or right. Although it is a term used by Marxists in the past, it is forcing and shaping a false consciousness. The talk shows are giving an unreal view of public opinion. As I go about my work in my constituency, I meet countless numbers of people who are happy with the tax provisions in the budget because they see money coming back to them. Nobody lost as a result of the budget. This important factor has been lost in the debate about the treatment of stay at home spouses.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, is an honest man. He proved his honesty over the years in, for example, championing real debate and opposition to policies then enunciated by the former Taoiseach, Mr. Haughey, within the Fianna Fáil Party. He made no secret of his opposition to those policies and outlined his views honestly. He made no secret of his aims and objectives in the budget. He wanted to get more women back into the workforce. He is not forcing them back to work; women are voting with their feet. They want to be in the workforce and they should be given every opportunity to participate in it. They were discriminated against in the past but they are not discriminated against in the budget.</P>
    <P>When some members of my party were parading on the plinth, exercising their consciences and worrying about the budget's provisions, my principal concern was that these aspects would be unpicked in the deliberations and so-called debates on the radio talk shows which followed. I was particularly worried that the measure which favours women going back to work would be changed. However, I am glad that nothing has been unpicked. The budget's original provisions still stand.</P>
    <P>Through his climbdown in relation to stay-at-home spouses, the Minister has added to the budget rather than subtracted from it. While I gave the Minister a certain amount of support at the briefing session, I told him I was worried that he would subtract from the budget rather than add to it. However, the Government has enhanced the budget. It has equalised in income and financial terms the treatment of those who go out to work and those who opt to stay at home. Initially, only 103,000 stay-at-home spouses were affected by the measure. By the addition to the budget through the Minister's climbdown, more women will benefit.</P>
    <P>There are important items in the budget in relation to health care and the reduction in personal taxation. Some Opposition Deputies are deliberately misunderstanding our policy in this <Col N="1737" /> area. When we went to the country in 1997, we made a series of brave promises on the tax front, including a promise to reduce personal income tax rates to 20% at the standard rate and 40% at the upper rate. We are within striking distance of achieving that brave and well enunciated aim. This promise was not only an aspiration. It was written in cold print before the last election. It was dramatised ten days before the poll so the people would be clear about it. We said we would cut rates, lift allowances and try to bring more people out of the tax net. We have achieved those aims. As the Minister often points out, the budget is one of a series. The Government will present five budgets and I hope the Minister will present the final two in which the aim of a higher tax rate of 40% and a standard rate of 20% will be achieved.</P>
    <P>The concerns of the lower paid must be addressed in the next two budgets in a much more focused way. I do not suggest that the concerns and welfare of the lower paid are not addressed in this budget. They are comprehensively addressed and I pointed this out to SIPTU president, Des Geraghty, when I took part in a radio show in recent days. He could not contradict me. In this budget 40,000 more people are being taken out of the tax net. They will not pay any tax. This number is in addition to the 80,000 people who were taken out of the tax net last year.</P>
    <P>Over two budgets, a total of 120,000 people have been taken out of the tax net completely. One only enters the tax net after one earns £4,700 to £5,000. I agree with SIPTU that people on what should be the minimum wage of £5 an hour for a 40 hour week should be removed from the tax net completely. I appeal to the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, to take this proposal on board and perhaps implement it. He should make a promise in that regard and set it down as a Government objective in the next budget.</P>
    <P>The Minister should press ahead with his plans. He has made two radical moves in the series of budgets he has presented, one of which is the switch to a tax credit system, which is democratic and egalitarian. It means that a person at the higher end does not gain disproportionately from a tax credit given at the lower end. This is an egalitarian move for democracy and will be of assistance to the lower paid. It will eliminate the situation which arose following many previous budgets where allowances were increased in an effort to help the lower paid, but high income earners, the richer section of our community, gained disproportionately from them. The tax credit system will address that problem.</P>
    <P>The move towards individualisation will be the subject of discussion between the Government and the social partners. However, people are confused in thinking individualisation is a concept which relates to the tax code. The propagandistic notion being perpetrated by the Labour Party and the Fine Gael Party is that this is some sort of move towards the interests of the individual <Col N="1738" /> rather than society along the lines enunciated by Mrs. Thatcher in Britain. However, I assure them that this is not a Thatcherite Government and this is not a Thatcherite budget. The Fianna Fáil Party is committed to middle and low income earners and the next couple of budgets will ensure that vision comes to fruition. The Government will last its full five year term and implement the promises it made to the people in the 1997 general election.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>I compare the budget to a business operation where a businessman is preoccupied with turnover. However, it is said that turnover is vanity and profit is sanity. There is a huge amount of vanity in this budget and people, particularly those on minimum wages who have to pay tax, have been excluded. The budget is completely focused on 17% of the electorate. The bulk of the electorate, including people who are heavily in debt, is ignored by the budget. A minimum wage of £4.40 an hour is set to be introduced and it is unreal that such workers are faced with paying tax on £67 a week.</P>
      <P>The social welfare increases are most unfair. The children's allowance has only been increased by £2 a week. The expectation in the media and from the Minister and the Government before the budget was extremely high. People expected so much but, unfortunately, those who should have benefited most did not get anything like what they expected. In terms of development, there is a new poor class in Ireland whose problems must be addressed. There is much wealth in many areas but some people have not received any real gains. It is most disheartening for people to receive an increase of £2 a week or £104 a year in the children's allowance.</P>
      <P>The Minister announced tax benefits for crechés. However, that benefit will not be taken up by those who have capital allowance benefits to build such facilites. A direct allowance, which people could see, would be better and would offset the huge cost factor in the care of children in homes.</P>
      <P>This is a vanity budget driven by high expectations. The result is that many people are dismayed and saddened at the amount of exclusion.</P>

Tá imní ar dhaoine freisin nach leor an <Col N="1740" /> tseirbhís atá ar fáil pé scéal é is cuma stailc a bheith ann nó gan é a bheith ann. Creidim féin gur toradh é an stailc seo ar dhrochbhainistíocht in áiteanna. Ní maith liom é sin a rá. Is toradh é an stailc ar cheardchumainn mífhreagracha agus ní maith liom é sin a rá ach oiread.

Má tá rud amháin le teacht as an díospóireacht seo tá súil agam go dtiocfaidh rud éigin cosúil le Public Transport Users' Group as. Tá fhios againn go bhfuil a leithéid agus Irish Parents' Council ann ó thaobh scoileanna de agus tá an Irish Consumers' Association ann ó thaobh trádála de agus eile.

      <P>Bhí fearg uafásach ar dhaoine inniu ag fanacht le traenacha agus cén fáth? Aréir agus daoine ag dul abhaile, agus mise in a measc, chualamar fógra gan eolas ar ardán Stáisiún an Phiarsaigh, a dúirt linn éisteacht leis an raidio agus a bheith ar an airdeall, fanacht le scéal. D'éistíomar leis an nuacht ar maidin agus ní bhfuaireamar mórán eolais ach amháin go raibh rudaí trén a chéile. Ansin dúradh linn glaoch ar uimhir 1850. Dhein mise iarracht ón a seacht a chlog go dtí ceathrú taréis a hocht glaoch ar an uimhir sin agus bhí sé gafa an t-am ar fad. Idir an dá linn bhí scoláirí ann a chaill a gcuid scolaíochta. Bhí daoine ann a thóg an lá le dul ag siopadóireacht agus bhí orthu rudaí a athrú agus gan dul amach. Bhí oibrithe ann a bhí déanach nó nach raibh in ann dul ag obair ar chor ar bith. Bhí daoine a chaill go leor airgid de bharr nach raibh aon dul as acu ach taxi a fháil má bhí siad in ann taxi a fháil agus bhí daoine ag teacht thar an teorainn ó Bhéal Feirste ar cuairt. Ba dhrochshampla amach is amach a fuaireadar siúd de chóras iompair phoiblí na Poblachta.</P>
      <P>Tá mise ag glaoch ar an mbainistíocht chun a fháil amach cén fáth nach raibh fógra ann roimh tráthnóna aréir. Dúirt siad nach bhfuair siad ach fógra 24 uair roimhe sin agus de ghnáth bíonn mí ag teastáil chun stailc a reachtáil. Agus bhí fógra ar an 29ú lá de mhí Dheireadh Fomhair, 1999 agus dúradar notice of strike had expired. Ansin ar an dtaobh eile den scéal chuir mé glaoch ar an National Bus and Railworkers' Union agus ar SIPTU a dúirt nach raibh aon expiry i gceist, nach raibh ann ach deferral of strike notice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tuigtear dom go bhfuil compromise nua le plé amárach agus guím gach rath air. Ach in ainm Dé is comhlacht beag í Iarnród Éireann i gcomparáid le comhlachtaí iarnróid i dtíortha eile. San Ísiltír mar shampla, áit a bhfuil i bhfad níos mó daoine ann agus comhlacht níos mó éiríonn leo rudaí a <Col N="1741" /> reachtáil. Bíonn an traein in am. San Eilbhéis chomh maith fuaireas amach nuair a bhíos ann ní hamháin go raibh an traein in am ach bhí duine ag seasamh taobh thiar den ardán agus do bhuail sé cnaip díreach nuair a bhí an second hand san áit cheart agus d'imigh an traein. Bíonn taxi nó car rental ar fáil ag gach stáisiún san Ísiltír agus bíonn fonn ar dhaoine an traein a úsáid dá bharr. Bíonn integrated ticketing ann ní hamháin do thraein no do bhus ach do thraein agus do thaxi. Chomh maith leis sin, tá fhios ag aon duine a bhí ar chuairt ar an Ísiltír go mbíonn neart áiteanna ann chun rothar a pháirceáil go sábháilte agus bíonn fonn ar dhaoine dul chuig an traein ar rothar. Is sampla maith dúinn é sin. Mar sin, an bhfuil aon ionadh ar an Aire go bhfuil Iarnród Éireann mí-shásta agus go bhfuil daoine taobh istigh d'Iarnród Éireann míshásta leis an chineál scéil atá ann. Is léir dúinn mar phobal agus is cinnte gur léir do mhuintir Iarnróid Éireann go bhfuil infrastructúr acu, the permanent way mar a thugtar air, agus níl sé á úsáid. Ó am go chéile bíonn sé plódaithe ar ndóigh, ach go minic cuirtear amú an infrastructúr atá ann. Ar ndóigh bíonn an pobal ag tabhairt amach do na tiománaithe má bhíonn an traein plódaithe. Feiceann siad an tiománaí agus feisteas Iarnróid air nó uirthi agus tugann siad amach freisin do na bainisteoirí nuair a bhuaileann siad leo agus leis na máistrí stáisiún mar gheall ar mhoill agus mar sin de. Ní aon ionadh ormsa go bhfuil ísle brí agus easpa mhisnigh ar dhaoine atá ag obair in Iarnród Éireann. Tugtar faoi ndeara chomh maith nuair a bhíonn caint ar thraenacha ocht gcarráiste nach bhfuil ach traein amháin mar sin ag teacht ó mo bhaile dúchais féin. Baile Brigín, ar a hocht a chlog ar maidin agus traein amháin eile ag dul abhaile ó stáisiún an Phiarsaigh san iarnóin ag trí nóiméad déag taréis a cúig. Ní stopann an traein sin a thuilleadh ag stáisiún Sráid na Teamhrach mar go bhfuil an t-ardán ró ghearr. Is léir go bhfuil an-chuid fadhbanna ann agus dá bharr sin ísle brí i measc lucht Iarnróid Éireann chomh maith leis na custaiméirí. Is cinnte go dtuigimid go léir, tá súil agam, cén fáth go bhfuil an pobal ar buille. Is minic, agus bímse ag taisteal go minic mé féin ar na traenacha, a bhíonn siad déanach, is minic a bhíonn siad plódaithe agus is minic a chuirtear seirbhís ar ceal ar fad agus ní bhíonn fhios agat go dtí go mbíonn tú ann ag fanacht leis an traein.</P>
    <P>Ó am go chéile, agus bhí mé féin ar an traein nuair a tharla sé seo, bíonn rud a thugtar &ldquo;signal failure&rdquo; air. Bíonn an taein lán, go minic bíonn sé plódaithe agus uaireannta stopann sé i lár áite agus ní bhíonn seans ag daoine rud ar bith a dhéanamh ach fanacht go foighneach. Is minic a bhíonn na carrchlósanna trén a chéile chomh maith. Aréir sna Sceirí bhí traein 6.25 déanach. Níor tháinig sé go dtí 6.45 agus bhí an áit trén a chéile. Bhí daoine ag fanacht le daoine eile chun síob a thabhairt dóibh má bhí siad in a gcomhnaí i bhfad ón stáisiún agus araile. Is cinnte nach bhfuil seo sásúil. Rud eile atá an-mhíshásúil ná an clár ama a bhíonn míchruinn. Deirtear sa chlár <Col N="1742" /> ama go mbeidh tú i mBaile Átha Cliath ag am áirithe agus caithfidh mé a admháil nach raibh sé riamh cruinn chomh fada agus a bhain sé liomsa. Bhí sé i gcomhnaí beagáinín déanach agus deirtear gur leor é sin. Ach ní leor é má tá tú chun seirbhís a chur ar fáil do dhaoine. Is minic nach mbíonn an leithreas ag obair ar thraenacha Arrow mar shampla agus neart daoine ag tabhairt amach faoi sin &ndash; daoine le páistí ag taisteal leo mar shampla. Is minic a bhíonn easpa slí isteach is amach do dhaoine atá ag brath ar wheelchairs.</P>
    <P>Mar sin tá go leor fadhbanna ag cur isteach ar Iarnród Éireann chomh maith le custaiméirí Iarnróid Éireann. Tá an stailc, dar liomsa, mar chuid de na fadhbanna ar fad atá taobh thiar de sin cé go bhfuil siad ag díriú ar na tiománaithe an uair seo. Má tá an pobal ar buile ní thuigim cén fáth nach bhfuil an fhoireann, nó an bhainistíocht nó an tAire ar buile. Agus má tá siad ar buile cad tá á dhéanamh acu faoi? Rachaidh an scéal seo in olcas. Bhí stailc ann inniu ach is cinnte má tá méadú ar an daonramh atá ag brath ar an Iarnród go mbeidh i bhfad níos mó fadhbanna amach anseo. Tá 10,000 duine in a gcomhnaí faoi láthair i mo bhaile féin. Taobh istigh de dheich mbliana eile beidh sé sin ardaithe go dtí 25,000 duine.  Más amhlaidh a bheidh sé sin is cinnte go mbeidh i bhfad níos mó daoine ag brath ar an traein agus tá eagla ormsa go mbeidh stailceanna ann níos minice.</P>
    <P>Dúirt Mr. Joe Meagher leis an gComhchoiste um Fhiontair Phoiblí agus Iompar, &ldquo;In 1998, we carried almost 32 million passengers, an increase of 8% on the 1997 carryings.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Mar fhreagra ar sin cad a rinne an Rialtas faoi sin ach méadú 6% a thabhairt ar an subvention do CIÉ i mbliana.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Considering&rdquo;, mar a dúirt Mr. Meagher arís, &ldquo;investment requirement of £840 million up to 2006 to bring infrastructure and rolling stock up to an acceptable level..&rdquo;. Ní leor é sin agus is maslach an tsuim airgid é an t-ardú sin. Bliain i ndiaidh bliana bhí laghdú in real terms ar an méid airgid a tugadh do CIÉ i gcoitinne. Agus tá an scéal níos measa má tá an stailc seo os ár gcomhair amach. Tá an scéal níos measa ó thaobh an Phlean Náisiúnta de. Tá £3 bhilliún luaite mar airgead don chóras iompair phoiblí agus taobh leis sin tá £9 mbilliún luaite mar chaiteachas ar bhóithre. Tá gá le bóithre ach tá na bóithre i bhfad níos contúirtí mar shlí taistil ná mar atá an traein. Maraítear thart ar 400 duine ar an mbóthar gach bliain. Bíonn an-chuid fadhbanna maidir le truailliú agus tá conarthaí idirnáisiúnta sínte maidir faoi sin. Tá fadhbanna atá i mbéal an phobail ar nós Glen of the Downs ann nuair atá iarnród atá ag dul síos cósta Chill Mhantáin ag an am céanna gan an infheistíocht atá ag teastáil agus costas ospidéil ag éirí as timpistí ar an mbóthar chomh maith.</P>
    <P>Deir an Plean Náisiúnta go mbeidh 90% den chaiteachas taobh amuigh de Bhaile Átha Cliath ag dul ar bhóithre. Nuair a chuireann tú é sin i gcomparáid leis an stailc a bhí ar siúl ar maidin is léir go bhfuil neamhaird á thabhairt ar <Col N="1743" /> fhadhbanna an chóras taistil phoiblí. Cuireann se sin leis an míshásamh, leis an aighneas, leis an choimhlint agus leis an seans stailceanna a bheith ann.</P>
    <P>Táimid ag caint mar gheall ar &ldquo;Cinderella&rdquo; service i gcoitinne. Ní thuigim cén fáth go bhfuilimid ag glacadh leis go mbeadh píosaí ó líne Bhéal Feirste atá á dtógaint amach á n-úsáid ar líne Ros Láir, ar líne an Teachta Ivan Yates. Second hand pieces of track and so forth atá n-úsáid ar líne Ros Láir. Is léir nach bhfuil ár ndóthain á dhéanamh againn ansin ach oiread.</P>
    <P>Tríd is tríd is toradh é an díospóireacht seo ar an stailc a tháinig aniar aduaidh orainn mar phobal inniu. Is toradh é an stailc ar criminal neglect. Níl aon fhocal eile air. Criminal neglect ón Rialtas ó thaobh cúrsaí sóisialta de, daoine atá buailte mar nach bhfuil córas taistil ann, cúrsaí chomhshaoil, mar tá an traein i bhfad níos fearr ná an bóthar ó thaobh córas taistil de.</P>

Ní <Col N="1744" /> maith an sampla é sin do áiteanna eile ach oiread. Is í an tAire atá i gceannas agus tá go leor le déanamh aici fós. Tá súil agam go dtuigeann sí níos fearr ná riamh faoi sin. Iarraim ar an Aire a mholadh dá comhleacaithe, na hAirí eile, dul ar thraenacha, fanacht ar ardáin, a bheith ann nuair atá sé plódaithe. Níl taithí ag Airí ar an ruaille buaille a bhíonn ar ardán stáisiún traenach na Teamhrach.

      <P>Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil leis an Teachta Sargent as ucht deis a thabhairt dom labhairt ar seo. Molaim chomh maith an Leas-Cheann Comhairle a thug cead do na Teachtaí an cheist seo a phlé faoi Ordú Seasta 31.</P>
      <P>I thank Deputy Sargent for the opportunity to speak on this important issue. The decision of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle to allow this debate under Standing Order 31 was very welcome. The fact that the Standing Order 31 facility is far too seldom granted contributes to the irrelevance of this Assembly on occasions when major developing issues of the day cannot be discussed here. The decision of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle stands in sharp contrast to the disgraceful exclusion by the Government, Fine Gael and Labour parties of myself and the Green Party Deputies from participation in today's statements on the Helsinki summit.</P>
      <P>Since the Order of Business, the rail strike has been deferred pending negotiations and that is a welcome development. It will be welcomed especially by the tens of thousands of commuters who were inconvenienced today. I urge everyone concerned to work for an outcome that will address the needs of train drivers and the travelling public. The drivers have a responsible, stressful and at times dangerous job to do, and they deserve full and generous remuneration for their work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I pay tribute to all those working in our public transport system, something that is not often done. Too often bus drivers, train staff and other workers who are the public face of the transport system bear the brunt of justifiable annoyance at the shortcomings of the system. This is grossly unfair because these major problems are not the responsibility of public transport workers. Indeed, it is the workers in the system and their trade unions who have always pointed to the need to invest heavily in public transport, a position that was not always as broadly supported politi<Col N="1745" /> cally as it is now. We witnessed chaos on the railways today, but chaos is never far away on our grossly overcrowded trains and buses. Measures have been signalled in the national development plan for long overdue investment in our rail network, but they do not go far enough. We should be working not just towards upgrading the existing rail network but towards restoring the once extensive network that traversed the country. The destruction of much of that network in the 1950s and early 1960s, though not a phenomenon unique to this country at a time when oil was cheap and plentiful, was one of the biggest mistakes ever made by any Government. This fact has been acknowledged by those of differing opinions in the State over many years.</P>
    <P>The familiar railway map of Ireland, reproduced at the back, interestingly enough, of the national development plan, will on the completion of that plan, if it remains unaltered, still have that huge gap from Derry to Sligo and from Portadown to Carrick-on-Shannon. I represent two of the counties in what I can only describe as that railway desert where not a single line passes through. It was most disappointing that the national development plan did not address this huge gap in our transport infrastructure. I remember well as a young boy making the almost daily train journey from my home town of Monaghan to the village of Glasslough in the north of the county. I have a vivid memory also of a special trip north by train in those early years. Forty years later many Monaghan people &ndash; just to instance that county &ndash; have never experienced the special thrill of rail travel. It has been mooted recently that the line to Kingscourt in County Cavan that currently serves the Gypsum plant there could be examined with a view to reopening it as a passenger service. The idea of developing that line into the further reaches of Cavan and Monaghan, and hopefully north, has great merit.</P>
    <P>In Private Members' time we addressed the need for social partnership. To deliver the public transport requirements of our people we need a real partnership between the travelling public, transport workers, Córas Iompair Éireann and its component companies We must deplore and dispel any notion of privatisation, a cry often raised by those who do not have the real interests of commuters at heart but only the profit that might accrue from the most lucrative routes, while the comprehensive public services are eroded.</P>
    <P>Another factor that contributes to transport chaos is the lack of real decentralisation. I have already made the point and this contribution is but an echo of it. How could we not have such chaos given the concentration of economic activity and population in the greater Dublin area? This matter must be addressed and decentralisation is clearly the answer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not take up my full time allocation because, while I was anxious for this matter to be debated this morning, the steam has gone out of the issue in so far as the strike has <Col N="1746" /> been deferred. Trains will run normally tomorrow and an end to the dispute is in sight, but the heart of the matter is that someone somewhere must show leadership on this issue. We now have a formula within various elements of CIE, Irish Rail and Dublin Bus, which is that change proposed by management can be resisted by industrial action which will cripple commuters and the management will cave in. As someone who has fought as hard as any Member of this House for £2 billion to be spent on public transport, I believe that changes in the interests of efficiency and productivity are inevitable. If we are to have Luas, new routes, feeder buses, orbital buses and so on, there must be a positive attitude to change.</P>
      <P>It is simply unacceptable for 30,000 commuters to be left high and dry in what I consider to be a lightning strike. I am not union bashing because these people are not members of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions. They are beyond the pale of partnership. The situation faced by commuters this morning was totally unjustified and disproportionate to the issues involved.</P>
      <P>There is a solution to this and I hope a lump sum payment is made on a once-off basis. One does not need to be a genius to do that. However, the way in which workers are indifferent to commuters and are, essentially, blackmailing them to get their way must be resisted. Changes have been made by workers in aviation, telecommunications, the civil and public service, local authorities, health boards and the nursing profession. Genuine grievances deserve support in this House. However, we should not encourage resistance to change. We must fight for better pay and conditions for ordinary workers. However, changes based on the development of a better public transport system should be supported. If we undermine the management at every opportunity, they will question the point of trying to develop a new public transport service.</P>
      <P>It will be like the taxi situation. Taxi drivers won all the battles but lost the war because members of the public voted with their feet. The public wants a public service and the customer is king. Luas will not necessarily be run by the same monopolist operators. Competition will be introduced to the bus sector and workers will realise that revenue from consumers pays their wages.</P>
      <P>I have watched very carefully what has happened with the gate keepers on level crossings and DART drivers, for whom compensation has now been agreed, which I welcome. However, it has been agreed on the basis of existing drivers, whose access to training is no longer an issue. That was a very questionable ground for a dispute. I have also watched, with some dismay, the two and a half year stagnation on the Imp bus issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a huge problem with the culture of industrial relations. I do not absolve the management from blame. However, the expenditure of £2 billion must be conditional on an understanding that the culture of industrial relations in CIE and its related companies must change. A politi<Col N="1747" /> cal message must go out that, while there is relief when someone stops being intimidating, short-termism cannot be subscribed to in the long-term. A new culture must be established.</P>
    <P>This is a vital public service and its workers cannot take wild cat action. There must be a cooling off procedure, so that people cannot be stranded and crippled in the way they were this morning. A settlement formula is inevitable. On the one o'clock news today there was a simple interview with a spokesman for the rail drivers, in which Seán O'Rourke exposed the fact that their position was untenable.</P>
    <P>Times have changed. This is for the good of Irish Rail, in that there will be investment. Times must also change in relation to flexibility, demarcation and the other issues. I regret I have to say that. However, unless we are honest about the need to lance this boil, we will be only codding ourselves with sticking plaster solutions which will get usColour RGB 171,0,0 through tomorrow but not the next decade.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell" hpid="Ms O. Mitchell Ms O. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I realise there is an unreality about having statements on a strike that is already over, and for good we hope.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell" hpid="Ms O. Mitchell Ms O. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I realise the word &ldquo;deferred&rdquo; was used. There was an element of the twilight zone about the whole affair because it came to us without warning, apparently out of nowhere. Nobody I know knew anything about it. We heard it was a demarcation dispute yesterday. We then heard it was a rostering dispute, and then that it was about different depots. Nobody seemed to know what it was about. We wondered at one point if CIE or the workers knew what it was about. We did not even know if it was an official strike. There was a sense of unreality about the whole thing. It was rushed into and the proper procedures were not gone through.</P>
      <P>However, what was very real was that 30,000 commuters were left standing on platforms this morning. The public has had enough of strikes and threatened strikes. The transport situation throughout the country is bad enough without having the public's confidence in it undermined by internal disputes and strikes which, as my colleague said, are totally disproportionate to what was at issue &ndash; although we had no idea what was at issue.</P>
      <P>It is unforgivable for their grievances, whatever they were, to be visited on the public which often has to put up with a very bad and second rate service, even when the trains and buses are running. It is unforgivable for that to be visited on the public at this time of the year, with the introduction of further uncertainty into travel plans. People will lose all confidence in a policy which is based on getting people out of their cars and onto public transport if they cannot depend on the public transport system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1748" /> It is completely unforgivable and unacceptable that, while this company has a protected monopoly and its sole purpose is to serve the public, the public are the very last people to be considered in these disputes. There have been strikes, lightning strikes and threatened strikes. This time last year, there was a threatened DART strike and there have been several more since then. The DART drivers refused to allow new drivers to be trained, which was a meaningless argument over nothing that threatened them in any way. The middle doors in the buses cannot be opened because of some industrial relations problems. Agreement cannot be reached to get 40 Imp buses, which are rotting somewhere&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell" hpid="Ms O. Mitchell Ms O. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear that. However, for two years, a major public investment by the taxpayer was rotting because agreement could not be reached. I am not laying blame for this at anybody's door, but it smacks of a company in deep trouble and one in which industrial relations procedures are failing utterly. It is stuck in a 1970s mentality, when every other sector has moved on.</P>
      <P>As my colleague said, workers, management and employers in every sector have had to face change. Even Members of this House must accept change. The world is changing. Every company faces competition and different market and employment conditions. The ability to survive and prosper is based on the ability to accept, face and embrace change. That is the only way CIE can go forward.</P>
      <P>What is wrong with this company? It seems to be almost the only one which cannot face change and put the customer first occasionally. This attitude was understandable in the past because the years of under investment and neglect of that company, for which we all bear some responsibly, has demoralised the workforce.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>The Deputy was not even born at the time. I understand it has demoralised the workforce and management. However, we are now facing major, unprecedented investment in this company and these problems should not still be coming to the fore. If this is an indication of the attitude they are going to take to the public, social partnership and orderly industrial relations procedures, it does not bode well for the future and must give us all pause for thought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not suggesting the Minister should interfere in strikes. Thank goodness the strike is deferred and I hope it will be sorted out. This debate is not about today's strike but the much deeper malaise in CIE which has to be addressed by the Minister. This company needs direction, leadership and investment. Even CIE can see change in the future but much of the problem is <Col N="1749" /> that it does not know what those changes will be &ndash; whether they will entail privatisation, competition or both. The company must be given some certainty to change the ethos of management and workers and relations between the two, so that they have some sense of pride in and ownership of the company and a sense that they want to the deliver the kind of service for which the public is paying. We cannot unconditionally invest large sums of public moneys until these underlying problems are sorted out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. S. Ryan Mr. S. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As a former employee and trade union official in CIE it gives me no joy to speak in this debate on the industrial action taken today by train drivers. This dispute, whether one calls it official or unofficial, should not have happened and it was avoidable. It was unjust to inflict misery on up to 30,000 commuters trying to get to work or to do Christmas shopping. As a result of this strike, commuters from my constituency, from Dundalk, Drogheda, Maynooth and Sligo were left stranded and were obliged to use an insufficient bus service or take their cars on to an already gridlocked road network.</P>
      <P>Disputes such as this provide ammunition to those who wish to restrict the right of important public sector employees to go on strike. As a trade unionist I will always uphold the right of workers to take the ultimate action. However, this right also entails responsibilities on employees and employers in essential public services. It takes two to tango and this dispute should have been resolved before it started.</P>
      <P>I welcome the decision taken this afternoon by the train drivers to defer strike action. This sensible move will allow services to resume in the morning and should enable a real and meaningful dialogue to take place and a resolution to be found, following the intervention of the Labour Relations Commission tomorrow afternoon.</P>
      <P>For a number of years there have been protracted negotiations between Irish Rail management and unions on a viability agreement or, as the trade unions describe it, process talks. The positive aspect is that this national agreement is reaching a conclusion which will be in the long-term interests of the company, its staff and the travelling public. When implemented, this agreement will deal with the contentious issues which have been allowed to fester over the years in the company. I hope it will provide drivers with a five-day week, incorporating Sunday working. Viable contracts in the depots throughout the country will provide working hours varying from a minimum of 43 hours per week to a maximum of 48 hours per week, and an acceptable salary for train drivers. Train drivers have traditionally endured a low basic rate of pay and the only way they could earn a decent living was by working overtime. It is not unusual for them to work up to 60 hours per week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In light of recent progressive developments in employment law, including the working time Act, which will soon apply to the transport sector, <Col N="1750" /> these practises must be reformed. It is undesirable that skilled professional staff such as train drivers should have to work up to 60 hours per week to earn a decent wage. I am pleased that, as part of the national negotiations between management and unions, these important issues have been addressed.</P>

Over the years I have given a specific commitment to public transport and to securing additional financial and structural resources for the improvement of the road and rail networks. It is important that all of the parties in Irish Rail and CIE come together to agree and implement industrial relations procedures because, at the end of the day, the people will not thank us if we are not prepared to provide an efficient and effective public transport service.</P>
      <P>We have heard much of the proposals in the national plan. However, people are still travelling in over-crowded trains and the infrastructure is still not in place. The Minister must ensure that the necessary resources are implemented so that we attract people to public transport services.</P>

      <P>I understood every word said by Deputy Sargent &ndash; my understanding of Irish is perfect but my speaking is not. It was good to listen to the Deputy and to Deputies Yates, Mitchell, Séan Ryan and Caoimhghin Ó Cáolain. I commend Deputy Yates for the clear manner in which he outlined the position. This strike should not have happened. I listened carefully to Barry Kenny of Iarnród Éireann this morning. He is a bright young man and he knows what he has to do and say. However, I thought of people gathering in rural stations, such as the people from Athlone who come up on the commuter train &ndash; young women with children and babies who work in the Civil Service. I thought of the disappointment of the children being brought for a traditional Christmas day out in Dublin. Those speaking about the matter did not seem to understand this. Iarnród Éireann, Bus Éireann and Bus Átha Cliath do not exist in name only, they exist for people to use their services. Taxpayers pay the salaries of those who work on trains and buses. All the speakers said the strike should not have taken place, which is true. I am glad the matter has been referred to the Labour Relations Commission. I hope a successful formula will be worked out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a deeper malaise at the heart of this unofficial strike action &ndash; one party says it is unofficial while another says it is official. The threat of strike action in the week before Christmas, without regard for those who use the <Col N="1751" /> services, is unacceptable. There is now concern that the planned £2.2 billion expenditure will not be matched by a change in work practices which is obviously needed in the three relevant companies. I know many of those who work on bus and train services and they are fine people. One wonders about the madness of some of the actions taken by a minority. I thank all who worked so hard in negotiations, such as the President of SIPTU, Des Geraghty, Noel Dowling and others, who tried to bring some reason to the debate. I also thank Kieran Mulvey and his team at the Labour Relations Commission who do trojan work.</P>
    <P>Questions were asked about how changes can be brought about and the need for competition. The review of the 1932 Act will be completed by the end of February. This will help to chart the way forward. Competition in rail services is not the way forward because no company wants to compete. Our rail track has a different gauge from most European countries. The good routes are cherry-picked and the rest abandoned, and I do not agree with that. There has been massive under-financing by Governments of all hues &ndash; I exempt Deputy Sargent who has not been in Government.</P>
    <P>We serve the public and if we fail to do that we will be booted out of our jobs. Public transport exists to serve the public. Those who work on trains and buses must receive proper wages. As Deputy Seán Ryan said, many of the issues are coming together. I hope the package will be accepted. Everyone had an input and it has encompassed many unresolved matters. It is my wish that we will never have to debate industrial relations in CIE again. I thank the Deputies for their interest in the matter. It was an interesting and powerful debate. We wish the talks well and I hope there will be a speedy resolution to the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important issue for the northside of Dublin. To put the matter in perspective, it is proposed to take 52 acres from Dublin Bay and convert it to real estate for port development. The Minister of State will know the scale of 52 acres. However, to put it in context, it is equivalent to a ground level car park for 32,500 cars, which is a massive amount of land. There have been no pre-application consultations with key groups such as residents' associations and public representatives. This proposal was drafted <Col N="1752" /> without proper consultation with local residents. The Minister of State knows that over the years the residents have objected to developments such as the underground gas caverns which were proposed at one stage and which thankfully did not go ahead.</P>
      <P>As a result of the tight timescale &ndash; only one month was provided for submissions, the advertisement of which many people were not alerted to &ndash; a huge number of people who would like to have made submissions missed the cut-off date. More importantly, many of the submissions were made in a hasty manner without the opportunity to properly research and reply to the issues raised in the environmental impact statement. The port company is not subject to the Freedom of Information Act so technical reports were not accessible to the public. The time which should be given to citizens to research such a modern project was not allowed.</P>
      <P>The legislation governing the decision about a project which will have a huge environmental impact on the bay is ancient and anachronistic. The Foreshore Act does not provide for public hearings, adequate time for third parties to make objections or an appeal mechanism. A project of such scale and with so many implications would not be allowed with such procedure in another state. This legislation dates from a time when the role of citizens was minute and is now inappropriate. I ask the Minister to extend the time allowed for submissions and, even though it is not his statutory obligation, to institute public hearings before he makes a decision. People have a right to express their views in a modern democratic society and to have them heard by technical experts before a Minister makes a decision. Otherwise, a nonsense would be made of long-established planning procedures where one has an opportunity to make objections and there are hearings to ensure a proper decision is reached.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about the thinking behind this proposal. It regards Dublin Bay as an appendage to the port to be absorbed whenever the necessities of the port demand it. People should look on the bay as an amenity. We are unique in Dublin in having a bay such as this. It should be looked on as an amenity which is worth preserving. I put it to the Minister of State that given the pace of growth in Dublin and the congestion created in bringing 50% of the country's trade into the heart of the city, it must be questioned whether it would be better for Dublin Port Company to intensify use of its assets, using them for longer hours and at off-peak times, rather than looking for more land from valuable Dublin Bay resources as it is now trying to do.</P>

      <P>Dublin Port Company has applied for permission under section 10 of the Foreshore Act, 1933, as amended, to have 21 hectares or 52 acres of privately owned foreshore in Dublin Port reclaimed <Col N="1753" /> for port purposes. In addition to the statutory consultees named on page 21 of the Environmental Impact Statement, the company has advised me that it also consulted the Clontarf Yacht and Boat Club prior to the publication of its EIS.</P>
      <P>The publication of the EIS and the commencement of the public consultation process were advertised prominently in the <i>Irish Independent</i> and <i>The Irish Times</i> on 1 October. Copies of the EIS and other associated documents necessary for the public consultation process were made available for public consultation for the statutory period of one month at both the port company's offices and Store Street Garda Station. While I am anxious that any developer seeking a foreshore lease or licence under the Foreshore Acts would enter into the greatest possible consultation prior to completion and publication of an EIS, it is ultimately a decision for the intending developer to make as to who is consulted, in addition to the statutory consultees.</P>
      <P>The House will appreciate that it is impossible to consult every person or group who might have an interest. Were it possible, there would not be any need to enter the public consultation process. However, I am advised that the port company, at the request of Deputy Callely, attended two residents association meetings in Clontarf Castle to discuss the project. The port company has also advised me that, following on publication of the notice in the newspapers on 1 October and, having regard to the relatively small attendance at the exhibition of the public consultation documents in the port offices, public representatives for the area, both at national and local level, known residents associations in the area and other known interested parties, such as An Taisce and Birdwatch Ireland, were written to and invited to attend at the company's offices. The company advises that the response was mixed, with some attending and having fruitful discussions, some sending apologies and some ignoring the invitation. I accept this as evidence that the company has complied with its statutory duty in relation to public consultation. I am informed that Deputy Bruton was not among those who accepted the invitation.</P>
      <P>The House will be aware that the proposed development required an Environmental Impact Statement under section 13A(1) of the Foreshore Act, as inserted by the European Communities (Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations, 1989 (Statutory Instrument No. 349 of 1989) and subsequently amended. I am satisfied that the procedures required under section 19 A, B and C of the 1933 Act have been complied with. The regulations set the prescribed period as being one month from the date of publication in the case of interested persons or bodies who are not prescribed bodies for the purposes of the Act. This prescribed period is binding both on the developer and on interested bodies and individuals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is significant to note that the statutory period was sufficient to allow 428 submissions to be <Col N="1754" /> made to me on to the proposed reclamation. The vast bulk of these were from individual residents or family groups with Clontarf addresses while two were from community action groups &ndash; the Clontarf Residents Association and the East Wall Community Development Council. The submissions were under no less than 14 broad headings. It would appear, therefore, that the statutory one month consultation period proved adequate in this case.</P>

        <b>: </b>I wish to share my time with Deputies Ring and Kenny.</P>
      <P>The announcement yesterday evening by Ryanair that it will pull out of Knock Airport on 11 January is described in newspapers today as a boycott. Let us call it what it is. It is nothing other than sheer blackmail. Ryanair knows it has Knock literally over a barrel. Ryanair accounts for 90% of Knock air traffic business. Michael O'Leary and Ryanair know well that by pulling out of Knock, they will not just cripple Knock Airport, they will close it. Ryanair would like to have Knock Airport understand that they have always done Knock Airport a service or a favour. It was a service or a favour that paid Ryanair rich dividends. When Ryanair was a struggling company, the people of the west rallied and supported it. They paid, and still pay way above the going rate. While Ryanair offered cut price fares of £19.99 from Dublin to UK destinations, passengers to and from Knock paid an additional £120 or £130 to and from the same destinations. People paid this out of a sense of service and loyalty to Knock and Ryanair. Six months ago Ryanair had such an interest in the west coast that it was prepared to guarantee at least 750,000 passengers through Shannon each week provided it got a terminal at Dublin Airport, yet yesterday it pulled out of Knock because of an argument about a mere £6 extra per passenger. It is obvious that Knock is a pawn in a powerplay. I am appalled, but not surprised, by Ryanair's ruthlessness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has a clear responsibility here. Knock is an excellent facility, an international airport run on a shoestring, with staff double jobbing on modest pay. They provide an international airport service for a fraction of Aer Rianta costs. Every penny received from duty free sales was ploughed back into support facilities and services and to reduce handling services. Without duty free sales, there was literally nowhere to go. Last week, the Government found £250 million overnight to defuse the budget controversy. I appeal to the Minister tonight to approve a subvention of £1 million for Knock to ensure that the vision of Monsignor Horan is not extinguished. This is a small price to pay to retain a service that links the remotest corner of rural Ireland with the capital of the United Kingdom in less than one hour. It links fathers working in Kilburn with their families in Kiltimagh and young people working in Glasgow with their fam<Col N="1755" /> ilies in Geesala. There is a social and economic dimension to this.</P>
    <P>We need to look at the structure of boards of management. They leave much to be desired.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Higgins for allowing me to share his time. What has developed at Knock Regional Airport is very serious. Deputy Higgins has pointed the finger in relation to Ryanair and the board itself. I am calling on the Minister tonight to try to help the board out of the financial difficulties in which it finds itself at the moment because of the abolition of duty free sales. The Minister should meet the board as a matter of urgency to see how she can help in solving the difficulties at Knock Airport. The board, together with Ryanair, must take much of the blame for them. Both acted very badly in this matter.</P>
      <P>It would be a major disaster for County Mayo and the west of Ireland if anything happened to this important infrastructure. I say to the Minister, as did Deputy Higgins, that this infrastructure links our emigrants to home. In the past, they supported Knock during a dispute involving the handlers and the carriers. I am glad that was resolved. Again, the pressure was being put on the board and on the general public.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to do whatever she can to support Knock Airport the way she supported Galway, Shannon and the other regional airports throughout the country. We are only looking for fair play. The board of Knock Airport must also get its act together. This is an important infrastructure in the west and we do not want anything to happen to it. We have retained Objective One status and it is important that this infrastructure is retained also.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to join with my colleagues, Deputies Higgins and Ring, and indeed all Deputies from County Mayo, on this matter. The airport manager describes this issue as a question of survival. Knock Airport has a distinct advantage in that it has an international size runway. It lies at the very heart of the Border, midlands and western region, which now has Objective One status. The major objectives of the BMW region, as stated in the national plan, are to increase the potential of the region, to act as a counterbalance to the southern and eastern region, especially Dublin, and to pursue more balanced and diversified growth within the region. I understand Sligo has a subsidy, Galway has a subvention, and Shannon has a £5 million marketing fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I disagree with Michael O'Leary's decision. Knock is being used as a pawn. I am well aware of the ruthlessness of this cut-throat business. He has a duty and, as the manager has pointed out, it is a question of survival, but the Government has a duty to ensure that the infrastructure of this region is developed. As stated in the national plan, and in the words of the Taoiseach when he <Col N="1756" /> opened the Western Development Commission offices in Ballaghaderreen, this area must never again be disadvantaged to the detriment of its people in comparison to other areas.</P>
    <P>The Minister has a responsibility. I would like her to prove me wrong when I say that she does not express sufficient interest in the development of Knock Airport. I would like her to go down to Knock and to give the airport the money Deputy Higgins spoke about, which is chicken feed in comparison to what is being allocated to many other areas of the country. This region has no Cabinet Minister. It has no funding from the Western Development Commission. There is no proposal for an extension of the gas pipeline by Bord Gáis. There is no major road from Letterkenny to Derry through Sligo and on to Galway. This region has no political clout. We have to rely on the Minister in Athlone to do this job for us. I expect, on behalf of the people of Connacht, in whom this airport is kept in trust, she will, on behalf of the Government, make sufficient moneys available to ensure that the survival referred to by the airport manager will be assured and that, at the close of the century, this vital piece of infrastructure will be retained.</P>

      <P>I wish to share my time with the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt. It is unfortunate that I have to comment on this matter this evening. Only two months ago I had to speak on the Adjournment about the decision of Aer Lingus to cease services to Knock Airport. I am very disappointed at the news that Ryanair intends to pull its services from Knock Airport. This is an excellent facility which means much to the people in the west.</P>
      <P>Knock Airport has been in existence for a period of 20 years and over that time it has operated at a small profit, mainly thanks to the operation of duty free. Duty free has now been abolished and, as a result, there is a projected loss to the airport of approximately £600,000 per annum. This must be made up by the board of Knock Airport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Knock Airport is a private company and the shares are held in trust for the people of Connacht. This is an important point because this airport serves the community. Its objective is not to pay dividends to shareholders or to make a profit. All we want is to be able to bring our people to and from the region. We want to generate tourism and offer an opportunity to people to do business in the west, and Knock Airport is an important part of that. Knock Airport has an energetic and committed staff but they have to be <Col N="1757" /> paid, and there is an annual wage Bill of £660,000. I am concerned about the future of those jobs because the staff are so committed and they want to do everything possible to ensure that Knock Airport remains in operation.</P>
    <P>There are only two carriers currently operating in and out of Knock Airport. During its winter schedule Ryanair operates 12 flights per week and 14 in the summer. British Regional Air travels four times a week to the UK, and charter flights operate during the summer. People are well aware of the catastrophic consequences of Ryanair deciding to pull the plug on Knock Airport, which is not justified in light of the fact that Knock Airport believes it must introduce a £6 departure fee per passenger. It is not justified for a number of other reasons. In 1992, when Ryanair operated in and out of Knock Airport, it was paying a landing fee of £7 per passenger. Today it pays £2.50 for the first 60,000 passengers and nothing for passengers in excess of 60,000. This works out at an average rate per passenger of £1.80. One would not get from Swords into the city centre on a bus for that amount of money. Ground handling fees are provided free of charge because the job is done by the staff of the airport.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that Ryanair has used its strength in Knock over the years to negotiate a competitive deal for itself. I appreciate it is a very successful company and its job is to make a profit. Ryanair is a commercial entity. My objective as a representative of the people of Mayo is to keep open a vital facility that is very important to my region. It is unfair that an airline that has done so well out of business generated in and out of Knock Airport over the years is now prepared, when it recognises that the airport provides a community service, to pull the plug. That is very disappointing news.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>It is in the interests of all concerned that the current difficulty between Ryanair and the air<Col N="1758" /> port management is resolved by further negotiation. The west cannot afford to suffer the loss of such a vital aviation service. I call on my colleagues in Government to assist in any way possible to broker an acceptable solution to this problem. As has been stated, there are moneys in the national development plan and I hope they will be utilised to address this issue. Perhaps something could be done in terms of the marketing fund. I ask my colleagues in Government to examine this issue, which has been highlighted by my colleagues from Mayo, in a favourable light.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all the Deputies who contributed to this debate. It is a fine mark of the county's solidarity that all of them are present in the House this evening to contribute to this debate. I welcome that. I welcome also the frankness of Deputy Jim Higgins in particular. Everybody was frank but he was particularly so because everything he said was true. That goes for Deputies Ring, Kenny and Cooper-Flynn and for the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt. They have all spoken trenchantly.</P>
      <P>I want to be equally trenchant. This is blackmail. I am speaking under Dáil privilege but I am telling the accurate facts. I asked my officials today to compile what would be the operating profit for Michael O'Leary on the Knock operation and the conservative estimate is that the company is making about £1.6 million per year for Michael O'Leary. He is doing very well out of Knock Airport. The figures are in my script, but I prefer to speak naturally about this matter because I am as incensed as the Deputies. He has worked aeronautical charges down to the bone and the employees of Knock Airport must in turn work themselves to the bone to operate the airport. He is using Irish airports, the Irish people and the Government as pawns for his own business future. Throughout the summer we saw the game he engaged in, saying he would bring 750,000 passengers to Shannon if we gave him a chunk of Dublin Airport. I do not intend to do business that way and I have made that clear publicly time and again. He was in Shannon Airport twice before. He will stay a short time, then flit again.</P>
      <P>If the flight was not making a profit, we could not condemn anyone, but it is making a handsome profit. The commercial and tourism needs of the people of the region are huge, as are the needs of the diaspora. It is a peripheral area. There was not always the same feeling from all sides of the House towards the airport or the man who set it up, but that is in the past. Everyone now wants to see Knock Airport prosper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The charge Knock Airport wishes to impose is for its own viability and has nothing to do with Michael O'Leary or Ryanair. Given that £5 of the airport taxes charged will not be imposed on a certain number of passengers, the difference will <Col N="1759" /> be £1. I understand from the work of my officials that consumers are not agitated about the charge.</P>
    <P>I understand the reason for this and although I admire enterprise in anyone, I do not like enterprise that is used to bully people, to make them work themselves to the bone when a profit is being made and to escape when the situation does not suit the enterprise. Ryanair uses certain small airports around Europe and Michael O'Leary insists that they cannot impose airport charges. He sees Knock Airport's incursion into that area &ndash; which is to help its viability &ndash; as a chink in the armour and that it will lead other airports to impose the charge also. He sees this as a break in the stranglehold he has on these airports, though he is giving a good service from these airports. However, I am extremely angry at the way he is using a people, a region and an airport.</P>
    <P>He will go, as he has laid that out quite clearly, so there is a need to attract a good quality, low cost airline that will give a similar service to the service Ryanair has provided. That must now be the aim and though I cannot get involved, I have asked others to help attract another airline to the region. There will not be any certainty with Ryanair, even if it says it will remain for six or nine months. Knock Airport must have a regular air service. It has brought vibrancy to the area and many people use the airport. I am from Athlone, but I am from the western side of the town; I am a Connacht woman. There is no exclusivity about this issue.</P>
    <P>As I said on the radio, this is a disgraceful act and I echo Deputy Higgins' contribution. A company making good money from a route is capriciously saying that that is the end and it is pulling out. Knock Airport got £1 million in capital development funds last year and I will meet its board again to discuss this. This has been a healthy debate. It is about time people decided there is a decent, fair way to treat people. We are not talking about an uneconomic route &ndash; money is being made on this route. People are not stupid; they can see through the strategies. The people of the west do not deserve to be treated by this airline in this intemperate way.</P>

      <P>Last night in Dublin the temperature fell to below freezing. The approximately 200 or so homeless people who found themselves on the streets were forced to curl up on sheets of cardboard in doorways. Only a few thin blankets lay between them and the freezing air. Among those sleeping rough was a ten year old boy who, because his mother is dead and his father is an alcoholic, has been living on the streets for the past year according to <i>The Irish Times</i> today. Is <Col N="1760" /> this a symbol of our Celtic tiger economy? Young families are sleeping in bed and breakfast accommodation and are forced to roam the streets every day. Hostels for the homeless are full to capacity and even those who want to stay in a hostel are being turned down on a nightly basis because of overcrowding. Meanwhile, on a weekly basis, the number of people sleeping on the streets of Dublin is rocketing.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that approximately 4,000 adults and almost 1,000 children are now homeless in the Dublin, Kildare and Wicklow regions. If this pattern is reflected nationwide, we can estimate that more than 10,000 people are without a roof over their heads in our land of plenty. This is an embarrassing and shameful statistic. The Minister for State has admitted that the rate of homelessness has doubled in the past three years. There is no doubt that this increase is a further manifestation of the half-hearted housing policy which this Government is presiding over, although I acknowledge that homelessness has wider roots than the housing issue.</P>
      <P>Surely the Minister of State and his Government cannot stand over an economy which deprives so many people of the basic right of a roof over their heads? Can the Government stand over the advice a young woman who appeared on &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; last night said she was given? She said she was advised to have a baby so that she and her partner could qualify for a flat. As we approach Christmas and the celebrations to mark the new millennium, it is worth giving some consideration to what is being done to ensure that people without a home are given the supports and services they deserve.</P>
      <P>The Government's sub-committee on the millennium has been the target of much criticism, but my single most significant criticism of it is that its plans are void of any significant projects to tackle our homelessness problem. Babies born on New Year's Day and their parents will be adorned with gifts from the Government; every household in the country will receive a special edition candle and millions of pounds will be spent on fireworks and festivities. At the same time as all this silliness pervades, there will be 10,000 homeless people on our streets, approximately 2,000 of whom will be children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Who wants to celebrate the millennium when more than 10,000 of their fellow citizens are curled up in doorways and on street corners? We would all live without a candle if we could be assured that every homeless person was given a roof over his head at the turn of the millennium. The call by Focus Ireland to invest £195 million over the next five years to deal with growing homelessness is the correct one. We are now in a position to make this investment, but it appears that the political will is not there to allow it to happen. What is required is a national strategy on homelessness which would ensure that people are <Col N="1761" /> not let fall though the system. The disgrace of children, young adults in need of drug rehabilitation and older people sleeping on our streets cannot be allowed to continue. I appreciate that the Eastern Health Board last week launched its strategy on homelessness, but the scope of the problem goes beyond their plans. There is a need for more than just accommodation. Counselling services, rehabilitation services for addicts and alcoholics and guidance with a career path are all elements of a national strategy that could make a meaningful dent in our homeless population.</P>
    <P>The most immediate requirement, particularly at this very cold time of the year, is to ensure that people are taken in off the streets. I appeal to the Government to take whatever steps are necessary, including the requisitioning of buildings, to ensure that as we enter the festive season, the turn of the millennium, and celebrate the life of a family who was homeless 2000 years ago, nobody has to sleep rough in the cold weather at this time of the year and that a roof and safe bed of some kind are provided for every citizen in the State over the coming season.</P>

      <P>The local authorities in the Dublin area, which includes Dublin Corporation and Fingal, Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown and South Dublin County Councils, are responsible for the provision of accommodation for homeless people in their areas. Apart from their housing programmes, the local authorities have wide powers under the Housing Act, 1988, to provide or fund the provision of emergency accommodation for homeless people.</P>
      <P>In the Dublin area the Eastern Health Board arranges emergency accommodation on behalf of the Dublin local authorities for homeless people. The cost is met by the Dublin local authorities and the Department of the Environment and Local Government recoups 90% of the local authorities' expenditure involved. In addition, Dublin Corporation provides funding to voluntary bodies towards the running cost of the accommodation and settlement and hostel based care and support services provided and operated by them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last week Dublin Corporation together with the Eastern Health Board launched their joint programme for the homeless in the Dublin area. The following initiatives were announced. Additional accommodation facilities have been sourced and brought on-stream. More accommodation has been identified and will be brought on-stream as quickly as possible. The focus is on the provision of sheltered accommodation for homeless persons who are long-term residents of hostels, which are primarily intended to be available as emergency accommodation. Individual agency services have <Col N="1762" /> been amalgamated in one central facility based at Parkgate Hall, Conyngham Road, which will be completed by the end of 2000. The Dublin Corporation homeless policy unit, the Eastern Health Board homeless persons services and personnel from the Homeless Initiative will be located there. Special outreach and resettlement services are being developed, which will work with the voluntary agencies and target people who are living and sleeping rough on the streets. It is intended this service will commence in January 2000.</P>
    <P>In addition, the resettlement officers will work with residents of hostels and bed and breakfast accommodation with the aim of moving them to more long-term and appropriate facilities. Co-ordinated services, including welfare, medical and other support resources, are being developed by the Eastern Health Board. These services will be co-ordinated by a dedicated service co-ordinator in each community care area, commencing with the north and south inner city in January 2000. The Homeless Initiative has developed a programme to improve and develop the quality and practice of services to the homeless.</P>
    <P>The contribution by the other local authorities in the Dublin area towards the provision of services to homeless people is increasing each year. The Homeless Initiative has facilitated the establishment of working groups to identify local needs and appropriate responses to these needs. Each of the groups will develop an action plan to tackle the problem of homelessness in their own areas. The Eastern Health Board has appointed a general manager with specific responsibility for homelessness. Dublin Corporation will appoint a senior official to head up services for the homeless from early in the new year. Both individuals will work closely together and will be based eventually at Parkgate Hall.</P>
    <P>Homelessness can be a complex social problem and addiction can sometimes play a large part in people becoming homeless. The provision of accommodation will not suffice on its own. Accompanying support services will also be required. For this reason, an extra allocation of £5 million over the next two years was included in the recent budget for the provision of two high support hostels in Dublin for homeless people suffering from drug and alcohol addictions. This funding will be available to Dublin Corporation to build or acquire and redevelop suitable premises for this purpose and is additional to the funding provided for their existing programmes.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that a structured and co-ordinated approach is being taken by Dublin Corporation, the Eastern Health Board is addressing all aspects relating to homelessness and there is general acceptance that the provision of accommodation is not the only requirement. There is an increasing level of closer working with the volun<Col N="1763" /> tary bodies providing services for the homeless. Homelessness is a priority matter that is being addressed and I am confident we will make substantial progress in delivering the appropriate responses.</P>

      <Quest>the action, if any, he will take to ensure no delay occurs between the time when a woman is diagnosed as having cancer and the commencement of appropriate treatment in view of the results of the caring about women and cancer survey; and the steps, if any, he will take to ensure the cytology services are properly resourced.</Quest>
      <QRef>[26673/99]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <P>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen): The Caring About Women and Cancer report, to which the Deputy refers, is the result of a trans-European investigation undertaken by a pan-European programme surveying approximately 15,000 women with cancer. Among the key findings of the survey are that: there was a high satisfaction rating with medical professionals during all stages of treatment, from pre-diagnosis to aftercare, but some women felt that there should be greater communication between the hospital and the general practitioner; very few women surveyed carried out pre-screening despite a high level of awareness among women that early detection offered the best possibility of a good outcome; patients wanted to know more about the anticipated side effects of their treatment, particularly with chemotherapy; and women also expressed an interest in having more time with their general practitioner.</P>
    <P>The report contained a number of recommendations including the need to raise public awareness of cancer; the need for a high level of participation in screening programmes; the need for women to take responsibility for their own health; the need for appropriate treatment as soon as possible following diagnosis; and the need for adequate communication between patients and medical staff regarding treatment.</P>
    <P>Under the national cancer strategy we had already been addressing a range of these issues prior to the publication of the report referred to by the Deputy. Considerable resources have been allocated to improving the cancer services available in this country, from diagnosis through to palliative care services. Some £26 million was allocated under the national cancer strategy between 1997 and 1999, and I have allocated a further £11.464 million under this heading for services in 2000.</P>
    <P>The national breast screening programme, the first phase of which is now beginning, will offer a high quality screening service to women in the 50 to 64 age group. Breast Check is endeavouring to ensure that a high participation in the screening programme is achieved.</P>
    <P>The National Cancer Forum, which advises me on matters relating to the development of the cancer services, held a cancer information work<Col N="1766" /> shop during the year, and is currently examining ways in which to address the issue of making all relevant information on cancer prevention, treatment and services available to both the public and medical personnel. The forum, in consultation with the Women's Health Council and Breast Check, is also reviewing the symptomatic breast cancer services currently available, so that these will complement the national breast screening programme. I am expecting a report from the forum on this matter very shortly. Any recommendations that arise from this report will be examined and the necessary developments initiated as part of the national cancer strategy.</P>
    <P>Cancer liaison nurses have been employed by the Eastern Health Board, funded by the national cancer strategy, to aid co-ordination of services for patients and improve communication between medical personnel, general practitioners and cancer patients.</P>
    <P>Considerable dedicated funding has been allocated to histopathology and cytology services in the past three years. Under the national cancer strategy I have allocated some £1.5 million for the provision of additional consultant histopathologists and additional cytoscreeners. Preparations for phase one of the national cervical screening programme are progressing well and it is anticipated that it will commence screening in the early part of 2000.</P>
    <P>It is pleasing to note from the Caring About Women and Cancer report, that once women do present for treatment, the vast majority of women are very happy with the services provided. I am confident that the improvements to date under the national cancer strategy will further enhance the services and achieve the ultimate goal of reducing the number of deaths from cancer.</P>

      <P>Infertility treatments such as IVF are not governed by specific health legislation but medical practice in this area operates under guidelines issued by the Medical Council. These treatments are not part of the publicly funded health service. Persons who avail of the service do so in a private capacity. They are eligible for tax relief on medical expenses and assistance with the cost of drugs under the drug refund scheme. While there are no statistics on the extent of infertility, it is esti<Col N="1767" /> mated that some 10% of couples are affected. Accordingly it is not possible to assess trends in the levels of infertility. The principal causes of infertility include general systemic disease, chronic diseases such as endocrine disease, pelvic inflammatory infection, abnormalities of the anatomical structure, congenital abnormalities in the reproductive system, trauma, neurological disease, psychological disturbance and occasionally the side effects of treatment such as cancer treatment.</P>
      <P>The area of assisted human reproduction raises a wide range of sensitive and complex issues with associated complex legal, ethical, social and medical implications. I am concerned to ensure that these issues are addressed in a comprehensive manner. It is my intention to bring forward proposals to Government in January to begin to address this very complex area.</P>

      <Quest>the measures, if any, he will undertake to reduce the numbers of suicides taking place each year in view of the fact suicide rates have almost doubled since 1990 and Ireland has the highest attempted suicide rate in Europe.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Suicide has become a serious social problem in this country. This trend is not confined to Ireland but is a growing global problem. Suicide is now the most common cause of death among 15 to 24 year olds. Apart from the increase in the overall rate of suicide, a disturbing feature is the significant rise in the male suicide rate which accounted for 421 of the 504 suicide deaths in 1998. These are worrying trends which require further research so that better strategies are developed to help people who are particularly at risk.</P>
      <P>Since the publication of the final report of the National Task Force on Suicide in 1998, a national suicide prevention/reduction strategy has commenced with a partnership approach being adopted between health boards and non-statutory services. Central to the strategy, in so far as the health services are concerned, has been the establishment of a suicide research group by the health boards to conduct research and advise health boards on measures to prevent and reduce suicide and attempted suicide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All health boards have appointed resource officers and have established multi-sectoral and multi-disciplinary working groups to examine the implementation of the recommendations of the task force report. They are engaged in a range of activities including the promotion of positive mental health and the de-stigmatisation of suicide, provision of information in relation to suicide and parasuicide, liaison with the media and provision of training for staff in relation to suicide and parasuicide. The process of consultation with <Col N="1768" /> statutory and voluntary groups regarding the issue of suicide has also commenced.</P>
    <P>An additional £1 million announced in the budget is being allocated to suicide prevention programmes in the health boards next year and to research aimed at improving our understanding of this disturbing social problem. Priority is being given to the further development of mental health services for groups at risk of suicide, in particular young males and the elderly. Health boards are examining ways in which mental health services can be made more accessible to such groups and the provision of crisis intervention services is being examined by a number of boards.</P>
    <P>Having national information on the groups at highest risk of suicide can contribute hugely to a suicide prevention strategy. Parasuicide consists of any nonfatal act initiated deliberately by an individual in the knowledge that it may cause harm or death. International studies have found parasuicide to be one of the most significant risk factors associated with suicide &ndash; those who engage in parasuicide are 20 times more likely to eventually kill themselves. A sum of £200,000 is being provided this year for the establishment, by the national suicide research foundation in Cork, of a national parasuicide register.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Rotunda Hospital's 1998 annual report identifies an increase in the number of pregnant women with the hepatitis C virus, HCV, presenting to the hospital since 1994, with a marked increase for the period 1997 to 1998. This coincides with a heightened awareness by the hospital of the increasing prevalence of hepatitis C amongst pregnant women.</P>
      <P>Women with identified risk factors for HCV or a history of jaundice are screened selectively at the Rotunda Hospital. The report indicates that a total of 128 infants at risk of HCV were born to 122 mothers in the Rotunda Hospital from 1994 to 1998. The Rotunda Hospital accounts for 64% of all such referrals in the Dublin area, 85% of whom acquired HCV through IV drug use. The health promotion unit in my Department implements a wide range of initiatives aimed at creating a greater awareness of the problems of drug misuse and preventing young people from turning to drug misuse in the first instance. It has worked closely with the Department of Education and Science on the development and dissemination of a substance abuse prevention programme in schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1769" /> A number of studies both in the Eastern Health Board drugs services and in prison have shown that between 70% and 80% of opiate addicts are hepatitis C positive. The health board has developed a broad range of drug prevention and treatment services. These services are provided at 53 locations throughout the health board area. Special attention is paid to pregnant women who test positive for hepatitis C. The board will continue to enhance and expand these services.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Eastern Health Board has appointed two liaison midwives and is in the process of appointing a third to work with pregnant drug misusing women attending maternity hospitals in Dublin. The liaison midwife acts as a link between the obstetric and the drug treatment services to ensure that drug misusing women receive a comprehensive service and that good communication exists between both teams. The liaison midwife is also involved in prevention and education work with the women and also assists the women in attending gynaecological clinics for follow up with family planning post delivery and works closely with social services around child care issues in the early post-natal period.</P>
    <P>In line with other European countries, Ireland is experiencing an increase in the numbers of hepatitis C infected women. The full impact of this on child health has not been determined. Further collaborative studies are ongoing to assess factors contributing to vertical transmission of hepatitis C and evaluate the role of interventions to its prevention. I assure the Deputy that my Department is closely monitoring and evaluating all such developments in this area.</P>

Within the three months allowed the matter will be considered again by the Labour and Social Affairs Council. I should point out to the Deputy that the parliament has also proposed amendments to sections of the draft directive dealing with fishermen and transport workers. I obviously cannot indicate at this point what position my colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment will be taking on the overall directive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I have indicated previously in the House that Ireland is committed to the introduction of a 48 hour week for non-consultant hospital doctors as quickly as possible provided this does <Col N="1770" /> not adversely affect patient care or the career prospects of young doctors. The Forum on Medical Manpower is close to completing the first phase of its deliberations and it has considered all of its recommendations on the assumption that working hours will be reduced to those proposed in the draft directive. In addition health service management and the Irish Medical Organisation have commissioned a joint study of existing working hours as a first step in a plan to reduce working hours. Tenders have been received from a number of consultancy firms to carry out this study. I expect one of those firms to be appointed shortly and the study to commence in early 2000. It is to be completed by mid-2000. An implementation strategy will then be put in place to progressively reduce working hours.</P>

      <P>
        <Col N="1771" /> The Medical Council is the autonomous statutory body which has the responsibility for overseeing the behaviour and conduct of registered medical practitioners. One of the ways in which the council discharges this function is through the regular publication of a set of ethical guidelines for the advice of members of the profession and the general public. Breaches of the guidelines are a matter for the council to investigate and, if appropriate, to take appropriate disciplinary action against the doctor concerned.</P>
      <P>Ireland is fortunate in having a well developed and highly regarded general practitioner service. Considerable effort has been invested in educating the public on making best use of their general practitioner. It is obviously important that the most effective use is made by patients and GPs of access to the specialised services provided by consultants. It is clearly not in the interest of GPs or consultants that patients should be able to refer themselves directly to consultant level services. I am not aware that this is a problem and I would be concerned if any patient were able to gain priority access to consultants on the basis of self referral.</P>

      <P>Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board. Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer are unable, without undue hardship, to provide <Col N="1772" /> general practitioner, medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants.</P>
      <P>Income guidelines have been drawn up by the chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these guidelines are revised annually in line with the consumer price index. However, the guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that his or her medical needs would justify this. Medical cards may also be awarded to individual family members on this basis.</P>
      <P>It is important to note that entitlement to a medical card is based on hardship rather than on any specification that a particular percentage of the population should have a card. The decrease in the percentage of the population with a card is a reflection of a general improvement in the economy in recent years.</P>

      <P>Since 1997, my Department has been working with health agencies to ensure year 2000 compliance in the health service. My Department has undertaken an overall role of co-ordinating, assisting, facilitating the sharing of information and monitoring progress. Each health agency has its own year 2000 programme in place and these are now drawing to a close. Overall, the health service year 2000 programme has represented a major national initiative. To date, I have authorised expenditure amounting to approximately £25 million for the repair or replacement of non-compliant systems and equipment. This remediation process has now been completed, except for a small number of outstanding issues. I am satisfied that these issues will be resolved in time and, in any event, that they do not pose a threat to patient safety.</P>
      <P>Best practices in this field also demands the development of contingency plans as an added guarantee. Accordingly, health agencies are in the process of finalising and testing comprehensive contingency plans which will be put into effect in the event of problems arising.</P>
      <P>In summary, my objectives are to ensure that there is no risk to the health and safety of health service clients and staff and that there is minimal disruption to normal services arising from the Y2K bug. I am confident that these objectives will be achieved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the concerns of the Deputy in relation to the issues raised in the report of the inspector of mental hospitals for 1998. I acknowledge the crucial role that the inspector plays in providing an independent and detailed analysis of our mental health services. Many of the points raised by the inspector relate to clinical and administrative issues associated with the provision of care and I would expect them to be addressed by the relevant professional and management staff in the health boards and hospitals concerned. In so far as the inspector has identified the need for improvements in facilities and staffing levels, it is my intention to make additional resources available to the health boards and hospitals. I have allocated an additional £12.2 million for improvements in mental health services in the year 2000, an increase of over 100% on the additional funding provided in 1999, and much of this will be devoted to tackling the deficiencies identified by the Inspector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The lack of multidisciplinary teams in many areas of the mental health services has been highlighted by the inspector of mental hospitals in his report. A total of £2.9 million has been allocated in 2000 towards the further development of community based mental health services, including the improvement of psychology and social work services. I acknowledge that much still needs to be done in the provision of comprehensive facilities and services. It is my intention to assist health <Col N="1774" /> boards to provide community-based services, as an alternative to care in large institutions, in line with the widely accepted policy for the mental health services outlined in Planning for the Future through the provision of development funding, both capital and revenue, next year and in future years.</P>
    <P>In his report, the inspector of mental hospitals referred to the fact that some patients in psychiatric hospitals have been in institutional care for many years and recommended the establishment of dedicated teams to develop rehabilitation programmes to facilitate their transfer to more appropriate care in the community. I have allocated £250,000 to the Western Health Board to fund such a specialist-led team which will commence a rehabilitation programme for long stay patients in St. Brigid's Hospital, Ballinasloe. If this pilot project is successful, a similar approach will be considered for other hospitals.</P>
    <P>An additional £1.1million is being allocated to further developments in child and adolescent psychiatry services. This funding will provide for the appointment of additional consultants in child and adolescent psychiatry and for the development of multidisciplinary teams to focus on specific areas, such as attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, ADD.</P>
    <P>The increase in the number of people living to advanced old age requires the development of specialist mental health services to meet their specific needs. Old age psychiatry services have been expanding in recent years and an additional £1 million is being allocated in 2000 to further this development.</P>
    <P>The provision of acute psychiatric units attached to, or associated with, general hospitals to replace services previously provided in psychiatric hospitals is continuing throughout the country. Seventeen acute psychiatric units are now linked to general hospitals and a number of units are currently at various stages of development including the Mercy Hospital, Cork; Beaumont Hospital, Dublin; James Connolly Memorial Hospital, Dublin; St. Vincent's Hospital, Elm Park; Portiuncula Hospital, Ballinasloe; Castlebar General Hospital; Ennis General Hospital; St Luke's Hospital, Kilkenny; Nenagh General Hospital; Portlaoise General Hospital and Sligo General Hospital. A further four acute psychiatric units are under consideration as part of the national development plan.</P>
    <P>A sum of £1.35 million is being provided to facilitate substantial improvements in the forensic psychiatry services in Dublin, Cork and Limerick. These funds will enable the appointment of four additional consultant forensic psychiatrists and associated support staff &ndash; two teams to be based in Dublin and one each in Cork and Limerick. These teams will liaise with the Director of Prison Medical Services and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform regarding the provision of appropriate psychiatric services in our prisons.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1775" /> In addition, £1 million has been allocated towards suicide prevention programmes and £2.5 million has been provided towards the costs associated with the implementation of the new Mental Health Bill which I circulated yesterday.</P>
    <P>These initiatives clearly demonstrate my commitment to bringing about real improvements in the mental health services and in tackling service shortcomings identified by the inspector.</P>

Under the Infectious Disease Regulations, 1981, health boards are empowered, where there is reason to believe that a possible source of infection exists, to carry out an investigation and to take such steps as are necessary or desirable for investigating the nature and source of such infection, for preventing the spread of infection and for removing conditions favourable to such infection.</P>
      <P>My Department is preparing a guide to good practice for tattooing and body piercing. It will deal primarily with prevention of the spread of infection and will be of assistance both to health boards and to those operating tattooing or body piercing services. An information leaflet for the public is also being prepared. It is hoped to complete work on these documents in 2000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>This question covers a number of related but sep<Col N="1776" /> arate matters. There will be a significant development of general practitioner services under the national development plan commencing next year. The exact level of allocation that will fall specifically to general practice development is currently being finalised in my Department in the context of a number of particular projects and strategic goals.</P>
      <P>The Government position on private health insurance can be found in the recently published White Paper which contains a section on primary care insurance, Paragraphs 5.36 to 5.45. The White Paper states that the Government considers that the further evolution of private health insurance should include steps to promote the position of primary care in the system and have regard to the particular role that general practitioners are positioned to play in maintaining and improving the health awareness and status of the public. Legislation is currently being prepared in my Department to give effect to the White Paper's conclusions and recommendations and such legislation will, it is scheduled, be introduced next year.</P>
      <P>In March of this year, an agreement was reached with the Irish Medical Organisation, in the context of extending medical card eligibility for the over 70s, on the issue of so-called excluded doctors, that is, doctors who did not have a GMS scheme contract. That agreement provided for a one-off scheme of entry to the GMS scheme for doctors in practice on 1 March having the requisite qualifications and required experience on that day or subsequently. Those arrangements are now operating and I have no plans for further action in this area.</P>
      <P>The matter of tax is one for my colleague, the Minister for Finance, but my Department and the health boards have provided, and continue to provide, funding for general practice development through the GP capital fund and the GP development fund. The indicative drugs target savings scheme provides an additional source of finance for general practice developments. General practitioners already have considerable access to hospital diagnostic services. In each health board area, the question of further developing access is kept under ongoing review and I am satisfied that this is the best way to proceed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been a number of developments in the provision of general practitioner services aimed at reducing utilisation of hospital accident and emergency services. Health boards have sought to develop effective GP rota systems so that patients can easily contact a GP for their needs outside of normal surgery hours. Some health boards have now gone beyond the rota systems by encouraging the development of specific out of hours GP co-operatives which are managed and operated by local GPs to serve patient needs on a virtual 24 hour basis. CAREDOC in the Kilkenny/Carlow area is such an example and the North Eastern Health Board is launching a board wide pilot project next year along similar <Col N="1777" /> lines. Both CAREDOC and the NEHB initiative are being monitored and will be reviewed to see whether they can be extended, over time, to the rest of the country. In other cases throughout the country there are already GP or primary care operated facilities located in hospital complexes, for example, DUBDOC in Dublin which operates from St. James' Hospital. Such hospital based arrangements, like the rotas and co-operatives, are monitored to establish how well they meet patient needs and reduce dependency on other health services.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that there should always be the most effective use of healthcare resources and I see the general practitioner continuing to play a central role in healthcare delivery in the context of an integrated healthcare sector where appropriate linkages are fully developed between primary care providers and other health service providers. I see this being done in partnership with general practitioners.</P>

The main objectives of the guidelines which were published in late September 1999 are: to improve the identification, reporting, assessment, treatment and management of child abuse; to clarify the responsibilities of various professionals and individuals within organisations; and to enhance communication and co-ordination of information between disciplines and organisations.</P>
      <P>Implementation of the guidelines and the associated recommendations will require additional investment over a number of years.

Next year an additional £30 million approximately in revenue funding will be provided for these services. This includes £3.25 million specifically earmarked to strengthen child protection services and training for personnel whose role involves direct contact with children and families. These developments follow the publication of important new national guidelines, Children First &ndash; National Guidelines for the Protection and Welfare of Children, in September of this year. The guidelines are designed to support and guide health professionals, teachers, and members of the Garda Síochána and the many people in sporting, cultural, community and voluntary organisations who come into regular contact with children.</P>
      <P>The objectives of the national guidelines are: to improve the identification, reporting, assessment, treatment and management of child abuse; to clarify the responsibilities of various professionals and individuals within organisations; and to enhance communication and co-ordination of information between disciplines and organisations.</P>
      <P>In addition, there are a wide range of other family support and child care services which are being further developed in order to strengthen preventative services. These include the launch of the springboard initiative, the teenage parenting programme, the provision of additional family resource centres, family support workers, community child care workers, neighbourhood youth projects and parenting skills programmes.</P>
      <P>The Government has also decided to prepare a national children's strategy which will map out a direction for the next ten years through a set of realisable goals which will address all aspects of services for children and young persons. Last month I invited submissions to the interdepartmental group responsible for developing the strategy and it is anticipated that it will be published early next year.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 35 and 137 together.</P>
      <P>As part of the process of ensuring that best practices are adhered to in the treatment and care of people with mental illness, the Inspector of Mental Hospitals prepared a document entitled Guidelines on Good Practice and Quality Assurance in the Psychiatric Services. This document set down a series of desirable and achievable standards of care, both in relation to the physical structures in which care is delivered and the clinical and other issues associated with the provision of care. This publication has been circulated to all mental health professionals and administrators in the country. The Inspector of Mental Hospitals is currently paying particular attention, when carrying out his inspections, to the extent to which the practices recommended in the guidelines are adhered to.</P>
      <P>It is imperative that the highest possible standards of clinical practice will prevail throughout the mental health services and I will be exploring mechanisms by which this can be achieved so that my Department and the professional bodies can work together in this regard. It is my intention that, on the enactment of the Mental Health Bill, 1999, a code of practice will be drawn up by the inspector and my Department to accompany the legislation and to further advance the implementation of the standards set out in the guidelines. In all of this, my Department will work closely with local service providers for the achievement of a quality mental health service for all.</P>
      <P>In this context, the new Mental Health Bill, published yesterday, includes a requirement that, where an involuntary patient has been on medication continuously for more than three months, the medication cannot be continued except with the patient's consent. Where the patient cannot give such consent, the medication must be approved by two consultant psychiatrists. Under the provisions of the Bill, this procedure must be followed every three months while medication is continued.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 36, 141 and 175 together.</P>
      <P>I have had inquiries made of the chief executive officer at the Mater Misericordiae Hospital and I have been assured, contrary to media reports, that the hospital remains committed to the commencement of the heart and lung transplant programme in April 2001.</P>
      <P>This new service will be delivered, in the long-term, in the new theatre-intensive care unit complex which will form part of the recently approved development programme for the hospital. It is proposed that the new facility will include a dedicated unit for the delivery of cardiothoracic surgery, including the heart and lung transplant programme. Pending the completion of the overall hospital development project, an interim solution is proposed by the hospital for the programme which will include the provision of theatre and associated facilities. I have also been assured by the Mater Hospital authorities that, in both the interim and permanent solution, they are dedicated to the provision of a high quality service in this sub-specialty.</P>
      <P>I have consistently emphasised that the provision of a suitable physical infrastructure for the programme is but one element to be considered in the development of a high quality service. It is also essential to ensure that the appropriate training and education of Irish staff be provided to facilitate the development of an Irish based programme. In this regard, a consultative group comprising key surgical, medical and management personnel from the Mater, St. Vincent's and Beaumont Hospitals together with officials from my Department was formed to oversee the implementation of the Government's commitment to establish an Irish based heart and lung transplant unit. The group has already devoted considerable time and effort to ensure that the programme is established consistent with the highest international standards in this field of organ transplantation. I assure the Deputies that I remain committed to the establishment of a quality programme, in line with best practice.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 37, 51, 52 and 135 together.</P>
      <P>Let me say at the outset how pleased I was to take part in the historic inaugural meeting of the North South Ministerial Council on Monday, 13 December. The meeting also afforded me the opportunity to meet my counterpart, Minister Bairbre de Brún, and I look forward to my next meeting with her early in the new year in the context of the council meeting in health sectoral format.</P>
      <P>There has been substantial co-operation over many years between the respective health authorities, North and South. Meetings at ministerial level have been taking place since the early 1980s and these, together with meetings at official levels, have afforded the opportunity to exchange information on issues of mutual interest and to discuss policy developments in our respective administrations.</P>
      <P>Significant recent policy initiatives have included not only the establishment of the Institute of Public Health and a joint waste management board, but also the development of cancer strategies in both administrations; the furthering of health research, particularly cancer research; and the development in Ireland of a Social Services Inspectorate with considerable input and assistance from our colleagues in Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A mechanism already exists for collaboration between the Western and Southern Health and <Col N="1783" /> Social Services Boards in Northern Ireland and the North Western and North Eastern Health Boards in Ireland known as Co-operation and Working Together &ndash; CAWT. CAWT's aim is to improve the health and social well being of their resident populations. Towards achieving this aim, CAWT has explored and identified opportunities for the planning and provision of services. It is intended that this solid basis for cross-Border co-operation will continue under the new administrative arrangements.</P>
    <P>The Good Friday Agreement provides for an implementation body in relation to Food Safety to be known as the Food Safety Promotion Board. The membership and the interim management arrangements of the Food Safety Promotion Board were agreed at the inaugural North-South Ministerial meeting on Monday, 13 December 1999. It is appropriate that food safety, which has become of such concern to consumers North and South in recent years, should be the focus of a North-South Implementation Body. Food safety issues, and food-borne illness, do not recognise political borders and many of the issues in food safety are common to both jurisdictions. The board will not only contribute to public health and consumer confidence, but will also serve the economic development of the Irish food sector on an all-island basis.</P>
    <P>The Food Safety Promotion Board will provide independent assessment, based on independent scientific advice, of the safety and hygiene of food produced, distributed or marketed in the island of Ireland. The board will draw on the pool of scientific advice and expertise already available North and South. The respective food safety enforcement agencies, North and South, will continue to be responsible for inspection and enforcement in their own jurisdictions and the board will establish and maintain links with these agencies.</P>
    <P>In accordance with paragraphs 8 and 9(i) of Strand Two of the Good Friday Agreement, the health area is one of the areas agreed for co-operation through the mechanism of existing bodies in each separate jurisdiction. A number of health areas have already been identified for priority examination by the North-South Ministerial Council meeting in health sectoral format. These are accident and emergency planning; co-operation on high technology equipment; cancer research; and health promotion. It will be open to the North-South Ministerial Council, by agreement of both sides, to pursue other matters in due course.</P>

      <P>Drug misuse in Ireland takes two forms, opiate abuse which is confined mainly to the greater Dublin area and the misuse of other drugs such as cannabis, ecstasy, amphetamines, tranquillisers, LSD, inhalants-solvents and magic mushrooms which is a nationwide phenomenon. Due to the illicit nature of drug misuse, it is difficult to get a clear estimate of the extent of the problem.</P>
      <P>There is no hard data available but various estimates have been made on the number of misusers in the country. Estimates of the numbers using opiates in the greater Dublin area range from around 8,500 to 13,500.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware the provision of detoxification facilities for drug misusers in the Dublin area is a matter for the Eastern Health Board in the first instance. I understand from the board that there is currently a 17 bed in-patient stabilisation unit at Cuan Dara in Cherry Orchard Hospital. There is also a 10 bed detoxification unit at Beaumont Hospital. In addition, the Eastern Health Board provides resources for a post-detoxification unit operated by the Merchants Quay Project in High Park, Drumcondra. It also provides funding for a post detoxification rehabilitation unit at Cuan Mhuire in Athy.</P>
      <P>The board is continuing to expand its drugs services including the number of detoxification beds available to drug misusers and will shortly open a 20 bed downstream detoxification unit in St. Mary's Hospital, Phoenix Park. Staff for this unit are currently being recruited and it is planned to open the facility early in 2000. A 12 bed in-patient stabilisation unit is also being developed at Cherry Orchard Hospital. Staff for this unit are also in the process of being recruited and it is hoped this unit will be commissioned early next year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on means. Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board. Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.</P>
      <P>Income guidelines are drawn up to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these are revised annually in line with the consumer price index. However, the guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that his/her medical needs or other circumstances would justify this.</P>
      <P>In view of this special provision, I do not feel it justifiable, nor did previous Governments, on health policy grounds, to extend an automatic entitlement to a medical card to any specific group without any reference to their means as a general rule. It is open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board for health services if they are unable to provide these services for themselves or their dependants without hardship for those who do not qualify for a medical card. There are a number of schemes which provide assistance towards the cost of medication. Under the long-term illness scheme, persons suffering from a number of conditions, including mental handicap, can obtain without charge the drugs and medicines for the treatment of that condition.</P>
      <P>With effect from July 1999, revised arrangements for refunds for drugs were introduced. Under the new scheme, the drug payments scheme, a person and his or her dependants will not have to pay more than £42 in any calendar month for approved prescribed drugs, medicines and appliances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Eastern Health Board has been experiencing difficulties in the provision of services in their regional orthodontic department in St James's Hospital over the past few months. I understand from the board that these difficulties were caused by the consultant orthodontist's unilateral decision to withdraw from the provision of orthodontic assessments, orthodontic opinions and the <Col N="1786" /> commencement of orthodontic appliance therapy for new patients. The position was exacerbated by the withdrawal of consultant cover and the consultant orthodontist's refusal to provide guidance to dental clinicians regarding orthodontic procedures.</P>
      <P>Despite negotiations and discussions at the highest level the consultant orthodontist persistently refused to provide services as outlined above. I understand that the consultant orthodontist's actions led to her suspension from duty without pay with effect from 4 November 1999.</P>
      <P>Since her suspension, there has been on-going communication between health board senior management and the consultant orthodontist's representatives to see if the difficulties encountered could be overcome to the mutual satisfaction of both parties. In the interim, the board is making every effort to procure consultant cover to facilitate the full restoration of orthodontic services.</P>
      <P>I have now approved the planning brief as submitted by the Eastern Health Board in respect of the proposed new orthodontic unit at Beaumont Hospital and have sanctioned a capital grant of £2.6 million in respect of this project.</P>
      <P>I recently approved a capital grant of £1.065 million for the development of a regional orthodontic unit in Dublin South-East. The development of these two additional units will make a significant contribution to the orthodontic service in the Eastern Health Board area.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 44, 56 and 61 together.</P>
      <P>Detailed waiting list data are collected on a quarterly basis from health agencies. Waiting lists for in-patient procedures at the 30 September 1999, the latest date for which detailed figures are available, stood at 33,555. I am arranging to have the detailed waiting list information circulated to the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1788" /> The latest waiting list figure shows a reduction in the previous quarterly figure, which continues the downward trend of this year. This is due to the co-ordinated, integrated manner in which I have tackled the issue of waiting lists since coming into office. Waiting lists have fallen by some 9% since the beginning of this year.</P>
    <P>I am allocating £23.5 million to waiting list initiative work next year, an increase of £3.5 million on the allocation for 1999. The health agencies have been informed of this in their individual letters of allocation, and the exact way in which this funding will be utilised for the purposes of reducing waiting lists will be a matter for the agencies to include in the service plans. The number of procedures to be carried out as a result of the increased funding available will be specified in the service plan. When the service plans are received by my Department they will be examined and discussed in detail with each agency.</P>
    <P>I am committed to continuing the co-ordinated approach to the waiting list issue which I commenced on taking office. I am confident that the additional funding I have secured for 2000 and the integrated approach I am taking in tackling this issue will continue to have positive results in reducing waiting lists and more importantly in reducing waiting times.</P>

The forum is about to com<Col N="1789" /> plete the first phase of its deliberations and I expect to receive an interim report from the forum by the end of January. I anticipate that the parties to the forum will be able to agree on a series of principles which will shape the future of our hospital services. The second phase of the forum's work will concentrate on how these principles are to be put into practice. It would not be appropriate at this stage to speculate on the detail of these developments.</P>
    <P>The parties represented on the forum are agreed on the need to change the way our hospitals are organised and staffed so as to provide patients with access to suitably qualified and experienced medical personnel as required. The parties are also aware of the need to correct the present imbalance between fully-trained doctors and trainees. They also appreciate the need to provide more acceptable working hours for doctors. Against that background there is an identifiable need for more consultants to be appointed. However there is also a clear need to have consultants available on a more flexible basis to cover periods of duty presently covered by NCHDs. All parties recognise that this will require changes in certain aspects of existing contracts.</P>
    <P>All of these changes will require to be negotiated between the interested parties. I have been impressed by the atmosphere of partnership in which the forum has conducted its business. It would not be helpful at this stage to anticipate what might be the outcome of what will be a complex process.</P>

      <P>Under the Health Act, 1970, a health board may make arrangements for the supply without charge of drugs, medicines and medical and surgical appliances to persons suffering from a prescribed disease or disability of a permanent or long-term nature. Diabetes mellitus and diabetes inspidus are among the conditions prescribed under the Act. Drugs which are directly related to the treatment of these conditions are made available free of charge. The operation of the scheme is primarily a matter for the relevant health board and information on the operation of the scheme with regard to the provision of drugs for the treatment of hypercholesterolaemia and hypertension arising from diabetes was sought from each health board. This information has now been received and is being reviewed by my Department. As <Col N="1790" /> soon as this review is completed I will communicate further with the Deputy in the matter.</P>

      <P>To meet in an appropriate manner the spectrum of different needs within the population of persons with an intellectual disability, it is necessary to provide a broad range of services. This includes both community-based residential, respite, day and other support services, in addition to a similar range of services provided by the residential centres around the country. The emphasis has been and will continue to be on the development of community-based support services which enable individuals with an intellectual disability to remain for as long as possible within their local community. However, there is also a need to ensure that for those who have been assessed as requiring the supports which are available in residential centres or village type accommodation, the appropriate facilities are also available for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, I recently announced a major acceleration of the investment programme in the area of services to persons with an intellectual disability. The additional funding being provided in 2000 is designed to support the opening of additional services, including residential, respite and day services, with an annual cost of £35 million. Because of the timeframe involved in bringing all of the new services planned for 2000 on stream, the actual cost of these services in 2000 will be £28 million. This funding is in addition to the £10.7 million already allocated to the services in 2000 to meet the full year costs of the 1999 developments and identified needs in existing services. This brings the <Col N="1792" /> total additional revenue funding provided in 2000 for the services to £38.7 million, increasing to £45.7 million on 1 January 2001.</P>
    <P>I am also making available £80 million capital over the next three years to accelerate the process of putting in place the necessary infrastructure to support these services. A total of £30 million will be made available in 2000, £40 million in 2001 and the balance of £10 million in 2002. In accordance with normal practice, a revenue allocation commensurate with the capital investment in the services will also be made over this period.</P>

      <P>My Department has been involved in specific initiatives aimed at preventing addiction among young people in the areas of tobacco, alcohol and drugs. It is, however, a matter for each health board to develop a local response to addiction problems in their own area; this includes the development of education and prevention strategies and, where appropriate, treatment services. My department has a role in co-ordinating and complementing these initiatives at a national level as well as implementing national campaigns and policy developments.</P>
      <P>Regional drug co-ordinators have been appointed to co-ordinate a multi-agency approach to drug prevention on a local basis nationwide. In addition, the Eastern Health Board is in the process of appointing ten drug education officers to tackle the problems specific to that region.</P>
      <P>Mass media drug, tobacco and alcohol misuse prevention campaigns are conducted frequently by the health promotion unit of my Department. To support these campaigns, educational and resource materials are provided by my Department, including videos, posters and leaflets, free of charge on request.</P>
      <P>The health promotion unit of my Department has also been a partner in developing a number of preventative education initiatives aimed at providing a more holistic strategy for addiction prevention among young people. The aim of these programmes is to build the self-esteem and confidence of young people, enhance their decision-making skills, inform their attitudes and provide them with correct and accurate information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Specifically the health promotion unit has supported the development of a broad-based social personal and health education programmes at health board level. On My Own Two Feet is a substance abuse prevention programme for post-primary schools which aims to enable students to develop their ability to make informed decisions about the use of drugs in their lives. The pro<Col N="1793" /> gramme is a joint initiative between the health promotion unit and the psychological service of the Department of Education and Science in conjunction with Mater Dei counselling centre. Walk Tall is the primary school version of this programme. In addition, in the school setting the TEACH programme, Smokebusters, HealthKicks and Smoke Free Leitrim projects are alcohol and smoking prevention programmes which aim to prevent the onset of addiction.</P>
    <P>To support these programmes a number of interventions are also aimed at the parents and the family, including the Parent Education on Alcohol, Drugs and Family Communication Programme; Parenting for Prevention Programme, Fás Le Cheile and the Home-School Liaison Service.</P>
    <P>In addition to the school and family based interventions, a number of youth group and community based initiatives have been developed such as the National Youth Health Programme; Drink Awareness for Youth Programme; solvent abuse resource materials for the youth group and school setting; youth work support pack for dealing with the drugs issue; and the Drug Questions &ndash; Local Answers Training Programme.</P>
    <P>Finally, Youth as a Resource, the recent publication from the health promotion unit of my Department has made recommendations on initiatives that will impact upon the health needs of the young people most at risk in our society for the future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 57 and 69 together.</P>
      <P>There have been substantial developments in the care and treatment of patients with cancer throughout the country over the past number of years. Considerable improvements have taken place in this area since the launch in November 1996 of the national cancer strategy, and the announcement in March 1997 of the action plan to implement the strategy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The national cancer strategy's two principal objectives are to take all measures possible to reduce rates of illness and death from cancer, in line with the targets established in the health strategy, Shaping a Healthier Future; and to ensure that those who develop cancer receive the most effective care and treatment and that their <Col N="1794" /> quality of life is enhanced to the greatest extent possible. Underlying these objectives is the need for a high quality, patient-focused service. One of the specific objectives of the strategy is to ensure that all patients have access to an equitable, effective service with a uniformly high quality of care, wherever they live.</P>
    <P>Regional directors of cancer services were appointed in each health board area, with three appointments being made in the Eastern Health Board area. A national cancer forum was appointed to advise my Department on appropriate developments and structures in the area of cancer. A special adviser on cancer services has also helped the process to move forward in an appropriate manner. I thank all those who have worked together within this structure to ensure that cancer services in Ireland are developed to meet the needs of those who develop the disease.</P>
    <P>To achieve the objectives set out in the cancer strategy, some £26 million has been allocated between 1997 and 1999 to develop a range of cancer services throughout the country. I have allocated further cancer funding of £11.464 million to the health agencies for 2000. This will ensure the continued development of the cancer services in line with the strategy.</P>
    <P>The main areas in which improvements have taken place to date are as follows: funding for 22 additional consultant appointments in the areas of medical oncology, haematology, palliative care and histopathology since 1997; screening programmes including the national breast screening programme, which has commenced, and the forthcoming national cervical screening programme; the National Cancer Registry published its third national report on the incidence of and mortality from cancer in Ireland &ndash; I have provided funding of over £100,000 to enable the registry to develop a data analysis and research programme; a review of counselling services throughout the country, which is an important element in the treatment of patients with cancer, was funded and carried out by the Eastern Health Board; and 24 cancer liaison nurses were funded and appointed in the Eastern Health Board area to improve and enhance the integration and co-ordination of the treatment of cancer patients.</P>
    <P>In the North Eastern Health Board area I have provided a total of £700,000 for the further development of cancer services in 2000. This brings to £1.48 million the funding provided for cancer services under the national cancer strategy since 1997.</P>
    <P>The National Cancer Forum submitted a report to me outlining the developments under the cancer strategy and highlighting many of the future needs of the cancer services. I am aware that many of the developments mentioned already have resulted in further demands being put on the services available. The particular areas needing further consideration include radiotherapy services, symptomatic breast cancer services, specialist oncology nurse training and education, and palliative care and counselling services. <Col N="1795" /> These areas are currently being examined by my Department. The funding of £11.464 million which I have allocated for cancer services in 2000 will be of importance in this regard. I am arranging to send a copy of the forum's report to the Deputy.</P>
    <P>At my request, the national cancer forum established a specialist expert group to examine the symptomatic breast cancer services throughout the country. The group's report is due for completion in the near future. When this report is received I will give it careful consideration and I propose to make funding available under the national cancer strategy to develop symptomatic breast cancer services further.</P>
    <P>I am confident that cancer services in Ireland are developing in an appropriate, co-ordinated and integrated fashion. I am pleased to report that we are making good progress in achieving the objectives of the strategy. I am committed to ensuring cancer patients in Ireland, wherever they live, will have a high quality cancer treatment service available to them.</P>

      <P>The diagnosis, assessment and treatment of attention deficit disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder normally falls within the area of responsibility of the child and adolescent psychiatric services in each health board. The development of a comprehensive child and adolescent psychiatric service in each health board area has been identified as a priority in my Department's health strategy &ndash; Shaping a Healthier Future, and a consultant-led multi-disciplinary team is now available in each health board. I have provided additional revenue resources of £0.5 million in 1998 and £1.378 million in 1999, and £1.1 million is being allocated in 2000 to enable further improvements in multi-disciplinary teams to be undertaken in the child and adolescent services.</P>
      <P>The decision on the nature of the treatment for ADD-ADHD is a matter for the consultant and I am not aware of difficulties arising in prescribing of certain medications initiated in this manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is difficult to estimate the number of children suffering from this condition as not all cases are presented for treatment. However the prevalence <Col N="1796" /> is estimated to be between 1% of children with severe forms of ADD-ADHD and up to 5% with milder forms. Research into the genetics of ADHD is also ongoing through a collaborative research project between the genetic and psychiatric departments of Trinity College and clinicians in the Eastern Heath Board.</P>
    <P>The chief executive officers of the health boards are anxious to ensure a planned development of services across the boards for persons with these conditions. They have recently been in touch with my Department recommending that a national working group be established with representatives from the health boards, the Department of Health and Children and perhaps the Department of Education and Science to prepare an agreed national framework for service developments. The proposal is currently being considered by my Department.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 60 and 140 together.</P>
      <P>I understand from the Midland Health Board that the property in question at Edgeworthstown, County Longford, was acquired in October 1996 by Aontacht Phobail Teoranta, a company controlled by the Midland Health Board, at a total cost of £130,974. The cost of renovating and fitting out the accommodation amounted to £58,000. The annual rent for the property payable by the board to APT is £2,400 and the annual upkeep costs in the region of £3,000.</P>
      <P>The property was acquired in the context of ward closures in St. Loman's hospital, Mullingar and the need to provide improved community-based accommodation for psychiatric patients. Despite the intervention of the Labour Relations Commission, no agreement has been reached to date between the board and the Psychiatric Nurses Association of Ireland on the staffing levels at the new facility and for this reason it has not yet been opened. I understand that the board has put new proposals to the union side for consideration and is currently awaiting a response.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the crisis in orthodontic treatment in the Southern Health Board region where there is a three year waiting period and more than 8,000 patients on the waiting list; the action, if any, he will take to improve the service; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The provision of orthodontic services and the maintenance of waiting lists for treatment are the statutory responsibility of the health boards. The orthodontic services continue to be developed in accordance with the dental health action plan. The action plan provides for the development by each health board of a consultant-led orthodontic service which ensures a service of high quality and high service levels. My Department has made additional resources available to the health boards to assist the boards with the development of their orthodontic services in accordance with the dental health action plan.</P>
      <P>I understand that the board considers that the present treatment waiting list may not be an accurate record of those currently in need of treatment. The board is considering proposals to have this waiting list validated.</P>
      <P>In addition to developing its own orthodontic service, the Southern Health Board has been attempting to develop links with Cork University Dental School and Hospital with regard to both the training of health board orthodontic staff and the treatment of patients. Full co-operation between the health board through its consultant orthodontist and the hospital is required to achieve the maximum use of available resources.</P>
      <P>I have approved an additional allocation of £250,000 for the Southern Health Board in 2000 for the further development of the board's orthodontic services.</P>

      <P>The Blood Transfusion Service Board is conducting a major blood procurement campaign at present. The multimedia advertising campaign commenced on 15 November 1999 and will run over the Christmas and millennium periods. The aim of this campaign is to ensure that there are sufficient blood supplies available to hospitals to meet medical and surgical needs and the demands of accident and emergency services. Blood donors throughout the country have responded very generously to this campaign and I encourage eligible persons to donate over the coming weeks. Special donor clinics have been arranged to facilitate donors who wish to donate over the holiday period. I express my sincere appreciation to donors for their generous efforts on behalf of patients in our hospitals.</P>
      <P>As regards the threatened industrial action by donor attendants at the BTSB, I understand management proposals have been accepted by the staff and the threat of industrial action has been withdrawn.</P>
      <P>As regards the testing of donations, responsibility for the organisation and administration of the national blood transfusion service rests with the Blood Transfusion Service Board. In July 1999, the board decided unanimously to authorise the executive to proceed with the detailed planning for centralised testing. This decision was based on a report prepared by its chief executive officer and national medical director, which strongly recommended centralised testing. The board is committed to consultation with blood users in the Munster region to address its concerns.</P>

      <P>Arrangements are in place in the Eastern and Southern Health Board areas for the screening of asylum seekers on a voluntary basis.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Information on rates of breast-feeding broken down by health board area are not available. The target rates for breast-feeding, as set out in the national breast-feeding policy for Ireland, are as follows: an overall breast-feeding initiation rate of 50% by the year 2000; a breast-feeding initiation rate among the lower socio-economic groups of 30% by the year 2000; and a breast-feeding rate of 30% at four months by the year 2000.</P>
      <P>While I recognise that the incidence of breast-feeding in Ireland remains low, the health promotion unit of my Department is committed to continue its support for the implementation of the recommendations of the national breast-feeding policy.</P>
      <P>A number of factors influence the success or otherwise of implementing the national breast-feeding policy. However, in prioritising the recommendations and how they might be implemented, it was recognised that the support of health professionals would be critical to its successful implementation as they are the first point of contact for the mother during pregnancy and after childbirth and are ideally placed to ensure that the mother receives information about the benefits of breast-feeding in order that she can make an informed choice. Consequently, the National University of Ireland, Galway, with funding from the health promotion unit of my Department, has produced a training pack for health professionals which includes a breast-feeding video and information booklets. This pack was developed in conjunction with An Bord Altranais and is designed to equip health professionals with the necessary skills and knowledge to assist mothers with breast-feeding. This training pack is now in place and available to the relevant health professional bodies.</P>
      <P>Another key recommendation of the national breast-feeding policy was that Ireland participate in the &ldquo;Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative&rdquo;. This global campaign led by the World Health Organisation and UNICEF encourages hospitals and health workers to support mothers to breast-feed. The initiative has recently been established in Ireland and the number of hospitals, maternity and paediatric units involved in the initiative continues to grow.</P>
      <P>I am confident that the continuing implementation of the recommendations, and particularly the growing participation in the baby friendly initiative, will result in an increase in the incidence of breast-feeding in this country.</P>

      <P>The Rotunda Hospital 1998 annual report indicates that the number of mothers delivered by caesarean section in the hospital in 1998 was 24.2%. In a recent national survey carried out by the Rotunda Hospital, the caesarean section rates ranged from 12% to 26%. Data supplied to the hospital would indicate a national caesarean section rate in 1998 as 18.4%. In 1980 the national section rate was in the order of 6.2%. As can be seen, there is increasing demand from patients at national level to be delivered by caesarean section. The notion of a &ldquo;correct caesarean section rate&rdquo; does not exist and very many reasons influence what a hospital's caesarean section rate may be. The policy of the Rotunda Hospital, and indeed every maternity unit in this country, is to provide a high quality service and care to both mother and baby based on best medical practice and clinical management against a background of an excellent anaesthetic service. Advances in regional analgesia and the applications of these advances have made a high caesarean section rate in the Rotunda safe to mother and baby and acceptable to patients.</P>

      <P>In the course of the expert review group on certain allied health professions, employers acknowledged that there are recruitment difficulties with a number of professions, including social workers, occupational therapists, speech and language therapists and orthodontists. Officials of my <Col N="1804" /> Department have already met with many of the heads of these schools and are currently planning a manpower planning exercise to address these difficulties.</P>
      <P>In relation to orthodontists, the medical manpower forum is currently looking at some of the staffing difficulties at present surrounding consultants in our hospitals and an interim report is expected in the near future.</P>
      <P>The National Social Work Qualifications Board has begun a manpower planning initiative in relation to social workers, the results of which are expected by the end of this year.

      <P>A manpower planning exercise in under way under the auspices of the review of psychology services group and is addressing the matter in both the short term and medium term. This group hopes to be in a position to enter into discussions with the training colleges early next year.</P>
      <P>Following talks between the joint committee for medical laboratory sciences and my Department in relation to medical laboratory technicians, it was agreed that from October 1999 the number of entrants to the three approved courses in Ireland would be increased by 20 per annum in total. As the course is of four years duration, these extra graduates will not be available to the market until 2003.</P>
      <P>To address the short-term difficulties, additional student placements have been agreed with some of the teaching hospitals and from October 1999 ten or 12 trainee medical laboratory technician posts are being offered to students who have an approved biomedical science degree, but whose practical experience is deemed to be insufficient. These trainee positions were advertised in the national press, and the joint committee has met to allocate these posts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 77 and 139 together.</P>
      <P>The report of the Commission on Nursing, A Blueprint for the Future, contains over 200 wide-ranging recommendations for addressing the underlying problems within the nursing profession and developing the role of nurses and midwives in the health services.</P>
      <P>At the launch of the commission's report in September 1998, I gave a commitment on behalf of the Government to take immediate action in a number of priority areas in response to the commission's recommendations. In spite of the recent industrial relations difficulties, real progress has been made in the following areas: draft legislative proposals to amend the Nurses Act, 1985, are in the course of preparation in my Department; a nursing education forum has been established to prepare the ground for moving pre-registration nursing education to a four year degree programme; funding has been provided for the establishment of a nursing andmidwifery planning and development unit in each health board area; the nursing policy division of my Department has been strengthened through the appointment of additional nurse advisors on a contract basis; and the clinicians in management initiative involving nurses in the management of the health services has been launched.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of the settlement of the recent nurses' strike, my Department has reached agreement with the alliance of nursing unions on a structured programme for the phased implementation of the commission's report. An agreed action plan has been prepared setting out the objectives to be achieved over the next two years. These include the development of new roles and grading structures within nursing which will enhance the profession of nursing, improve service delivery, and help to address concerns among nurses about their relative lack of promotional outlets. The <Col N="1806" /> action plan will also address other important issues affecting the nursing profession, such as the empowerment of nurses and midwives, post-registration education and development, and the whole area of skill mix and effective use of the professional skills of nurses. I am arranging to have a copy of the action plan sent to the Deputy for her information.</P>
    <P>A key feature of the action plan is the establishment of the national council for the professional development of nursing and midwifery, recommended by the Commission on Nursing. This new body is a necessary prerequisite to the creation of clinical nurse-midwife specialist and advanced nurse/midwife practitioner posts. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that I have now established the national council and appointed the membership of it. This will facilitate the development of the 1,250 clinical specialist posts recommended by the Labour Court, as well as the implementation of a number of objectives set out in the action plan. Progress has also been made already in relation to other elements of the action plan, including arrangements for an increase of some 300 nursing student training places next year, the introduction of a pilot direct entry midwifery education programme in summer 2000, and a doubling of the theoretical component, from 13 to 26 weeks, of the current post-registration midwifery programme.</P>
    <P>The Health Estimate for 2000 includes a sum of £10 million for the implementation of the action plan. This is in addition to the £16 million full year cost that will be made available to finance the development of the various new posts recommended by the Labour Court in the context of the implementation of the Commission on Nursing report.</P>
    <P>While all of the recommendations of the commission are important, it is accepted by all the relevant interest groups, including the nursing unions, that they cannot all be implemented at once. Accordingly, it is intended that further action plans would be prepared to provide for the implementation of the remaining recommendations over agreed timeframes.</P>

      <P>The health promotion unit of my Department has produced an information leaflet on hepatitis C <Col N="1807" /> and this leaflet is made widely available. I have no further plans at present to initiate a national campaign on hepatitis C, as suggested by the Deputy, but I will keep the matter under review.</P>
      <P>An advisory group on the transmission of diseases in the health care setting produced two reports in September 1997 and February 1999 on the prevention of transmission of blood-borne disease in the health care setting. The reports deal mainly with prevention of transmission of hepatitis C, hepatitis B and HIV. The reports, which were widely circulated, make recommendations on the essential safety procedures for the health care setting.</P>
      <P>A number of studies, both in the Eastern Health Board drugs services and in prison, have shown that between 70% and 80% of opiate addicts are hepatitis C positive. Data on the first ten years of the board's needle exchange programme was recently presented to the board and an expanded needle exchange programme is actively taking place through the recruitment of extra outreach workers and the opening of needle exchange locations in various sites throughout the city.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the national breast screening programme has drawn up a woman's charter as part of the commitment to providing a quality service for women. One of the targets of the charter includes waiting time for treatment. I have ring fenced funding to the two hospitals associated with BreastCheck to ensure that designated beds and dedicated theatre time are set <Col N="1808" /> aside so that the programme can implement the woman's charter.</P>
      <P>I will shortly be receiving an expert report on the symptomatic breast screening services, which I expect will consider the remaining issues namely, lack of information, lack of communication, and poor support systems.</P>
      <P>However, in order to prevent the issues arising in relation to the breast screening programme, BreastCheck has undertaken to carry out the following: an extensive PR campaign in each area prior to screening, using radio and print media and involving many local groups including health professionals, women's groups and voluntary organisations; information leaflets to those invited for screening, those who attend and those who require further investigation; an information pack to general practitioners in partnership with the Irish College of General Practitioners; employment of a multi-disciplinary team of highly skilled professionals, including two nurse counsellors who will be present at both assessment and treatment; and a commitment to provision of results to women within the target of the woman's charter.</P>

Each kit contains 50 slides. This arrangement is in place for several years. The board indicated that one incident occurred in late November where a general practitioner looked for a kit when the supply was used up. He was asked to wait a few days until the new supply arrived. This is the only occasion that the board has had to ask a general practitioner to wait.</P>

      <P>The Infectious Diseases Regulations, 1981, specify those diseases which are statutorily notifiable to my Department and the powers and responsibilities of health boards in relation to their prevention and control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1809" /> A wide range of public health issues arise in relation to infectious diseases and policy in this area is guided by the appropriate expert advice and by international best practice. The incidence of the notifiable conditions is monitored and, together with other factors, is taken into account when policy is being considered. My Department receives advice from expert committees on certain infectious disease issues, including policy in relation to immunisation, bacterial meningitis, tuberculosis and CJD &ndash; Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease. In the current year, the conditions for which the number of notifications represents an increase over the 1998 level include bacterial meningitis, including meningococcal septicaemia, food poisoning, bacterial other than salmonella, and viral hepatitis type A.</P>
    <P>The National Disease Surveillance Centre was established in October 1998 and will significantly enhance our capabilities to monitor communicable diseases. Initially, it will be responsible for the surveillance of communicable diseases, such as meningitis, tuberculosis and foodborne diseases such as salmonella and e.coli O157. Its functions include collaboration with and supporting the health boards in the control of infectious disease, the development of guidelines and protocols and undertaking research.</P>

      <P>Following the Taoiseach's official visit to China in 1998, an Asia strategy group was established under the chair of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to consider how best to increase trade and investment between Ireland and Asia. This group produced a report outlining a strategy for the long-term development of foreign earnings in Asia which was duly approved by the Government.</P>
      <P>The report recommended, <i>inter alia,</i> the strengthening of Ireland's diplomatic and promotional presence in the region. In this regard the Government has, in recent months, decided to open a new Irish embassy in Singapore as well as new consulates in Shanghai and Sydney. Furthermore, arrangements have been made to enhance our diplomatic and promotional representation in Tokyo and Beijing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Asia strategy group report also recommended that an implementation group be established under the aegis of the foreign earnings committee, comprising public and private sector interests, to oversee the implementation of the Government's long-term foreign earnings strat<Col N="1810" /> egy in the region and to report to Government. The report also called for additional resources to be made available to raise awareness of Ireland in the marketplace and to fund target marketing of Ireland to key decision makers in the region. I am happy that additional resources for these purposes have now been secured and I hope to be in a position to appoint the implementation group shortly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 44 of the Credit Union Act, 1997, allows a credit union establish a special fund to be used by it for social, cultural or charitable purposes, <Col N="1811" /> including community development. Under section 44(1), the establishment of such a special fund is entirely a matter for the decision by the majority of the members of each individual credit union attending and voting at its general meeting.</P>
      <P>The Act limits the special fund to an amount not exceeding 2.5% of the accumulated reserves of each credit union, excluding the statutory reserve, in the year of establishment of the fund. At 30 September 1997, the last full year for which figures are available, total reserves for all credit unions in the State, excluding statutory reserves, were £41.5 million. If they all decided to establish the permitted fund at the maximum levels allowed in section 44(4), I estimate the value of these funds would be about £1 million.</P>
      <P>The amount of money which may be added to the fund in each year out of the annual surplus of a credit union is limited to an amount not exceeding 0.5% of the value of the credit union's assets as shown in the accounts for the most recent financial year. At 30 September 1997, total assets for credit unions were £2.827 billion, which, if all credit unions were in surplus and were to add the maximum permitted by section 44(3) to their fund, would add in the region of £14 million to these funds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of several recent reports and studies which reflect issues of labour demand and supply. These include, for instance, the National Development Plan 2000 to 2006 and the recent study by Goodbody Stockbrokers on the plan.</P>
      <P>The national development plan forecast potential average annual GNP growth of 5%, and productivity growth of 3% in GNP terms, in the period to 2006. At the level of aggregate demand, employment in the period ahead is expected to grow at an annual average rate of 2% per annum, during the period of the plan.</P>
      <P>The NDP is predicated on a continuation of strong labour force growth, albeit at a slower rate than in recent years. An annual average increase of about 2% is forecast. This is based on estimates of the natural increase in the labour force, augmented by higher labour force participation and the continuation of net immigration. These forecasts represent a reasonable assessment of likely future labour market developments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1812" /> The sectoral breakdown and-or occupational breakdown of these forecasts will be dependent on, <i>inter alia,</i> the changing requirements of employers in response to competitive pressures, the interests and aptitudes of individuals and the availability of education and training places in the public and private education and training systems.</P>
    <P>Recent supply and demand side reports and studies assist in manpower forecasting and medium-term planning here. Table 1, for example, has been taken from the recently published Economic and Social Research Institute national survey of private sector vacancies. It provides a breakdown of total vacancies into occupational groups and shows these as a percentage of total employment in each occupation. This shows that the greatest proportionate shortage was among computer and engineering professionals and associate professionals. A further significant category of vacancy was among skilled maintenance and production workers &ndash; craftspersons.   </P>

    <P>The ESRI Medium-Term Review 1999 to 2005 also represents a valuable report on forecast labour supply and demand for a period ahead. This is complemented by reports under the FÁS-ESRI manpower forecasting series which provide detailed breakdowns of employment forecasts by occupation. Report No. 7 of that series shows that, in the period under review to 2003, in proportionate terms, the largest increases forecast are for professionals, 32.3%, proprietors in services 29.2%, catering occupations, 28.9%, managers, 27.5%, and sales workers, 25.4%.</P>
    <P>The Government is pursuing a wide range of policies in order to ensure that the economy remains competitive and continues to grow in a sustainable and low inflationary way. I have <Col N="1813" /> described in recent replies to the House the broad range of initiatives taken, both to enhance labour supply and the skills of the current workforce. These include fiscal initiatives aimed at reducing the tax burden and labour market structural measures as notified, for example, in the 1999 employment action plan.</P>
    <P>On the specific aspect of skills, a principal element of the response is being pursued through implementation of the recommendations of the expert group on future skills needs. In its first report, the group addressed skill needs of the hardware electronics and software sectors. The group is currently examining skills needs in a range of other sectors.</P>

      <P>The Government agreed at its meeting on the 21 July 1999 to set up an interdepartmental agency group to review and report on the State's approach to public safety. The review group is being chaired by Dr. Daniel O'Hare and the first meeting took place on Monday, 15 November 1999.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that I am not in a position to comment in detail on the substance of discussions on a draft directive at internal market council. In general, however, the current Government has maintained the line taken in negotiations on this matter by its predecessor. This is that Ireland does not favour the adoption of an artists' resale right directive because such a measure would, in the main, assist relatively prosperous artists with strong secondary markets in their works rather than those in most need of assistance. Also, in the context of the small Irish art market in particular, such a measure would be unlikely to generate revenue proportionate to collection costs, or to convey financial benefit on artists sufficient to compensate for the damage that could be caused to the professional art trade, the continued health of which is surely in the interest of artists as well as art market professionals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our continued opposition to the proposal notwithstanding, Ireland has at all stages played a constructive part in the negotiation of this pro<Col N="1815" /> posal, in the interests of ensuring that should a directive be adopted in this matter, it will represent the optimum outcome for both artists and the professional art market at Irish and European levels.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>Dublin Port Company has applied for permission under section 10 of the Foreshore Act, 1933, as amended, to have 21 hectares of privately-owned foreshore in Dublin port reclaimed for port purposes.</P>
      <P>The publication of the EIS and the public consultation process were advertised in the <i>Irish Independent </i>and <i>The Irish Times</i> on 1 October and copies of the EIS and other associated documents necessary for the public consultation process were made available for public consultation for the statutory period of one month at both the port company's offices and Store Street Garda station.</P>
      <P>The port company has advised me that, following publication of the notice in the newspapers on 1 October and, having regard to the relatively small attendance at the exhibition in the port offices of the public consultation documents, public representatives for the area, both at national and local level, known residents associations in the area and other known interested parties, such as Birdwatch Ireland, were written to and invited to attend. The company advises that the response was mixed, with some attending and having fruitful discussions, some sending apologies and some ignoring the invitation. I would accept this as evidence that the company has complied with its statutory duty in relation to public consultation. A further consultation period is not, therefore, called for.</P>
      <P>A total of 428 submissions were made to me in relation to the proposed reclamation. The vast bulk of these were from individual residents or family groups with Clontarf addresses while two were from community action groups &ndash;  the Clontarf Residents Association and the East Wall Community Development Council. The submissions were under 14 broad headings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The observations made on the proposal, 16 of which were in favour, have been referred to the port company for its comments. These comments, <Col N="1816" /> together with the submissions to which they refer, will be considered by departmental officials before making a recommendation to me.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will note that planning permission under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Acts will be required for any development on any of the foreshore in question if it is reclaimed. Thus, interested parties will have full opportunity to consider and comment on the details of any such development before such development could take place.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, decisions on the locations of the six new implementation bodies and the new tourism company were taken jointly with our Northern ministerial colleagues at the inaugural plenary meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council in Armagh on Monday 13 December.</P>
      <P>In coming to these decisions, we took a range of factors into account, including particular requirements stemming from the nature and activities of the bodies and the location of existing staff already carrying out some of those functions. We also attached importance to achieving an appropriate overall balance between North and South, and to reflecting the all-island, and not simply cross-Border, nature of the bodies.</P>
      <P>There were, of course, many potentially suitable locations in both jurisdictions, and I am glad that a number of offices will be located in the Border region, including the regional office of the Special EU Programmes Body in Monaghan, the regional office of the Ullans Agency in Donegal, and a regional office of Waterways Ireland in Leitrim. Other offices are located close to the Border on the Northern side &ndash; for example, in Newry, the Trade and Business Development Body, and in Enniskillen, Waterways Ireland.</P>
      <P>Bearing in mind the range of factors outlined above, and given its particular concentration of expertise in the field of food science, it was felt that Cork was an appropriate location for the Food Safety Promotion Board. Overall, of course, I fully recognise the special economic features and needs of the Border region. These are continuing to be addressed through the EU's PEACE and INTERREG initiatives and the work of the International Fund for Ireland. In addition, I have no doubt that the border region will benefit substantially from the enhanced co-operation and common action on the island which will be carried forward by the North-South Ministerial Council.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>The crisis situation in Chechnya is a matter of profound concern to the Government. Since early September Russian forces have been carrying out a military campaign against Russia's self-ruled, separatist republic of Chechnya, following attacks by rebels based there on the neighbouring republic of Dagestan. The conflict has escalated in the past couple of weeks and the capital Grozny is now surrounded by Russian ground forces, and sporadic fighting is taking place in the suburbs. Russia has indicated that it has established safety corridors' to facilitate the evacuation of the city by the 20,000 to 40,000 civilians remaining there. However, many civilians remain too frightened to use these routes. Chechen President Mashkadov has announced that he is prepared to hold talks with Russian Emergencies Minister, Mr. Sergei Shoigu and the OSCE Chairman in Office, Mr. Knut Vollebaek.</P>
      <P>From the beginning of the conflict the issue has been discussed at every meeting of EU Foreign Ministers, and a number of high level demarches have been made to the Russian authorities. The European Council in Helsinki on 10-11 December took a strong stand on this issue. It condemned the intense bombardments of Chechen cities and the treatment of civilians as totally unacceptable. The Council made clear that it expected Russia to abide by the basic principles of humanitarian law, the commitments it has made within the OSCE and its obligations as a member of the Council of Europe. The Council also indicated that it would draw the consequences from the situation in Chechnya for the Union's Common Strategy with Russia, its Partnership and Co-operation Agreement and its TACIS Programme, all of which would be reviewed. The OSCE and the Council of Europe were also invited by the European Council to review, in their field of competence, the modalities of their cooperation with Russia. The European Council Conclusions have been conveyed by Finnish Prime Minister Lipponen to Prime Minister Putin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although the Russian threat to treat any remaining civilians in Grozny as terrorists has been withdrawn, the Government remains deeply concerned at the plight of the civilian population. Apart from those caught up in the conflict around Grozny, an estimated 350,000 Chechens have been displaced , some 246,000 to the neighbouring Russian republic of Ingushetia. The Government has allocated IR£220,000 in humanitarian assistance to Chechen refugees. This allocation is <Col N="1819" /> additional to Ireland's share of the European Union aid package of £1.2 million.</P>
    <P>Ireland's concerns about the civilian population have been made known to the Russian authorities on numerous occasions and at the highest level. The Taoiseach expressed our views directly to President Yeltsin on the occasion of the OSCE summit in Istanbul in November. On 8 December I called in the Russian Ambassador. I made clear that the Government remained very disturbed at the tragic effects on the civilian population of the military campaign in Chechnya and stressed the need for an early restoration of peace and stability in the region. I indicated, in my capacity as Chairman of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, that I would do everything possible to assist this, including the possibility of a visit to the region. I am now pursuing this with the Russian authorities.</P>
    <P>The Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights, Mr Gil-Robles, visited the north Caucasus on 1 December and his report will be considered by the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe in Strasbourg on 15 December. I will be discussing the Chechen conflict with the Political Affairs Committee of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe in Paris on 16 December. I intend, as Chairman of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe to make every effort to assist a peaceful, political solution.</P>
    <P>The OSCE is also actively engaged in efforts to promote a political solution. The Chairman in Office, Norwegian Foreign Minister Vollebaek, visited Chechnya from 14-15 December and he is reporting to the OSCE Permanent Council on 15/16 December. The European Council urged Russia to use that visit for a dialogue with the elected leaders of Chechnya. It also urged that a field office of the OSCE Assistance Group in Chechnya should be opened immediately in Nazran, Ingushetia. The Government fully supports these proposals and calls on Russia to use the facilities of the OSCE and the Council of Europe to help bring about a lasting peaceful solution in Chechnya.</P>

The claim was processed in accordance with the dates of birth of the animals at the time of application. As a result, seven animals were processed under the ten month age category and the remaining animal was processed under the 22 month age category. As the application was submitted too early for the 22 month premium in respect of the seven animals, payment cannot issue for these animals in respect of that age category. However, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the scheme laid down in the EU regulations, the animals are counted for stocking density each time an application is submitted, thus affecting eligibility for qualification for extensification premium.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>Council Directive 91/628, as amended by Council Directive 95/29, lays down general provisions of protection of animals during transport by sea, air, road and rail across all member states. However, standard provisions have not been laid down at EU level in relation to the approval of vessels. In this regard, the EU Commission is at present examining how transport arrangements are being implemented for the different modes of transport, including roll-on roll-off ferries, in the different member states.</P>
      <P>In Ireland, implementation of the directive has been considered a priority, both in regard to fulfilling our legal obligations at EU level, and securing the continued viability of our live trade by ensuring that animals are treated in a humane manner consistent with EU law. The provisions of the directive were, accordingly, transposed into Irish legislation through the Diseases of Animals (Protection of Animals during Transport) Order, 1995 (SI No. 98 of 1995) and the Diseases of Animals (Protection of Animals during Transport) (Amendment) Order, 1997 (SI No. 326/97).</P>
      <P>The Deputy may be aware that since 1996 my Department has introduced detailed national regulations in relation to the carriage of cattle at sea in dedicated livestock vessels. The Commission is already considering proposals for more detailed EU rules in relation to this type of vessel, in part based on Ireland's national legislation in this area. Any proposals in relation to ro-ro ferries are likely to be dealt with separately, at a later date. It is not possible to say at this stage when such proposals are likely to materialise, or the form they will take. However, the Deputy can rest assured that my Department will continue to play a full and active part in the development of any measures put forward as a result of the Commission's deliberations in this area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of roll-on roll-off shipping facilities for the export of livestock to Europe is primarily a matter for the ferry operators themselves. However, my Department is responsible for the inspection and <Col N="1824" /> approval of vessels for the carriage of livestock. In this regard it has, since the beginning of the year, approved four additional dedicated cattle ships and a roll-on roll-off vessel. All of the dedicated ships have been approved for transporting cattle to the continent while two are approved for markets further afield such as the Lebanon. This brings the total number of dedicated ships approved for the export of cattle to 17 and the number of approved ro-ro vessels to three.</P>
      <P>It is clear from this that everything possible has been done to facilitate the carriage of livestock to our markets in Europe and the Middle East. During 1999 there has been a record level of exports and a record level of carrying capacity and every reasonable request as regards inspections and improving capacity has been facilitated.</P>
      <P>Indeed the most recent figures available to my Department for cattle exports bear testament to the success of the efforts of all concerned in this regard. Live cattle exports to early December, 1999 are, at 386,243, more than double the number &ndash; 150,524 &ndash; exported in the same period last year and more than seven times the number &ndash; 52,000 &ndash; exported in the same period of 1997. Of the 386,243 cattle exported to date this year, exports to the Continent amounted to 304,605. This is more than double the number &ndash; 123,602 &ndash; exported in the same period last year.</P>
      <P>In relation to the <i>MV Venus</i>, I am aware that the owners have, for now, interrupted its service from Cork to St. Malo and Cherbourg in France and that the vessel has departed for Greece for its annual service. At this point in time the intentions of the owners of the <i>MV Venus </i>are not clear. However, my Department has been in touch with the operators and further contacts are expected which should establish with greater clarity their intentions as regards the future of the service.</P>
      <P>In the meantime my Department will continue to discharge its function in this matter by responding without delay to all reasonable requests for inspections of vessels to ensure that there is sufficient capacity available to meet demand.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 86 on 17 November 1999, the person named submitted an incomplete 1999 area aid application form. He did not indicate the areas of parcels of land included in his application nor did he provide proof of his entitlement to claim on commonage parcels. He was contacted in this regard and provided details of the relevant parcels and proof of entitlement to the commonage, to the area aid unit.</P>
      <P>The process of entering these parcel details onto the Department's electronic database has now been completed. The person named applied for 51.20 hectares on his 1999 area aid application form. Following processing of his application an area of 50.93 hectares was determined which is 0.27 hectares or 0.53% less than that in his application.</P>
      <P>Under Article 9 of EU Regulation 3887/92, no penalty is applied when the difference is less than 3%, the penalty is based on double the difference when it is between 3% and 20% and when the difference is over 20%, a 100% penalty must be applied.</P>
      <P>Therefore in this case no penalty is applied leaving the area determined for payment at 50.93 hectares. Any payments due will issue as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 122 and 123 together.</P>
      <P>The two estuarine embankments that form the fresh water lake at Inch are Farland Point embankment and Quigley's Point embankment. Both were constructed in the 1850s. Following investigations into the stability of the Farland Point embankment in 1993 a major programme of strengthening with rock armouring on the seaward side was recommended and this work was completed in 1996. The embankment was also raised at this time. There are no further plans to raise this embankment. There are seven tidal flap gates on this embankment through which the flood waters from Inch Lake discharge. One of these gates is leaking and a replacement gate will be fitted shortly.</P>
      <P>The other embankment at Quigley's Point was topped up at selected locations following the storms of February 1990 and is currently in good repair. There are no proposals to further raise this embankment.  The flooding which occurs on the public road leading from Magheraboy to Inch Island is caused by rising water levels in the lake together with wind action. This matter will be addressed jointly by the Office of Public Works and Donegal County Council.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The personal allowance for widows and widowers in the current tax year is £4,200 which is given as a credit as to the standard rate of tax and a further allowance of £500 is due at the taxpayer's marginal rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1831" /> The widowed persons allowance was first introduced in the tax year 1954-55 and the allowance at that stage represented an increase of £25 over and above the single allowance. The attached schedule outlines the history and quantum of the allowance since its inception. The difference between the allowance and the single personal allowance increased in the 1970s and in 1982-83 the difference increased to £500. That differential remained until the introduction of the tax credits in 1999-2000. With the move towards a credit system in addition to the single allowance credited at the standard rate the widowed person was given an additional allowance of £500 at his-her marginal rate.</P>
    <P>A widowed person with dependent children is also entitle to:</P>
    <P>(i)the widowed parent allowance, which for the year 1999-2000 is worth £1,050 at 24% and £2,650 at the taxpayers marginal rate and</P>
    <P>(ii) the following additional allowance:&ndash;</P>
    <P>&ndash;£5,000 in the first year after bereavement</P>
    <P>&ndash;£4,000 in the second year after bereavement</P>
    <P>&ndash;£3,000 in the third year after bereavement</P>
    <P>&ndash;£2,000 in the fourth year after bereavement</P>
    <P>&ndash;£1,000 in the fifth year after bereavement.</P>
    <P>An estimated 75,000 widowed persons on tax records in 1999-2000 are entitled to claim the additional personal allowance of £500 at an estimated cost of £8.9 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1832" /> As regards increases in the widows allowance I have announced the following changes in Budget 2000:.</P>
    <P>&ndash;The personal allowance for single-widowed persons will be increased to £4,700 at the standard rate of tax.</P>
    <P>&ndash;The additional allowance for widowed persons without dependent children will be doubled form £500 to £1,000 and standard rated. This is added to the £4,700 single/widowed allowance.</P>
    <P>&ndash;The additional allowance for lone parents including widowed parents will be increased by £500 to £4,700 at the standard rate, giving widowed parents the same personal allowances as married couples, that is, £9,400 in total, all of which will be given at the standard rate of tax. To ensure no loss to widowed parents on the higher rate of tax, as a result of standard rating, their standard band will be increased to £20,150, that is £3,150 higher than the band for single taxpayers.</P>
    <P>&ndash;The widowed parent's bereavement allowance which applies in the first five years after bereavement will be doubled to £10,000 in year one, £8,000 in year two, £6,000 in year three, £4,000 in year four and £2,000 in year five and standard rated.</P>
    <P>I receive many pre-budget submissions from varying groups including the widows, all of which I take into account in the context of the budget.</P>

      <Quest>if he will examine the situation in relation to the threshold of the 2% health levy particularly for pensioners where small pension increases can result in actual losses, by putting them within the levy limit; if he will introduce some form of marginal relief whereby the levy is due only on the portion over the threshold or part thereof; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The health levy is charged at a rate of 2% on a person's total income from all sources with only a few exceptions, for example, social welfare payments. The 1994 budget introduced a low income exemption threshold for the levies of £173 per week or £9,000 per annum which means that where a person's reckonable income is lower than the threshold they are not liable to the levies. However when a person's income rises above the threshold the levies are payable on the person's total income. The threshold ensures that most pensioners on low incomes are exempt form the levies. In this year's budget I announced that the threshold will be raised from £11,250 to £11,750 per annum.</P>
      <P>The current arrangements in respect of the health levy are more favourable to many pensioners than most taxpayers because the levy is not applicable to their social welfare pension. The total income of medical card holders and recipients of social welfare survivors' and widows' pensions, lone parents' allowance and deserted wives benefit-allowance are exempt from the levies. After a pension increase, the monthly income of a pensioner may increase to a level above the threshold whereby they become liable to pay the health levy. However, if their annual income remains below the threshold, they may be liable for a refund of any levies paid throughout the tax year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The levies threshold was introduced in order to focus assistance towards those on low incomes. The Government was aware of the &ldquo;step&rdquo; that exists at the levies threshold when the threshold was introduced. However, it is <Col N="1834" /> considered that having a marginal relief system would introduce an unacceptable level of additional complexity into the levies-PRSI system. It is sometimes also proposed that the levies should apply only to that portion of a person's income over the weekly/annual threshold. Such a measure would be costly to implement as it would benefit everyone. While there are no proposals to abolish the levy, I can confirm that the position generally, including the level of the threshold, will continue to be reviewed as are all other taxes or levies in the context of the annual budget.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to confirm that substantial funding is in place or in the course of being negotiated with the European Commission for cross-Border activities for 2000 and later years. The Deputy will be aware that under the current INTERREG Programme and the Special Support Programme for Peace and Reconciliation in Northern Ireland and the Border counties of Ireland, considerable funding remains to be expended during 2000 on foot of commitments to projects entered into before the closing of these programmes. The existing programmes close at the end of December 1999 and funding under both is fully committed.</P>
      <P>The new programmes are expected to become operational in the second quarter of 2000 once the necessary funding negotiations and other technical issues have been put in place. In relation to future funding of the Peace and Reconciliation Programme, the Berlin Council agreed in March of this year that 500 million should be allocated to a new Peace Programme for Northern Ireland and the Border counties. Of this, 100 million will be allocated to projects in the border counties over the period 2000 to 2004. This allocation represents up to 75% of the total funding to be made available. The Exchequer, local authorities and other agencies will make up the remaining funds.</P>
      <P>Funding will be made available for a new INTERREG Programme to support cross-Border activities from 2000 to 2006. My officials are in negotiations with the European Commission on the level of funding to be made available under this programme. These negotiations are at an advanced stage and, therefore, I am not in a position to confirm a final position until later this month or possibly early in the new year.</P>

      <P>Lone parents including widows with children have, at present, the single person's allowance of £4,200 at the standard rate of tax plus an additional allowance of £4,200, of which £3,150 is available at the marginal rate of tax. From 6 April 2000, the lone parent's allowance will be increased by £500 to £4,700 at the standard rate, giving lone parents the same personal allowances as married couples, that is, £9,400 in total, all of which will be available at the standard rate of tax. To ensure no loss to lone parents on the higher rate of tax, as a result of standard rating, their standard band will be increased to £20,150, that is £3,150 higher than the band for single taxpayers.</P>
      <P>In addition to the specific measures I have outlined, lone parents will benefit from the general improvements which I announced in my budget speech, namely: the increase in the personal allowances from £4,200 to £4,700 at the standard rate; the reduction in both the standard and top rates of tax by 2%; and the increase in the standard rate band for single persons from £14,000 to £17,000.</P>

      <P>I announced on Wednesday, 8 December 1999 that the Government has decided to bring forward a £3,000 per annum tax allowance at the standard rate of tax in respect of spouses of married one income families who work in the home caring for children, the aged or handicapped persons. This fulfils a promise made by the Government in the joint Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats statement issued prior to the June 1997 general election of an allow<Col N="1836" /> ance, set then at £2,000, for families in these circumstances.</P>
      <P>This undertaking was always on the list of measures to be pursued in the Government's two remaining budgets but has been implemented now to recognise the role of spouses who work in the home and to balance the tax relief measures announced in the budget on 1 December 1999 which addressed the position where both spouses were in paid employment.</P>
      <P>The specific details of the operation of the scheme will be set out in the Finance Bill to be published next February. This tax relief will be worth up to £660 per annum to one income married families on the standard and higher rate of tax at all income levels but will be of grater proportionate value to lower income families because it is standard-rated. The full year cost is estimated at £125 million.</P>

There are many factors which affect this but I am satisfied that the marketing and promotion practices of the tobacco industry are the primary cause.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, in Ireland we have had restrictions on advertising and sponsorship by the tobacco industry for some years but I am advised that prohibitions on advertising in particular are only effective when they are comprehensive. I am, accordingly, committed to the introduction of such prohibitions. However, it is probable that the policy review being finalised will bring forward suggestions for other additional measures some of which may require legislation. Accordingly, I have not yet made a final decision on the most appropriate legal instrument to be used. I am not, however, going to wait to act until we have completed a lengthy deliberative and legislative process. Under existing law the levels of expenditure on tobacco advertising and sponsorship by the industry have to be approved by the Minister for Health and Children each year. In exercise of these powers, I have advised the industry that, in general, I do not propose approving any further expenditure on advertising or sponsorship with effect from July 2000. My officials will have further discussions in January 2000 with the interests affected to finalise details of the arrangements.</P>
      <P>With regard to the report of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children, I have directed that this report be given careful and detailed consideration by the Tobacco Free Policy Group in the light of its deliberations. I expect that the group will adapt its report to take account of any new ideas or initiatives which are included in the committee's report.</P>
      <P>I am committed to putting in place an effective public health programme in this important area of tobacco and health. I am conscious that there is an increase in the numbers of children smoking and that further measures are necessary if we are to make any serious progress in reversing this trend. The Government has already taken the very important and practical step of introducing one of the highest tax increases ever on tobacco products, 50p on a pack of 20 cigarettes. While this may hit heavy smokers particularly hard, it should be borne in mind that the single most effective instrument in preventing young people from experimenting with tobacco is high price. I have also secured the agreement of the Government that the proceeds from this increase will be given to the health services as additional funding.</P>

A number of important initiatives are already under way in this area.

The project provides a basis for developing a model of critical care transfer which best suits Irish requirements. In addition, I <Col N="1842" /> have allocated additional funding in 2000 to support the development of a neonatal retrieval service dealing specifically with the transfer of critically ill infants. Arrangements for the development of this service are at an advanced stage and it is expected that the service will commence operation in the first half of next year.

      <P>The report of the inspector of mental hospitals for 1998 was submitted to me by the inspector on 15 October 1999 and published on 5 November 1999. Considerable misunderstanding has been caused by statements that the draft report was submitted to my Department in March 1999 and I would like to take this opportunity to clarify this issue.</P>
      <P>The report of the inspector of mental hospitals consists of a summary of the reports of each inspection of mental health services carried out during the preceding year. An initial draft of each inspection report is received by the mental health services division of my Department and, in line with a protocol developed in consultation with the inspectorate, each draft is sent to the chief executive officer of the relevant service provider, health board, voluntary hospital, private psychiatric hospital, for verification of factual content. When all the responses have been received, they are considered by the inspectorate and any necessary amendments are made to the report. When the reports of the individual inspections have been completed, they are summarised to produce the final report. The inspector also writes an introductory chapter for the report.</P>
      <P>The inspector's report also contains statistical data on the mental health services. Statistical questionnaires are sent out to each service provider, health boards, voluntary hospitals, private psychiatric hospitals, by my Department towards the end of each year. Each service fills out the relevant questionnaire and returns it to the Department. This can often take some time as quite an amount of detailed statistical data is sought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The process outlined above takes several months and, added to the printing and proof-reading of the report, this accounts for the time-span between receipt of the first draft and publication of the final report. The inspector finalises the report before it is submitted to me. On publication of the report this year, I stressed the importance of publishing the inspector's reports as soon as possible in the year following inspection. I have asked the inspectorate to finalise the 1999 report at the earliest possible date. Towards this end, my Department will be writing to service <Col N="1844" /> providers asking them to expedite their consideration of the draft reports and the submission of statistical data.</P>

The board decided that the development of centralised command and control arrangements could best be achieved in the context of the Camp West project which also provides mobilisation services for fire services in the western region. To enable the board to proceed with the Camp West development I have provided a capital grant of £230,000 in 1998 and a further capital grant of £267,000 this year.</P>
      <P>I allocated an additional £1.62 million to the Western Health Board for the development of its ambulance service in 2000 which brings to approximately £4.51 million the total funding made available to the board for this purpose. Provision has been made in this allocation for the share of revenue costs of the Camp West centre by the Western Health Board, which is estimated at £316,000. The board has also been pursuing a range of improvements to the ambulance service, including improved training, upgrading of the ambulance fleet and the development of ambulance bases.

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that post-mortem examinations are carried out to establish the cause of death. This usually involves the retention of tissue. In certain cases the post-mortem examination is incomplete without the retention and subsequent evaluation of an entire organ.</P>
      <P>I am informed that it has traditionally been accepted practice in pathology that consent of next of kin to a post-mortem examination is required and obtained. However, it has not been standard practice to provide relatives with specific details of the retention of tissues and organs for further diagnostic or other purposes.</P>
      <P>The professional body responsible for standards and practices in pathology in Ireland, the Faculty of Pathology, Royal College of Physicians of Ireland, has been reviewing current consent arrangements for post-mortem examination and, in particular, the retention of tissue-organs for further diagnosis, teaching and research. The faculty has recommended to its fellows that specific consent for retention of tissue for such purposes be sought for all post-mortem examinations. The faculty considers that it is essential to be explicit in relation to this issue and accordingly is at present finalising a set of guidelines which will be issued to all members of the faculty as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The chief medical officer of my Department has written to the chief executive officer of each health agency asking them to ensure, pending the issue by the Faculty of Pathology of its guidelines on this matter, that a policy of informed consent by next of kin to the carrying out of a post-mortem and retention of tissue-organs, operates in each health agency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am confident that the guidelines of the Faculty of Pathology, which will ensure that tissue <Col N="1847" /> and organs will only be used for diagnostic, treatment and research purposes where explicit consent has been obtained from next of kin, will form the basis for best practice in this area.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that these arrangements will ensure that post-mortem examinations are conducted in a manner that is sensitive to the needs of families and will ensure that the necessary functions and processes involved in post-mortem examination can be understood and accepted by the general public.</P>

    </P>
    <P>In July of this year the Taoiseach, Deputy Ahern, launched the cardiovascular health strategy group report, Building Healthier Hearts. The report is very comprehensive and its recommendations are far reaching. My Department has set a medium-term objective to bring our levels of premature deaths from cardiovascular disease in line with the EU average at a minimum and a long-term objective of reducing our rates to those of the best performers in the EU.</P>
    <P>This strategy document is designed to achieve these goals in a systematic and sustained manner. Department officials are currently drafting an action plan which will identify key recommendations which can be implemented in a planned and structured manner. While it is felt that it will take five years to implement the 211 recommendations, I am pleased to announce that £12 million will be available in the year 2000 for the first year of this programme. This will be used to fund a range of initiatives during the year which will have a full year cost of some £24 million. This additional funding will be the foundation for the implementation process of some of the more immediate recommendations across the health services. Progress will be achieved next year in health promotion, primary care, pre-hospital care, hospital care and in the area of audit and evaluation. The full implementation of the cardiovascular health strategy will cost upwards of <Col N="1851" /> £150 million with an investment of £70 million required over the next three years.</P>

    <P>There have been substantial developments in the care and treatment of patients with cancer throughout the country over the last number of years. Considerable improvements have taken place in this area since the launch in November 1996 of the national cancer strategy, and the announcement in March 1997 of the action plan to implement the strategy.</P>
    <P>In order to achieve the objectives set out in the cancer strategy, some £26 million has been allocated between 1997 and 1999 to develop a range of cancer services throughout the country. I have allocated further cancer funding of £11.464 million to the health agencies for 2000. This will ensure the continued development of the cancer services in line with the strategy.</P>
    <P>The main areas in which improvements have taken place to date are as follows: funding for 22 additional consultant appointments in the areas of medical oncology, haematology, palliative care and histopathology since 1997; screening programmes, including the national breast screening programme, which has commenced, and the forthcoming national cervical screening programme; the national cancer registry published its third national report on the incidence of and mortality from cancer in Ireland. I have provided funding of over £100,000 to enable the registry to develop a data analysis and research programme; a review of counselling services throughout the country, which is a very important element in the treatment of patients with cancer, was funded and carried out by the Eastern Health Board; and 24 cancer liaison nurses were funded and appointed in the Eastern Health Board area to improve and enhance the integration and co-ordination of the treatment of cancer patients.</P>
    <P>The National Cancer Forum submitted a report to me outlining the developments under the cancer strategy and highlighting many of the future needs of the cancer services. I am aware that many of the developments mentioned already have resulted in further demands being put on the services available. The particular areas needing further consideration include radiotherapy services, symptomatic breast cancer services, specialist oncology nurse training and education, and palliative care and counselling services. <Col N="1853" /> These areas are currently being examined by my Department. The funding of £11.464 million which I have allocated for cancer services in 2000 will be of importance in this regard.</P>
    <P>I am confident that cancer services in Ireland are developing in an appropriate, co-ordinated and integrated fashion. I am pleased to report that we are making good progress in achieving the objectives of the strategy. I am committed to ensuring that cancer patients in Ireland, wherever they live, will have a high quality cancer treatment service available to them.</P>

      <P>At any time the levels of attendance at accident and emergency departments of acute hospitals are complex and difficult to predict with any degree of accuracy and in this regard all accident and emergency departments experience periods of exceptional demand. Although delays are unavoidable during such periods appropriate medical treatment is provided at all times.</P>
      <P>It is the responsibility of each health agency to ensure that adequate arrangements are in place to meet any additional demand for health services, including accident and emergency services, over the millennium period.</P>
      <P>The overall strategy being employed by health boards over the millennium period is to provide appropriate levels of services at primary care and community care level and thereby avoid unnecessary demands on the accident and emergency departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1856" /> Acute hospitals providing accident and emergency services across all health board areas are prepared for a significant increase in demand for accident and emergency services over the millennium period. A range of measures aimed at meeting the anticipated increase in demand for accident and emergency services will be introduced by hospitals. These may be summarised as follows: the cancellation of elective admissions over the Christmas-millennium period thereby ensuring that adequate acute beds are available if required for emergency admissions from accident and emergency departments; minor injuries clinics located beside, or adjacent to the accident and emergency departments of major acute hospitals where demand is expected to be highest will be provided to supplement the accident and emergency departments. These clinics, which will be staffed by appropriate trained staff, will deal with all persons presenting with minor injuries and will free-up accident and emergency departments for real emergencies.</P>
    <P>A national public education campaign, national press and television, aimed at increasing general awareness regarding the appropriate use of accident and emergency departments with particular emphasis on persuading persons with minor ailments to attend their general practitioner rather than the accident and emergency department of an acute hospital will shortly be launched by the accident and emergency steering group of the Eastern Health Board. Elsewhere similar campaigns will be launched at area health board level in local newspapers and local radio.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the arrangements which health agencies will have in place, including staffing arrangements, will be adequate to meet the anticipated increase in demand for services.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 183 and 184 together.</P>
      <P>The Government agreed in July last year to the establishment of an office of ombudsman for children. This is a major initiative by the Government and is a further measure to protect and promote the welfare of children in the context of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.</P>
      <P>Heads of a Bill are currently being prepared for Government by the interdepartmental group preparing the national children's strategy with a view to having the necessary legislation in place for the establishment of the office next year. Details of the office will be made public when the Bill is published.</P>
      <P>However, I intend that the office will be independent and will report to the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>It will have two broad functions: promoting the welfare of children generally, including commenting on the impact on children's welfare of legislative proposals; the investigation of issues raised by children.</P>
      <P>It will be important that the ombudsman for children should have a strong promotional role and should provide guidance on future tends in relation to the welfare of children. I intend that the office will have the necessary statutory powers to carry out the proposed role.</P>

In the case of Dungarvan UDC, its year 2000 allocation of £483,953 from the local government fund represents a substantial increase of 26% over its initial 1997 allocation.

The NDP, together with the Community Support Framework, when agreed with the European Commission, and the subsequent Economic Infrastructure Operational Programme, will form the strategic policy context for the provision of national roads over the next seven years. It is a matter for the NRA, within this framework, to promote the more detailed programming of the work required and to manage, in co-operation with local authorities, the planning, design and implementation of individual road development projects.

      <P>It is a statutory function of fire authorities under section 10(2)(c) of the Fire Services Act, 1981 to &ldquo;make adequate provision for the reception of and response to calls for the assistance of the fire brigade&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>At the end of the 1980s a number of initiatives were proposed by fire authorities to my Department, including one for a shared service in the mid-west region, to address difficulties experienced by fire authorities in providing an efficient and cost-effective 999-112 emergency call-receiving service.</P>
      <P>Arising from this, my Department, in its role of developing and co-ordinating the provision of fire services by the fire authorities nationally, proposed that three regional based control centres be developed, in the east, west and Munster, capable of serving the mobilisation and communication needs of all fire authorities in these three regions. As a result, the fire services computer aided mobilisation project was initiated.</P>
      <P>Throughout the 1990s work on developing the project has progressed in the three regions, with creation of management and operating structures, development and agreement of user requirements and technical specifications, provision of buildings, communications and mobilisation infrastructure and staffing etc. In the early stages of the project, when agreement on user requirements and specifications were being developed, my Department chaired a national co-ordinating committee on the matter.</P>
      <P>My Department's input to the overall project continues in its representation on regional management committees and technical liaison groups and the provision of capital funding for the overall project and the application of the associated financial control and cost management procedures.</P>
      <P>Camp West, in common with the other two centres, will provide fire authorities with an efficient, cost-effective and reliable mobilisation and communication system and will ensure that the most appropriate fire brigades, having regard to the location and nature of incidents, are alerted and mobilised promptly and respond efficiently to callouts. The Camp West centre is well advanced and I look forward to its completion and opening in 2000.</P>

      <P>The Government strategy for road safety 1998 to 2002 has set out a range of policies and measures designed to reduce road deaths and serious injuries each by at least 20% by 2002 relative to 1997.</P>
      <P>The first progress report of the high level group on road safety, was published in July 1999 and details progress with implementing the strategy. Copies of that report have been circulated to all Deputies and are also available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>The report notes good progress towards the primary strategy target in the first year: 3% fewer people died on the roads in 1998 than in 1997; 12% fewer people were seriously injured in 1998 than in 1997: this represents the lowest number of serious injuries for this decade and constitutes significant progress towards the five year target of at least 20% reduction. More recent provisional data from an Garda Síochána indicate that there were 377 road deaths in the first 11 months of 1999 compared with 413 in the same period in 1998.</P>
      <P>Progress towards the supporting targets of the strategy has also been made: car and truck speeds were slightly down; there were fewer fatal accidents in the night-time hours, commonly drink related; engineering measures to reduce accidents were implemented at 93 national road locations in 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report also describes progress on key strategy actions scheduled for 1998 and 1999: the use of automatic speed detection systems has been extended and preparations were well advanced for the commissioning of fixed speed cameras; <Col N="1861" /> evidential breath testing for drink driving, scheduled to commence in October 1999, is now operational in four Garda stations and is being progressively extended nationwide; on-the-spot fines have been extended to non-wearing of seat belts and a range of other road safety related offences; and the scheme of a new Road Traffic Bill is being drafted in my Department to provide for a penalty points system. This will be brought before Government at the earliest possible date with a view to publication of the Bill by mid 2000.</P>

      <P>Refugees are entitled to services from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs on the same basis as Irish citizens. The number of refugees who require social welfare services is small compared to the population in general and meeting their needs is not presenting the Department with any significant difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The income maintenance needs of asylum see<Col N="1862" /> kers, that is persons who are awaiting a decision on their claim for refugee status, are met for the most part by health boards which administer the supplementary welfare allowance system on behalf of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. Additional community welfare officer posts and additional office accommodation have been funded by the Department to meet the increased demands being made on health boards in this area.</P>
    <P>For example, the Eastern Health Board asylum unit at the Refugee Applications Centre in Mount Street was recently assigned a further 15 members of staff to deal with the increasing numbers accessing the service.</P>
    <P>With regard to guidelines, discussions took place with health boards during the year on procedures for the processing of applications for SWA for asylum seekers at all health boards. Following these discussions, two circulars were issued detailing the procedures to be followed.</P>
    <P>In an earlier initiative, an interdepartmental committee was set up in May 1993 to examine policy and practices with regard to non-Irish citizens who are resident in the State with particular reference to people who apply for refugee status. This committee drew up guidelines on the procedures for the reception of asylum applicants which were published in June 1996.    </P>
    <P>In line with the guidelines, each health board has nominated a designated community welfare officer to deal with the reception of asylum seekers, to act as a co-ordinator and to provide practical assistance with their special needs. I am satisfied that these guidelines, together with the more recent circulars, provide an adequate framework for health boards in dealing with the income maintenance needs of asylum seekers.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 193 to 195, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The farm assist scheme, which introduced the special arrangements for farmers on low incomes, was provided for in the Social Welfare Act, 1999 and came into operation with effect from 7 April 1999.</P>
      <P>The number of claimants in receipt of small-holders unemployment assistance on 31 December 1998 was 6,559, with an average payment during the year of £74.60 per week.</P>
      <P>On 27 November 1999, there were 6,961 farm assist claims in payment, with a further 341 claims under investigation. In addition, 925 claims were still in payment under the smallholders scheme, making a total of 8,227.</P>
      <P>Former smallholders who opted for farm assist are receiving on average £83 per week, which represents an increase of £8 per week compared with the average payment made under the smallholders scheme.</P>
      <P>New applicants to farm assist are receiving an average payment of £56 per week.</P>
      <P>In 1998, £27.8 million was expended under the smallholders unemployment assistance scheme. The provision, in 1999, for the smallholders unemployment assistance-farm assist scheme was £38 million. The number of applicants to date is less than was envisaged at the time the estimates were drawn up.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that some £32 million will be spent this year under the smallholders unemployment assistance and farm assist schemes. A provision of £38 million has been included in the estimates for these schemes for next year.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that farm assist represents a worthwhile improvement in the financial provision for low income farmers. It is of particular benefit to farm families with children, because of the special disregard in respect of children but also provides increased payments to couples without children and to single farmers on low income.</P>

      <P>The future direction of social welfare rates generally is under continuing review within my Department and all relevant research from the ESRI, Combat Poverty Agency and others such as the national pensions policy initiative will be taken into account in this regard. As I have previously indicated to the House, this must also take account of the wider economic and financial implications as well as complementary developments in other areas of Government policy such as a national minimum wage and the employment action plan. This issue is also addressed by the NESC in its strategy document Opportunities, Challenges and Capacities for Choice which will be an important input into the discussions on a possible successor to Partnership 2000. No doubt, the outcome of these discussions will also make a significant contribution to considerations on social welfare policy and income adequacy in general.</P>
      <P>I would not accept that a direct comparison between the minimum wage and the personal rate of social welfare payments is valid. While it is true that, from next May, the personal rates of a number of social welfare weekly rates of payment will be £77.50, this would be considerably higher where the person has dependants. For example, a person with a dependent spouse or partner and two children would receive £150.90 a week, in addition to child benefit.</P>
      <P>As regards social security rates in other member states of the EU, the information, in so far as it is readily available, is set out in the following table. Figures generally refer to the situation at 1 January 1999. I would point out that some care needs to be taken with these figures, as systems vary significantly from one country to another, for example, in relation to time limits on benefits, different coverage under social insurance and social assistance, and availability of family benefits.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 197 and 198 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1866" /> At end November 1999, 80,874 people aged 60 and over were in receipt of the widow(er)'s contributory pension while a further 16,775 in the same age cohort were in receipt of the widow(er)'s non-contributory pension.</P>
    <P>The widow(er)'s pension schemes which are not age related recognise the particular financial difficulties that arise for people following the death of a spouse. A widowed person may qualify for the widow(er)'s contributory pension under more flexible qualification criteria than apply to the old age contributory pension, namely, payment is based on either the claimant's own or late spouse's social insurance record. In addition, a person may use the full record or the record over the previous three to five years to satisfy the yearly average condition.</P>
    <P>Where a person fails to qualify for a contributory-based widow(er)'s pension, it is open to him/her to apply for either of two means-tested social welfare payments &ndash; namely, the one-par<Col N="1867" /> ent family payment if they have child dependants or the widow(er)'s non &ndash; contributory pension where there are no child dependants.</P>
    <P>As I indicated in my recent budget speech, and following the review of An Action Programme for the Millennium, this Government is committed to extending a pension rate of £100 per week to all social welfare pensions for older people. In this regard, from May 2000, the weekly rate of payment to widow(er)'s contributory pensioners for those aged 66 or over will increase to £89.10 while the maximum personal rate of the widow(er)'s non-contributory pension will be £85.50 per week, as an increase of £7 per week. For those under 66 years of age, the budget has provided for a weekly increase of £4 &ndash; or in percentage terms between 5.2% to 5.6% &ndash; on the maximum personal rates of payment with proportionate increases for those on reduced rates. A person, under 66 years of age, on the maximum rate of the widow(er)'s contributory pension will, from May next, receive £81.10 per week while a person, again under age 66, on the maximum rate of the widow(er)'s non-contributory pension will receive £77.50.</P>
    <P>In addition, I announced major improvements in the way capital will now be assessed for all means-tested pensions whereby the first £10,000 will be disregarded completely, the next £10,000 will be assessed at £1 per £1,000, the subsequent £10,000 at £2 per £1,000 and the balance at £4 per £1,000 thereafter. This measure, effective from October 2000, will substantially benefit many people in preserving their pension payments.</P>
    <P>The death of a partner is always a very difficult time for everyone. Last February, I introduced an enhanced bereavement grant of £500 and, as I announced in my budget speech, I have now decided to provide an additional once-off grant for newly widowed people with dependent children. This is intended to give some breathing space in the immediate aftermath of a bereavement while they begin the process of adapting to their new situation.</P>
    <P>The grant will be a once-off payment of £1,000 payable in respect of deaths which occur on or after the 1 December 1999. The grant will be payable to widows and widowers with dependent children who qualify for a widow(er)'s contributory pension or a one-parent family payment or a bereavement grant payable on the death of their spouse. It is estimated that the payment will benefit over 1,500 widows and widowers each year at a cost of £1.5 million. Payments will commence as early as possible in the new year when the administrative and operational arrangements for the scheme are in place.</P>
    <P>The free schemes are generally available to people living in the State, aged 66 years or over, who are in receipt of a social welfare type payment and to certain people with disabilities under the age of 66 who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments.</P>
    <P>Following the recent budget, the free schemes <Col N="1868" /> will be extended to all persons aged over 75 regardless of income and household composition. In addition, carers in receipt of carer's allowance and carers of people in receipt of prescribed relatives and constant attendance allowance, will also qualify for all free schemes. These improvements will come into effect from October 2000.</P>
    <P>Widows or widowers aged from 60 to 65 whose late spouses had been in receipt of the free schemes retain that entitlement. This is to ensure that households do not suffer a loss of entitlements following the death of a spouse.</P>
    <P>The extension of the free schemes to all widows/ers would have significant cost implications. It would also increase demands for the extension of the free schemes to all persons over the age of 60. This proposal could only be considered in a budgetary context with due regard being paid to the availability of resources and the need to set priorities among the various other competing demands being made on all areas of the social welfare system.</P>
    <P>A fundamental review of the free schemes is being carried out to assess whether the objectives of these schemes are being achieved in the most efficient and effective manner. This includes an examination of the qualifying conditions for the schemes, the target group and the scope for alternative policy arrangements.</P>
    <P>This review which is already at an advanced stage, is being carried out by an official of my Department on secondment, as a visiting research fellow at the Policy Institute, Trinity College, Dublin. It is expected that the research conducted will be published by the Policy Institute in the &ldquo;Trinity Studies in Public Policy&rdquo; series in March 2000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>At 30 November 1999 there were 6,980 appeals on which work was in progress. The following is a breakdown by category: unemployment schemes 1,995; sickness schemes 2,380; pensions 664; one parent family schemes 369; carer's allowances 467; farm assist payments 325; occupational injuries benefits 541; others 239. The appeals process is quasi-judicial and is designed to ensure that every appeal gets full and fair consideration in accordance with principles of natural justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The procedures include the requirement that the grounds of appeal be considered and commented on by the deciding officer. This may involve, for certain schemes, a second examination by a medical assessor of my Department or a further report by a social welfare investigator on matters raised in the appeal. Where conten<Col N="1869" /> tion remains, an oral hearing of the appeal by an appeals officer may be necessary.</P>
    <P>The numbers above are at all stages of the appeals process and include cases ready for attention in the social welfare appeals office, cases under investigation in my Department and also cases in which further evidence is awaited from appellants. Not all appeals will require a determination by an appeals officer as in some cases, arising from further investigation, a revised decision by the deciding officer may be possible. In other cases, the appeal may not be pursued by the appellant.</P>
    <P>The number of appeals received this year, up to the end of November, amounted to 14,425, an increase of almost 13% over the same period last year. The increase in the number of appeals <Col N="1870" /> awaiting attention is being addressed and the appointment of additional appeals officers to deal with the increased workload is under consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The small claims procedure is a special mechanism for dealing with consumer claims within the District Court structure which is designed to handle such claims speedily, inexpensively and informally without involving a solicitor. It is administered by the small claims registrar whose function it is to process the claims and, if possible, reach a satisfactory settlement without the need for a court hearing. Should this prove unsuccessful the claim will go before the District Court judge. The small claims procedure was initially introduced on a pilot basis in 1991 and was extended nationwide in 1993 following on from the success of the pilot scheme. The current fee payable for using the procedure is £6.</P>
      <P>To avail of the procedure a person must have bought goods or services for private use from someone selling them in the course of business. With effect from 1 July 1999 a person may make a claim where the goods or services cost up to £1,000. Claims may be made for bad workmanship or faulty goods as far as most everyday transactions are concerned but not for debts or personal injuries. When the scheme was extended in 1993, the non-return of rent deposits and minor damage to privately-owned property were included.</P>
      <P>Within the, procedure, the person making the claim is called the &lsquo;Applicant' and the person against whom the claim is made is called the &lsquo;respondent'. If a claim is made and is not disputed by the respondent, an order is made for the payment of the amount sought. Should the respondent dispute or counterclaim, the small claims registrar may interview and-or invite both parties to discuss the claim in an effort to reach agreement. If no agreement can be reached the case is listed for court. If the court finds in favour of the applicant, it will make a formal order for the amount claimed. Likewise the procedure provides that if the respondent does not reply to the claim within a set period the clairn is automatically treated as undisputed and an order is made for the amount claimed. Both parties to the case are then notified of the order and if payment is not made, the matter can be referred to the relevant city or county sheriff in Dublin or Cork, or county registrar elsewhere for execution. In the event of the matter being referred to the sheriff a fee of £6 will apply, but this amount will be refunded if the sheriff succeeds in executing the court order. This may be done in any case where a party does not comply with the court order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The small claims procedure is concerned with dispute resolution in an inexpensive and informal <Col N="1873" /> way and contains no provision for punitive action for persons or companies coming before it on a regular basis and, as with other court orders, I have no function in conducting an analysis of the persons or companies against whom awards are made.</P>

      <P>The Courts Service was established on 9 November 1999. One of the functions of the service is to provide, maintain and manage court buildings.</P>
      <P>I am informed that plans are being prepared for the refurbishment of the courthouse in Castlebar in conjunction with Mayo County Council, which is acting on behalf of the Courts Service in relation to this project.</P>
      <P>I understand that preliminary consultations have taken place with court users and it is expected that the accommodation to be provided in the refurbished courthouse will include three substantial courtrooms with adjoining Judges chambers, family law facilities, modern office accommodation with state of the art technology for the staff of the District and Circuit Court, modern accommodation for the barristers and solicitors, consultation-interview rooms, a victim support room and all other ancillary facilities. Proper holding cell facilities will also be provided for prisoners. The building will be fully accessible to people with disabilities.</P>
      <P>I am informed that it is not possible at this stage to provide a precise timescale for the work given the nature of the planning, consultation and tendering processes. However, it is expected that plans will be completed by the end of March next. Tender documents will then be prepared and contractors will be invited to tender for the work. It is expected that, following a tender competition, work will commence on site in the latter part of 2000.</P>
      <P>It is anticipated that approximately £750,000 will be spent on the courthouse project next year, and that the courthouse in Castlebar will be refurbished as quickly as possible to provide modern court facilities to all court users in Castlebar and the surrounding area.</P>

The report of the commission is a lengthy one containing many recommendations which require careful consideration. Already, as one would expect, it has given rise to considerable interest and debate among the public. It is important to allow adequate time for the public to become acquainted with the issues raised and with the recommendations contained in the report. I do not, therefore, intend to make an immediate decision on the question of the allocation of bonus marks for Irish in the leaving certificate. The question of awarding bonus marks to candidates who answer through Irish in the junior certificate will be considered in the light of the arrangements in place for the leaving certificate.</P>

      <P>The assessment of means under the third level student support schemes maintenance grants scheme is based on gross income with certain deductions for specified social welfare and health board payments. When assessing income from self-employment-farming the amount assessed is the adjusted profit-loss for income tax purposes from all self-employment activities, both Irish and foreign, whether they are exempted or relieved from Irish income tax. Capital allowances and other capital related costs, such as interest on borrowings used to purchase fixed assets, are not deductible from the adjusted profit in computing reckonable income for grant purposes. These means test arrangements have been in operation since 1983 and are of general application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finance lease arrangements are an alternative method of funding the acquisition of fixed assets. The lease payments are comprised of two elements; repayment of the purchase outright cost of the asset; and finance charges levied by the lease company. As these two elements are directly related to capital additions, the expenditure is not deductible for higher education grants <Col N="1878" /> purposes. However, expenditure relating to operating leases is deductible in calculating reckonable income for the purposes of the grant.</P>
    <P>As already stated, these means test arrangements have been in operation since 1983 and I have no plans to alter the method of computing reckonable income for the purposes of the student support schemes.</P>
