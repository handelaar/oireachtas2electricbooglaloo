      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business I propose to deal with a number of related notices under Standing Order 31 from Deputies Quinn and Shatter. I propose to call on the Deputies in the order in which they submitted their notices to me. I call first on Deputy Quinn to state the matter of which he has given notice to me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In accordance with the terms of Standing Order 31, I wish to seek leave to move the Adjournment of the Dáil to discuss the following specific and important matter of public interest requiring urgent attention, namely, the need for the Government to outline its proposals to provide emergency cover for hospital patients and others requiring medical care in view of the imminence of the national nursing strike and, particularly, having regard to the failure of the health services employers and the nursing unions to reach agreement on the level of emergency cover and having regard to the consequences for patients of the failure to agree emergency cover, the need for the Government to immediately re-open negotiations with the nurses unions with a view to concluding an agreement capable of averting the strike.</P>

      <P>Sir, I wish to give notice of my intention to seek leave to move the Adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to discuss the following specific and important matter requiring urgent consideration, to ask the Minister for Health and Children the contingency arrangements, if any, being put in place to provide health care and essential hospital services to those who require them should the nurses strike commence on 19 October next.</P>

      <P>I wish to draw the Chair's attention to what was said in this House yesterday. In reply to my request yesterday of the Taoiseach for Government time to discuss this matter, he said there are provisions under Standing Orders if people wish to raise the matter tomorrow and that we will see what happens then. By this afternoon, Sir, many people will already have received notices from hospitals asking them to take their family members home. Handicapped patients are being asked to leave now.

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;concerning the NIB and certain Deputies. Strictly speaking, these are not matters for the Order of Business, but a practice has evolved on the Order of Business in this Dáil and the preceding Dáil that Leaders of parties, which are recognised groups under Standing Orders, have been allowed to ask the Taoiseach of the day a relevant, but brief, question on a topical matter. I will, therefore, allow a brief question from Deputies John Bruton and Ruairí <Col N="544" /> Quinn this morning but, in doing so, I have to point out:</P>
      <P>(i) that these issues may come before the Moriarty tribunal and the standard ruling under Standing Order 56, namely, that the Dáil should not attempt to have a parallel tribunal on these matters, may apply; (ii) it is a long-standing ruling of the Chair that serious charges may be made against a Member only by substantive motion where the whole House has an opportunity to decide on the matter and not by innuendo or otherwise across the floor of the House; and (iii) the initiative for making a personal explanation rests with the Member concerned, not the Chair.</P>
      <P>I ask Members to co-operate with me so that the business of House is conducted in an orderly and fair manner to all Members concerned. I call Deputy John Bruton.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree there is widespread concern that a Deputy, who is a member of Fianna Fáil and a key supporter of the Government, obtained more favourable treatment from a bank as a result of political representations than other clients of that bank would have obtained at that time and that it is a cause of public scandal? Does he also agree it is questionable whether it is appropriate for the Deputy in question to remain as chairman of a committee of this House in the circumstances, particularly a committee which deals directly with the area in which he was engaged in a failed business? Will he agree to ask all other members of the Cabinet to make a similar statement to the one he made last night that he was not one of the persons who made representations to the bank on behalf of the Deputy in question? In asking each Minister to make such a statement, he should also ask them to make it clear that they did not, or if the case was that they did, suggest that the bank might have difficulty in its business if it did not accede to these representations.</P>
      <P>Will he ask the Attorney General to advise him, and through him the House, on whether the Moriarty Tribunal has any jurisdiction in this matter? My reading of the terms of reference suggests it does not because it is confined to payments to named individuals and Deputy Ellis is not a named individual. The suggestion, therefore, that this matter is being referred to the tribunal may be nothing more than a device to prevent legitimate questions being asked about the matter. The Deputy and others may be hiding behind the tribunal rather than facilitating it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to the fact the Taoiseach exonerated himself last night unilaterally from the charge of bringing influence to bear on National Irish Bank and its chief executive, Mr. Lacey, on behalf of Deputy Ellis, will he now ensure that the serving members of his Cabinet exonerate themselves from any such charge, bearing in mind the seriousness of the suggestion <Col N="545" /> implicit in the report yesterday that undue influence of a threatening nature was brought to bear on a bank whose ownership had recently changed and that it would not be in the best interests of the new owners of the bank to effectively jeopardise the survival of the Government? Does he think, as a former Minister for Finance, that direct representations by a Minister for Finance, Deputy Albert Reynolds, who admitted that it probably happened, although he cannot remember it, were appropriate in the circumstances? Will he offer a personal view on the matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, it is a sad fact that a number of serving and former Members of this House have found themselves in financial difficulties. It is a matter of public record that some of them, in common with other members of the community, have been successful in their attempts to have some or all of their debts forgiven by various financial institutions. I am not aware of any facts about the case of Deputy Ellis which make it any different from previous instances involving current or former Deputies. However, if anyone has any evidence to the contrary, it is incumbent on them to furnish it to the Moriarty Tribunal or to state it publicly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>It has nothing to do with the Moriarty Tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We should be careful both inside and outside the House not to give credence to unsubstantiated allegations or reports but to seek to have them examined in an appropriate way. If allegations are made or evidence is brought forward, I will, as Taoiseach and leader of my party, investigate it. However, I have not received any reports.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ellis issued a public statement yesterday through his solicitor about the relief of his debt by National Irish Bank to his benefit following representations to the bank in 1989. That statement has also been furnished to the Moriarty Tribunal and will fall to be considered by that body in the normal way. Deputy John Bruton may or may not be correct as to whether it falls within its terms of reference. That is a matter it must consider. I have checked that with the Attorney General and his view is that the tribunal would have to look to see if it falls&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I expect that both Deputy Ellis and Deputy Albert Reynolds, who also issued a public statement yesterday about this matter, will co-operate fully with any tribunal or questions asked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="546" /> None of my colleagues have given me any information to indicate they made representations and I am sure they would if they did.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Taoiseach ask them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>My office contacted National Irish Bank and was told that it has instituted a search of its records. As of now, it has not uncovered any record of any contact between Ministers or anyone else in connection with the case of Deputy Ellis. It told my office that if it uncovered any such records, it would inform us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach reconsider his suggestion that this is a fairly normal transaction given that 90 per cent or more of the debt was written off? There have been write-offs but a 90 per cent write-off is almost unprecedented, particularly where an asset of considerable value remained in the possession of the person whose debt was written off. Why has the Taoiseach not asked his Ministers if any of them made representations? Why has he left it to them to come to him? Surely he has a proactive responsibility in regard to this matter? Surely he would regard it as a matter of the gravest concern if an implicit threat was made by any member of his party, whether a current Minister, to this bank about its future operations? Surely that is an issue which Deputy Bertie Ahern, either as Taoiseach or leader of Fianna Fáil, must be willing to address? Was there any suggestion, however slight &ndash; innuendoes suffice in these circumstances &ndash; of difficulties being placed in the way of this bank in its work if it did not make the enormous write-off in this case? Can the Taoiseach satisfy himself and the House on that point?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Taoiseach and his party learned nothing from the saga that resulted in the departure from this House and the Cabinet of former Deputy, Raphael Burke? Bearing in mind that unhappy set of events which resulted in the loss of a seat for the Fianna Fáil Party, will he not directly ask his Cabinet colleagues, who are sitting beside him, rather than institute the &ldquo;up and down every tree&rdquo; routine once again?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Last evening I was going to deal with some of the fallacies advanced as reasons for not joining the Partnership for Peace and give the example of a very respected organisation known <Col N="554" /> as AFrI which recently published a position paper on the matter. It alleges &ldquo;PfP diminishes the role of the UN and diminishes democratic accountability&rdquo; and, therefore, we should not join. That is false. The operations undertaken by members of PfP typically include activities that will increase the ability of those states to prepare for UN peacekeeping operations.</P>
      <P>I refer to items I, Co-operation and Peacekeeping and II, Actions in the Humanitarian Area in the Irish Presentation Document. The Swedish Presentation Document sets out the areas where PfP would be used and that includes contributions to UN operations. The Austrian Presentation Document speaks of enhancing the capabilities of the Austrian armed forces for multi-national co-operation and communication. This includes the ability of the Austrian armed forces to better co-operate with other armed forces in peacekeeping operations, humanitarian efforts, disaster relief and so on. The Swiss Presentation Document refers to training of military observers and training in logistics for peacekeeping operations. They are some examples. Far from the PfP having any effect in diminishing the role of the United Nations, the road chosen by most members of PfP has been to use the co-operation in PfP to enhance their ability to co-operate with the UN. There is no interference in democratic accountability because membership of PfP does not interfere with the normal parliamentary procedures under which Governments are made accountable in their respective member states.</P>
      <P>It is frequently alleged, and Deputy O'Kennedy alleged the last evening, that PfP is a conspiracy on the part of states that have arms manufacturing industries to encourage others to buy more arms. That is utter nonsense. It is ludicrous. The people who claim to have uncovered that conspiracy speak darkly about provisions on inter-operability and armaments co-operation. These are seen as part of the conspiracy. Inter-operability is needed to make UN operations more effective. That is dealt with in the Irish Presentation Document and in a great deal of the comments made on the advantages of PfP. Inter-operability helps to make UN operations more efficient.</P>
      <P>Armaments co-operation is presented by some of these critics as being another part of the conspiracy. I invite them to rejoin the real world and look at what is intended by armaments co-operation. If one looks at the literature, armaments co-operation even among the major states is most often seen as a way of restricting the growth of military and defence budgets. Countries co-operate between themselves, very unsuccessfully, in arms production and the development of modern weapon systems in order to reduce the burden on their national exchequers by sharing research and development costs. Far from arms co-operation being seen as a means of inducing other people to buy more arms, it is a method of holding down the level of expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="555" /> It is dishonest to talk about the international sale of arms in this connection as if it were only sellers and manufacturers of arms who persuade the hapless regimes of otherwise innocent countries to buy arms. Any sale takes a willing seller and a willing buyer. There are willing buyers of arms of all kinds all over the world. Our joining PfP does not reduce our ability to co-operate, as we have been doing, in efforts at UN level to draw up more stringent and constraining codes of practice for the sale of arms throughout the world. If we are serious about the kind of things Deputy O'Kennedy trotted out last night in regard to dealing with the international arms trade, we will not achieve that by simply refusing to join PfP and pontificating sanctimoniously, as he does, from the sidelines. We will do it by continuing to be involved in the UN and in other international fora in an attempt &ndash; it is a difficult enterprise &ndash; to get a better degree of international support for codes of practice in relation to the arms trade.</P>
    <P>It is sometimes alleged that we should not join PfP because it is the wrong organisation for us to be in if we are interested in peace, and that we should work within the OSCE instead. That is dishonest because the PfP has a totally different role and vocation from the OSCE, and it is dishonest to pretend the OSCE can in any way help to prepare countries for involvement in peacekeeping or humanitarian operations in the way that PfP can. OSCE is an entirely separate organisation with a different mandate which operates independently of and unaffected by the PfP. The regrettable fact is that the OSCE, valuable as it is, and other structures we have for the promotion of peace sometimes fail, as they did in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Kosovo, East Timor, Somalia, Rwanda, Burundi, Angola and so many other places around the world. We need to be ready and equipped for the kinds of intervention that seem necessary in those places and PfP is an important part of that enterprise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is recommending that Ireland should participate in Partnership for Peace because we believe it is in the national interest to do so and because it will enable us to make an enhanced contribution to international peace and security.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We also owe it to our Defence Forces to allow them co-operate freely with the forces of other countries with whom we have close ties in peacekeeping and humanitarian tasks. We have much to be proud of in the contribution of our Defence Forces at home and abroad and the way they have conducted themselves during many difficult missions over the past 40 years. They have enhanced Ireland's reputation over several decades. It is the unanimous view, not just of those who command defence forces but right through their officers and ranks, that Ireland should join Partnership for Peace to enhance their ability to co-operate with others. The view of serving per<Col N="556" /> sonnel has great weight with me as I have a sincere regard for their loyalty and professionalism and the service they have given to the State since its foundation as one of its most important institutions.</P>
    <P>Ireland is not, nor is it about to become, a heavily armed nation. Diplomacy, rather than arms, has always been our primary focus in protecting our national security. In terms of equipment, the Defence Forces have what they need to operate with and very little more. Their ability to cope has sometimes been taken too much for granted by successive Governments. A planned approach over the next ten years, as will be set out in the forthcoming Defence White Paper by the Minister for Defence, Deputy Smith, will, I hope, succeed in remedying most of the serious deficiencies in terms of what is required for today's tasks. This need not involve any significant real rise in defence spending but simply a more productive use of existing resources when we are able to put the backlog of army deafness cases behind us.</P>
    <P>Those who argue against our participation in PfP, or who wish to prevaricate on the question, are denying our Defence Forces the freedom to prepare for peacekeeping and humanitarian tasks with the forces of other countries.</P>

      <P>Ireland, as a country with a long experience of peacekeeping, has much to give as well as to receive in this area. Today, these tasks are the main focus of activity for every developed country now that the traditional task of military alliances has gone into abeyance with the absence of the identifiable threat from a rival bloc. It would be tragic if Ireland were to be left behind because of political inhibitions that in part relate to another era and that take no account of the huge changes in the world that have happened in the past decade.</P>

      <P>Our sole motivation as a Government is to enhance Ireland's contribution to peacekeeping and the capacity of our Defence Forces for that purpose. I wish to make it clear that we are not acting under political pressure of any kind. Frankly, it is not a matter of great importance to other countries whether we participate in PfP; nobody outside this country has ever mentioned it to me. There are no economic reasons for participation. While on a few occasions in the past foreign ministers of other European countries have successfully attempted to establish linkages between a common European defence policy and, say, participation in monetary union or levels of Structural Funds, the fact is we are already participating in the single currency and we concluded our Agenda 2000 negotiations in March without reference to security issues. People should dismiss any notion of plots, conspiracies or hidden agendas about which a small group of people, who are trying to whip up public paranoia, keep talking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>Who are those people?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We have no intention of accepting membership of any nuclear-based alliance such as NATO. We want to see the world rid of nuclear weapons. A mutual defence pact is not even on the agenda of the European Union's common foreign and security policy. All the evidence currently available suggests that, for the foreseeable future, NATO will provide as necessary for the collective defence of its European member countries, without duplication in practice by any other organisation.</P>
      <P>Every other European neutral country, including Switzerland, participates in Partnership for Peace. While NATO membership has been the subject of heated political debate in Austria, PfP has been utterly non-controversial in all other European neutral countries, including Switzerland. There is no cause for Ireland to become, at this stage, even more neutral than the neutrals. Partnership for Peace is not undermining the UN or the OSCE. It is complementary to both of them. Regionally-led peacekeeping forces are becoming more and more the norm, as we can see in East Timor.</P>
      <P>This is not the first Government to have come to the conclusion that participation in Partnership for Peace is in Ireland's interest. The rainbow coalition's White Paper on Foreign Policy set out the case and came to the conclusion that the overall objectives of PfP are consistent with Ireland's approach to international peace and security, and that &ldquo;it does not involve membership of NATO, the assumption of any mutual defence commitment or any commitment or obligation in relation to future membership of NATO&rdquo;. The rainbow White Paper went on to state: &ldquo;Objectively speaking, participation on appropriate terms would not therefore affect in any way Ireland's policy of neutrality nor would it prejudice or pre-empt Ireland's approach to discussions in the D509&ndash;A13</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="558" />  European Union on a common defence policy&rdquo;. The White Paper stated that the Government had decided to explore further the benefits Ireland might derive from participation in PfP and to determine the contribution that Ireland might make.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dick Spring, who was a much respected Minister for Foreign Affairs, issued the White Paper and told the Dáil on several occasions during Question Time, when I was in the House, that &ldquo;there was neither a basis nor a need for a referendum on participation in PfP&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be fair to acknowledge that the Fine Gael Party has adhered to its position in Government but I have to ask if the Labour Party is now repudiating the clear and unequivocal policy position that Deputy Spring held as Minister for Foreign Affairs? It seems the Labour Party leadership has decided to play politics with the issue, partly as a means of papering over differences in its own ranks. More rein has now been given to the Marxist-inspired anti-Americanism that was the constant hallmark of the Workers' Party and Democratic Left, with the former leader of both now the foreign affairs spokesperson, as well as the president, of the amalgamated Labour Party. To be fair to Deputy De Rossa, he has found a close ally in Deputy Michael D. Higgins and together they have succeeded in modifying, if not reversing, the previous position of the Labour Party in Government.</P>
      <P>If the former Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Spring, was right in saying there was no need or basis for a referendum, then the only issue is one of politics. Our legal advice is clear as set out in the Government explanatory guide. The commitments involved are political and voluntary. They do not place us under any binding obligations in international law. The explanatory guide has been made freely available to anyone requesting it, and if there is public confusion it is primarily because some groups have wanted to create such confusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is perfectly true that Fianna Fáil in Opposition was sceptical about the matter. To put that in context, the rainbow coalition was led by a party, some of whose leaders and former leaders and leading spokespersons have been indifferent or hostile to Irish neutrality and who, from time to time, have expressed the view that Ireland should have joined the allies in World War II and become full members of NATO and-or the Western European Union. There was, therefore, an understandable distrust of long-term intention which, in some instances, may go further than is proposed by this Government. I approve the Fine Gael amendment that any alteration to the Pres<Col N="559" /> entation Document should be brought before this House for approval.</P>
    <P>It is in the election manifesto, not any earlier speech in Opposition, which constitutes what a party finally puts to the electorate. In our election manifesto it is correct to say that we opposed Irish participation in PfP, and we promised: &ldquo;Fianna Fáil in Government will not participate in any co-operative security structure which has implications for Irish neutrality without first consulting the people through a referendum&rdquo;. The full quotation is rarely given because it is a qualified, not an unconditional, commitment. I have on more than one occasion stated in this House that, in a speech during the general election campaign and before the people voted, I expressed an interest in Ireland participating in the newly formed Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council. This development in May and June of 1997 in particular and the emergence of PfP as an important framework in its own right have made PfP participation more attractive from our point of view, and it has also rendered somewhat out of date many of the previous comments about PfP by some NATO spokespersons, who are consistently quoted by its opponents.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Because we have a concern for electoral proprieties, we took the opportunity of the European Parliament elections, which I promised we would do in this House, to set out our changed position on PfP participation so that the people would be democratically consulted before a decision was taken. This superseded what we had said at the last general election. Any party is entitled to change its position, if it puts it to the electorate. The people were consulted in the same way as they are consulted about most issues at elections. Having explained the background to PfP, we stated that we intended to negotiate participation in Partnership for Peace by the autumn. Our manifesto &ndash; it was almost the sole issue discussed the day I launched it at a party press conference in a hotel near Leinster House &ndash; went on to state: &ldquo;Such a decision would have no implications for our neutrality and no constitutional implications, and will be taken on the basis of the mandate received by the parties favouring participation standing in the European Elections.&rdquo;  We made our intentions absolutely clear to the people. If they had a fundamental objection to Irish participation in PfP, they had the option of voting accordingly, and they did not do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It has also been a long-standing feature of our democracy that foreign policy is made by the Government and the Dáil. When Éamon de Valera introduced the Constitution on 11 May 1937, he stated that Article 29 dealing with international relations &ldquo;puts the question of our international relations in their proper place &ndash; and that is outside the Constitution&rdquo;. He distinguished matters of foreign policy from &ldquo;fundamental rights&rdquo;. To the extent that the European treaties have implications for sovereignty and European legislation may in certain instances impinge on fundamental rights, it has been necessary to put successive treaty revisions before the people. If we were ever to join a military alliance, which would commit us to automatic participation in war if another member country were attacked, that would necessitate a change to Article 29 and a referendum, as the power of making peace or war would effectively be removed from Dáil Éireann. That, however, is not the situation. PfP does not involve us in any binding defence obligations. Its character is of an entirely positive and beneficent character, and I challenge anyone to point out a single PfP activity to date involving other countries that has had a negative or harmful effect.</P>

Fortunately, in the case of East Timor, diplomatic and economic pressure proved effective. Reflecting on the League of Nations, de Valera said in 1946 that if there was to be an alternative to futile discussion &ldquo;there must be a method by which effective forcible action will be taken&rdquo;.

The second is whether it is appropriate and politically acceptable that this should be done without reference to the people, especially having regard to the commitments given by the main Government party, Fianna Fáil, when it was in Opposition.</P>
      <P>I want to deal with the second issue first. Political parties change their policies all the time. It would be ludicrous to suggest that parties cannot change their position. If that were the case, politics would stand still, frozen in a bizarre time warp. It is a totally different situation, however, when a party says to the electorate during an election campaign, &ldquo;If you vote for us, X will not happen&rdquo;. It is a totally different situation where an Opposition party says to the electorate, &ldquo;If you vote for us, X will not happen without your view being established through a referendum&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is exactly what has happened in regard to Fianna Fáil and Partnership for Peace. It has already been quoted in this debate, but I will quote again what the Fianna Fáil manifesto for the June 1997 general election said. In that manifesto, Fianna Fáil said it would &ldquo;oppose Irish participation in . NATO-led organisations like Partnership for Peace&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will also quote again one of a number of significant things the current Taoiseach said during <Col N="563" /> the debate on the White Paper on Foreign Policy in March 1996. That White Paper indicated the Government would consider the matter of membership of PfP. Speaking of PfP, he said:</P>
    <P>We would regard any attempt to push Partnership for Peace or participation in Western European Union tasks by resolution through this House without reference to the people who, under our Constitution have the right &ldquo;in final appeal to decide on all questions of national policy&rdquo; [not just questions of constitutional issues, but questions of national policy] as a serious breach of faith and fundamentally undemocratic . any sleight of hand trying to put it through the House would be fundamentally undemocratic.</P>
    <P>Based on what the Taoiseach said on that occasion, what the Government is asking us to do in this motion is &ldquo;fundamentally undemocratic&rdquo; and a &ldquo;sleight of hand&rdquo;. Regardless of how the Government may have changed its mind about the policy issue of Partnership for Peace, it is another matter entirely to claim, on the one hand while in opposition, that something is fundamentally undemocratic and should be referred to the people and then, within a few months of getting into Government, say that is not so. For any party to renege on such a solemn pre-election commitment is to further undermine public confidence in political parties and create further cynicism about the political process.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge that the legal advice available to the Government is that no constitutional amendment is required. Similar advice was available to the last Government and was known when the Taoiseach was cynically trying to sweep up extra votes by pledging to hold a referendum. What has changed since March 1996? The only thing which has changed is that Fianna Fáil was then in Opposition seeking votes and is now back in Government and feels it no longer need the votes of those it misled on this issue. Given what has happened in relation to the pledges made and broken by Fianna Fáil on Partnership for Peace, what credence can the public attach to other commitments given by Fianna Fáil, especially those given by the Taoiseach? When he says that there is no question of Ireland joining NATO, how can we be sure this commitment will not be set aside in time, as others have been, if Fianna Fáil considers it politically expedient to do so, as it may well do?</P>
    <P>There is no reason a plebiscite could not be held to determine the views of the people on what both supporters and opponents of PfP agree is a significant development in international relations for this country. It would appear that formal amendment of the constitution does not arise in the context of Partnership for Peace, but it is the view of the Labour Party that this issue is of such significance that it should be referred for decision to the people. While a consultative plebiscite of the type provided for in the Labour <Col N="564" /> Party's Private Members' Bill is not referred to or provided for in the Constitution, there is no constitutional bar or impediment to holding a plebiscite.</P>
    <P>Plebiscites have been held in other countries from time to time. The most recent and the one with which the people would be most familiar was the plebiscite held in Northern Ireland seeking public endorsement of the terms of the Good Friday Agreement. While the outcome of a plebiscite would not be legally binding in the way that a constitutional referendum would be, no Government could ignore the views of the people expressed in this way. As a democrat and someone who has expressed strong reservations about the proposal to join PfP, I have no hesitation in saying that I would accept without qualification the view of the people expressed through a plebiscite.</P>
    <P>There is compelling evidence that the people wish to be consulted on this matter. The failure of the Government to honour its pledges is emerging as an issue, even at this early stage, in the Dublin South-Central by-election. The queue of Fianna Fáil backbenchers lining up to put clear water between themselves and their leader on this U-turn is also as a result of the reaction they have received from their own members and supporters. In addition, the only poll, to my knowledge, which asked people their views on a referendum &ndash; the MRBI poll in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 14 May &ndash; showed an overwhelming majority in favour of holding a plebiscite.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Taoiseach has taken time to re-read his speech to the Dáil on 28 March 1996, but if he has done, I hope he cringed with embarrassment. Apart from making a pledge he clearly had no intention of keeping, he also pandered to the most conservative and chauvinistic forces in Irish society and engaged in a sort of scaremongering which makes rational debate on PfP and related issues more difficult. In 1992 during the Maastricht debate, and again during the debate on the Amsterdam Treaty, there were those who obscured the important issues by talking in emotive terms about young Irish people being sent home in body bags if the people voted &ldquo;yes&rdquo;. In much the same emotive vein, the Taoiseach spoke in his March 1996 contribution of &ldquo;British troops back in the Curragh, the French in Bantry Bay, the Germans in Banna Strand, the Spanish in Kinsale and the Americans in Lough Foyle&rdquo;. All that was missing from his speech was the old Fianna Fáil spectre of the RUC on the streets of Tralee.</P>
    <P>The proposal to join Partnership for Peace and other issues that this country will face in regard to European security and defence require serious, rational debate. The sort of contribution made by the Taoiseach had nothing to offer in this regard, and was the kind of cynical manipulation for which Fianna Fáil is renowned. Perhaps the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, might be better engaged root<Col N="565" /> ing out this Fianna Fáil culture rather than seeking to end our multi-seat electoral system.</P>
    <P>We are living in a period of rapid political change. Within the past ten years we have seen the collapse of the Berlin Wall and the map of eastern Europe change beyond recognition. New alliances are emerging. We have seen old conflicts that many people thought were long dead re-ignite with terrible results in the former Yugoslavia. The Thatcherite tide that threatened to swamp Europe during the 1980s has now been reversed, and much of Europe now has left or centre-left governments. We have seen the European Union develop at a rapid rate, moving closer to political and economic union, with the enactment of the Maastricht Treaty, agreement on the Amsterdam Treaty and the coming into effect from 1 January this year of the single currency. Attitudes are changing, positions are being re-examined and views are evolving. For example, we now have a Green Minister for Foreign Affairs in Germany who attends and participates at meetings of NATO Foreign Ministers. In this rapidly changing world it is simply not sustainable to repeat a meaningless mantra about the so-called sacredness of Irish neutrality as if we were still in the midst of the Second World War or still trapped deep in the dark days of the Cold War.</P>
    <P>Despite our neutrality, Ireland has never been an isolationist country. As far back as the 1930s Ireland was an active member of the League of Nations. We have been a member of the United Nations for 40 years. Ireland has served on the Security Council of the United Nations and, on one occasion, provided the President of the General Assembly. Irish troops have served with distinction in virtually every continent on the globe. Irish Foreign Ministers, such as Dick Spring, have served with distinction as President of the EU Council of Foreign Ministers and in that role have helped to broker solutions to many international disputes. The current Minister for Foreign Affairs won widespread praise for his role as EU observer for the referendum in East Timor in August.</P>
    <P>I make these points to emphasise that to have reservations about membership of Partnership for Peace, as I have, is not to be isolationist or backward looking. As a member of the European Parliament elected to represent the interests of the people of Dublin and as a firm supporter of deeper European integration, I accept that the process on which the EU has now embarked will lead to a common defence and security architecture for the community. As a member state of the EU which has benefited financially and socially from membership and where support for each of the developments in the Union has been approved by significant majorities at successive referenda, we must be willing to play an active part in this evolving process, both in forming it and participating in it.</P>
    <P>However, it must be emphasised that membership of PfP and the development of an appropri<Col N="566" /> ate defence and security architecture for the EU are separate and distinct issues. PfP is a creation of NATO, not of the European Union. I have great reservations about any closer connections between this country and NATO because I believe it is an anachronistic military alliance which retains as the central plank of its military strategy the threatened use of nuclear weapons. I do not have to quote any half-baked general about this. All one has to do is visit the NATO website and one will find hundreds of documents outlining the strategy of NATO and its dependence upon not only nuclear but also chemical and biological weapons. It is a disgrace that the Government produces a motion in the House and a guide for Partnership for Peace without examining the role which NATO sees for itself in the world and Europe, the type of defence posture it adopts and the type weapons it proposes to use against any, not just nuclear, attack on its allies. We need to debate that and not pretend it does not exist. It would be far preferable to have a European security structure subject to the European Union rather than the domination of European security affairs by NATO, which is not accountable to the people. The major advantage of such a structure is that it would ultimately be subject to the democratic checks and balances of the EU Council &ndash; the member states &ndash; and the European Parliament.</P>
    <P>There have been a number of myths about the supposed consequences of staying out of PfP. The most common suggestion has been that Irish troops would be in some way excluded from participation in international peacekeeping operations. This is an unfounded fear. All the peacekeeping or peace enforcement operations in which Irish troops have participated have been under UN mandate. Irish troops left today for East Timor without Ireland being a member of PfP. Irish troops have served in Bosnia and are serving in Kosovo under a UN mandate, but under NATO command on the ground, without Ireland being a member of PfP. There is no reason this should change.</P>
    <P>There are a number of points arising from both the Government explanatory guide to PfP and the Presentation Document to which I would like to refer. One of the most significant shortcomings of the guide was its failure to offer any explanation of what NATO is or provide any analysis of its role in the modern world. It says that PfP is a voluntary and co-operative framework for regional security and co-operation between NATO and individual non-members of NATO. Should we not, at least, try to offer some analysis of the role of NATO? Does NATO have any current relevance with the ending of the Cold War and the demise of the Warsaw Pact? If NATO is a defensive organisation, who exactly is it defending its member states against? Are we happy that NATO could, as was the case in Kosovo, launch what was the biggest military offensive in Europe since the end of the Second World War without any mandate from the UN? <Col N="567" /> Do we believe that NATO is entitled to engage in &ldquo;out of territory&rdquo; operations? None of these issues were dealt with in the guide book issued by the Government.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Presentation Document, I note that it seems to go considerably further than other European neutrals in regard to commitment to peacekeeping and peace enforcement operations. I am particularly concerned that there is no specific commitment in the Presentation Document that Ireland will participate only in peacekeeping or enforcement operations mandated by the United Nations. There is no requirement that such operations be mandated by the EU or even the OSCE. It seems from this document that Ireland could participate in operations &ldquo;mandated&rdquo; only by NATO. This is a significant and unwelcome departure in terms of Irish foreign policy.</P>
    <P>It is also significant that the Government has accepted the amendment tabled by Fine Gael which specifies that &ldquo;any future amendment to the areas of participation by Ireland in PfP as outlined in the Presentation Document will be put before the Dáil for approval&rdquo;. Are we to assume from this that had not this amendment been accepted, then the Government would have been free to unilaterally change the terms of our involvement with PfP without any reference to the Dáil? Why does the motion not refer to the fact that the agreement with NATO is for three years, and is then subject to review?</P>
    <P>In the light of this it would have been far preferable for our proposed membership of PfP to have been governed by legislation passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas, rather than a simple motion.</P>

      <P>I need just about a minute more, if I could have your indulgence, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle. If we are going to join an organisation like PfP, then it is essential that the terms and conditions on which we join must be covered by primary legislation.</P>
      <P>I accept that the issues raised by the proposal to enter PfP and issues relating to European security and defence are complex and difficult matters. I fully respect those, especially on the left, who take a different view to me. It is important that we continue a rational debate on these issues.</P>
      <P>However, there is no difficulty about saying that when a party cynically promises to do one thing in opposition and then cynically does the direct opposite in Government, politics and democracy are damaged. Whatever the outcome of this motion &ndash; and it does not seem in doubt given the position adopted by Fine Gael &ndash; Fianna Fáil, through its handling of this issue, has done serious damage to politics and further undermined people's confidence in politicians.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak in the House today in support of the Government's motion concerning participation by Ireland in Partnership for Peace. For some considerable time now I have been convinced of the benefits for Ireland of such participation and have been forthright in advocating that we join PfP. The Irish have always had an international outlook. One has only to recall the conviction, the spirit and the sphere of influence of the monks and scholars of Ireland who were drawn in centuries past to mainland Europe and further afield to share their faith, their learning and their scholarly excellence and in return to bring honour and prestige to their country. One can draw parallels with Ireland's proud tradition of peacekeeping under United Nations mandate. The United Nations has been the cornerstone of Irish foreign policy since we joined that organisation in 1955. Ireland has unfailingly supported the efforts of the UN in the many areas of its worthy activities but most significantly, through the generous response of the Irish people to the call to contribute to peacekeeping and peace support missions. Ireland's contribution to UN peacekeeping matches the best in the world. We continue to be called on to provide such support. PfP is not in conflict with our traditional support for UN peacekeeping operations. It will enhance our capacity to contribute to such operations. Neither will it affect our commitment to peacekeeping outside of Europe.</P>
      <P>New and transformed co-operative structures are being developed for more effective conflict prevention and crisis management. It is important that effective strategies for conflict prevention, crisis management and peacekeeping are developed and sustained in order to build stability and security in Europe. Increasingly, regional organisations such as NATO, are being mandated by the UN to undertake peacekeeping, peace support and humanitarian tasks. The obvious examples are SFOR in Bosnia Herzegovina and KFOR in Kosovo where personnel of the Defence Forces contribute to the missions there. It is in these types of situations that Ireland can benefit from participation in PfP, because much of the preparation and training for these new style missions is undertaken by countries under the auspices of PfP.</P>
      <P>PfP is but one element in the development of these new inclusive co-operative security arrangements in Europe. It is a truly co-operative approach to security with the stated aim of intensifying political and military co-operation in Europe, promoting stability, reducing threats to peace and building strengthened relationships by promoting practical co-operation amongst its participants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While initially it was felt that PfP appeared to be geared to countries aspiring to eventual membership of NATO, it has since been joined by most OSCE countries, including Russia and the former Soviet Republics, as well as neutral coun<Col N="569" /> tries such as Sweden, Finland, Austria and Switzerland. Currently, 43 states participate in PfP. PfP was to a certain extent devised as an instrument which would assist in coming to terms with the post &ndash; Cold War situation in Europe after the dismantling of the Warsaw pact.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>And as an alternative to enlarging NATO.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The development of structures such as PfP, therefore, can be said to reflect the need felt by some countries arising from the current transitional nature of European security. The emphasis has now shifted away from territorial defence towards issues of conflict prevention, peacekeeping, crisis management and the security threats posed by international crime. Similarly, the approach in the Amsterdam Treaty reflects the trend away from territorial defence with its focus on the Petersberg Tasks of peacekeeping and crisis management. The Petersberg Tasks were conceived in the context of support for the efforts of the United Nations and the Organisation for Security and Co-Operation in Europe, OSCE, and the European Union is now seeking to develop them under the Amsterdam Treaty. Ireland has been a strong supporter of this important development and looks forward to its provisions becoming effective. It must be borne in mind here that much of the planning and development for the Petersberg Tasks is now also being carried out by countries under PfP programmes. History teaches us that nothing ever remains the same and, as the nature of security threats change, so too do the responses that are called for to deal with such threats and changes. They need to change and adapt in the light of experience. The benefits for Ireland of the opportunity to participate in programmes such as PfP is, therefore, self-evident.</P>
      <P>The new European security architecture is essentially a continent-wide undertaking in collective security in the new and emerging European relations. Within this architecture, PfP is a voluntary, flexible and non-binding co-operative security framework, between NATO and individual states which are not members of NATO. It is this very flexible nature of the arrangement, which has attracted so many countries to participate. In addition, PfP can be said to have built on the United Nations Charter. It is recognised that no one state or institution can by itself deal with the complex and diverse challenges to security in the post &ndash; Cold War world. It is said that no man is an island. The old Gaelic expression &ldquo;ar scath a chéile a mhaireann na daoine&rdquo; holds as true today of the need for countries to support the efforts of collective security to meet modern day threats as it did in times past in relation to the dependency of the Irish communities on each other for support in saving their harvests or, in sharing the basic necessities of life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recent turmoil in the former Yugoslavia is probably the best example of the new approach <Col N="570" /> of mutually reinforcing co-operation between a range of institutions, for example, the UN, the EU, NATO, the OSCE, the Western European Union, Western European Union, and the Council of Europe. As Minister for Defence, I am pleased our Defence Forces have been able to play a part in that troubled region. I have seen at first hand the fruits of their endeavours in Sarajevo and I have been proud of their contribution. I have also seen clearly there, and in Lebanon, that military tasks go hand in hand with humanitarian ones.</P>
    <P>Partnership for Peace has been complemented by the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council, which includes all members of PfP. The EAPC grew out of consultations involving members of PfP who felt the need for a new multinational consultation framework at political level, which was not limited to members of NATO or the former Warsaw Pact alliance. Membership of EAPC is open to all OSCE states which have subscribed to PfP's Framework Document. Ireland will participate in the EAPC on joining PfP. The EAPC and PfP can be described as instruments of collective co-operation.</P>
    <P>Participation in PfP will not involve membership of NATO and will not bring Ireland into any form of alliance involving mutual defence commitments. Neither will it constitute or imply any undertaking or intention to become a member of NATO at any time in the future. There is nothing in the Framework Document which suggests otherwise. Participation in PfP will not affect Ireland's long-standing policy of military neutrality. A policy of military neutrality must be matched by a willingness to engage with other countries in the necessary collective efforts that are required to meet the security challenges of today and of the years ahead.</P>
    <P>All along, Ireland's willingness to participate in UN peacekeeping missions has been motivated by a firm belief that we have a moral imperative to assist our fellow human beings, to put it simply, to play our part. The same now applies to Partnership for Peace. The overall objectives of PfP are consonant with Ireland's approach to international peace and European security. It involves voluntary and non-binding co-operation. Its objectives are in tune with how we see Ireland continuing to be a significant player in the field of international relations.</P>
    <P>Ireland's proposed Presentation Document, which is before the House today, sets out the areas of co-operation envisaged for the Defence Forces. These include peacekeeping and humanitarian tasks which are in line with traditional and long standing involvement and experience in those worthy areas of service to others. Considerable benefits will accrue to the Defence Forces in terms of training opportunities and the experience that participation in PfP activities will afford them. These areas are expanding progressively.</P>
    <P>Partnership for Peace will allow the Defence Forces to upgrade their skills and to improve their capability for multinational peacekeeping <Col N="571" /> operations in the future through the medium of interoperability development, training and exercises. In particular, membership would enhance the Defence Forces capacity to conduct modern peacekeeping operations with other military forces in an era in which the nature and scope of such peacekeeping missions is changing.</P>
    <P>The United Nations has undergone a critical change in how it organises and implements peacekeeping and peace support missions. Increasingly, it is mandating regional organisations to conduct those missions on its behalf. This new strategy places greater responsibility on participating nations to examine their forces' self-sufficiency in training, equipment and operating proficiency. The Defence Forces must be given the opportunity to respond to these critical changes if Ireland is determined to continue to play a leading role as a contributing nation to international peacekeeping operations.</P>
    <P>The Defence Forces, in turn, have much to offer to other participating states in terms of the cumulative experience and insight which they have gained over many years in a wide variety of peacekeeping missions. Defence Forces facilities which could be made available for training purposes include the United Nations Training School and a language laboratory at the Curragh with associated infrastructure and courses. All of this is reflected in the Presentation Document.</P>
    <P>The experience and expertise of the Defence Forces in the field of peacekeeping is well recognised by many countries who undoubtedly will seek to benefit from it under Partnership for Peace. This experience will be readily imparted to those countries and, as a result, this will give Ireland an influence in how peacekeeping operations will be conducted in the future. When I visited ESFOR and held discussions with representatives of the defence forces from other countries, especially NATO countries, I became aware of the extent to which they are unfamiliar with the peacekeeping activities and experience of the Irish. We join Partnership for Peace as a country with a significant contribution to make in terms of perhaps influencing and changing others who may not have had peacekeeping and the humanitarian tasks associated with it as high on their agenda as they could and should have. In joining Partnership for Peace we decide what we want to be involved in and what contribution we want to make. This is the principle of self-differentiation and it will allow Ireland the flexibility to control its level of participation in PfP activities.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, and I repeat, Partnership for Peace has developed into a major framework for co-operation, training and preparation for UN mandated peacekeeping, humanitarian tasks and crisis management. The call on the international community, including Ireland, to support peacekeeping missions is stronger than ever today. Oppression of a people, genocide, such as in East Timor, ethnic cleansing and other such abuses all present a challenge to countries such as Ireland, <Col N="572" /> which are thankfully spared such barbarities, and which are in a position to offer help no matter how modest it might appear. Ireland's willingness to participate in missions such as KFOR and INTERFET is motivated as much by a firm belief in the moral obligation which rests on the shoulders of the international community to support the UN in its tireless efforts in conflict prevention and peacekeeping in these troubled spots as by our sense of outrage at the infliction of such suffering on our fellow human beings. Above all, it is motivated by our firm conviction that we must stand beside other nations who respond, and play our part.</P>
    <P>I have long been an advocate of joining Partnership for Peace and I restate that position here in the House today. As the Taoiseach has pointed out, we can make PfP a logical extension of Ireland's foreign policy, not a departure or aberration from the independent foreign policy tradition we have espoused and developed and of which we are rightly proud.</P>

Chuir an Taoiseach dallamhullóg ar an phobal agus ar a lán daoine in a pháirtí féin.</P>
      <P>No Government in recent Irish history has made such a brazen U-turn as that perpetrated by the Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, on the Partnership for Peace, or the partnership for NATO, as it should properly be called. Last week in this Chamber the Taoiseach, in an astonishing remark which went largely unreported in the media, described what was set down clearly in the 1997 Fianna Fáil general election manifesto as a &ldquo;so-called commitment.&rdquo;  This remark showed outright contempt for the electorate, which returned Fianna Fáil to the Dáil as the largest party and the main party in Government. I make no apology for quoting in full the commitment made in the 1997 Fianna Fáil manifesto:</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil are committed to nuclear disarmament. We will oppose any moves to edge Ireland closer to membership of an alliance still committed to the deployment of nuclear weapons. We oppose Irish participation in NATO itself, in NATO-led organisations such as Partnership for Peace, or in the Western European Union beyond observer status.</P>
      <P>Those words could not have been made any clearer. They should be written in giant letters throughout the country to remind the people of the broken promises, the betrayal and the sell-out of Irish neutrality being engineered by Fianna Fáil this week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="573" /> In March 1996 the then leader of the Opposition, Deputy Bertie Ahern, stated that any attempt to join the so-called Partnership for Peace without a referendum would be &ldquo;a serious breach of faith and fundamentally undemocratic&rdquo;. That faith has now been broken and what is taking place here this week is indeed fundamentally undemocratic. A Government elected on the basis of opposition to PfP and a promise to hold a referendum if membership was proposed is denying the people their right to vote. Who now will represent the tens of thousands of Fianna Fáil voters and the many members of that party who supported, and still support, the position articulated in the 1997 general election? Where are the Fianna Fáil backbenchers now? Is there a single one of them with the conscience to keep the promise they made to the people? Is there a single one of them with the courage to stop acting like sheep and to stand up like the elected representatives and legislators they are supposed to be? I want to challenge the false and insidious notion which has been peddled around the corners and back stairs of Leinster House in recent days. It has been whispered to journalists by some Fianna Fáil members that we must go into partnership for NATO in order to remain in favour with the United States Administration for the sake of the peace process. I can only describe this as a cynical spin, used as a last resort by Fianna Fáil members. It is a sordid attempt to manipulate the universal goodwill for the Irish peace process in order to excuse the duplicity of the Fianna Fáil leadership.</P>
    <P>There was some protest from the Fine Gael benches yesterday when Deputy O'Kennedy criticised the calls by former senior Army officers for membership of PfP, but no one mentioned the much more serious statement from the current serving Chief of Staff of this State's military forces, David Stapleton, in Clonmel on 7 October. He quite openly urged membership of PfP and, thus, intervened directly in the political field only days before the issue was to be debated in this House. We heard the argument last night from the Minister for Foreign Affairs that the PfP is not institutionally linked to NATO. It would be laughable, if it were not so tragic, that the Government, even at this stage, is still trying to fool the people and to distance NATO from the PfP. There can be no doubt that in joining PfP the Government is placing this State firmly within the NATO camp. For the first time, an Irish ambassador is being appointed to NATO and Irish troops will train with NATO troops. Despite the Government's protestations to the contrary, PfP entry is the preliminary step to full membership of NATO and the Western European Union.</P>
    <P>A NATO report published in 1995 stated: &ldquo;Active participation in Partnership for Peace will play an important role in the evolutionary process of the enlargement of NATO.&rdquo;  In July 1998, NATO's Assistant General Secretary, Gerhardt Von Moltke, said: &ldquo;The new Partnership for Peace is now welded to the new NATO.&rdquo;  PfP <Col N="574" /> headquarters are part of NATO headquarters in Brussels. The very flag of the PfP incorporates the NATO symbol. The international arms trade wants the expansion of NATO and the PfP because it knows that it stands to profit enormously from it. The armed forces of the PfP states are to upgrade their military equipment to NATO standards and, of course, the states with whom we are allying ourselves are armed with nuclear weapons. How is it possible for the Government to credibly oppose the arms trade and nuclear weapons, as it claims it wishes to do, when by joining PfP we are contributing to the military industrial complex which sustains these evils?</P>
    <P>We have all been appalled by the genocide carried out by Indonesia against the people of East Timor. The Irish people have been to the fore among those who expressed solidarity and who gave practical help to the East Timorese people long before the latest crisis in their history. Yet the Government now wants us to enter a formal alliance with the very powers who armed and supported the Indonesian regime during the two and a half decades of their occupation of East Timor.</P>
    <P>The Government claims that its priority in joining PfP is peacekeeping. This State has won respect for its involvement in peacekeeping missions under the auspices of the United Nations. The expansion of NATO through PfP can only serve to weaken the United Nations. A fundamental principle of the UN is to work against the division of the world's nations into armed power blocs. The end of the Cold War should also have spelt the end of such power blocs, but instead we have seen NATO expanding and seeking world domination. We cannot be real peacekeepers if we participate in the continuing expansion of NATO or in the creation of a European super state with a military arm. Sinn Féin believes there is no role for the European Union in military and defence matters. International peacekeeping should be under the auspices of the United Nations and Irish foreign policy should be based on the strengthening of the United Nations and on disarmament.</P>
    <P>As an Irish republican, I must underscore a reality of which I am very conscious. There are NATO alligned troops currently on Irish soil. They still occupy barracks and other military installations in the six north eastern counties of our country. As a TD for a party which represents communities which have endured that occupation for decades, I also reject membership of PfP on those grounds. It is totally unacceptable for an Irish Government to align itself militarily with NATO when a branch of the NATO army still occupies a part of our country. Deputy Gay Mitchell thinks this is a good reason for us to join PfP and, in due course, NATO itself. He wants an Ireland united under NATO. No one should be surprised at that. At least it can be said of Deputies Mitchell, O'Malley and others that they openly advocate the end of our neutrality, unlike <Col N="575" /> those who claim to uphold it and then undermine it, as Fianna Fáil is now doing.</P>
    <P>Instead of joining a NATO front group, the Irish Government should be posing questions such as: why does NATO still exist so long after the end of the Cold War? Clearly, there is a community of interests in maintaining and expanding NATO, not between the peoples, the communities of the NATO member states, but between the armament industries, the military establishments, the intelligence agencies and sections of the political establishment which never wanted to abandon an alliance that gave them power, profit and prestige for so long. Those who support PfP accuse us of having no alternative. Their interpretation of neutrality is opting out. The arguments of those who promoted PfP here in recent years has been helped by the failure of successive Governments to adopt proactive neutrality. There is a need for a debate on neutrality, a debate about how we can build upon it, strengthen it and make it a much more meaningful principle and policy. Instead we have, on the one hand, the recruiting sergeants of Fine Gael who want us to join NATO and, on the other, Fianna Fáil who are inflicting death by a thousand cuts on the neutrality of this State.</P>
    <P>The Irish people have a very special role to play in international affairs. As a people who have had to fight against colonialism, we are unique in the European Union, most States of which are former colonial powers. We have the capacity to be a bridge between Europe and the peoples of what is called the South, the poorer nations of the world representing the majority of humanity. The State has played that role intermittently in the past. To develop and expand such a strategy would be positive neutrality in action, using the goodwill and respect enjoyed by the Irish nation throughout the world to promote the peaceful resolution of conflicts, disarmament, protection of the environment and the fair distribution of the world's resources.</P>
    <P>We see yet again across those benches the grand coalition of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, who on this, as on so many issues, are found to be hand in hand once the smoke of mock battle has lifted. I am proud to stand with the real Opposition in this House today, the genuine opponents of this sell-out of our neutrality, small in number though we may be. We will be returning to the defence of our neutrality again in this House and eventually in future referenda and elections. On those occasions the duplicity we have witnessed this week will come back to haunt those who have tried once too often to hoodwink the Irish people.</P>

      <P>I wish to share time with Deputy Browne. Having given this matter and all the arguments which have been put forward careful consideration, I am in favour of Ireland joining Partnership for Peace. By doing so Ireland <Col N="576" /> will re-state its commitment to the development of a just and peaceful international society based on the rule of law, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and the peaceful settlement of disputes. Partnership for Peace and the co-operative values which underline it are comparable with these commitments and objectives. Joining Partnership for Peace will be good for Ireland.</P>
      <P>Ireland has been very successful in carving out a niche for itself in the increasingly interconnected global world. This has been achieved in large part by becoming involved in so many international organisations. Joining PfP will reiterate our commitment to world peace and show the world that we too want to play our part.</P>
      <P>Currently there are many international organisations maintaining peace in the Balkans, including the UN and PfP. This alone shows how complex the issues are. Ireland has played its part in many of these organisation and membership of PfP will allow us make a substantial and positive contribution. Ireland agrees with the basic concept of Partnership for Peace. Stability and security in the Euro-Atlantic area can only be achieved through co-operation and common action. Ireland shares the values fundamental to PfP as set out in the PfP framework document. This includes protection and promotion of fundamental freedoms and human rights and safeguarding freedom, justice and peace through democracy. In joining PfP Ireland in common with other PfP nations will reaffirm its commitment to fulfil in good faith the obligations of the UN charter and the principles of the universal declaration on human rights.</P>
      <P>Critics have argued that joining PfP will lead to greater spending. I suppose this is certainly justified, but a number of other neutral countries in Europe, such as Austria, is spending less than Ireland in this context. We have to upgrade our Defence Forces, something we might take a closer look at on joining PfP.</P>
      <P>One of the biggest difficulties and concerns raised by the vast majority of people is that by joining Partnership for Peace we might jeopardise our neutrality. Neutrality has been a benchmark of our foreign policy and a respected part of that policy for many years. We should continue to be a neutral nation. Having read various accounts and studied various documents on Partnership for Peace, and having spoken to many people who have contacted me and other Deputies on all sides of the House, I firmly believe that joining Partnership for Peace will not jeopardise our neutrality. There are many nations which uphold neutrality and which, like Ireland, will remain neutral while being members of Partnership for Peace. We must join other organisations &ndash; we cannot remain on our own as a small nation, something proved by our membership of the EU.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We can be proud of the many peacekeeping operations in which Ireland has been involved since 1958. There have been 46,000 individual tours of duty involving 37 UN peacekeeping mis<Col N="577" /> sions. Based on this experience Ireland is prepared to participate in and contribute to co-operation in the partnership framework in such areas as operations, planning for peacekeeping and peace support, communications, command, control, operations procedures, training and logistics. Ireland's experience in peacekeeping has underlined the importance of international co-operation and by moving forward and joining PfP at this stage we can continue our excellent track record in this field. I would be concerned if joining Partnership for Peace jeopardised our neutrality. I am very much in favour of us remaining neutral. We should do whatever we can in bringing peace and resolution to international conflicts, but we should definitely not jeopardise our neutrality.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Wexford)</i>
        <b>:</b> For the past 40 years Ireland has been actively engaged in UN peacekeeping missions, with more than 46,000 individual tours of duty. As a nation we are very proud of Ireland's peacekeeping record and although Irish soldiers and their families have paid a high price in serving Ireland and the UN in peacekeeping missions over the years, their work continues to receive the wholehearted support of the Irish people. All of the 46,000 tours of duty were completed without Ireland being a member of PfP. The tour of duty in East Timor would have commenced without Ireland being a member of PfP. There is absolutely no reason we cannot continue to play a positive role in peacekeeping operations across the world while at the same time remaining outside PfP. The Treaty of Amsterdam allows that freedom to our Government and other governments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Joining PfP is the thin end of the wedge in terms of getting us into a military alliance. The PfP was originally put in place by NATO to encourage the Warsaw Pact and other countries to work under the umbrella of NATO. I feel NATO had a second objective, namely, to get the neutral states of the EU, such as Ireland, into alignment with it. Joining PfP will open the door, however small the opening, to interfering with our neutrality. I am a member of the Council of Europe and listen to delegations from EU countries and countries about to become members of the EU in debates and in the corridors of power, and they talk about a European military alliance and one European army. Where does Irish neutrality fit into such debates and decisions? The document, Intergovernmental Conference 1996: Commission Opinion &ndash; Reinforcing Political Union and Preparing for Enlargement, contains statements that concern me, including &ldquo;This requires better integration of the armaments industry into the general Treaty rules, greater solidarity and co-operation, including the establishment of an armaments agency, and a consistent approach to foreign trade&rdquo; and &ldquo;To establish a proper European identity with regard to security and defence as an integral part of Common <Col N="578" /> Foreign and Security Policy&rdquo;. The thoughts and ideas of the European Commission concern me.</P>
    <P>The Minister informed us that our Army will greatly benefit from training with NATO forces and will also be equipped with the most up-to-date and modern arms. Will NATO commanders be in charge of our Army personnel serving abroad? The Minister informed us also that the Government will be able to decide the role and place at any time of the Army. What assurances can he give in that respect given that NATO is made up of more powerful countries which are likely to prevail? Up to now Ireland has responded to calls from the United Nations to become involved in peacekeeping roles. Will that continue to be the situation or will we be tied to decision-making by NATO?</P>
    <P>Irish neutrality has had a number of positive features to date, including non-participation in the international arms trade, non-involvement in a military alliance and the freedom to speak with an independent voice on world issues in a way that could not be easily dismissed as based on self-interest. The Government could proactively use neutrality to assist and be a facilitator in the areas of conflict prevention and resolution. Our position as a member of PfP will make it impossible to play such a role. We will be seen to be aligned with some of the major superpowers and aggressors such as the United States, France, the United Kingdom and others. The Minister should insert the following protocol in the presentation document: &ldquo;Nothing in our membership of PfP would affect our military neutrality without a referendum being put to the Irish people.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have expressed the view at the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party that having promised to hold a referendum on the issue we should go down that road. Cynicism among voters about politicians is at an all-time high while voter turnout at elections is at an all-time low. We have made a major mistake in not giving the people a say. That is the reason I ask the Minister to include my protocol in his final deliberations in the House next week. As the Leas-Cheann Comhairle is aware, being chairman of the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party, I have made my case but without success. I have been a voice in the wilderness. The road we are going down in joining PfP is not the correct one and will have serious consequences for our stance on neutrality. What are the human and financial implications? I fear they will be enormous. We will now be involved in interstate conflicts not of our making but at what cost?</P>
    <P>These are my views which are sincerely held. I cannot see the advantages in joining PfP. We could remain on the outside, as the Amsterdam Treaty allows, and still play a magnificent role in peacekeeping throughout the world as we have done for 40 years. As Deputy Howlin is aware, we pay tribute annually in Barntown and Camolin to two men who lost their lives in the Congo, Fitzgerald and Wickham. I salute and pay tribute to the peacekeepers for the wonderful work they <Col N="579" /> have done in the name of Ireland. They have been wonderful ambassadors.</P>
    <P>We have made the wrong decision in this matter but I am a democrat and I was not successful in making my case. I will continue, however, to argue that the people should be given their say on the question of Irish neutrality.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am contributing to this debate not because I am an expert on foreign policy or on this issue but because I have been contacted by many of my constituents. The Taoiseach spoke this morning about the former President and Taoiseach and former great Fianna Fáil leader, about whom many still speak, Éamon de Valera, who said in this House in 1938 that there was no such thing as neutrality.</P>
      <P>Deputy Browne may be a democrat but he and his colleagues informed the people that Fianna Fáil in government would hold a referendum on this issue. If Deputy Browne really believes what he said, both he and his colleagues who have expressed the same view should vote against the Government next week. Deputy Browne is correct. It gives politics and politicians a bad name and leads to a lack of trust. When Leader of the Opposition, the Taoiseach informed the people that Fianna Fáil in government would hold a referendum on this issue. What he is doing is wrong.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach knows what the position of the Fine Gael Party is. Many people in my constituency who would not agree with the Fine Gael view have said that the one thing that can be said about the Fine Gael Party is that it has been consistent in and out of government and they respect us for it. I am glad there is still some honour left in politics.</P>
      <P>There have been rumblings in the Fianna Fáil Party on this issue. Why do Deputy Browne and his colleagues not table a motion at the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party, of which the Leas-Cheann Comhairle is chairman? If such a motion was tabled I am certain the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, who is a democrat, would allow it to be discussed and permit a straight vote. We should not be hypocritical, saying one thing and doing something else. That is the reason people are annoyed and confused, and who confused them? The Fianna Fáil Party did not spell out in opposition what joining PfP would mean. It had to be different to please the people to get into government. Now that it is in government it has a different view.</P>
      <P>It annoys and upsets me when people cannot be truthful in politics. That is the reason I am calling on the Taoiseach to let the people decide. I and the Fine Gael Party will still be consistent, we should take part in PfP. The people will make the decision and perhaps we will all be pleasantly surprised that a majority might say it is the right thing to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like many Members of the Oireachtas, I was contacted by phone and fax about the situation in East Timor. Everyone asked me to contact the <Col N="580" /> Taoiseach, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the European Union to make sure something was done. It was terrible to see, night after night, thousands of people fleeing their homes and being butchered, murdered and raped. People were outraged and they wanted us to do something about it. However, while they did not like it, I told many of those who rang me that it was the same old story; we want everybody else to resolve our problems. We do not mind sending in American or British soldiers, but we do not want to send in Irish ones.</P>
    <P>Like many others, I have been given a guarantee that PfP will not interfere with our neutrality, which is fair and honest. If Fianna Fáil had said that in Opposition as well as now in Government, we would have no problem with that guarantee. I tell Fianna Fáil's backbenchers that the situation is quite clear &ndash; there is no difficulty with PfP. It will be good for Army personnel to go abroad and gain experience in peacekeeping, new weaponry and in other areas. They will represent this country which is part of the EU. We cannot take all the good things out of the EU, yet not play our part in a peacekeeping force.</P>
    <P>People are outraged, however, because they were promised a referendum on PfP membership and now the Government is doing something else. That cannot and should not continue. At this late stage the Government should reconsider the matter and hold a referendum. The Government should tell the people it has changed its mind and that it will honour its previous commitment to a referendum in the interests of natural justice.</P>
    <P>Over the years, the Army has done us proud in many peacekeeping missions abroad. Up to now, 46,000 such individual missions have been served with the United Nations and I compliment the Defence Forces personnel for that. The Army would acknowledge that in recent years it has not had the best PR image and, like politicians, was not very well thought of by the general public. The one thing that maintained positive publicity and kept Army morale high, however, was the participation by our troops in overseas missions. They did their country proud, but a price had to be paid for that. My own constituency paid a major price because many Defence Forces personnel from County Mayo died while serving in peacekeeping missions abroad. I thank their families for the service they rendered to the State. While bad PR is another issue, we must compliment the Army for the good things it does.</P>
    <P>Since independence, and regardless of the political situation, the Army and Garda have served the State well. We had a turbulent time in the 1920s and 1930s when the first Governments were being formed and there could have been a <i>coup d'état</i>. Such an event never occurred, however, because the Army and Garda always supported the democratically elected Government. They always will do so and I compliment them for it.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil has done politics and politicians a disservice in the way it has treated the PfP issue. The main problem is the confusion Fianna Fáil <Col N="581" /> has caused and because of that, people cannot trust that party now in relation to PfP. That is the one big issue that has not emerged in this debate. People know that PfP membership is not so serious and that it will not interfere with our neutrality nor put us into big alliances, such as NATO. The problem is, however, that they are afraid of what the Government will do and what it will lead to. If the Government says it will not lead on to something, how can the public believe it? One cannot believe it because before the election it said we would not join PfP without a referendum, yet once in Government the referendum idea was thrown out of the window. They come in here quoting de Valera, but that is why people do not trust them. That is why people are afraid and have no confidence in the Government.</P>
    <P>Government backbenchers should do the honourable thing if they feel so strongly about the PfP issue. We are all democrats. There is an excuse for Fianna Fáil TDs on this occasion because they can say that when they became Government backbenchers they did so on foot of the party's manifesto which quite clearly stated there would be a referendum on joining PfP. Fianna Fáil backbenchers are great at saying one thing in the House, while another thing is occurring outside. This has happened for years and more recently in relation to scandals. On this occasion they are telling the media they are dissatisfied and do not agree with the Government's decision on PfP membership. If they do not agree with it, they should walk through the lobbies next week and vote against it. That is all they have to do, and people will then say: &ldquo;Look at Deputy John Browne. He is a man of principle. His party leader and party did not honour their commitment but he has honoured his.&rdquo;  There are four or five more who have signed a declaration saying they are not in favour of abandoning a referendum on PfP membership.</P>
    <P>One of the few jobs we get to do in this House &ndash; and for which we receive any respect &ndash; is to vote &lsquo;níl' or &lsquo;tá' when we walk through the lobbies. Fianna Fáil backbenchers have the opportunity on this occasion to say &lsquo;yes' or &lsquo;no'. They should not say one thing to the media and another thing at the parliamentary party meeting, while voting differently in the lobbies.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael has been consistent on this matter. People may not agree with our views but at least they recognise our honesty and they know where our party stands. Fianna Fáil cannot be all things to all men; a bit like de Valera in 1938 when he said that there was no such thing as neutrality. I do not pretend to be an expert on foreign policy, but the reason I contributed to the debate is that I do not like to see the sort of hypocrisy that has gone on in recent years concerning this issue. Fianna Fáil has caused confusion over it.</P>
    <P>I listened to the Taoiseach earlier but I do not know how he can make such a speech. The spin doctors and civil servants were probably up all night wondering how they would draft it. I am sure the Taoiseach did not want to come into the <Col N="582" /> House to read that speech after he had given an earlier commitment that Fianna Fáil, when in Government, would hold a referendum on PfP membership. It must be an awful situation for the Taoiseach to be in. I have not had the pleasure of serving in Government, but three Deputies present in the Chamber have done so: Deputy O'Malley, Deputy Howlin and the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob.</P>
    <P>It must be awfully lonely to be out of Government when one wants to be in office. The Taoiseach, Deputy Ahern, could not wait to get his hands on the throne of power. He would have said anything to anybody to get into Government. It is a sad day for democracy and for public life when people cannot honour what they say when in Opposition. The Taoiseach should not be ashamed to say he did something wrong. He did not tell people the truth. If it was the truth he would have been here today saying: &ldquo;I am going to do now what we promised before the election.&rdquo;  How can they now say that they changed their minds? Spin doctors are well paid and they did a good job on the Taoiseach's script, but people feel strongly about this issue and they are outraged and annoyed. They will certainly wait for Fianna Fáil in the long grass. People do not forget and they do not like to be given misinformation. If they are told one thing before an election, they expect that to be delivered in Government.</P>
    <P>We can discuss neutrality, but there are many dangerous people and much turmoil in this world. There are problems in many parts of the world and the international situation is probably more dangerous now than it has ever been. Whatever our policies, in or out of Government, they should be consistent.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I fully support the motion that Ireland should participate in the Partnership for Peace and the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council. Hopefully the decision will be made by next week at the latest and the current indications are that the motion can expect a positive response from the Dáil. If this proves to be the case, it is a welcome development. It is not a decision of great moment, although its opponents will try to portray it as such. It is a modest step in international co-operation. In participating, we are taking our place with virtually every other European nation, together with the nations of North America and <Col N="583" /> Central Asia. Many of the members of the partnership are former members of the Warsaw Pact. More are former constituent republics of the Soviet Union. The diversity of the membership is so broad that it is almost universal from the eastern Pacific Ocean to the north-western Chinese border.</P>
    <P>Those of us who have long advocated participation in the partnership have begun to tire of hearing the mantra that Ireland's traditional neutrality &ndash; whatever that may be &ndash; will be prejudiced. If that is so, why have genuine intellectually and ideologically convinced neutrals, such as Sweden, Austria, Finland and Switzerland, been able to join? None of these countries has expressed a desire to join NATO and they appear to have no such intention. Why are we still told that the PfP is but a stepping stone to NATO? The facts are different from some of the fantasy that is sought to be developed in that regard.</P>
    <P>Some people never mention the partnership without describing it as &ldquo;NATO-led&rdquo;. The truth is that it is not NATO-led. It may have been, in 1994, the creation of the post-Cold War NATO but it is not the creature of NATO and its current members will be the first to say so. Would the Swiss be members if it was a creature of NATO? The central fact is that the partnership entails no treaty or alliance obligations. It is, therefore, fundamentally and generically different from NATO or any other military alliance. It entails no obligations of mutual defence or assistance. It essentially consists of one enormous <i>à la carte </i>menu from which partners or prospective partners can choose such items as appeal to them and reject the balance.</P>
    <P>Looking at Ireland's presentation document, published last week, one is forced to the conclusion that Ireland is on a restricted diet as far as the partnership dishes are concerned. The Government has listed five items only, which are as follows: (1) co-operation on peacekeeping; (2) humanitarian operations; (3) search and rescue; (4) co-operation in the protection of the environment; and (5) co-operation in marine matters. These are harmless headings. They could scarcely be described as a contribution to global belligerency. The short presentation document of five pages could hardly ruffle a feather or raise an eyebrow in the most pacifist of Irish households.</P>
    <P>In the run up to several of the European Union treaties, there was an unbalanced debate in Ireland where all sorts of wild claims and allegations were made and an atmosphere approaching hysteria was sought to be generated in some quarters. We then signed the treaty and ratified it and no more was heard until the next one came along. The dark forebodings were proven to be groundless and so it will be with this move. In a year's time we will ask one another what all the fuss was about. If a fuss was justified, because we were imposing on ourselves some form of international military obligations, why was that fuss not kicked up in Switzerland? The Swiss bring <Col N="584" /> democracy to its extremes. Each year there are several referenda held on a variety of matters there. Even such relatively trivial local issues as the closing time in bars can be the subject of a referendum. There is provision in the Swiss system that a comparatively small number of citizens can petition for a referendum and it must be granted. However, in Switzerland there was no petition for a referendum on PfP. This may be because the Swiss are somewhat more factual and less emotional than us and are not prepared to be misled by propaganda which is clearly duplicitous.</P>
    <P>The significance of the Swiss position may be more fully understood when we realise that they joined the Partnership for Peace without a murmur and, indeed, with some enthusiasm, but they are not prepared to join the United Nations because they see in its charter the possibility of having international obligations thrust upon them. In this respect, they are legally and factually correct. The Europe we inhabit has made giant strides in economic co-operation. Political co-operation in matters internal to the European Union has improved greatly. Where we all fall down is in the development of a common foreign and security policy. The great weakness is our collective inability to cope on an agreed basis with serious external insecurity such as the Balkans.</P>
    <P>As Europeans we have been rescued from our common paralysis in Bosnia and Kosovo by the Americans, although the Balkans is much more our problem than theirs. I find it difficult to tolerate, either as a European or an Irishman, that we render ourselves impotent where foreign and security policy arises. Irish people are essentially internationalists, not isolationists. Why do some of us try to deny our international heritage by balking at meaningful co-operation with others unless it results in money for ourselves?</P>
    <P>Ireland since Independence has had a proud record of engagement in world affairs. We played an active role in Commonwealth conferences in the 1920s and 1930s. Éamon de Valera made impassioned efforts to make a success of the League of Nations &ndash; Seán Lestor was its last Secretary General. After the Second World War Ireland seriously considered joining NATO but the Government of the day finally decided against it due mainly to the continuance of partition which we then chose not to recognise. Our initial attempts to become members of the UN fell foul of Cold War politics and we were not able to join that organisation until 1955. Since then Irish Ministers, diplomats and particularly soldiers have made a valuable contribution to the United Nations. From the Congo to Cyprus to Lebanon, Irish soldiers have a proud record of peacekeeping with the United Nations. They recently participated in the NATO-led peacekeeping operations of SFOR and KFOR.</P>
    <P>Our membership of the then European Economic Community in 1973 moved our involvement in Europe in particular onto a new plane. The <Col N="585" /> Amsterdam Treaty represents the latest development in the European Union. The main foreign policy innovation in that treaty was the incorporation of the Petersberg Tasks, of humanitarian, rescue, peacekeeping and crisis management activities in the Union's common foreign and security policy. For Ireland to continue its proud record of involvement in international affairs, we must now turn our attention in a more focused way to the maintenance of European security and stability. Partnership for Peace will enable us to do this. PfP is a voluntary framework for regional security co-operation. It has a particular focus on co-operation for peacekeeping and humanitarian operations.</P>
    <P>Of the 43 countries currently involved in PfP, 24 are not members of NATO. These include our fellow EU neutral states, Austria, Finland and Sweden. The representatives of those countries, together with those of Switzerland, gave evidence to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs in July last year. These representatives &ndash; the ambassadors &ndash; reported that their countries' participation in PfP posed no problems for them in respect of their neutrality.</P>
    <P>Neutrality does not preclude full and active support by Ireland for collective security based on international law. We cannot afford to sit on the fence in the hope that neutrality alone will achieve international peace and security. The circumstances prevailing now indicate that membership of PfP is the best means of allowing Ireland to enhance its contribution to international peace and security.</P>
    <P>Partnership for Peace will be of tremendous benefit to our Defence Forces. It will enable them to strengthen further their capacity for UN peacekeeping, humanitarian operations, search and rescue and environmental protection. It will give the Defence Forces access to enhanced training and the latest equipment. The former UN Secretary General, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, said in 1996 with regard to UNPROFOR that a mandate for peacekeeping by lightly equipped forces can hardly any longer meet its purpose. Ireland must participate in PfP to be able to participate fully in the Petersberg tasks. In view of the Labour Party's considerable confusion about this motion, I will quote its official spokesman on foreign affairs, Deputy Spring, who said on 28 October 1998 to the foreign affairs committee: &ldquo;Most colleagues know where I stand on PfP: we should be in PfP&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>When the democratic world is forced from time to time to deal with a tyrant, it is better that it has the ability to do so rather than the self-inflicted need to appease him. Even the most skilful diplomacy will occasionally come up against brick walls. Rather appropriately, the Secretary General of the Department of Foreign Affairs reminded the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs of Bismark's dictum: &ldquo;Diplomacy without arms is like music without instruments&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I greatly welcome the opportunity <Col N="586" /> to contribute to a debate which should be taking place not only in this House but across the country. I have paid close attention to the debate and a great deal needs to be said about the future security arrangements for Europe and the security involvement of this country. I also wish to dispel any real or imagined confusion that exists in the minds of Deputy O'Malley and others about the position of my party on this matter.</P>
      <P>We live in a changed world. The dominant forces that characterised the Cold War after the end of the Second World War have changed. There is now one global superpower. However, it is not a safer world. It is a post-imperialist world that is divided in terms of access to the resources for advancement. The ever present challenges to the rule of law, the sustaining of basic human rights and the maintenance of democracy are real. Democracy is a fragile instrument, a creature largely of this century and, as we witnessed this week in the democracy of Pakistan, it is a vulnerable system of government.</P>
      <P>Everybody who is committed to the principles of democracy, the rule of law and the protection of human rights must have an international perspective. I am greatly concerned, as most Members would be, about the current state of world affairs. The certainties of the past have evaporated and threats to the stability of existing democratic nations are real, not imagined. In the past decade we witnessed, in a country that is within two hours flying time of this city, unspeakable brutality, carnage and rape and the reintroduction of the words &ldquo;concentration camps&rdquo; into our vocabulary. These events are real and they must influence the debate we are having now.</P>
      <P>What is required &ndash; this is entirely supported by the Labour Party &ndash; is a new framework of European security that is forged from the times we live in and not anchored to the past and its antagonisms. The new security architecture should be based on fundamental and acceptable principles such as democratic accountability, the rule of law and the vindication and maintenance of human rights. This discussion must take place in that context and in the context of the major debate that is taking place both on the future of the European Union, with enlargement imminent, and the creation of mechanisms to sustain the economic and social progress the people of Europe have made in recent decades and which they yearn to make in coming decades.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It also must be anchored in the reality that there is a need for fundamental reform of the United Nations. The Government should allow that debate take place. It should publish its views on the future of the United Nations, how it can be structured and how the honourable service &ndash; to which many speakers have alluded &ndash; of Irish soldiers over many years in UN peacekeeping missions can be crafted for the future. That has not happened. That debate is being stifled and, if the Government had its way, it would end today. At least the opportunity will be afforded to many Members of this House to participate in the <Col N="587" /> debate but, by right, the opportunity should be afforded to every citizen.</P>
    <P>We live in a communications age and a world where the phenomenon of instant communication will increase rapidly. We have and will continue to witness barbarous crimes against humanity and the abuse of human rights. That will be brought daily into our living rooms and put into our consciousness through the communications media. We simply cannot wring our hands in horror and make nebulous demands that something must be done. As a modern sovereign European nation, Ireland must be a participant in the resolution of conflict and involve itself in vindicating human rights and the rule of law.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party does not wish to opt out of any of this. On the contrary, we have engaged ourselves directly, as the most internationalist party in the House, with our sister parties across the European Union in a new debate about creating not just an adjunct to the old order or a vindication of some great success of the past but a modern security infrastructure and architecture that will sustain the prosperity of Europe and the world for the future. The debate on Ireland's future involvement in security matters is of fundamental importance and is one of the most important matters that will come before this House for discussion. I am not one who believes the debate should be confined to this House. If we have learned anything from the numerous debates we have had on amendments to the European Treaty and the evolution of the European Union, the close numbers in votes in this State and the defeat of proposals for treaty amendments in other member states, such as France and Denmark, the fundamental rule and lesson learned must be to bring the people with us and allow their voice to be heard and not decide treaty matters of fundamental importance to every citizen in some closed environment. We must allow the people to have their voices heard and, ultimately, afford them the right to make the final decision.</P>
    <P>This wider debate is clearly needed. Many people have heard of the concept of PfP in recent weeks and very few people outside this Chamber could tell us definitively what are the implications for Ireland of joining it.  For that reason, it is imperative this debate takes place. It must also take place because of the clear and unequivocal promise on this matter given by Fianna Fáil and the Taoiseach when in opposition.</P>
    <P>Speaking on PfP the Taoiseach, when in opposition, said: &ldquo;We would regard any attempt to push Partnership for Peace or participation in Western European Union tasks by resolution through this House without reference to the people, who, under our Constitution, have the right in final appeal to decide all questions of national policy, as a serious breach of faith and fundamentally undemocratic.&rdquo;  He said any sleight of hand in trying to put it through this House would be fundamentally undemocratic, yet <Col N="588" /> that is exactly and precisely what Fianna Fáil and the Government intend to do. It is not good enough. How can the people have confidence in political commitments so clearly and unequivocally given if they evaporate as soon as the elections are over? Speaker after speaker from the Government benches has renewed a different pledge, that in the event of a proposition to join NATO the people would be consulted. How can the people have any confidence in such a pledge when their last solemn pledge evaporated so speedily, thoroughly and completely?</P>
    <P>I listened with great respect to the contribution of my constituency colleague, Deputy Browne, this morning. His views are honorable, but it is his actions that will determine whether the public cynicism that he talked about will be diminished or increased. If he does not walk the walk or stand by the principles he enunciated here by voting to fulfil the commitment he gave as a candidate in the last general election, his contribution is meaningless. We are tired of people saying one thing in this forum and another somewhere else, saying one thing on the floor of this House and voting a different way.</P>
    <P>What is PfP? The fundamental objectives are stated in the framework document published by the alliance in January 1994. They are to facilitate transparency in national defence planning and budgeting processes; to ensure democratic control of defence forces, maintaining the capability and readiness to contribute to operations under the authority of the United Nations and or the responsibility of the OSCE; to develop co-operative military relations with NATO for the purpose of joining joint planning-training exercises in order to strengthen the ability of PfP participants to undertake missions in the field of peacekeeping, search and rescue, humanitarian operations and others as may be subsequently agreed; and to develop, over the longer term, forces that are better able to operate with those of the members of the North Atlantic Alliance.</P>
    <P>For many people, particularly many people in my party, the difficulty with joining PfP is not the tasks assigned to it by our obligations under this new arrangement but the anchor between PfP and NATO. The party leader, Deputy Quinn, stated clearly his view on NATO and I think it is a view shared by all within the parliamentary Labour Party. It has outlived its usefulness. It is based on a hostility to Russia that cannot be appropriate to provide a security apparatus for the Europe of the 21st century, yet, by stealth, it is a nuclear based NATO, for want of an alternative, that is providing that umbrella of security. That is not acceptable.</P>
    <P>The debate we should be having, that is required and will pose difficulties for all of us, is on how to shape a new infrastructure and shed some of our clichés of the past. We, as a party, are willing to participate fully in that. Our difficulty is that debate is not taking place. In the absence of that debate, on balance and with some reluctance because I am concerned about the NATO com<Col N="589" /> ponent, I would be prepared to vote yes to joining PfP, but I demand the right to have a proper debate on that issue in this House and across this nation. The right that I demand for myself to vote yes or no is equally the entitlement of every citizen of Ireland. The Government has done itself a great disservice and has done a great disservice to the debate that is required about one of the most fundamental issues we, as a European people, face in the future. I ask those on the Government benches who still have a conscience to consider the Labour Part motion and allow this debate to take place. It would be regarded not as an ultimate U-turn but as an acceptance of the will of the people and it would be the right and moral thing to do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatCarey" hpid="Mr. P. Carey Mr. P. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the proposition before the House. Partnership for Peace was first conceived under the stewardship of Les Aspin, former US Defence Secretary, and was formally launched at the NATO summit in January 1994 as a co-operative security initiative designed to intensify political and military co-operation in Europe, promote stability, reduce threats to peace and strengthen relationships by promoting practical co-operation among its participants.</P>
      <P>As other speakers said, at present 43 countries are involved in PfP, 27 of whom are non-members of NATO. Since its launch, PfP has attracted the support of all our EU partners, almost all members of the OSCE, including the 16 NATO members, Russia, all but one of the states of the former Soviet Union and traditionally neutral states like Sweden, Finland, Austria and even Switzerland.</P>
      <P>Essentially, Partnership for Peace was born out of attempts to address the problems of security and stability in Europe following the end of the Cold War. At this time there was an ardent desire on the part of a number of former Warsaw Pact countries, fearing Russian instability and possible aggression, to join NATO. PfP was set up because member states of NATO were worried that rapid enlargement of the alliance would prove to be destabilising.</P>
      <P>PfP received mixed reviews initially and was the subject of some cynicism. Many commentators viewed Partnership for Peace as merely a means for NATO to buy time as that organisation dealt with the enlargement issue. This view had, however, given way within a couple of years to an altogether more upbeat evaluation. PfP is now seen as having an intrinsic value in its own right and it has become a permanent fixture in the new European security architecture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Partnership for Peace has played a major role in the divisions of the Cold War, being replaced by a new approach based on co-operative approaches to security. This development reflects principles accepted by all European states, including Ireland. Traditional conceptions of security and defence have given way to general acceptance that peacekeeping and crisis management are the key to ensuring stability and security in Europe. This evolution is in the direction of Ireland's approach which has always emphasised conflict prevention and peacekeeping. From <Col N="590" /> being seen primarily as a means of outreach and reassurance to the new eastern European democracies, PfP has developed far beyond that aspect and now plays a leading role in co-operation, training and preparation for UN peacekeeping, humanitarian tasks and crisis management.</P>
    <P>May 1997 marked a major milestone in the evolution of PfP. At this time NATO, in consultation with the states participating in PfP, decided to broaden and develop co-operation within the PfP framework in view of the increasing role and importance of PfP as an element in the European security architecture and, specifically, in view of the lessons learned from the efforts of the international community in Bosnia.</P>
    <P>PfP is also being complemented by a political consultation mechanism, the Euro Atlantic Partnership Council, which came into being in May 1997. This council has been an important forum for discussions on Bosnia, Kosovo and future peacekeeping as well as non-military areas of co-operation, such as disaster relief in Europe. The Euro Atlantic Partnership Council provides the over-arching framework for political and security related consultations and for enhanced co-operation under PfP. It maintains the approach whereby partners are able to decide for themselves the level and areas of co-operation with NATO. One of the stated aims of this council is to provide an expanded political dimension for multilateral consultation and co-operation on a wide range of security and defence related issues, for example, regional matters, arms control, civil defence and disaster relief.</P>
    <P>The Government recognises that Partnership for Peace has evolved into a unique and important mechanism to contribute to peacekeeping within Europe. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, wrote in an article in <i>The Irish Times </i> on 28 November that PfP has developed into a major framework for co-operation, training and preparation for UN mandated peacekeeping, humanitarian tasks and crisis management.</P>
    <P>The first step taken by participants in PfP is to subscribe to a framework document which sets out the basic purposes and objectives of PfP. The purposes set out in the framework document include the protection and promotion of human rights, rededication to the principles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the safeguarding of freedom, justice and peace, the preservation of democracy, the upholding of international law and the fulfilment of the obligations of the UN charter and OSCE commitments. The objectives of PfP also include matters such as democratic control of defence forces, which reflects the initial focus of PfP on the emerging eastern European states. The objectives focus on maintaining readiness to contribute to peacekeeping operations mandated by the UN or OSCE, on joint planning, training and exercises to strengthen states' abilities to undertake peacekeeping, search and rescue and humanitarian operations.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="591" /> In putting forward a presentation document, a participating state sets out its overall approach to PfP and identifies those areas of PfP in which it is interested. Other neutral states have, for example, made clear that they do not wish to join NATO and have identified peacekeeping co-operation as a priority area. The participating state then develops, in consultation with the NATO secretariat, a practical programme of co-operation specifically tailored to the areas of interest to it. This is what we are doing in our presentation document.</P>
    <P>A popular misconception is that Partnership for Peace is NATO or is a back door to NATO. This is definitely not the case. PfP offers a selective and flexible means of co-operation on military and peacekeeping matters. Prospective NATO members have joined PfP but so too have Russia, the Ukraine and Austria, none of whom could be considered prospective NATO members. Partner nations join PfP for different reasons and when drafting their unique agreement they select from a menu of offers from NATO. This <i>à la carte</i> approach is what makes PfP so attractive to many nations, including Ireland. Participation in PfP is based on the principle of self-differentiation. This means a participating state can select the nature and scope of its participation in PfP.</P>
    <P>Moves towards Ireland's entry into PfP began more than three years ago with the public consultation process and the publication of the White Paper on Foreign Policy by the previous Administration. That White Paper states that the overall objectives of Partnership for Peace are consistent with Ireland's approach to international peace and European security. It also states that the Government had decided to explore further the benefits Ireland might derive from participation in PfP and to determine the contribution Ireland might make to partnership. Senior officials in the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Department of Defence had consultations with NATO to explore further the benefits Ireland could derive from PfP. The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs discussed the issue on many occasions and it was also the subject of questions to the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>
    <P>The present Government has supported a process of informed debate on PfP. In January of this year the Dáil passed a motion calling on the Government to build on Ireland's international vocation in support of peace and security, and to examine further Ireland's participation in Partnership for Peace, taking into account the ongoing public debate and subject to the approval of the Dáil. The motion also reaffirmed Ireland's policy of military neutrality and our commitment to the peaceful resolution of disputes and the international rule of law. On 28 January the Taoiseach said:</P>
    <P>The current debate will allow the different parties in Dáil Éireann to formulate their positions and put it before the people as part of the <Col N="592" /> European election platforms. That will provide all of us, including Fianna Fáil, with a new electoral mandate in this regard. I would envisage, all going well, that Ireland will join the Partnership for Peace on a mutually agreed basis in the second half of this year, and the Government will be working towards that timetable.</P>
    <P>In March of this year the Minister for Foreign Affairs briefed his EU ministerial colleagues on the Government's intentions regarding PfP.</P>
    <P>As other speakers said, Ireland, as a military neutral country, has made a proud and constructive contribution to international peacekeeping and this has been widely and generously acknowledged. The important contribution Ireland has made to international peacekeeping was referred to earlier in the year in a glowing tribute by the UN Secretary General, Kofi Annan.</P>
    <P>PfP has evolved into a major framework for co-operation, training and preparation for UN mandated peacekeeping, humanitarian tasks and crisis management. By joining PfP we will be able to continue to develop our proud tradition of maintaining peace in the world by becoming a member of the pinnacle forum in Europe through which co-operation and peacekeeping missions are increasingly being organised. As a modern State, we should be self-confident to enter such a forum knowing our values and principles, ready to argue for them and, in doing so, making our own distinctive contribution to the maintenance of peace and security across the globe.</P>
    <P>As regards peacekeeping, Irish membership of PfP would bring a number of advantages, especially in the context of the changing security architecture in Europe and the changing manner in which the UN operates. For Ireland this is an important consideration as peacekeeping has always been a defining element in our foreign policy. Having served in 40 missions and contributed 45,000 tours of duty, we are justifiably proud as a nation of our contribution to UN peacekeeping over the past 40 years. Joining PfP will help us to build on our achievements in this field.</P>
    <P>Although opponents of Irish membership of PfP have argued that membership will damage our peacekeeping reputation and our ability to contribute to future missions, this is not the case. It ignores the reality that a major evolution in UN peacekeeping has been taking place. The UN is increasingly reliant on regional security organisations and UN mandated peacekeeping operations are being carried out by organisations, such as the NATO led SFOR in Bosnia, the Russian led CIS troops in Georgia and Tajikstan, the West African forces in Nigeria and Sierra Leone and the Australian led INTERFET force which is being set up in East Timor.</P>
    <P>The number of peacekeeping troops under direct UN command has fallen dramatically from a peak of 80,000 to approximately 14,000 today. The future of international peacekeeping lies in regional organisations taking the lead. As long as we stay outside, we will become marginalised and <Col N="593" /> less able to continue our proud peacekeeping tradition in an effective way. Rather than PfP membership weakening our ability to engage in peacekeeping, it would strengthen it and enable it to continue into the future. Membership of PfP will strengthen our ability to engage in peacekeeping rather than weaken it.</P>
    <P>It is Government policy that Ireland should stay in the mainstream of European peacekeeping. Our Defence Forces must have a full say in preparations for peacekeeping missions. Participation in PfP would result in many benefits for our Defence Forces in terms of access to training and equipment hitherto unattainable, participation in joint military exercises and access to valuable educational opportunities. We recognise that as a Government we have a responsibility not to prevent our Defence Forces from playing a full role in peacekeeping under changing conditions for purely ideological reasons. While we do not need to join military alliances, we must co-operate with the principal regional organisations involved to maintain peace and security in Europe, in keeping with our peacekeeping contributions.</P>
    <P>Because PfP is a flexible arrangement, it allows each member to choose the areas in which it wishes to co-operate. Participation in PfP does not involve membership of NATO and appropriate participation will not affect Ireland's policy on military neutrality. Participation will not bring Ireland into any form of alliance involving mutual defence commitments. Neither will it constitute or imply any undertaking or intention to become a member of NATO in the future. In effect, PfP presents us with a menu of options from which we can pick and choose. Our presentation document, prepared by Ministers and officials, sets the agenda for the terms of our involvement. The Minister for Defence recently stated that it is envisaged that these activities will include peacekeeping under a UN mandate and humanitarian relief and rescue &ndash; tasks in line with our traditional involvement in those worthy areas of service to others. Our neutrality is protected by the Amsterdam Treaty and the Constitution. I commend the motion to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to support this motion. As well as agreeing that we should become members of the Partnership for Peace I have always advocated we should be full members of NATO. We have an obligation to repay those who helped create our prosperity, primarily the members of the European Union. It is fitting that we should give something back. The allocation of 600 soldiers, or whatever number is proposed, to this movement is highly commendable and desirable. I hope it will have a beneficial effect, not only on us but on Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not a coincidence that there has been more than 54 years of uninterrupted peace and harmony in western Europe. No other part of the globe, other than the United States, has enjoyed such tranquillity. This deserves serious consider<Col N="594" /> ation because Europe was a hotbed of war in the previous 100 years, including two terrible world wars and many other conflicts including conflicts on the Iberian peninsula and between Finland and Russia. We mainly owe that peace to the creation of NATO and long may it last. If we have another 154 years of peace, our children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren will thank us for doing the right thing. I have no problems with NATO membership. Why should we be afraid of it? It is not a military provocateur but a defence organisation which has done wonderful work.</P>
    <P>Russia has problems at the moment &ndash; political instability due to sterile leadership, economic chaos, increased crime and continuing outbreaks of violence and virtually war in some of its former republics such as Chechnya and Dagestan, with the threat of further violence in Georgia where a group of UN relief workers were captured yesterday and are being held hostage. Many of the Islamic republics in the south of the former Soviet Union are highly unstable. It is important that western Europe unites to ensure there is no threat to us and our stability. We want to be protected and live in the certainty that we are safe. We have that certainty in NATO and the Partnership for Peace. If Islamic fundamentalism threatened to spill over into Europe, we would have that umbrella organisation to protect us. It is gratifying that we have that safeguard and we should be delighted to have an opportunity to play our part in giving some of that protection.</P>
    <P>We know from history that tyrants will always exist. Human nature being what it is, these dreadful people will seek to secure power by any means, and if it involves killing millions of other people, they will be only too glad to do it. This is evidenced by Hitler in the last world war, Idi Amin in Uganda, Pol Pot in Cambodia and Saddam Hussein in Iraq. They were prepared to kill millions of people to fulfil their ambitions. It is wonderful to have a military organisation which stops this happening in Western Europe. It is good to see countries like Poland and Hungary joining NATO. I recently visited Slovenia as part of a delegation from the Foreign Affairs committee. It is a former Yugoslavian republic which is anxious to join NATO and is also on the shortlist for membership of the European Union. It is open about the fact that it wants to join a military alliance for protection. It is gratifying that so many countries wish to join a military alliance which will protect them and provide security in the greater region.</P>
    <P>It is not long ago since there was a Colonel's regime in Greece and dictatorships in the Iberian peninsula in both Portugal and Spain. All of that has gone. We are moving the boundaries of stability further east. I hope, when the Balkan conflict is resolved, Milosevic is desposed and Karadzic stands trial for war crimes. The greater part of Yugoslavia will join a western military alliance, based on the principles of defending Europe. Romania and Bulgaria which are further east will <Col N="595" /> also be anxious to join. Ten years ago Finland would not have joined the Partnership for Peace, as it is doing now. It was afraid the Russians would not agree, as it was always under their power. We are very insular and we do not realise the trepidation many of these countries experience. We are safe. We are so far away from the scene of the difficulties that we are inclined to ignore what other countries and other races dread; domination by their neighbours. That has been the story of Europe for many centuries.</P>
    <P>I agree with what the Government is doing and I am glad my party is supporting the initiative. It is important that every country in Europe gets together and supplies the men and women to constitute a force which will be there for our protection. The Americans have made a conscious decision, while they are still members of NATO, not to partake in any further wars in Europe, the Middle East, the Far East or any other part of the world. They will confine themselves to protecting their own region, principally North and Central America, and it will be difficult to get any American Government to move further afield. The days of going to Vietnam or of having their troops murdered in their hundreds in Lebanon, Saudi Arabia or Somalia, where they were on peacekeeping missions, are over. During the Gulf War they did so much to stop a tyrant not just from taking over the Middle East but probably North Africa in its entirety. Instead of being grateful many people criticise the Americans for the work they have done to stabilise the world yet every time there is an outbreak of violence or a war in Africa we hear the call, &ldquo;Why do the west not stop it?&rdquo;. Of course, by &ldquo;the west&rdquo; they mean the Americans, but the Americans are not prepared to see their sons and daughters killed by the thousands any longer in wars far away from home.</P>
    <P>Currently there are 12 wars, some of them vicious, ongoing in Africa &ndash; in Liberia, Sierra Leone, Angola, the two Congos, Zaire, Rwanda, Burundi, Sudan, Ethiopia and Eritrea. Not long ago there were awful wars in Uganda and Mozambique; we even had cannibalism being performed by the leader of Uganda, Amin. Then there is Nigeria, which is constantly volatile. We cannot expect any United Nations force, or the United States in particular, to get involved in these areas. The price in terms of manpower and in terms of lives lost would be massive. The Americans have retreated into their own cocoon, North and Central America, and Europe will be left to its own devices. That is why it is important that Ireland plays its part, the same as any other country.</P>
    <P>When the conflict in Kosovo was at its most dangerous it was gratifying to see that the British took the initiative, not the Americans. The Americans carried out the bombing, they provided the logistics, but when it came to putting in troops on the ground, which involved great danger, it was the British who led the way. We should thank them for doing that because who else would have <Col N="596" /> done it? No other force in Europe would have led the way. Others joined in when they took the initiative but that will be the story from now on. It will be up to ourselves, whether it is the British, the Germans or the French, to club together and protect Europe from any overflow of violence from the former Russian republics or from Russia itself, because of instability in that country, or from the fundamentalists in the Middle East, which is always a danger. I hope that membership will lead to our Defence Forces getting the type of equipment they are entitled to, that it is updated and on a par with all modern armies because I suspect we are not as up to date as we should be.</P>
    <P>An event occurred two weeks ago in Austria which would have been frightening some years ago, namely, the emergence of Nazism on a significant scale. Austria returned an extreme right wing party, which has been termed the Nazi party, the second largest party in its recent elections. That would have sent a shudder down the backs of people throughout Europe were it not for the presence of NATO and Partnership for Peace. That event, allied with racial riots, again caused by a Nazi element in Germany, is an indication of something which is just under the surface but it will never cause us any serious problems while we have organisations like NATO and Partnership for Peace. We must never become complacent, however. Chamberlain became complacent in 1938-39 and allowed himself to be persuaded by Hitler that there was nothing to worry about, that all his intentions were peaceful. We now know the holocaust that followed. We must be on our guard and we have to participate in Europe because if we do not do so, nobody else will do so in the future. The Americans have pulled out, it is now up to us, and anybody who believes we are doing ourselves a service by not joining Partnership for Peace is a fool or a pervert. They are certainly seriously misguided. I welcome the motion and look forward to our participation in this praiseworthy body.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelOFlynn" hpid="Mr. O'Flynn Mr. O'Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to speak in favour of the Government proposal in relation to participation in the Partnership for Peace programme. I also welcome Fine Gael's decision to support the proposal. I am aware of the unease among some members of the public. There is concern about the impact of this move on our traditional status as a neutral nation. I am sure many Members have received correspondence and telephone calls from members of the public who are unhappy about this move. I do not doubt the sincerity of the reservations expressed but time will show that many of the doubts expressed in relation to Partnership for Peace will be allayed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Membership of the partnership, which was was established in 1994, is entirely voluntary. The aims of the body are to ensure that we have in place an effective framework for co-operation in peacekeeping and humanitarian operations. It is grounded on the principles of the UN charter and <Col N="597" /> the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, known as OSCE. As I stated, it is involved in training for peacekeeping and humanitarian initiatives. It is also committed to search and rescue programmes and to environmental protection. It is important that that is understood. It is also important to realise that each participating country can decide the level and extent of its involvement. That is not generally realised by the public.</P>
    <P>There are political aspects to Partnership for Peace. It promotes democracy, justice and peace, the safeguarding of freedom, the maintenance of the principles of international law, and the fulfilment of the obligations of the UN charter and the OSCE commitments. These are principles which this country has always endorsed and they have stood the test of time. In our membership of Partnership for Peace, our traditional standpoint on these important issues will remain the same. We are only one of a large number of nations that will participate in the Partnership for Peace. I understand that 24 of the 43 countries involved are not members of NATO. Among them are the neutral states of Austria, Finland, Sweden and Switzerland. These sovereign nations have had no problem with their existing membership.</P>
    <P>There is not a mutual defence commitment in Partnership for Peace. It is not a military alliance. There are not any treaty obligations in membership of Partnership for Peace. Every state may determine the nature and the scope of its participation. Each state will have to furnish a Presentation Document. Ours is before the House for consideration and approval. I am certain that a Member of this House would not be party to any submissions that would infringe on the valued traditions of neutrality that we hold dear.</P>
    <P>Partnership for Peace will not pose any problems for Irish neutrality. It has not done so for other neutral countries that have become members of this body. Our membership will be in line with the reality of the membership of Switzerland, Finland and the other neutral states. Their Presentation Documents enshrined the concept of their continued neutrality.</P>
    <P>Switzerland was invited to join the Partnership for Peace, which it did. Its Presentation Document, which it finalised on 20 November 1996, stated:</P>
    <P>Switzerland has no intention to abandon its neutrality. It has no desire to become a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation.</P>
    <P>Those are unambiguous words. In effect, Switzerland, which has a long, proud and honoured tradition of neutrality, saw nothing in membership of Partnership for Peace that would be incompatible with its neutrality. Who can doubt that there was much soul searching and in-depth analysis of the implications of Partnership for Peace for Swiss neutrality? Many of that little country's people must have expressed doubts and must have had serious reservations when the concept of membership was first presented to them. <Col N="598" /> However, those fears were proved to be groundless, otherwise, Switzerland would not have become a participant in the Partnership for Peace programme. The Swiss have the right to decide on their involvement &ndash; or non-involvement &ndash; in all the activities of Partnership for Peace. We have the same rights and will put the same safeguards in place.</P>
    <P>We will ensure that our traditional neutrality will continue to be observed. Irish participation in Partnership for Peace would be in line with our commitment to the development of co-operative security structures in Europe. That commitment places total emphasis on conflict prevention, peacekeeping and crisis management. It will preclude membership of NATO or any Alliance commitments.</P>
    <P>In today's world there is a need for a body that enshrines the aims of Partnership for Peace. Ongoing conflicts in many areas are causing untold human misery. War has become commonplace and the word &ldquo;genocide&rdquo; is used more regularly. Hunger, want, death and destruction feature regularly in our radio news, our newspapers and on our television screens. The Third World faces ongoing calamities.</P>
    <P>This country has a proud record of responding to the needs of the deprived throughout the world. We, as a people, can be proud of our traditional generosity to deprived nations. We have a national record of participation in peacekeeping, which has won us international acclaim. We have been in demand in many spheres of conflict. Our record of playing a fair and unbiased role in any area to which our Defence Forces are sent by the UN is second to none.</P>
    <P>We can play a role, through Partnership for Peace, in the prevention of conflict, the work of peacekeeping and participation in humanitarian operations. These are all laudable aspirations, which we must make a reality. We cannot stand back. We will be able to act more effectively when our membership of Partnership for Peace is ratified.</P>
    <P>Being involved with this programme does not mean that, by some means or other, we are joining NATO through the back door. Neither I, nor any Member of this House, have any hidden agenda. We do not wish to be members of NATO. I want this clearly understood. It is important to note that our membership of Partnership for Peace is not binding and is completely voluntary. I understand that if we ever find there are any problems with our membership of Partnership for Peace, we can opt out. If we do agree with aspects of Partnership for Peace, we are quite entitled to withdraw from that body.</P>
    <P>There has been much debate on the fact that there will not be a referendum, although a commitment was given that one would be held if membership of Partnership for Peace clashed in any way with our proud tradition of neutrality. However, it was found that this was not the case. As I have already said, the traditionally neutral states had already thoroughly researched this <Col N="599" /> aspect of membership, and they have all joined Partnership for Peace without any qualms. They do not see membership as being at variance with their continued policies of neutrality.</P>
    <P>Our defence Acts permit Irish participation in peace enforcement operations, provided the operations have a UN mandate. Our past record in this area is second to none. Our previous involvement in those missions did not change our stance on neutrality. Our participation in any mission will be subject to a Dáil motion of approval in every instance. If this is so, why should our participation in the same type of operation today have detrimental effects on our time honoured policy of neutrality?</P>
    <P>Partnership for Peace is not a military alliance. Any involvement we will have will be on purely peacekeeping and related grounds. This is clearly stated in the charter of Partnership for Peace. We are used to being in a position where we co-operate with the regional organisations. We have been involved in peacekeeping in Europe and much farther away. Membership of Partnership for Peace will be in keeping with our past practice. Our previous peacekeeping contributions &ndash; under many different Governments &ndash; did nothing to water down our national resolve to remain neutral. This situation will continue when we become members of the partnership.</P>
    <P>I treasure our neutrality, which has won us worldwide respect and acclaim. Neither I nor the Government would not do anything to put it at risk. I hope every Member will support this. I am delighted, as I said at the outset, that Fine Gael supports the Government on this motion.</P>
    <P>I support the statement made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, to the House yesterday when he said:</P>
    <P>Our decision to participate in Partnership for Peace is in full accordance with the policy of military neutrality, which has always been pursued in tandem with full and active support for collective security, based on international law. Ireland shares the values set out in the PfP framework document, including protection and promotion of fundamental freedoms and human rights, and safeguarding of freedom, justice and peace through democracy. In joining PfP, Ireland, in common with the other PfP nations, reaffirms its commitment to fulfil in good faith the obligations of the charter of the United Nations and the principles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Equally, Ireland reaffirms its commitment to the Helsinki Final Act and all subsequent documents of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe.</P>
    <P>The Presentation Document makes clear that participation in PfP will in no sense inhibit our full commitment to disarmament and arms' control. In joining PfP, Ireland reaffirms its commitments and obligations in this area.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="600" /> I support this statement. The Minister went on to say:</P>
    <P>Our Presentation Document takes full account of the fact that, in May 1997, the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council, EAPC, came into being as the political framework for PfP. The Taoiseach publicly welcomed this development as long ago as 24 May 1997 &ndash; a fact which critics of the Government's approach seem to have forgotten. The EAPC is a flexible and voluntary forum, involving all PfP nations, for consultations and co-operation on political and security related matters of common concern, including regional issues, arms control, peacekeeping, civil emergency planning, scientific and environmental issues.</P>
    <P>Irish Defence Forces personnel have been actively involved in humanitarian assistance. They have performed tremendous service on behalf of the country. Many of those serving overseas have served on a number of missions and have been overseas on a number of occasions. Many of the Defence Forces personnel come from my city and county of Cork. Many of the members of the Southern Command have served with distinction from when we first sent troops to the Congo to today in areas of conflict where peacekeeping is needed, such as the Balkans, the Middle East and East Timor. I record my sincere gratitude to those men and women who have served with distinction in the armed forces on peacekeeping missions throughout the world. They have done us proud. They have brought great honour and respect for our small island nation among the larger nations. I hope they will continue to serve this country and the United Nations in areas of conflict to end crisis conflicts using the skills they have and the good crisis management techniques the armed forces have developed and augmented over the past 40 years.</P>
    <P>I commend the motion to the House and hope there will be a unanimous decision, with everyone, even those concerned at present about certain aspects of the proposal, seeing the wisdom of voting with the Government and Fine Gael on this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to participate in the debate on this motion on Partnership for Peace. I compliment our party colleague, Deputy Gay Mitchell, as spokesman for foreign affairs, because he has crusaded on this issue for many years and has been instrumental in explaining to many within our party what Partnership for Peace means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened to various speakers and heard the word &ldquo;neutrality&rdquo; dispersed throughout the debate. People speak about our neutrality as sacrosanct. Over 50 years ago, at the end of the Second World War, Éamon De Valera sent his sympathies to the German Ambassador on the death of Adolf Hitler. We all know the terrible <Col N="601" /> atrocities which were committed in that war. In recent times when we debated issues such as NATO becoming involved in Kosovo, we are familiar with the type of histrionics which occurred in the House regarding US involvement. Sometimes we are hypocritical in that we welcome American investment in this country but if it becomes involved in trying to resolve a conflict, we tend to be critical. We are a little ambivalent in that regard. Perhaps after 50 years it is time to speak of a new protocol in the area of neutrality so that we know what it means in the context of Ireland's role in the world.</P>
    <P>I heard several speakers say that Partnership for Peace is a backdoor to NATO. In December 1997 the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, stated that Partnership for Peace was such. Having listened to his contribution to this debate, I accept that he has changed his mind, with the passage of time has accepted the wisdom and been influenced by what has happened. He mentioned the Committee on Foreign Affairs which invited delegations from many of the neutral countries, such as Austria, Finland, Sweden and Switzerland, which participate in Partnership for Peace. On seeing such countries participating in Partnership for Peace, it is about time we saw sense and realised there is nothing to fear from our involvement in it.</P>
    <P>In May 1996 in Oxford the Taoiseach stated that Partnership for Peace would send the wrong signals about our future intentions and would have long-term implications for our neutrality. He also stated that he would like a cast iron pledge from the Government of the day that it would not make any move without first consulting the people in the interests of openness and accountability. I do not know if people have been canvassing in the by-election but I did so yesterday and there was criticism about the fact that we were joining Partnership for Peace without a referendum. I explained that our party has been consistent in advocating Partnership for Peace from the start. People were critical that Fianna Fáil could make such a swift U-turn from when it was in opposition in that it is not now advocating a referendum. I assure Fianna Fáil Deputies that they will encounter this when they go canvassing. If they do not, I will be more than surprised.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that the former commander of the Army, Lieutenant General McMahon, stated that Partnership for Peace would be good for the Army. He maintained that it would be good for education opportunities and advancing the cause of the military establishment in Ireland. Realism must prevail about the concern expressed that we will be involved with countries with nuclear weapons. How do we reconcile that with the fact that our Army forms part of peacekeeping forces abroad which also involve France, the US and Russia, countries which have nuclear weapons? <Col N="602" /> One wonders about the ambivalence on some people's part in this regard.</P>
    <P>If we participate in Partnership for Peace, we will also get the opportunity to participate in the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council. This appears to be a laudable organisation for us to become involved with. It is involved with humanitarian assistance, for example, disaster relief in the Balkans, and peacekeeping duties. Why are we scared of becoming involved in Partnership for Peace and with this body?</P>
    <P>Much appreciation has been expressed of the Army and our role abroad and I concur with that. We have been involved in many peacekeeping missions over the years in various countries and we have been applauded for that. However, I would also like to applaud the role of the Naval Service over the years. I grew up beside the sea and I remember vividly as a young person being proud to board naval vessels which came into port. Over the years, however, the naval manpower has become incompatible with the roles in which the service is involved. The Naval Service was established to defend our shores against belligerent countries. Nowadays its role has changed dramatically and it is now involved in many areas, such as sea rescue activities, and has played a dominant role recently in combating drug trafficking. The Criminal Justice Act, 1994, gave the Naval Service the power, without Garda presence, to board a vessel at sea where there is a suspicion that it is involved in the importation of drugs.</P>
    <P>If our naval force is contrasted with those of other western European countries, it will be seen that we have a very small naval force for such a huge coastline. This creates a temptation to use our coastline as a means to import drugs into Ireland or to use it as an access point to other countries on the basis that there is less likelihood of being caught. Cannabis has been trawled by fishing boats and bales of cocaine have been washed up on the shore. The Naval Service is combating this trade, in addition to all the other areas in which it is involved. We need to increase the money spent on the naval force. We acquired an additional vessel recently, the <i>Róisín</i>, which I welcome, and this brings the number of patrol vessels to eight.</P>
    <P>In the context of Ireland's responsibilities in the area of fisheries, there is a temptation for foreign trawlers to take their chances in the European economic zone in Irish coastal waters because the likelihood of their being caught is much more remote than it would be off other European countries. We have 16 per cent of European Union waters. The area for which we have responsibility stretches at least 200 square miles, and probably 260 square miles off our coastline. In landlubber's terms, that statistic would equate to two Garda patrol cars for the entire country. That is the level of manpower and resources on which we are depending <Col N="603" /> to defend our marine waters. Given the situation, I praise the Navy for its work in the past. I urge the Government not to sit on its laurels but to think about increasing resources further in this area. The Government should contemplate the purchase of extra coastguard vessels and the development of a coastguard fleet in parallel with our naval resources, given the new responsibilities which have been thrust upon us in this area.</P>
    <P>I am aware of problems within the naval service caused by a high labour turnover, especially in the case of highly experienced technical people who, because of the success of the economy generally, are tempted to take up jobs outside, once they have completed their term with the naval service. Last year the naval service lost more than 70 employees and this year the loss is already running close to 70. I would like to think we will expand our naval resources not because of the likelihood of invasion by a belligerent state, but because of the important role it plays and our enhanced responsibilities.</P>
    <P>We are coming of age when we join bodies like Partnership for Peace, this Euro-Atlantic partnership. It will enhance Ireland's role, which is already a very professional role well recognised throughout the world in the whole area of peacekeeping. Joining Partnership for Peace will bring us into the new millennium with a more positive attitude.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil speakers have applauded Fine Gael for supporting this motion. We are supporting this motion because we have always advocated this since it was first floated by President Clinton in January 1994. We supported it when we were in Government. Regrettably we did not introduce it while we were in Government. We are, therefore, duty bound to be consistent and to support it now. Fianna Fáil changed their mind on this, but if we were in Government and they were over here, would they have changed their mind, or would they play politics with it and look for a referendum? This is symptomatic of the positive approach we have within our party. We are all consistent in our approach on this. The motion will be approved by this House. There will be some dissenting voices. I tell them to wake up to the new millennium and recognise the changes that have taken place on the world scene and recognise that Ireland's participation in Partnership for Peace is long overdue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>When one listens to the speeches and reads the documents relating to Partnership for Peace, one sees and hears the words &ldquo;partnership&rdquo;, &ldquo;peace&rdquo;, &ldquo;co-operation&rdquo;, &ldquo;freedom&rdquo;, &ldquo;justice&rdquo;, &ldquo;democracy&rdquo;, &ldquo;support&rdquo; and &ldquo;rescue&rdquo;. Looking at those words in isolation, one might ask how it is that Ireland didn't join Partnership for Peace years ago if this is what we are talking about. Surely these elements, these words, and these principles are at the core of our indepen<Col N="604" /> dence. As is typical of the Irish psyche, we tend never to look at the positive but to concentrate on the negative. The two negative words which came to the fore, and which seemed to threaten, had to do with our neutrality and that overriding body, NATO. Those two words were linked together in a very negative way. We did not look, and did not see what was really involved in Partnership for Peace.</P>
      <P>I can understand that, because neutrality is important to the Irish people. However, at the end of the 20th century, we need to ask what our neutrality is. We talk about referenda and the Constitution. The word &ldquo;neutrality&rdquo; is not in the Constitution. We adopted our policy of neutrality after the Constitution was drafted and accepted by the people. It was adopted as a policy, not as a principle, and not as a philosophy. It could be said, and it has been said, that it was adopted as the policy which divided us least at the time of World War II. It would be very easy to establish that despite being ruled by a major power, we in Ireland always adopted an independent stance in our foreign affairs. Even going back to the time of the Boer War, MacBride decided to lead an Irish group, irrespective of the fact that he was going against the power that ruled us and them, and in World War II Irish troops demanded and received independent recognition. No sooner was the first Dáil established than we had people knocking on the gates at Versailles looking for recognition of our independence followed closely by the sending of ambassadors abroad, despite the fact that we did not have our full independence. We have always shown that we adopt an independent stance. As a nation we are confident in our ability to play our role among the major powers. This became particularly evident during World War II when the policy of neutrality had to be developed and established permanently. The real challenge came post-World War II through our role with Frank Aiken and Freddy Boland in the United Nations, our peacekeeping, our anti-nuclear stance and our anti-military stance. That is what neutrality has become, and that is what it means at the end of the 20th century.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Neutrality is extremely important to the Irish people not because, as some people indicate, we do not understand, but because it has become a part of the Irish people, who prefer to preserve peace than to engage in war. It is not that we fear being involved or sending our young people out to war but that we want to be out there actively promoting peace as a confident young Irish nation. Instead of focusing on the negative words that this debate has focused on to date, we should look at the positive. That is difficult when one keeps hearing the word &ldquo;NATO&rdquo;, a word which conjures up a huge alliance, revives for us all memories of the Cold War, of anti-communism, of domination and of fear. It is unfortunate that <Col N="605" /> the debate on our joining Partnership for Peace has focused on these things and has focused on whether there should be a referendum rather than on what Partnership for Peace actually is.</P>
    <P>When this matter was debated in the House on 29 January I raised a number of questions because, like many others, I felt the need to know the relationships between Partnership for Peace and NATO and the proposed extent of our involvement. However, since the debate has broadened, especially since the holding of this debate, those questions have been answered in the various documents presented. In view of this I am happy to support the motion that we join Partnership for Peace.</P>
    <P>I support the motion on the basis that at the end of this century we are a confident, independent nation and that this gives us the freedom to choose between our involvement in all the different organisations throughout the world. We can decide the extent of our role in the United Nations, and the fact that we seek a seat on the Security Council shows the measure of our confidence in ourselves and that we know we have a role to play. It is because of our commitment to develop justice and a peaceful society, both at home and abroad, that we can investigate, and are not only welcome but invited to join various world and European organisations. It is because we want to uphold human rights, not only in this country but abroad, and to introduce freedom throughout the world that we are willing to join. To date none of the organisations we have joined has in any way affected our neutrality or questioned whether we are a military power. Of course we are not one. However, our independent stance can let us show the world that we are not beholden to one power or another.</P>
    <P>The new and developing debate on neutrality brings us back to the policy of neutrality. More importantly, it makes us focus on the philosophy of neutrality and what it means in practice. I welcome that debate and hope it extends throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The motion before us to support joining Partnership for Peace can be looked at in the context of our role in Kosovo, the Balkans and Bosnia where when international co-operation was needed we were there and willing to help. I welcome the link, especially in these countries, between the United Nations, the EU and our role in the Petersberg Tasks because these groups together are upholding the UN Charter, which guarantees human rights throughout the world.</P>
    <P>Only two days ago the House voted to send troops, our rangers, to East Timor. We can look forward to the type of co-operation they will see there. Speaking on that motion I criticised and questioned the United Nations for being tardy in its response and for not being prepared. I hope our involvement in Partnership for Peace will ensure we are always ready to move in to help to <Col N="606" /> maintain democracy, to preserve human rights and to ensure that people's freedom is allowed.</P>
    <P>What I find especially encouraging about Partnership for Peace is that of the 43 members, 24 are not members of NATO and that all our EU partners and the neutral states are members. We all look to countries like Sweden and Switzerland as being the supreme neutral states. The fact that they are members, working together on major issues, and are willing to welcome us means they recognise us as being among their equals also. In view of this and in view of what we have given the world over recent years, it is a logical progression for us to join Partnership for Peace.</P>
    <P>Some days ago I looked at film footage on RTE of our first peacekeeping troops heading out to the Congo. Thousands of people lined O'Connell Street and the troops were met and reviewed by the Taoiseach and Ministers of the day because it was a major event in Ireland. Many others will remember the disasters and loss of life in Namibia, Lebanon and other places since then. The fact that 46,000 individual tours of duty have taken place by our armed forces is surely proof that we have learnt much and have much to learn and, more importantly, that we have much to share in establishing peace throughout the world.</P>
    <P>The change in security arrangements, the fact it is now more regionally based and, more especially, that no matter what involvement we have it will always be as a result of a Dáil vote based on a UN mandate will ensure that we are working within those rights we uphold. The Presentation Document on Partnership for Peace outlines the scope of our co-operation. It states that we will co-operate in the partnership framework in such areas as operational and generic planning for peacekeeping and peace support, communications, command and control, operational procedures, logistics and training. This is an extension of what we do, and rather than seeing what we can get from the rest of the world, it is one way in which we can positively contribute to it.</P>
    <P>We will now be involved not just at the last stages, but in the preparations because Partnership for Peace will ensure that best practice is adopted. We will also be involved in training, equipment and education. While it will probably mean that the British will be back in the Curragh, the French in Bantry Bay, the Germans on Banna Strand and the Spanish in Kinsale, it will be for all the right reasons because we will share our expertise, working in co-operation with all of these countries and ensuring that democracy and freedom is upheld throughout the world.</P>
    <P>When considering Partnership for Peace, peacekeeping comes to mind. However, we should not overlook the humanitarian aspects which are also central to its mission. Prior to sending our rangers to East Timor we sent gardaí to become involved with civilian authorities &ndash; indeed, we <Col N="607" /> have been involved in that for a number of years. We also sent Naval Service and Army personnel on various missions. In addition, the work of the Irish aid organisations should always be lauded.</P>
    <P>What is especially interesting about the humanitarian aspect is the &ldquo;teach a man to fish&rdquo; philosophy on which it is based. If one teaches a man to fish one feeds him for life, it is the self-help philosophy. Given that, as a young country we managed to build ourselves up after the War of Independence and the Civil War and to bring in democracy without having to resort to violence, we can share with all the newly emerging democracies.</P>
    <P>Disaster relief is another feature of Partnership for Peace. Disasters have occurred in many areas. Africa constantly comes to the fore in this regard. More recently much assistance under Partnership for Peace has been sent to the Honduras. We can also help in civil and emergency planning.</P>
    <P>Given all these aspects, will the door be open to us to help the children of Iraq and will we be able to help countries where peace might reign, but unfortunately under dictators? I hope we will be able to use our new opportunities and contacts to help these countries where children are starving and are being denied medical aid.</P>
    <P>While we have always been familiar with the issue of mines and landmines, it was only because of Princess Diana's involvement that they came to the fore. One of the aims of Partnership for Peace is to try to search for the landmines which are unknown and unseen but which have such devastating effects on people throughout the world. With search and rescue and environmental and marine matters, we can uphold the rule of law, respect human rights and restore democracy. We can do so in a voluntary, non-binding and co-operative manner. We can opt in and opt out. I hope there will be times when we will opt out because that will show we are a confident nation and a power among equals and that we are moving forward, not afraid of our past but confident we can contribute to the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>I pay tribute to Deputy Gay Mitchell who has for many years promoted Ireland's joining the Partnership for Peace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Partnership for Peace was established in 1994 as a voluntary and co-operative framework for regional security co-operation between NATO and individual non-members of NATO. PfP has a particular focus on co-operation for peacekeeping and humanitarian operations. Currently 43 countries are involved in PfP; 24 of these countries are non-members of NATO. The countries in PfP include all our EU partners, the neutral states of Austria, Finland, Sweden and Switzerland, Russia and many states in Eastern Europe. There is no conflict between participation in PfP and our policy of military neutrality. Other Euro<Col N="608" /> pean neutrals have participated in PfP without difficulty. There is no mutual defence commitment in PfP; it is not a military alliance. A lot of alarming information has developed given the change in the Government's stance not to hold a referendum. The Minister indicated the necessity for a referendum when in opposition. This has added to the confusion and misinformation which is now developing. The Minister for Foreign Affairs indicated that he would issue explanatory information to the general public to alleviate their fears.</P>
    <P>The procedure for participating in PfP is voluntary; it involves voluntarily subscribing to a framework document. The framework document imposes no treaty obligations. Participation is based on the principle of self-differentiation, that is, a state selects for itself the nature and scope of its participation in PfP. A participating state presents its own agenda for co-operation through a presentation document. Prior to Ireland's participation in PfP, the proposed Irish Presentation Document will be submitted to Dáil Éireann for its consideration and approval. This is an important aspect. Presentation documents were submitted by the four neutral states, Austria, Finland, Sweden and Switzerland when they joined PfP. The experience of the neutral states in PfP also demonstrates that it poses no problems for neutrality. It is important that this point is brought to the fore. I received phone calls from constituents who were concerned about a new agenda. These people included former members of the Defence Forces and the FCA who had a different spin on Ireland joining PfP. The amount of misinformation has alarmed many people and it is a pity local radio and the local press did not explain the matter more fully.</P>
    <P>The Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council is a political framework for PfP. The EAPC has become an important forum for regular consultations involving PfP nations on a wide range of issues from peacekeeping and humanitarian assistance in the Balkans to disaster relief. The EAPC brings together in one forum all our EU partners, the United States, Canada and Russia. Ireland would participate in the EAPC on joining PfP. We are an island but we are not insular in our approach. We have an interest in having our voice heard in the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council. PfP is playing an increasingly important role as the need for effective conflict prevention, peacekeeping and humanitarian operations becomes more apparent. This was evident in the past year given the difficulties in Europe and throughout the world.</P>
    <P>PfP would be of particular benefit to our Defence Forces in maintaining the Irish tradition in UN peacekeeping. The major changes that are taking place in UN peacekeeping and the role PfP plays in co-operation for new peacekeeping arrangements is very important. It also has a role <Col N="609" /> in facilitating co-operation for search and rescue. It is important to promote the positive aspects of PfP. There is a growing feeling in Europe that the EU should play a greater role in addressing and resolving European problems through peacekeeping and humanitarian operations, known as the Petersberg Tasks, in support of the United Nations. The EU's efforts will intensify now that the Amsterdam Treaty has come into force. PfP will be an important framework for preparation and co-operation for those talks. It does not change the situation under which Irish participation in a peacekeeping mission requires a UN mandate.</P>
    <P>There is no legal or constitutional requirement for a referendum. However, the Government when in opposition promised a referendum, and a number of people, particularly Fianna Fáil supporters, are disappointed that this promise is not being fulfilled. Deputy Gay Mitchell promoted Ireland's joining PfP as far back as 1994. Since I entered Dáil Éireann, I have heard him speak on the issue on numerous occasions at parliamentary party meetings. He had a huge brief on the matter and was very much to the fore in promoting the positive aspects of joining PfP. There is a certain amount of disillusionment at the fact that the Government party changed its opinion and that it has not made a commitment to the electorate that they will hold a referendum. People expected a referendum on this issue.</P>
    <P>The Presentation Document of Ireland for the PfP programme makes some very good points. It states:</P>
    <P>In accepting the invitation to participate in PfP, Ireland restates its commitment to the development of a just and peaceful international society based on the rule of law; democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms; and the peaceful settlement of disputes. PfP, and the cooperative values which underlie the Partnership, are compatible with these commitments and objectives.</P>
    <P>This is a very important objective. It also states:</P>
    <P>Ireland plays an active role in UN peacekeeping [we must salute the work our peacekeepers have achieved] and supports the continuing elaboration of effective international strategies and action for conflict prevention, peacekeeping and crisis management. In this connection, Ireland attaches importance to effective and mutually reinforcing cooperation between those institutions with a role to play in the search for peace and stability in Europe.</P>
    <P>Ireland welcomes the role that cooperation for peacekeeping has assumed in Partnership for Peace and looks forward to contributing to Partnership activities in this area. The calls on the international community to be able to respond to the humanitarian needs of popu<Col N="610" /> lations in crisis have become increasingly apparent in recent years.</P>
    <P>This is very apparent. It goes on to read:</P>
    <P>Since 1958, Irish peacekeepers and military observers have participated in 46,000 individual tours of duty involving 37 UN peacekeeping missions. Based on this experience, Ireland is prepared [which it has very effectively demonstrated] to participate in and contribute to cooperation in the Partnership framework in such areas as operational and generic planning for peacekeeping and peace support, communications, command and control, operational procedures. Ireland's experience in peacekeeping has underlined the importance . which in Ireland's view is essential . for multinational peacekeeping or crisis management operations.</P>
    <P>Ireland has played a huge role in peacekeeping.</P>
    <P>. Defence Forces personnel have been actively involved in humanitarian assistance. They provide assistance to the civil authorities in response to natural or other disasters. In the context of their international peacekeeping role, Ireland peacekeeping contingents have engaged in humanitarian efforts aimed at assisting local communities to develop a self-help philosophy; and Irish Defence forces personnel have served on a voluntary basis with UNHCR and Irish aid agencies on several continents. In the light of this experience, Ireland is interested in the development of cooperation, and the exchange of experience and expertise in the area.</P>
    <P>Ireland also has a role in the development of co-operation, and exchange of expertise [this, no doubt, will be very evident by joining this group] . in the field of civil search and rescue.</P>
    <P>Ireland has a role to play in the protection of the environment in the further development of co-operation in PfP with regard to threats to the environment, which are very much on the increase, and in the development of co-operation on marine matters. The document goes on to read:</P>
    <P>As a maritime nation, Ireland is interested in the development of cooperation and training in marine techniques, including marine research, technology and development.</P>
    <P>It is important to explain the positive benefits of joining PfP. There is a lot of alarming misinformation which is blinding people to the benefits of PfP. The Government has created this uncertainty because of its promise of a referendum. The Minister, Deputy Andrews, stated that he would provide more information to the electorate, and they are entitled to this. Membership of PfP will assist the Defence Forces in improving their capability in multinational peacekeeping and peace support operations in future. This is <Col N="611" /> a very important element in the context of the wonderful name we have in terms of multinational peacekeeping. In recent years the UN has mandated a new style of peacekeeping and crisis management and Ireland, which has a significant role in this context, must wish to share with the other participating states the experience it has acquired.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of steps are being taken to address the weaknesses identified in the delivery of remedial education at primary level revealed in the recent report, &ldquo;Study of Remedial Education in Irish Primary Schools&rdquo;. The summary report of the study has been issued to all primary schools. Principals, including those of schools in designated areas of educational disadvantage, have been requested to convene a meeting with their remedial teachers, staff and board of management to discuss the content of the report and the steps they should take at school level to implement the recommendations.</P>
      <P>This whole school approach to planning will have particular significance in schools in designated areas of educational disadvantage. In recognition of this I am allocating significant funding to assist school development planning in these schools. An important focus of this planning will be to identify and address the needs of pupils with serious literacy and other learning difficulties initially in schools in disadvantaged areas and eventually in all schools.</P>
      <P>I have increased the allocation of remedial teachers at primary level from 1,302 to 1,463. I am also very conscious of the need to improve the remedial competence of second level schools to enable them provide a more effective remedial service. To this end, in the current year I have increased the number of remedial teachers at second level from 350 to approximately 560 whole time equivalents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="612" /> Courses in remedial education are provided every year at six centres for approximately 150 primary and post-primary remedial teachers. One of these centres caters for primary remedial teachers only.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that over the next year it is intended to make significant advances in the effectiveness of these resources.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked this question about six months ago and I deliberately re-tabled it to provide a chance to raise the issues again. Nothing has happened since we discussed this matter previously. The report has been sent to principals but not a single step has been taken by the Department to deal with the problems. Is it not the case that 85 per cent of children with difficulties in maths are not getting assistance? Is it not also the case that in disadvantaged schools the remedial programme is not improving the relative position of children? Therefore, do we not need a concentrated effort in disadvantaged schools to improve the quality, extent and impact of the remedial resource?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I reject the statement that nothing has been done. That is not true. The key to resolving this and to improving the quality of what we do in the schools lies in the concept of whole school planning and in resourcing that initiative. We have provided the resources for that initiative and have circulated the initiative to all designated disadvantaged schools and all schools participating in other pilot projects relating to early school leaving or retention initiatives. This is the most significant thing we can do. In addition, we have increased the number of remedial teachers, very significantly at primary and second level, something which is important. Basically we are combining an expansion of the service with a reform of it.</P>
      <P>We have also invested significant resources in the form of additional library grants for books, which is a fundamental prerequisite for high reading and good literacy standards. Last year for the first time every school in the country received a significant grant to set up libraries. In addition, our general staffing improvements and the revised primary curriculum, which has a very strong emphasis on literacy, will reinforce the initiatives we have taken.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the case that the Minister has provided more resources, but that he has effectively spread the jam thinly across the system? This year not a single additional remedial teacher has been allocated to a disadvantaged school at either primary or second level where difficulties are being encountered. Does the Minister agree that what is necessary to make an impact is targeted resources in terms of schools which are in difficulty and a proper national directive with proper technical support for <Col N="613" /> remedial teachers? Talking about schools making plans is all very well, but they will want resources to deliver to children in difficulty, something the Minister has not provided in schools which are really suffering.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I reject the Deputy's basic strategy as he is falling into the pattern and approach that was criticised by the study, that is, that we should look at remedial education in isolation from what happens within the classroom or the school in general. The major fault outlined in the study on remedial teaching is that remedial teachers were taken in isolation, that children were taken out of the classroom and sent to remedial teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is falling into the other trap of saying what schools should do while giving them no resources with which to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Whole school planning is very important. We can pooh-pooh the idea and say it is an airy-fairy concept, but it is not. If one examines some of the projects which have worked in terms of combating disadvantage a common element of all the solutions and strategies has been the issue of whole school planning. The key point is that it is everybody's business that certain children in a school may have a reading or numeracy difficulty and not just the business of the remedial teacher. The Deputy is correct in saying this will require additional resourcing, which we are prepared to give, have given this year and will give over the coming months.</P>

      <Quest>the schools which have represented to his Department that their buildings are below the required standard, substandard in any other sense or in need of replacement; the plans, if any, he has to ensure that no child will have to receive education in such a school by the beginning of the school year in September 2000; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[20191/99]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department does not keep a running record year-on-year of applications from schools for capital, but the total number of capital projects currently being progressed by my Department's building unit is in excess of 2,000 at primary and post-primary levels. These relate to a wide range of issues, not simply substandard accommodation.</P>
      <P>In 1996 prior to my coming into office the capital provision for primary and post-primary schools was £62.9 million. This year's corresponding provision is £147.2 million. Those figures clearly illustrate the Government's commitment to improving the physical fabric of our schools and significant progress has been made in the elimination of substandard accommodation in the recent past. Arrangements are under way to conduct a comprehensive survey of accommodation at primary and post-primary levels to determine more accurately the level of need among schools. It is envisaged that every school in the State will be visited by suitably qualified personnel who will thoroughly inspect the condition of each school and report findings to my Department. This information will be used to target funding more precisely where the need is greatest.</P>
      <P>In addition to the measures outlined, in recent years a devolved grant amounting to £12 million per annum has been introduced at primary level. The purpose of this grant is to enable school authorities to undertake minor improvement works at a local level without further departmental involvement. I am currently considering introducing a similar scheme for post-primary schools.</P>
      <P>My Department is also considering new planning guidelines for school buildings to ensure that new buildings and major renovations and extensions will be built to the most modem standards.</P>
      <P>Clearly, capital projects of their nature take time to complete and in the circumstances it is not realistic to expect that ideal accommodation will be available for every student by September 2000. I reiterate my commitment to significantly improving the standard of accommodation in our schools and am confident that significant progress will be made during the term of office of the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for his reply. However, my question was not about ideal settings for the education of children but rather dealt with substandard, unhygenic and unsafe buildings. I find it difficult to understand that the Department is unable to count the letters it has received from boards of management, parents and teachers concerning the number of such schools. While I am as interested as the Minister in the survey which will be carried out by the Department, could he not provide me with the information I sought in the interim, namely, the number of schools that do not meet the criteria of safety and health or which are substandard? I was not suggesting that the buildings be in an ideal condition by September 2000, I was simply seeking an assurance that no child would be educated in such a school by that date. At a time when there are capital funds available it would be a wonderful millennium project to give me the assurance sought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the reason we are undertaking an inventory of school accommodation. We have moved on all the emergency cases of substandard accommodation that have been brought to our attention by school boards of management. We do not however have an exact figure. That is the reason we are undertaking a comprehensive inventory which will cost a significant amount of money but which is necessary. Within the Department there are up to 2,000 projects and applications which relate to health and safety matters, extensions, expansion of pupil-teacher numbers and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>This is all very fine but I must come back to the text of the question. When a school ceiling falls in it is an emergency. Let me give an example of what I have in mind and why I would not be happy with the idea of waiting for an inventory followed by programmes of works. There is a second level school in Carraroe to which refurbishment works have been carried out over three or four years and which is in a hopeless condition even when the work is allegedly completed. I am asking a simple but interesting question. When parents, teachers and others consider that a school is unsafe, does not meet health standards and is substandard, they write to the Department. I gave plenty of notice of this question. How many such letters are there in the Department? I do not have a difficulty with the Minister's inventory &ndash; I look forward to its completion &ndash; but surely it is known how many primary and second level schools have been described by those who wrote as not meeting these basic requirements. That is the information I am seeking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am also seeking an assurance that a once-off capital programme will be sought to eliminate the backlog. If I am wrong, the Minister should tell <Col N="616" /> me, he should tell me that there are no such letters in the Department, but I am entitled to know what ones are there. If one has a child in such a classroom one will not be encouraged by a statement that an inventory is being undertaken to find out how many others are in the same condition. Will the Minister seek additional capital funds to put the matter right by the year 2000?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very much aware of the central role principals play in our school system. I am also aware that the provision of effective supports for teaching principals is a complex issue. The role of each principal in different schools will vary depending on a wide range of factors, for example, the size of their school. Principals in the more than 800 schools which have only one or two teachers obviously face very different issues from those in larger schools. It was because of the <Col N="617" /> need to examine the full range of issues that I established last year a working group to examine the rights, roles, duties and responsibilities of principals, both administrative and teaching, in primary schools. The review group which was chaired by Teri Garvey was representative of the partners in education and current and former principals comprised a majority of its membership.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, teaching principals already have a range of supports to assist them in carrying out their functions in schools. These include the middle management structure in schools in accordance with which principals may delegate some functions to other teachers in the school. These structures were designed to compensate for the increasing levels of administration and management that arise as schools increase in size. Approximately three quarters of all primary schools have middle management structures. Principals in many schools also have access to secretarial and caretaking services funded by my Department. As the Deputy may be aware, I recently announced a major investment of £2.7 million to provide for a substantial improvement to the secretarial-caretaking scheme in primary schools. In addition various initiatives implemented by the Government have ensured the fundraising burden placed on principals has been significantly reduced and important training supports have been put in place.</P>
      <P>I remain committed to ensuring principals in all our primary schools are effectively supported in their roles and will consider in great detail the report of the working group.</P>

On the £5 million allocated for secretarial and caretaking assistance in schools, is it the case that this is confined to schools with more than 100 pupils?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The position on secretaries and caretakers has been an issue since the PESP. Successive Governments did not bother implementing it and no one on any side shouted too loudly about it. We have now decided to implement the PESP recommendation which relates to all schools with more than 100 pupils. It was indicated to me during the year that if the additional resources could be secured to do even that much it would be seen as a very positive signal by the INTO and teaching principals that the issue was being seriously considered. We have managed to secure the additional funding required to facilitate the provision of such supports this year. The report identifies other areas also, including administrative support in schools with fewer than 100 pupils, and suggests a phased introductory period for delivery of its various recommendations which we are entitled to consider and, as with all other issues pertaining to primary education, prioritise.</P>

When I met the INTO before and after the general election it had a clear list of priorities also which involved class size reduction, the core issue of funding which has been increased by over one third, significant improvements in capital spending which has been increased significantly and so forth. We have also provided funding for library books and information technology. We have now moved on secretarial and caretaking assistance which is a key issue. I regret that a strike has been called. It is not necessary. The report has yet to be formally published. It was clear to all concerned that there would not be movement before the autumn, yet people felt obliged to go on strike.

      <P>The great majority of primary schools now administer standardised tests of literacy and mathematics at each class level from first class upwards. The results are used to inform teachers and parents of pupil progress in these core areas of the curriculum. In addition, the test results are used to identify pupils in need of remedial teaching and to assist teachers in the organisation of their pupils for class and group teaching. As is emphasised in the revised primary curriculum, the regular assessment of pupil attainment is an absolutely essential part of ensuring that each child is helped to achieve his or her potential. This year, I have allocated additional remedial teachers to both primary and second level schools so that all pupils who need help will receive it. A remedial teaching service, comprising of 1,463 remedial teachers, has been allocated to cover all primary schools. We have increased the numbers for post-primary as well. In addition to the ex-quota allocation, schools may provide for remedial teaching within their teaching quota at second level. Remedial teachers administer a range of diagnostic tests to determine the nature of the learning difficulties of pupils identified by group-administered standardised tests.</P>
      <P>As I mentioned in my earlier reply to the Deputy, it is intended to implement improvements to the operation of remedial teaching in light of both domestic and international research. I have already initiated discussions with the educational research centre in order to explore the extent to which it would be beneficial to expand the use of standardised measures of curricular attainment in schools for monitoring pupil progress and for identifying pupils with learning difficulties. Arising from this, I intend giving schools specific supports for the use of up to date assessment tools at all stages. This approach of building the capacity of schools to administer and, crucially, act upon assessments is the best means of proceeding and helping pupils to attain higher standards across the curriculum.</P>

      <P>It is important to cut to the core of this matter. Is the Minister willing to instruct <Col N="620" /> schools that there should be a standard national test which would be the basis for benchmarking where schools are in relation to fundamental issues, and allocating resources to tackle a key problem? Does the Minister support the recent call by the general secretary of the INTO to make tackling literacy in schools a millennium project? That would mean giving resources to tackle identified needs. Is the Minister aware that currently 17 per cent of young people leaving schools aged 16 to 25 are at the lowest level of functional literacy? The Minister's officials told the Committee on Education and Science that we are the 20th of 24 countries in terms of literacy among 14 year olds, 21 per cent of whom have reading difficulties. The Minister must focus priority resources on this area, and he should start with national testing backed by resources.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>More important than national testing is testing and assessment within the classroom, and giving teachers and schools the necessary resources to do that. As I indicated in my reply, I am doing that and am prepared to do even more in terms of providing financial resources, particularly for more modern standardised tests that are now available. That is the key issue. The primary school curriculum review examined the issue of assessment and came down heavily in favour of a process of assessment within school classrooms. The methodology of teaching obviously should involve such an assessment process, which is crucial to high literacy attainment.</P>

      <P>That is not true. The bottom line is that we can glean a picture nationally. There are different ways of doing so. In the past, we have engaged in international surveys as well as comparative surveys on literacy, numeracy and attainment within our primary schools. A major national survey is currently coming to completion on literacy and reading abilities. We have participated in such surveys in the past and will participate more in international assessments.

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am confident the arrangements which have been put in place to support the implementation of the revised primary school curriculum are appropriate and will provide high quality professional development opportunities for teachers and the wider education community. Planning for implementation has been under way for some considerable time. Over the past two years, the Government has prioritised investment in primary education and many of its initiatives have sought to anticipate the resource implications of the revised curriculum.</P>
      <P>In addition, the primary curriculum implementation group, involving representatives of the education partners, has been in place since 1997, and has been deeply involved in proposing the support strategy, which I approved for implementation some months ago. Important strands which were addressed during this process include the circulation of information to schools during the lead-in period, arrangements for the distribution of the curriculum documentation, and planning for professional development programmes.</P>
      <P>Central to the organisation of support has been the establishment of a dedicated primary curriculum support programme, in place since September 1998. With staffing, which includes a national co-ordinator, an assistant co-ordinator and a team of 40 trainers, the PCSP works in close co-operation with the national network of education support centres in organising professional development programmes.</P>
      <P>The primary task of the PCSP is to support teachers in managing the implementation process. Already, within little more than a month since the launch of the curriculum, more than 3,000 teachers have participated in a two-day course entitled &ldquo;An Introduction to the Curriculum&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>By February 2000, every primary teacher will have had an opportunity of participating in this course, and further courses are planned for the latter part of the current school year as part of a phased support programme. Following each course, an in-school planning day will enable schools to begin the process of planning for implementation in their individual schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the national professional development programme, the education support centre network, in response to locally identified <Col N="623" /> needs will organise additional activities for teachers and schools. The PCSP also has responsibility for liaising with parent and management groups to ensure that they too have access to information about the revised curriculum. Information seminars have already been organised in conjunction with the National Parents' Council &ndash; Primary. Further seminars for parents are planned and the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment will prepare an information booklet for parents on the revised curriculum.</P>
    <P>The launch of the revised curriculum on 9 September marked the end of the development phase and the beginning of a phased approach to implementation, which will be supported over a four to five year period. This will involve the commitment of more than £5 million to the end of next year and further substantial funding thereafter. I am committed to ensuring that pupils in our schools experience the content and processes of learning promoted in the revised curriculum and that they have every opportunity to achieve high standards of both educational attainment and personal development. It is my intention that the effectiveness of the support programme, as well as levels of implementation in schools, will be closely monitored over the coming years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister think it is fair that the in-service training will be provided by sending children home for six days each year for the next five years and expecting parents to make alternative arrangements for their children? Does he accept that a more professional way to provide the major in-service investment for the implementation of the primary curriculum would be to negotiate with the trade unions to enable in-service training to take place during vacation periods?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree in the sense that it is important that everybody involved in education, including parents, respects and acknowledges the central importance of professional development in terms of the implementation of any revised curriculum. In-service is as valid a part of the school year as the school day itself. I am not sure if it is six days every year, although there is a major two day course this year because of a broad introductory programme&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>That depends on how many subjects are done each year and how many schools cut back. The national primary parents' council has accepted this point and it said to me that it is important to send out the message that in-service is most important. It is also important that it is done properly and we have worked with all the <Col N="624" /> partners in terms of developing the implementation programme. Everybody is on board not only in terms of the content of the curriculum but also the process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it difficult to understand the Minister's argument that the school week must be disrupted if proper quality in-service training is to be provided and that this in some way gets parents to have blood on their shirts in relation to in-service training. I cannot see any merit in that view. Surely in-service training should be done in a professional way by giving enough time&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;in vacation periods when there are no distractions in terms of trying to get back to manage various items relating to school activities. In any modern organisation, surely this is the way to provide in-service training rather than disrupting production to facilitate such training. It may make sense to the partnership the Minister mentioned, but it makes no sense to most parents whose children were sent home last Monday week and who had to make alternative arrangements. Perhaps both parents have to work to meet the cost of housing today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>It should also be pointed out that the in-service programme for the primary school curriculum is not the only in-service course under way at present. A range of other in-service programmes take place during Easter breaks and the summer vacation period. The number of information technology in-service programmes that have taken place outside school hours has been phenomenal over the past two years. By the end of this year, up to 40,000 teachers will have taken part in in-service programmes on information technology, many of which took place outside school hours.</P>
      <P>The central point is that the issue of the terms and conditions of teachers cannot be effortlessly glossed over or put to one side. There are fundamental issues in this area also and the key issue as far as I am concerned is that the revised curriculum is a major advance in terms of content and process.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>

This is the largest curricular support programme in the history of the State. For example, in 1971 no documentation was issued because of lack of resources. The material which has been issued is sufficient to enable teachers to teach the new curriculum. It contains fantastic information, including sample lessons, exemplar lessons and information on content and methodology. Teachers have already received a rich source of information.</P>

      <P>Safety on school transport is of paramount importance to my Department and to Bus Éireann which operates the scheme on behalf of the Department. Bus Éireann has a very good safety record in the operation of school transport and an ongoing commitment to highlight safety in this regard.</P>
      <P>Bus Éireann is responsible for the safe condition of the vehicles in use and has a wide range of checking procedures in place to ensure a safe and reliable service. All vehicles operating under the scheme meet rigid safety standards and, where vehicles have over eight adult seats and are more than one year old, they are required to pass the Department of the Environment and Local Government tests in regard to road worthiness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="627" /> Bus Éireann vehicles are serviced every six weeks under specified maintenance procedures to ensure that the highest safety standards are achieved. Any faults coming to the notice of Bus Éireann maintenance staff are dealt with immediately. A large proportion of the existing Bus Éireann school bus fleet was refurbished during summer 1999. All school transport vehicles operated by Bus Éireann and private contractors are subject to an annual road worthiness check and to regular inspection to ensure their reliability is maintained throughout the year. All buses are fitted with heating and demisting systems. The age profile of the Bus Éireann school bus fleet is being significantly improved due to the ongoing programme of introducing former service buses to school transport, replacing older vehicles.</P>
    <P>Under the Government's strategy for road safety, the Department of the Environment and Local Government, in consultation with my Department, is committed to developing a strategy for safety on school transport. In this context, Bus Éireann has been requested to consider the wide range of safety issues associated with the operation of the school transport scheme.

In the absence of seat belts on overcrowded buses, what is the position of insurance cover for the child? It is not unreasonable to ask when we might see changes that will eliminate dangerous overcrowding on buses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree it is not unreasonable. The road traffic regulations issued by the Department of the Environment and Local Government govern the loading on school buses. Similarly, under the public service vehicle regulations the licensed carrying capacity of all vehicles engaged in school transport is based on the ratio of three pupils for every two adult seats. That has been the system for a long time. Under existing regulations, passenger seat belts are non-compulsory in buses, including those operating under the school transport scheme.</P>

For years all interested parties were call<Col N="629" /> ing for funding for school bus escorts for children with special needs. In the last budget I secured that funding. For a number of months afterwards, we were in negotiations with the national association of boards of management of special schools and did not get agreement on how it would be administered.

It is an unusual situation where the Minister secures the funding and makes it available to the boards of management but some of them return the cheques. It is regrettable that happened. To a certain extent, we can overstate the difficulties here. It is interesting that the pilot project that was introduced two years ago in about 100 schools did not show up the difficulties that are now being put forward.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8, 13, 28 and 94 together.</P>
      <P>This school year is seeing the first allocation of additional teachers to second level schools for some years. This year provision was made for 225 additional teachers and this, together with the retention of 130 teachers who would otherwise have been redeployed, enables us to provide a remedial teaching service in every second level school and also to bring all disadvantaged schools into the home-school liaison scheme. I have also made improvements in the provisions available for guidance in our schools with a guaranteed minimum allocation now available to every school.</P>
      <P>In addition to providing for additional teachers, I have this year introduced a new retention ratio for secondary schools. The impact of this is to retain in schools teachers who would otherwise be liable to be redeployed. In all, 150 teachers have been retained under this initiative and these teachers will continue to be available to improve the quality of education in our schools. At second level the issue of disadvantage is closely linked to the incidence of early school leaving. For that reason I put in place a number of initiatives focused on this difficult and intractable problem. In addition to the eight to 15 initiative, a new stay in school initiative is now commencing.</P>
      <P>The issue of class size in second level schools is complex. Analysis of this issue conducted by my Department indicates a varied pattern of class size across the second level sector. In general, senior cycle classes are appreciably smaller than those at junior cycle and the pattern across subjects can vary significantly. It is in the nature of some subjects that they attract a relatively small cohort while traditionally core subjects account for larger classes. In addition, schools with like enrolments and resources can have quite different patterns of class size.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principal concern in relation to class size must be the impact on educational attainment. In this regard, the great body of research indicates that the major impact of class size is to be found in the early years of primary education and for disadvantaged groups in particular. In the 1998-99 school year the pupil-teacher ratio at second level was approximately 15.4:1. Allowing for the increase of 225 teachers and a projected drop in enrolments, it is expected that the pupil-teacher ratio will reduce to approximately 15.1:1 in the current school year. This represents a decline in the actual PTR from that which prevailed in the <Col N="631" /> 1970s. Within the current PTR there are a large number of very small classes.</P>
    <P>Approaches to enrolment and redeployment at second level have remained relatively static over many years and one result of this is that there is no necessary link between the allocation of additional teachers and the achievement of key educational priorities such as widening subject and programme choice. Present redeployment arrangements fail to achieve a balancing of necessary resources among schools. For these reasons, I have recently written to the unions and management interests indicating my intention to have these issues examined by a technical or expert group in consultation with the various interests.</P>
    <P>I have a strong commitment to continuing to improve the resources available to our schools. It is vitally important that investment in education in all its forms has the ultimate well-being of the pupil at its core and I see the review which I mentioned as being of considerable value in achieving that objective.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Can I take it from the Minister's reply that he does not accept the results of the national ASTI survey in spring 1999 which showed that 60 per cent of second level schools are offering general subject classes with more than the recommended maximum of 30 students, that 30 per cent of schools have difficulty because of inadequate staffing in providing the full range of science subjects and that 42 per cent of schools have difficulty because of inadequate staffing in providing access to the full range of technical subjects? Does the Minister accept or reject this survey? An appeal to complexity does not impress me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>We are willing to discuss the statistics with any group. We have statistics on class size at second level. One might not take the concept of complexity seriously but it is a fact. The key issue is how we allocate resources in the future to obtain our objectives. There are twice as many classes in the system, for example, that have fewer than 15 pupils than have more than 30 pupils. Reducing the general schedule by one or 0.2 in itself will not dramatically impact on many class sizes. I have asked the unions involved to find out what is the best way of providing additional posts at second level to achieve our core educational priorities. I do not accept that a simplistic approach of simply and solely reducing the schedule is the way forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us stick strictly to general subject classes for a start. I take from the Minister's first answer that the analysis that was made of reducing the class size would probably not apply there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>What does &ldquo;general&rdquo; mean?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I have difficulty accepting the first answer which suggests that reducing class sizes does not automatically lead to beneficial results. I have decided to concentrate on general subject classes and my argument, therefore, is that if over 60 per cent of second level schools are offering general subject classes with more than 30 pupils, it is obvious that reducing the class size would have an effect. Does the Minister agree that the inflexible way in which the panel operates at present means that teachers, with the changed enrolments in different subjects that are taking place, can stay on the books of a school while schools are prevented from hiring young, highly talented second level teachers simply because the ratio is being operated inflexibly? If the Minister is arguing for complexity within the subject provision, he cannot then retain an inflexible ratio at the same time. He cannot have it both ways.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>That is more of a holy grail for the unions than for the Minister. I would be interested in examining that issue. The Deputy was correct in the sense &ndash; as I mentioned in my reply &ndash; that the redeployment scheme does not allow for a proper balancing of resources. We reduced the retention rate last year to try to free up some of the teachers on the redeployment panel to enable them to go back to the schools, as part of the core staffing. There is, however, an issue there that we want to examine. That is why we have written to the unions and the management with a view to all of us agreeing a process to get to the core of this issue. In terms of the core classes of English, Irish, and mathematics, there are schools with significant class sizes over 30.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but the size of many of the general subject classes would not be more than 30. Many of the subjects have very low class sizes. Many people would be surprised about that, and I am willing to make the data available to Members.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Specifically on this matter, does he recall that before the last general election he published an interesting document under the banner &ldquo;People before Politics&rdquo; in which he gave an explicit com<Col N="633" /> mitment that extra teachers would be made available to schools with under 300 pupils to provide for a broadening of the range of subject choice, but that has not happened. Why will he not allocate teachers instead of setting up another review group? He made this commitment in good faith to the electorate, but now he is pushing it off into endless rounds of discussions. He is two and a half years in Government and, perhaps, he will be out of it soon. Why does he not deliver on what he promised?</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 39 together.</P>
      <P>The 1995 White Paper on Education provided that the Higher Education Authority, in consultation with the third level institutions, would be asked to advise on the most appropriate and effective means of achieving an annual increase in participation of 500 students from lower socio-economic groups in third level education over the next five years. The White Paper further provided that each third level institution would be encouraged to develop links with designated second level schools.</P>
      <P>Through some targeted funding provided to the universities by the Higher Education Authority and funding from within the overall financial allocations to the institutes of technology, the third level colleges have developed initiatives, as proposed in the White Paper, which involve links with second level schools and local communities. Examples of these activities include the Pathways Through Education project, supervised study programmes, summer schools, study skills programmes and mentoring.</P>
      <P>The Higher Education Authority is currently compiling statistical information in relation to the initiatives under way to increase participation, and the authority has commissioned Dr. Bob Osborne of the University of Ulster to undertake an evaluation of these initiatives. The authority has also commissioned Professor Malcolm Skilbeck to consider, in an international context, trends and issues arising from efforts to improve equity in higher education and to identify strategies and procedures that show promise in meeting objectives of greater equity. This study will address the full range of equality issues, not just those pertaining to socio-economic disadvantage. In addition, I understand that the fourth national survey of entrants to higher education, being undertaken by Professor Patrick Clancy on behalf of the Higher Education Authority, is expected to be published in late spring 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The work of the Commission on the Points System, which I established in October 1997, is also <Col N="636" /> relevant in this regard. Its terms of reference include examining the effect of the existing system of entry to third level education on access to third level of students who have experienced significant educational disadvantage. I understand the commission's report is being finalised presently.</P>
    <P>These various studies will facilitate a critical examination of the current arrangements. These arrangements will be complemented and strengthened by the £6.9 million funding initiative I announced to tackle educational disadvantage at third level. Of this funding, £3 million is being specifically allocated to promote access to third level among students from disadvantaged backgrounds, including people with disabilities. My Department has had discussions with the access officers of the colleges, the Union of Students in Ireland, the Higher Education Authority and other interested bodies in relation to this funding and I hope to be in a position to finalise the arrangements for the funding in the near future.</P>
    <P>A further sum of £1.5 million is being provided to address the issue of non-completion of courses in important parts of the third level system. My Department is currently engaged in discussions with institutes of technology with regard to the measures for which this funding will be used. In addition, in agreeing to an increase in the student services charge for this year it has been indicated to institutes of technology that £8 of this charge is to be specifically devoted to attrition-access initiatives in the institutes. The institutes have been requested to furnish the proposals for the attrition-access initiatives in this context at an early date.</P>
    <P>The remaining £2.4 million of the funding initiative will permit the higher, non-adjacent rate of grant to be paid to all eligible mature students under the student support schemes with effect from the 1999-2000 academic year. I will stop there because the answer is sufficiently long as it is.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be wrong not to acknowledge the efforts being made in many third level institutions. Is the Minister in a position to indicate the number of second level colleges which do not liaise with a third level institution? The increased efforts being made in third level institutions will come to nothing if new connections are not made with the second level institutions where the need is greatest. It is not an impossible task for the Department to tell us what proportion of second level institutions have made meaningful contact with appropriate third level institutions to offer their students a choice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have the exact figure with me but I can give the Deputy the information on second level schools which have developed linkages with third level colleges. Some third level <Col N="637" /> colleges are fairly late into the field in terms of initiatives. UCD, in terms of the New Era project, DCU, Dublin Institute of Technology, UCC laterally and others have developed linkages with second level schools, mainly in designated disadvantaged areas. That is the key to progress.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of many second level colleges which regard third level institutions as a totally different world. There is no connection between the advice available to the most vulnerable students and what they are prepared for at third level. What intervention mechanism is available when the connection does not exist? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>We are providing additional resources but the institutions must do more. Some have done more than others. I met the directors of the institutes of technology yesterday and I told them we have not done enough as a society over the years to advance and increase the participation rates of those from socio-economic backgrounds in third level institutions. We must start at primary and second level. There must be more linkages between schools and between universities and institutes of technology. Some laudable initiatives have started, including the BITE initiative with DCU and the New Era programme in UCD. Some colleges started access programmes as late as last year. The key is to work with the access officers in the third level institutions to develop the linkages. We have asked them to come back to us with their plans for expanding initiatives in this area and we will fund those plans.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that every time we look for figures, someone is evaluating them and we are told we will get them soon? The Department stated that 87 people had entered the third level sector under this initiative whereas the target in the White Paper is 2,500.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought it was 500 per year, which would be 2,500 by now. Does the Minister agree it is time to consider playing a stronger role in this area, such as stating that funding for colleges should be conditional on them establishing and developing programmes to a minimum target level? Has he set target levels for his own initiative of £6.9 million? We want to be able to ask in a year's time how much did the Department achieve of the target it set. This has been an area of commitment studded with good promises but little&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Funding mechanisms or structures were not in the Department or in many of the third level colleges. The only funding made available to the initiatives, such as the BITE initiative, was a fairly meagre disadvantage fund of £0.5 <Col N="638" /> million from 1995 onwards and half of that was allocated for access purposes for students with disabilities. The first major funding in this area was provided in last year's budget. The Deputy is correct that we will take a strong directional role in this area in terms of the governance of the various institutions. We do not govern the institutions but we fund them. They have indicated to us they are willing to participate in this endeavour. I am still not entirely satisfied they are working in a coherent and co-ordinated way in terms of the numbers.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister accept that while the colleges have a clear responsibility in this, the lead must be given by the Government and to do so the Government must make clear it is serious about tackling this problem? Does he further accept that if the problem is to be tackled in a meaningful way clear data must be available on the current participation rates and that targets should be set for increasing those rates? When we discussed this issue before the summer recess, the Minister was not in a position to provide any data to us on the participation rates from different counties or parts of cities. Has he gathered any information since on the current position so that we can monitor it and see what progress, if any, is being made? </P>

      <P>The purpose of the current pilot phase of this initiative is to test models of response to the problem of early school leaving with a view to identifying effective approaches to the problem which could be replicated across the education system. A total of 14 project areas have been selected to participate in the present phase of the initiative. The areas selected cover both urban and rural locations. Each project involves local first and second level schools, as well as local partnership groups, community groups and statutory and voluntary organisations. The current phase of this programme will operate from September 1998 to June 2000. The programme is <Col N="640" /> being evaluated by the Children's Research Centre in Trinity College. The final evaluation report is expected by September 2000. The question of extending the early school leavers programme to further areas will be considered in the light of the outcome of the evaluation of the present pilot phase.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that I also recently announced a £4.5 million initiative aimed at keeping pupils in school up to the end of the leaving certificate. Marking a significant departure from traditional policy, the funding will be granted to schools on the basis of plans which they will be helped to design. At the core of this initiative will be a multi-annual written retention plan or agreement drawn up between the school and my Department. This will provide for a range of targeted measures directed at the particular needs of the school, together with clear projected outcomes in terms of increased retention. A key requirement of the individual retention plans will be that the school, as the driver of the initiative, operates on a multi-agency basis and establishes appropriate cross-community links in delivering on its commitments. Implementation of this initiative will commence shortly.</P>

      <P>Does he agree that making this scheme a pilot and waiting until 2001 for its possible extension is poor consolation especially when the Minister gave £250 million to the technology sector at the drop of a hat, although it was welcome. However, early school leavers, who should be a priority, are given £3 million or £4 million and told to wait until 2001 when they may get a little more. People are committed to this issue.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Clearly, nutrition is vitally important to the health of children and is of particular significance in areas designated as disadvantaged. Undernourished children or children in poor health are unlikely to be in a position to take full advantage of the education system. While my Department responds to educational disadvantage through various schemes, the Departments of Health and Children and Social and Community and Family Affairs have responsibility in areas relating to malnutrition.</P>
      <P>The Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs engaged consultants to carry out a review of the schools meals scheme and has forwarded a copy of the consultants' report to my Department. A working group comprising officials from both Departments, together with representatives from the Department of Health and Children, the Department of the Environment and Local Government, the Department of Finance and Dublin Corporation has been established to review the existing scheme. The first meeting of this working group was held on 22 September 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="643" /> In carrying out the evaluation of the school meals scheme, the working group will also consult many other relevant bodies.

An interdepartmental review is taking place to examine which is the best Department to administer and deliver this scheme. This is an important issue which cannot be decided overnight as it has resource implications for the Departments concerned.

He now tells us that meeting took place in the past month. Is he aware that very large numbers of children from disadvantaged areas are going to school unable to participate in education because they are hungry? Is he aware that many school principals say the most significant change they could make would be to introduce hot nutritious meals in schools? Is he aware that today and every day for the past 18 months while he has sat on this report, children have gone hungry and have been unable to benefit from education? Will he give this matter his urgent attention and stop the nonsense about evaluation processes and consultants' reports? We have enough reports. The report recommended that the Minister take responsibility for nutrition in schools.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to take these questions together.</P>
      <P>The Health Service Employers Agency met yesterday with the Alliance of Nursing Unions to discuss the provision of emergency and essential nursing cover during the nurses' strike scheduled to commence on Tuesday next, 19 October. Some progress was made in arrangements for care in certain areas, for example, metabolic screening of new-born babies for PKU and other genetic disorders &ndash; the Guthrie or heel prick test &ndash; and care of terminally ill patients. I am very concerned, however, that there is no detailed agreed plan at national level with the nursing unions. In the absence of such an agreed plan it is still not possible for me to give the House an assurance on the level and extent of nursing care available in the event of a strike.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was agreement on the following areas. In relation to metabolic screening, it was agreed by the unions that nurses would co-operate in the referral of new-born mothers to hospital for the Guthrie test. In default of attendance, cases would be referred. It was agreed that the unions will provide local management with details of emergency cover duty rosters to facilitate investi<Col N="646" /> gation of critical instances, if any, which might arise.</P>
    <P>Disagreement was recorded, however, in relation to the following matters which are a source of continued concern to me and to health service management. On the administration of intravenous drugs, the unions continue to refuse to facilitate a national protocol which would cover the administration of IV drugs as an essential task. It had been previously agreed, however, that this would be undertaken in emergency cases. I appeal to the unions not to create hardship for patients on this issue.</P>
    <P>In relation to warfarin and diabetes clinics, it was indicated by the unions that the nurses would be withdrawing from these clinics.</P>
    <P>In relation to pharmacy and drugs, the unions stated that emergency cover will not include the restocking of pharmaceutical supplies or cooperation with the continued administration of drugs to day care patients.</P>
    <P>On communications, the unions would not agree to co-operate with the proposals to provide dedicated clinical care phone facilities. This would have assisted hospitals in providing a necessary facility for relatives and/or carers when inquiring for up to date information on the well-being of patients.</P>
    <P>While health service management acknowledge that a certain amount of progress has been achieved through local discussions, there remains a gap between what is offered by the unions and the minimum requirements, as outlined by management on 30 September. The continued absence of a nationally agreed framework leaves an element of uncertainty regarding the provision of minimum care requirements at all locations for the duration of the strike. I share the concern of health service managers on this issue, as undoubtedly does the House.</P>
    <P>I should remind the House that the HSEA document outlined the minimum cover necessary to ensure that lives are not put at risk for the duration of the strike. This document was compiled in consultation with a wide range of health care agencies, including senior nurse managers.</P>
    <P>In the absence of national agreement, health agencies have made arrangements to inform patients or clients of the general deferral of admissions, clinics and the curtailment of other health services, as appropriate, within the terms of their own contingency plans and subject to consultation with medical and other staff, as required. Advertisements from health boards and the major hospitals are currently appearing in the newspapers informing the public of the effect of the planned strike on services.</P>
    <P>The HSEA is meeting with the Irish Medical Organisation and with the Irish Hospital Consultants' Association this afternoon to discuss the situation in the light of yesterday's meeting. Previously, the Department had written to both <Col N="647" /> organisations appraising them of the situation. Individual health agencies are also liaising with general practitioners concerning the effects of the strike.</P>
    <P>In reply to Deputy Quinn's question as to whether the Government will reopen negotiations with the nursing unions with a view to averting the strike, I can only repeat what I have said in this House and in Seanad Éireann over the past two days, and what the Taoiseach said on Tuesday. The Government believes that the combination of the acceptance of the Labour Court findings regarding pay and allowances, the implementation of the report of the Commission on Nursing and the continuing discussions with public service unions about a new approach to public service pay determination provide enough scope to address the nursing issues, both pay and non-pay, in a reasonable way.</P>
    <P>I appeal once again to the Nursing Alliance to call off the threatened all-out strike and to pursue their case in the context of the forthcoming discussions between the Government and the social partners on a new national programme to succeed Partnership 2000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the general public are aghast at the Minister's failure to attempt any constructive dialogue of any nature with the nursing unions? Will he acknowledge and recognise that the activity and effort being put into trying to agree contingency arrangements is extraordinary in the context of the Minister's own failure to engage in such dialogue? Is the Minister aware that this morning the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children unanimously, across party lines, agreed that a letter should go to the Minister and the unions asking that constructive dialogue take place? Will the Minister now, before a strike occurs, commence a process to facilitate the resolution of this dispute instead of continuing to adopt an attitude whereby he regards a dispute as inevitable, and both he and his colleagues, in what they say, inflame the situation to a greater degree and create more difficulties than we need have at this stage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>At no stage have I sought to inflame the situation, only to outline the Government position. The Government has put forward an alternative strategy for the Nursing Alliance which need not involve any hardship to the public and which at the same time allows them to pursue, as they see it, legitimate grievances that they would contend still exist after the Labour Court series of recommendations, without providing a prescriptive outcome. I refute the claim that the Government is not offering an alternative to what is being proposed by the Nursing Alliance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of the use of the word &ldquo;inevitable&rdquo;, it is one that has been used by the Nursing Alliance leadership, not by the Government. The <Col N="648" /> Government does not seek a confrontation or a strike, nor does it believe it is necessary in the context of the alternative strategy it has outlined to the Nursing Alliance as providing an alternative approach which need not provide the effect on services which is envisaged should the strike go ahead.</P>
    <P>In relation to the efforts that have been made, I stated before in the House, and again this evening, that since 30 September we have put to the Nursing Alliance a proposed contingency plan for emergency and other essential care during the threatened nurses' strike. We would require a national framework for the assurance that the House seeks to be given unconditionally. It should be said that as a result of yesterday's meeting, and the report from the various areas, it is clear that the gaps which existed are closing considerably. I acknowledge that much progress has been made in local discussions between management and unions in addressing the issues which we would like to see the Nursing Alliance agree to but, unfortunately, thus far the Nursing Alliance has not been open to including an agreement with the health service management on a national framework which would give the assurance that the House seeks. However, considerable progress has been made at local level and the lines remain open between the HSEA and the Nursing Alliance to see what further efforts can be made to close already closing gaps between the level of cover being sought and the level of cover this is proposed to be given. In fairness to the Nursing Alliance, there is no indication of non-acceptance, to put it that way, in relation to the staffing of critical care areas that one would expect should be covered because an emergency is an emergency and critical care is critical care, no matter on what side of the table one is sitting, even in the event of a strike being contemplated.</P>
    <P>As I said in my reply, considerable progress is being made at local level. However, as I have said from the outset, it appears the problem with the local arrangements is that they would not provide us with the level of certainty and uniformity which the public feels entitled to expect if this strike took place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said in his reply that advertisements outlining the available cover were placed in the newspapers by the various health boards. Has he seen the banner headline of the <i>Evening Herald</i>, which states &ldquo;Operation Shutdown&rdquo; and which is the message that will be conveyed to the public? There is a fear across this city and the wider country that because of the failure so far of the negotiators on behalf of the health service employers, the Department of Health and Children and the nursing unions to arrive at an agreed level of care, beyond what the Minister has already outlined, there will be a serious crisis next Tuesday. In light of the failure <Col N="649" /> so far, according to the report the Minister has just given us, will he reconsider the hard-line stance the Government has adopted from the very beginning and see if there is a way in which negotiations can be opened up along the lines, for example, outlined by Tom Hayes on the radio earlier? This dispute will have to be settled at some stage. Can it be settled in advance of the inevitable deaths that will take place rather than afterwards?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The foundation of language is important here. This morning the Nursing Alliance, personified by Mr. Des Kavanagh, the General Secretary of the PNA, confirmed that there is no intention on its part to put lives at risk. We should accept that. There is always an understandable tendency to overstate a case for the purpose of making a point. However, one should accept the Nursing Alliance's intention in that respect, and there is no need for us to repeat it. That has been clarified by them and by us. The headline &ldquo;Operation Shutdown&rdquo; which the Deputy has just shown me does a grave injustice to nurses. Nurses are not intent on providing an operation shutdown.</P>

      <P>Where there is inaccuracy, let us clear it up. It is inaccurate, given the level of progress that has been made at local level in discussions regarding the need to provide the minimum emergency cover outlined in the document of 30 September. While I acknowledge that it appears to be the case thus far that the Nursing Alliance is not open to agree a framework at national level, significant progress is being made at local level. As I have said, it is my strong view that it is very difficult to guarantee uniformity and certainty where we are dependent on local arrangements. However, progress has been made at local discussions to deal substantively with the <Col N="650" /> issues which are a cause of concern to all parties. At this stage, I am prepared to acknowledge, as I think every Member of the House should be, that all sides have similar definitions of what emergencies consist of. As I said, we are making significant progress. There are areas of disagreement but the lines remain open and the local discussions continue.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the substance of the Deputy's first question, it is asking a bit much of the Labour Court to deal with all the issues he outlined. That could all have been dealt with on the basis of a restructured claim that had a limit of 5.5 per cent from the PCW. We have enough problems with the specifics of this issue without bringing everything else into it. To that extent, other issues are absolutely irrelevant.</P>
      <P>The question of arbitration in relation to the merits or demerits of the claims that were processed has been dealt with by the established industrial relations machinery. The Government has made clear that it is not in a position to undermine the authority of the Labour Court or to depart from its recommendations. It has explained, calmly and uncontested, that it has done so on the basis of the wider implications for public sector pay of departing from those recommendations. That is not, in any way, to speak of what other ways these issues could be developed, on the basis of the alternative strategy the Government has outlined.</P>
      <P>Therefore, in regard to the Private Notice Question tabled by the Deputy &ndash; people might question my objectivity but this is also the view of many objective observers, one of whom was mentioned by Deputy Quinn &ndash; it would be regarded as an outstanding negotiating and arbitrating success to emerge with an average 23 per cent increase, on the basis of a claim under a restructuring clause that allowed for 5.5 per cent.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree that disputes are resolved by conciliation, not confrontation, and that he has chosen the latter option? Will he outline in detail the steps he will be taking between now and Tuesday to avert this strike action? Does he agree that successive Governments have taken nurses for granted in that they have seen nursing as a vocation rather than a job? Is it the case that the consultants wanted total control over deciding what constituted essential and emergency cover and that that is where the problem lies?</P>

      <P>Again, the Deputy's question related to the contingency plans that are being made, and I have outlined those to the House. His questions now are more extraneous, but I will deal with them. I reiterate that no confrontation has been sought by the Government in relation to this matter. The Government has abided by <Col N="652" /> the procedures and honoured the commitments it was asked to honour under the established industrial relations machinery, which was set up to deal with cases such as this where parties in direct discussions cannot come to agreement. The failure of one side of the equation, the Nursing Alliance, to abide by those principles of social partnership resulted in a strike ballot being taken and notification of strike action has been forwarded. The reason there will be a strike is because Nursing Alliance has decided to use what I regard as a blunt weapon when other avenues are available which need not affect the public and which allow it advance its issues in a way consistent with the social partnership which has brought success to all parts of the country and all elements of the workforce, including nurses.</P>

      <P>I asked a question about consultants and the Minister has the answer. Is it the case that the consultants wanted total control over the definition of essential and emergency cover and that that is where the problem lay in dealing with contingency plans?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is more comprehensive and complex than that. It must be asked what constitutes essential nursing cover. The Nursing Alliance has a legitimate view to express about that. Clearly the admittance to hospitals is a medical or clinical decision and the IMO has issued a circular to everyone suggesting that the protocols relating to that should continue and I believe they will.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware, and can he tell the House how many operations have to date been cancelled by hospitals because of this threatened strike? Is he aware, and can he tell the House how many residential homes to date have been in contact with relations of people who are intellectually or physically disabled requesting they bring their relations home this weekend? Is <Col N="653" /> the Minister in a position to tell the House how many patients are so affected? Is he in a position to tell the House how many hospitals to date cancelled casualty department appointments dating back over many weeks for a variety of patients? Can the Minister tell the House exactly what he and his Department are doing to monitor the impact as of now of the proposed strike and what he will do next week to monitor the impact of a strike which would not have occurred had he engaged in constructive dialogue with the nursing unions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Constructive dialogue has taken place for four years on this matter and the Labour Court has confirmed we have reached the culmination of that process. Obviously elective admissions will be affected by this proposed strike action. Regarding residential services for intellectually disabled and geriatric patients and so forth, local discussions have confirmed that personal care and the usual proper nursing care for those people in residential facilities will continue and that is welcome. Obviously day care services will be affected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Why did relations of people in residential homes receive phone calls yesterday and today? Can the Minister indicate to the House if he knows how many elective surgeries involving serious areas of specialities such as orthopaedics and cardiac surgery have been cancelled to date throughout the country? Is he monitoring that and can he tell us what is the position to date? Has a calculation been done by his Department on what impact there will be on the waiting lists if this strike begins and continues for a number of days, if not weeks?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously we will be able to assess that if and when the strike occurs and continues. I have candidly stated that elective admissions will be affected, as will waiting lists, as a result of a reduction in activity levels in the acute hospital system. All these procedures will be affected and that goes without saying. That is why we continue to appeal, even at this late stage, to the Nursing Alliance not to proceed with this strike and allow us proceed with the alternative strategy.</P>

      <P>Deputy Quinn was Minister for Finance at a time when what was on offer was a third of what is now on offer. Be that as it may, we all have our responsibilities and they change from time to time. The Government has stated that, if people are prepared to uphold the principles of social partnership, there is a means by which these issues can be continued to be addressed, but they cannot be addressed on the basis of a departure from the Labour Court recommendations. That is the Government's position and it is not a confrontational, absolutist or irredentist position.</P>

      <P>It is one which provides the scope for the issues which the Nursing Alliance wishes to see addressed to be continued to be addressed in the appropriate fora which have been set out by Government, which include the Commission on Nursing, the question of a new pay determination system to be agreed through working with their public service union people, and a post-Partnership 2000 arrangement. That, coupled with acceptance of the Labour Court recommendation, provides an available level of scope which is unavailable when strike action is taken. That is the fact of the matter and it is an unarguable case. The Government is anxious that everyone would again dedicate themselves to the principles of social partnership, which have served all the social partners well, as the means by which we now do business in this country. We do not want&mdash;</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not accept that this is a recommendation from the Labour Court that we are talking about, that it is not mandatory, that it is not arbitration? The Cabinet had to meet before the Government decided whether it would accept the recommendation. Would he accept that there are many examples where recommendations are not accepted either by one side or the other, that in this case one side has not accepted the recommendation but that does not mean the end of collective bargaining, and that the Minister has the capacity and the freedom&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise an additional point. With due respect to the Minister, I can tell him that the key to ensuring that people will be looked after in care is the opening up of discussions between the Minister and the nursing unions. That is the way forward. Talk is always better than war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of the elderly and the sick do not live in residential units and need care. Who is to decide what is an emergency case? Much of workload will land on the family doctor dealing with people who are in need of care who may not now be able to avail of nursing care in the community. If, in the view of the family doctor, that person <Col N="656" /> becomes an emergency case, is that sufficient for him or her to receive treatment in hospital? We are getting very close to zero hour, and there are so many questions unanswered&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The general practitioner will assess the situation for patients in the community and that will be referred to in the assessment procedures in the hospital. The normal procedures in that respect will apply.</P>
      <P>In relation to the Labour Court, it is true that we have a voluntary code of practice in industrial relations. We also have what is known as a best code of practice. I have stated time out of number that it was the Nursing Alliance who, at the time of the publication of the Commission on Nursing report, sought due process. Now I am being told by some in the Nursing Alliance that I keep quoting the Labour Court recommendation. The first people to suggest that the Labour Court could resolve this matter were the Nursing Alliance in relation to three pay related issues. I am simply saying that, on the basis of what were termed residual issues being dealt with in the Labour Court, on the basis of the Labour Court having dealt with this in as comprehensive a way as it has dealt with any other issue before it in industrial relations over the past four years, on the basis of the Chairman of the Labour Court confirming that this was the culmination of the process, and on the basis of the Industrial Relations Act, 1990, which refers to the Labour Court as a court of last resort in practice, the fact that we have a voluntary code of conduct does not mean that we walk away from the principles of social partnership that that represents.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the only way this problem can be resolved is by talking? Will he stop giving this House lectures in industrial relations and indicate whether he will now open up a dialogue with the nursing unions? Is the Minister not aware that he does this before the strike occurs or he will inevitably have to do it afterward when great damage will have been done? Will he consider now opening up a dialogue so that procedures and frameworks can be found to avoid what will be a most damaging and life-threatening dispute?</P>

      <P>In relation to the &ldquo;sooner or later&rdquo; argument which can have populist attraction without examination, sooner or later a recommitment to the principles of social partnership will have to be accepted by everybody. In the Government's view, those principles involve an ability to come up with a strategy which can keep the public isolated from this issue. The Government is putting forward a strategy which allows the Nursing Alliance to avoid involving the public in what is a pay and non-pay issue between the nursing unions and nursing management. That is precisely why we are continuing to ask people to give proper consideration, in a way in which perhaps the recommendation did not receive it, to the scope that is available in the strategy which the Taoiseach has outlined. It is a genuine and proper proposal which upholds the views and positions of everybody while allowing this matter to proceed in a non-confrontational way.</P>

        <b>:</b> Does the Minister agree that in the course of their everyday care in the hospitals and other parts of the health service, nurses are most in touch on a continuous basis with patients, that they already make many crucial and life and death decisions about the medical conditions of patients and advise doctors and consultants accordingly? Given this, will he instruct the health services employers to agree to the position being adopted by the nursing unions' representative as to the role nurses will have in determining emergencies? Given that the public understands the role played by nurses, does he accept they have massive public support, that the public will not tolerate a prolonged strike because of its drastic effects and that, in view of this, he will have to accede to the legitimate demands of the nurses? Given this, why does he not settle the dispute now rather than let a strike take place? The Minister has not answered the question as to why he agrees there should be inequality between nurses with third level degrees and other professions with third level degrees in the health service who have vastly different remuneration levels.</P>

      <P>With regard to the points raised by Deputy Joe Higgins, there are relativities involved in the present pay determination system which people in the present environment regard as providing a barrier to addressing issues in the long-term which will improve remuneration for increased responsibility and performance. That is the issue the Taoiseach raised with the social partners as long ago as June 1998 and upon which much work has been done. It is because we are in the era of social partnership that those issues can be addressed constructively with the view perhaps that they may form part of the basis of the discussions that will take place in relation to a post-Partnership 2000 agreement. That will be the means by which those traditional and historical difficulties can be resolved.</P>

Why is the Government adopting such a hard line position on the nurses dispute when there is an option to open discussions with the unions? Is the Department still of the view that <Col N="662" /> this strike, if it happens, may last three weeks? How does the Minister envisage the ensuing scenario? How many deaths will occur? How many people will suffer? How can he square that with the core commitment made by the Government to tackle the waiting lists?</P>

We have different points of view as to how to guarantee or give assurances on that, but that is the current position. In view of this, to refer to questions in that manner does not do a service to the representatives of the nursing unions who seek to ensure that they deal properly with this issue and in accordance with the ethics of their profession.</P>

It is a truism to say that the strike will have an adverse effect on the health services. No one seeks or wants this strike. There is no question of treating any sector differently from another sector. It is a question of abiding by the procedures, honouring the commitments and moving forward in a non-confrontational way, which is available to those who are seeking to go on strike. That is the Government's clear position. I believe it is a tenable and proper position, one which takes into the account the wider implications of this issue. There are wider implications, depending on how the matter is resolved. This is very clear and Opposition Deputies and parties committed to the social partnership model are skirting around that central problem because it does not suit them to face up to it. The Government did face up to this problem and I am doing the consistent thing as people&mdash;</P>

      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy McGinley.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an urgent need for the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development to provide the necessary funds to compensate pig farmers in the Border counties for the financial losses arising from the fire disaster at the Lovell and Christmas Plant in Ballymoney on 20 June 1998 so that these farm families can avoid bankruptcy. The IFA carried out a survey of 94 farmers in Donegal, Cavan, Monaghan and Leitrim which shows clearly that the group along the <Col N="666" /> Border received an average of 11.22 pence per kilo less than their counterparts not affected by the fire.</P>
    <P>McCarron's factory in Cavan and Graham's factory in Monaghan were closed and as a result many farmers could not have their pigs killed; they had to hold them to over weight and accept as low as 30 pence per kilo for them. In the first quarter of 1999, the difference was 8.29 pence. The Minister states that no funds are available in his Department. He also states that the EU Commission could view compensation as a form of State aid. The UK Government gave aid to the Northern Ireland pig industry and received approval from the Commission because the region was affected in extraordinary circumstances, no different from an earthquake. It was a regional disaster affecting the northern counties and the Border counties. The UK found a means to fund the region of their country &ndash; Northern Ireland. This Government must act responsibly and provide the £4.78 million requested. At a time of unprecedented tax returns, the sale of Telecom Éireann and other proposed assets, this is not an impossible sum to contribute to save family farms from bankruptcy.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed and extremely surprised that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Mr. Walsh, or either of his two colleagues are not present in the House this evening. The Minister was asked to meet cross-party Oireachtas Members from Border counties. That meeting was requested by Deputy John Ellis, Chairman of the Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine. He was also asked for a meeting by the Monaghan-Cavan-Donegal county councils but refused. His answer, through his Private Secretary, is very negative. It states that pig prices have increased by 22 per cent since the beginning of this year and indicates that further increases are envisaged. Is the Minister and his Department in touch with the reality of the situation? Pig prices are falling, young farmers are being forced out. However, the meeting was not requested in relation to present prices; it was requested in order to seek compensation for the direct loss to the region for the period the factories were closed following the fire disaster.</P>
    <P>Only farmers producing full accounts that can be inspected by the Department can and should be paid. The problem remains that banks and others have carried these farm families without any help from Government, not even sympathy. Tall stories regarding the commitment of factories and so on have been spun. When Graham's factory in Monaghan closed under strange circumstances and McCarron's factory in Cavan closed as a result of a strike, farmers had to find other markets. It is not true that they were going from factory to factory looking for higher prices and that they were receiving higher prices than their counterparts in the south of the country earlier in the year. The statistics drawn up by the IFA are for the full year 1998, not just for the period in question. They show clearly that there <Col N="667" /> is a difference of 11.22 pence for that period. I suggest that if this sort of crisis happened in Cork or Tipperary there certainly would be a Minister in this House this evening representing the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. I do not doubt the commitment of the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, in this matter, and I hope he will be able to have it raised at Cabinet, but we would have immediate action&mdash;</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Crawford for sharing time with me and I support the case he has put so eloquently. It is almost 18 months since this crisis for pig farmers in Border areas, particularly in Counties Donegal, Cavan, Monaghan and Leitrim commenced and it is very sad. I am very disappointed that progress has not been made in addressing the difficulties. There are 93 or 94 farmers involved and if this continues much longer there will be far fewer. In County Donegal 23 farmers are affected and they are put to the pin of their collar. A precedent has been set in Northern Ireland, a region within the UK, for farmers who have been compensated. The Border counties are a region in this country and I cannot see why the precedent established in Northern Ireland cannot continue here through compensation for the farmers concerned. If this is not done most of these will get out of pig farming and the investments they have made in recent years when times were good will be lost. This would be a major blow to the economy of these families and the regions in which they live.</P>

      <P>Pig farmers in the EU as a whole have been experiencing difficulties over the past year or so. The difficulties have arisen as a result of various factors, the chief one being over production. Consumption of pigmeat in the EU has not increased at the same pace as production, and this has added to the difficult situation. Traditional markets in Asia and Russia were also very sluggish and greatly under performed. The normal market cycle in the pig sector throughout the EU was further exacerbated by a surge in output following a classical swine fever outbreak.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Ireland the pigmeat sector was hit with the added problem of a fire at a pigmeat plant in Northern Ireland which had been slaughtering about 5,000 pigs per week from producers mainly based in the Border regions. The Minister was acutely aware at the time of the difficulties being experienced by these producers and he took action to assist them in disposing of the backlog <Col N="668" /> of pigs which had temporarily built up. The Deputy will recall that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development arranged for extra shifts to be worked at some EU export approved plants as well as giving EU export approval to an additional two plants in Counties Meath and Westmeath. This ensured that the backlog was dealt with quickly.</P>
    <P>On the broader front, the Minister along with his colleagues in the Council of Agriculture Ministers pressed the EU Commission to take action to help the difficult pigmeat market. The Commission responded by giving generous increases in export refunds on a number of occasions in 1998 and also this year. These increases ranged from 33 per cent to 80 per cent. In addition an aids to private storage scheme was introduced. This scheme removed more than 420,000 tonnes of pigmeat from the EU market which was placed in storage. Also, a food aid programme for Russia, which included 100,000 tonnes of pigmeat, was also put into operation. To date, about 50,000 tonnes of pigmeat have been sent to Russia.</P>
    <P>As a result of all this action, pig prices have increased substantially since the beginning of the year. Up to the week ending 9 October 1999 pig prices had increased by about 22 per cent. The EU Commission has indicated that pig supplies in the last quarter of 1999 are expected to decrease, and that would indicate that the market should improve further. Indications are that the Japanese and Russian markets are recovering and are now accepting large quantities of imported EU pigmeat.</P>
    <P>The option of direct financial assistance to pig farmers is one which is not open to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Under EU rules, direct aid is classed as a State aid and as such is precluded. While the Deputy may be aware that an aid scheme for pig producers in Northern Ireland was allowed, Commission decision 1999/591/EC of 9 June 1999, which contains the details of the scheme, clearly shows that it was the exceptional circumstances of the case which allowed the aid to be paid. It was limited to payment for the disposal of 15,571 overweight pigs which were slaughtered, removed from the food chain and sent for rendering. The prices paid to Northern producers for their overweight animals &ndash; 110kgs live weight and above &ndash; was set at a maximum of £30 sterling per pig which is equivalent to about IR£36. It is understood that average prices in our Border counties during this time were considerably higher.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister met the banks and the pig feed suppliers to discuss the difficulties being experienced. Both organisations expressed their willingness to continue to assist pig producers in any way possible for the duration of the difficulties in the sector. An Bord Bia plans to launch a pigmeat promotion programme next week to encourage <Col N="669" /> sales on the home market. The programme is scheduled to last one month and will no doubt play its part in increasing the level of pigmeat consumption.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the action taken so far to help the pigmeat market has had some success. Clearly, there is further ground to be made up in terms of prices being paid to producers. The Minister will continue to press the EU Commission to keep the market under review and to ensure action is taken to the maximum extent possible in order to restore balance and give reasonable returns to all involved in the pigmeat sector.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell" hpid="Ms O. Mitchell Ms O. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>This issue is of vital importance to the country's infrastructure. I raise it in the context of the recent successful objection to the south-eastern motorway and the leave granted to appeal to the Supreme Court for a judicial review of the Minister's order. I do not intend dealing with that case, but with its general application and the implication of this case being before the courts.</P>
      <P>The south-eastern motorway and the Dublin port tunnel are the outstanding links in the ringroad around the city and as such are of national importance as routes to other parts of the country. They are of particular importance to HGVs and port traffic around the country. They are also of vital importance for traffic management for Dublin city which is rapidly becoming an unviable place to do business and which is increasingly becoming a nightmare to live in. The absence of a completed ringroad makes it impossible to remove the extraneous heavy traffic from residential and business areas and precludes the implementation of effective city-wide traffic management measures and the provision of efficient public transport in the city. In south County Dublin, it condemns the entire area to continued traffic mayhem and to escalated mayhem as traffic increases as the southern cross motorway comes to an abrupt halt in Ballinteer.</P>
      <P>In addition, there are dozens of private and public investment decisions which are contingent on the south-eastern motorway being in place and which will now certainly have to be postponed and in some cases will be lost altogether. Of particular interest to the Minister in this context will be the entire Dún Laoghaire housing programme, both public and private, and the waste management strategy which is part of the Dublin-wide strategy. Neither of these projects can go ahead in the absence of the motorway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is only one motorway and one project of many which is being held up, interminably in some cases, as a result of court action by individuals or groups of individuals. They are being held up having been through the entire planning process which, and I am sure the Minister is aware of this, is time consuming and tortuous. Within the planning process for major infrastructural <Col N="670" /> projects there are numerous safeguards and ample opportunity for those affected to make their case. In my experience every effort is made to accommodation people's needs. The process begins with the democratic decision that such projects are required and justifiable in the public interest. There are public consultation stages, both before and after full detailed designs have been drawn up. A full EIS is prepared in each case and a public inquiry heard to which an inspector gives lengthy consideration before making his recommendation to the Minister. Despite all of this we have case after case of works of national significance, which are clearly in the public interest, languishing for years in our courts or in the European courts.</P>
    <P>As we embark on a new national development plan, at a time when we have clearly established the urgent need to tackle our national infrastructural deficit and intend to commit unprecedented billions to do so, we simply cannot ignore the need to introduce legislation which will make that possible. Without new legislation the national development plan will remain merely aspirational and our infrastructure, particularly our national roads, will remain that of a Third World country trying to cope with the transport needs of a fast growing economy. The biggest barrier to growth is our inadequate infrastructure. Unless we tackle the problems of planning delays we will simply not be able to sustain those growth rates at a rate anything like the rates for which we have the potential.</P>
    <P>The new planning Bill presents an opportunity to deal once and for all with these problems. I welcome the provision of the Bill which transfers confirmation of what was previously a ministerial order to An Bord Pleanála. By placing such consideration in the hands of an independent body it removes the likelihood of at least one source of challenge on the grounds of conflict of interest but the legislation must go much further and limit the range of grounds on which such a court challenge can be brought. The list of grounds on which a challenge can be sought must be clearly indicated so that the promoting authority can establish clearly that it has taken all such issues into account at planning stage and An Bord Pleanála can show that it has also done so in making its order of confirmation. The grounds on which a judicial review can be sought are so open-ended that almost any reason can be given and accepted by the courts.</P>
    <P>There is a need to amend the Roads (Amendment) Act, 1998, which was intended to limit the period within which an objector could lodge an appeal. There is a fatal flaw in the legislation in that it gives discretion to the courts. It was precisely the use of this discretion which successfully landed the south-eastern motorway before the Supreme Court. The Minister may say that it is too late to extricate this case from the <Col N="671" /> courts but we must at least learn lessons from this debacle and ensure it is the national interest which prevails in such cases.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue. The Government shares her concerns that serious delay can be caused in the case of major infrastructure and other development projects by applications by third parties to the courts for judicial review after all the planning procedures have been gone through. This issue has been given considerable attention in the context of the recently published Planning and Development Bill, 1999, which will introduce some further constraints on the taking of judicial review but not along the lines suggested by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The Constitution places considerable limitations on the use of legislation to restrict a citizen's right of access to the courts against the actions of public authorities. The Deputy suggests that legislation could allow a project to proceed on the basis that disputes regarding a decision on major infrastructure could be treated as a matter of compensation. The reality is however that many such disputes do not lend themselves to a monetary remedy. Property rights, environmental issues and environmental law play a major part in many judicial review proceedings and these matters cannot be left to be decided as a matter of compensation only. It is difficult to envisage therefore the introduction of a law along the lines suggested by the Deputy which would not infringe the Constitution or other binding international environmental instruments.</P>
      <P>Under present planning law judicial review of a planning or An Bord Pleanála decision may only be allowed where an application for leave for judicial review is sought within two months of the decision and only where the High Court is satisfied that there are substantial grounds for contending that the decision is invalid or ought to be quashed. A similar provision was introduced in respect of major road schemes by the Roads (Amendment) Act, 1998. Section 48 of the Planning and Development Bill currently before the Seanad extends these judicial review limitations to cover all local authority and An Bord Pleanála decisions in relation to development under the Bill, not just in relation to planning applications. This will cover decisions on compulsory purchase orders and decisions on local authority development &ndash; under Part 10 of the planning regulations &ndash; as well as local authority development which requires environmental impact assessment. The Bill further provides that applicants for judicial review will also have to show a substantive interest in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These provisions should go some way towards cutting down the number of judicial review cases taken against major public projects. The Government is not however prepared to rest there. Con<Col N="672" /> sideration is being given to means of speeding up the judicial review process where judicial reviews are allowed. These could include the possibility of setting up a special division of the High Court so that judicial reviews in relation to planning matters and the provision of public infrastructure could be dealt with more expeditiously. Improved administrative procedures within the courts system could also help. An interdepartmental group has been established to examine as a matter of urgency these and other aspects of speeding up infrastructure projects.</P>
    <P>On a wider front the planning Bill contains a number of fundamental reforms designed to streamline procedures and generally speed up the provision of public infrastructure. Time does not permit me to go into these but I refer the Deputy to the second reading speech on the Bill by the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, in the Seanad today.</P>

      <P>Bunaíodh an comhlacht seo ar eastát tionscail Ghaoth Dobhair i 1974, 25 bliain ó shoin, agus i rith an ama sin chuir sé fostaíocht den scoth ar fáil do na hoibrithe a bhí fostaithe ansin, an chuid is mó acu fir. Nuair a tháinig an fógra, tá cupla seachtain ó shoin, go bhfuil an comhlacht chun an mhonarca a dhúnadh agus 87 duine atá ag obair ansin a ligint chun bealaigh is cinnte gur buile mór é, ní hamháin do na daoine a bhí ag obair ansin ach don cheantar Gaeltachta sin ar fad agus go speisialta, don eastát tionscail féin.</P>
      <P>Fir ar fad atá ag obair sa chomhlacht, taobh amuigh de thriúr ban. Tá sin tábhachtach mar go bhfuil sé chomh deacair sin, i láthair na huaire, tionscail a fháil ins na Gaeltachtaí le hobair a chur ar fáil d'fhir. De ghnáth tá sé níos fusa tionscail éadaí agus mar sin de a fháil le mná a choinneáil ag obair. Mar sin, is buile mór é. Tá cuid de na daoine seo ag obair sa mhonarcha le 25 bliain agus go leor acu gur cinn teaghlaigh iad agus freagrachtaí airgid acu, agus cuirfidh an dúnadh seo astu go mór.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá sé cúpla seachtain ó fógraíodh seo agus ag an phointe seo, ní shílim go bhfuil aon dul siar ar an chinneadh atá déanta. Tá an tionscail seo faoi smacht comhlacht Rettig atá lonnaithe san Fhionnlainn. Tá an socrú déanta acu agus ní shílim gur féidir dul siar air. Bhí comhráití ar siúil le cupla seachtain anuas le téarmaí iomarcaíochta agus mar sin a phlé agus a shocrú agus, chomh fada agus is eol dom, tá sin déanta. Is é an fáth go bhfuil mise ag tógáil na ceiste anseo &ndash; agus tá lucháir go bhfuil an tAire Stáit i láthair &ndash; chun a rá leis an Aire Stáit go bhfuil sé iontach tábhachtach go ndéanfadh sé féin, a Roinn agus go mórmhór Údarás na Gaeltachta gach dícheall chun tionscail eile a fháil isteach le fostaíocht a chur ar fáil dóibh siúd a chaill a gcuid postanna i Dianorm. Ní hamháin gur cailleadh postanna i <Col N="673" /> Dianorm le bliain anuas ach cailleadh postanna eile ar an eastát i nGaoth Dobhair chomh maith. Mar shampla, ligeadh oibrithe i BMR &ndash; cuid acu páirt-aimseartha &ndash; chun siúil agus cailleadh postanna i Qualtron chomh maith. Tá deacrachtaí ag an eastát sin i láthair na huaire agus caithfidh an t-údarás, le tacaíocht an Aire, aire ar leith a thabhairt don eastát agus na postanna atá ansin a chaomhnú agus cur leo más féidir.</P>
    <P>The announcement by Dianorm in the industrial estate that it was closing down operations from 26 October with the loss of 87 jobs came as a bombshell to the Gaeltacht area of west Donegal. Since its establishment in 1974 Dianorm and its predecessor, Diatherm, was one of the flagship industries on the estate. Its product was radiators for central heating. It was looked upon and accepted as a heavy duty and substantial industry. Its workforce is predominantly male &ndash; 83 out of a total of 87, in fact. The closure of this industry is a severe body blow, not alone to this Gaeltacht industrial estate but also to west Donegal. At this stage the decision to close seems to be irreversible.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State and Údarás na Gaeltachta should do everything possible to find a replacement industry. Many of the workers who are being made redundant are the sole breadwinners for their families. Many have financial commitments and responsibilities for mortgages and other necessary borrowings. Alternative employment is urgently required and I am asking the Minister of State to give this matter top priority immediately and without delay.</P>
    <P>Níl fágtha ag na hoibrithe ach cúpla seachtain eile. Beidh siad ag dul chun bóthair agus tá súil agam go ndéanfar gach dícheall fostaíocht buan a chur ar fáil dóibh chomh luath agus is féidir.</P>

      <P>Ar 3 Meán Fómhair 1999 d'fhógair bainistíocht an ghrúpa Rettigh Heating, úinéirí Ollannacha an chomhlachta Dianorm Teo, Eastát Tionscail Ghaoth Dobhair, Co. Dún na nGall, go raibh cinneadh déanta acu chun Dianorm Teo. a dhúnadh. Caillfear 87 bpost dá bharr. Is de bharr titim mhór i margadh na hEorpa ó 1995 i leith agus titim i bpraghasanna díolacháin ba chúis leis an dúnadh dar leo. Tuigim go raibh an tionscal faoi bhrú le roinnt blianta anuas.</P>
      <P>Ag an am céanna bhí togra tarrthála, ar chostas mhór, á scrúdú ag mo Roinnse ach d'ainneoin an chúnaimh a bhí á mholadh chinn Rettig Heating an chomhlacht a dhúnadh.</P>

      <Col N="674" /> Thug Rettig Heating aitheantas don chomhoibriú a bhí ar fáil ón Údarás ina n-iarrachtaí agus ar ndóigh inchur na fóirne sa chomhlacht féin. Bhí sé i gceist ag Rettig Heating an t-am sin go stopfadh an táirgeacht ar 26 Samhain 1999. Ó shin i leith tharla na nithe seo a leanas: Tar éis idirbheartaíochta tháinig an comhlacht ar shocrú leis an bhfoireann maidir le pá iomarcaíochta; tuigim ón Údarás freisin go bhfuil i gceist anois an táirgeacht a stopadh thart ar dheireadh na míosa seo; tuigim go bhfuil malairt fhostaíochta aimsithe cheana féin ag cuid d'fhoireann an chomhlachta, agus tá an túdarás ag cuidiú le malairt fhostaíochta a aimsiú don chuid eile; tá tionscal ionaid á lorg ag an údarás agus tá cúpla fiosrúchán á scrúdú, cé go bhfuil sé róluath a rá fós cén toradh a bheidh orthu seo.</P>
    <P>Tríd is tríd, mar sin, cé gur cúis mhór díomá dom, mar Aire Stáit, gur chinn an grúpa an comhlacht seo a dhúnadh, tá céimeanna dearfacha idir lámha agus tá toradh ag teacht ar chuid acu cheana féin. Ainneoin an cháis seo agus cúpla ceann eile ina raibh laghdú fostaíochta le déanaí, tá staid na fostaíochta ar eastát tionscail Ghaoth Dobhair an-sláintiúil faoi láthair. Meastar go mbeidh níos mó fostaithe ansin, fiú tar éis dúnadh Dianorm, ná mar a bhí aon bhliain roimhe seo &ndash; os cionn 1,150.</P>
    <P>Níl aon bhaint agam-sa, ó lá go lá, le cruthú fostaíochta. Sin job an údaráis. Ach tháinig méadú mór ar airgead an údaráis &ndash; atá curtha ar fáil ag mo Roinn-se &ndash; le cupla bliain anuas d'fhonn cuidiú leis an údarás a chuid oibre a dhéanamh ar son muintir na Gaeltachta. Tá mé cinnte, ainneoin na ndeacrachtaí, go n-éireoidh leis an údarás fostaíocht malairteach a chur ar fáil chomh luath agus is féidir agus leanacht den dea-obair atá ar bun acu ar son phoball na Gaeltachta.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>On previous occasions I have highlighted the urgent necessity of building a new gaelscoil in Newcastlewest. In 1995 we were all delighted when the then Minister for Education, Niamh Bhreathnach, approved this project under the capital spending programme. In the succeeding years the school has lost its priority status because of a lack of commitment and support from the Department. The gaelscoil purchased a 2.5-acre site and the Department should compensate the school forthwith.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The gaelscoil also received permission for the water and sewerage connection which would cost over £21,000. My understanding is that in the past this water and sewerage connection was probably an impediment to the progress of the project. Now, however, I would say the impediment is gone and the Department can act accordingly. The Department should provide finance for this project as a priority. The present gaelscoil operates out of a collection of pre-fabricated buildings <Col N="675" /> at a local community centre. An Bord Pleanála has already threatened the gaelscoil with eviction from some of the pre-fabricated buildings it currently occupies.</P>
    <P>The gaelscoil's parents and pupils have suffered enough in unsuitable accommodation. It is worth bearing in mind that the school itself has progressed and now has an enrolment of 216 pupils. It has developed a naíonra for pupils prior to attending primary school and also has a gael coláiste. Given the sincerity and commitment of the teachers in the school, and the appreciation of pupils and parents at local level, it is high time that the Department of Education and Science seriously set about getting a momentum going with regard to this project. That momentum has been lost over recent years. As we face the new year, and departmental Estimates are being prepared, I hope the Government will make sure that Gaelscoil Ó Doghair in Caisleán Nua Thiar, will be top of the Department's priority list. I hope the Minister of State's reply will be positive.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Education and Science is aware that the school has a current staffing level of a principal, eight assistant teachers and a remedial teacher. The school's enrolment at 30 September 1999 was 217. The school is at present based in temporary accommodation in the local community centre and the Department of Education and Science is grant-aiding the rental costs <Col N="676" /> to the tune of 95 per cent. The present accommodation is unsatisfactory and it is for this reason that the Department approved the commencement of architectural planning for the provision of a new school for Gaelscoil Ó Doghair.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that the original proposals failed due to the fact that site services could not be provided. The school subsequently presented a revised proposal to the Department. Local developers have since confirmed their agreement to allow water and sewerage connection to their facilities, and this offer is currently being considered. The Department wrote to the school management on 28 September last seeking clarification on certain matters pertaining to the site proposed for the school. A response to this letter is awaited. Meanwhile, following a request from the chairperson of the board of management, the Department advised that it is in order for the board to engage a consultant architect to prepare a drawing outlining a proposal for connection to the water and sewerage system. The Department awaits further communication from the board in regard to this matter. I wish to assure the Deputy that the Department, in conjunction with the board of management, will progress the overall building project as quickly as possible. The Department is fully committed to the provision of improved facilities for Gaelscoil Ó Doghair. I thank the Deputy again for giving me the opportunity of outlining the current position to the House on behalf of the Minister for Education and Science.</P>

      <P>The dates on which the results of the certificate examinations are issued are a function of the timing of the actual examinations and the time required for the marking of scripts and processing of the results.</P>
      <P>While my Department will continue to make every effort to issue results as early as possible it must be recognised that there are real constraints on making any significant improvement in respect of the junior certificate if the issue date in the case of the leaving certificate is not to be affected. Given that there is a finite pool of suitably qualified examiners my Department ensures that the number of examiners engaged in the leaving certificate marking process is adequate to enable the result deadlines to be met. This is possible because the later issue of junior certificate results provides some latitude in relation to providing additional time where necessary to the pool of examiners available for junior certificate marking. Ultimately, the time required for the proper execution of the marking process is a direct function of the number of available examiners and the number of scripts to be examined.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy will agree that priority must be given to the issue of the leaving certificate results so as to ensure that the CAO college entry process executes in a timely manner.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that I have recently issued a discussion paper in relation to assessment at junior cycle. As matters stand the junior certificate examination is very much a mirror image of the leaving certificate despite the fact that both examinations serve very different purposes. Undoubtedly, the issue of timing of results is one that should be looked at in the context of any future changes.</P>

Successful applicants would be required to nominate a patron and appoint a board of management in accordance with standard procedure.</P>
      <P>All applications for the recognition of new primary schools, including denominational, multi-denominational and all-Irish schools, are considered on the same basis. Usually, provisional recognition is granted initially. However, permanent recognition may be granted at the outset where a prospective school can demonstrate that it is likely to have a large initial enrolment which is expected to grow further in subsequent years.</P>
      <P>When a school has been granted provisional recognition, it becomes eligible for payment of teachers' salaries, capitation grant, rental grant and a furniture grant.</P>
      <P>Generally, the question of granting permanent recognition is considered after a number of years of operation in the light of each school's development, having particular regard to pupil enrolment and adherence to the Rules for National Schools. At that stage, it is possible to determine whether a school has established its viability. Where that is the case, permanent recognition is granted and the school becomes eligible to apply for capital grant-aid.</P>
      <P>As a result of a major initiative, which I announced earlier this year, my Department is now in a position to provide the entire purchase cost of sites for schools and 95 per cent of the building cost. I also raised very significantly the rate of funding available to schools renting temporary accommodation.</P>
      <P>I should point out that I am examining the commission's report in detail at the present time and I expect to have completed my analysis in the near future.</P>

      <Quest>the number of children for whom psychological assessments will be provided during the coming school year at primary and secondary levels.</Quest>
      <QRef>[20021/99]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the numbers of children in schools for whom psychological assessments will be provided by psychol<Col N="679" /> ogists employed by the new National Educational Psychological Service Agency which formally commenced the provision of its service on 1 September 1999. Some psychological assessments are carried out by health board personnel or privately. Information on these latter assessments is not available to my Department.</P>
      <P>The number of students in schools for whom psychological assessments will be provided during the coming school year will be related to the varying needs arising in schools in areas served by the new NEPS agency and related to the availability of psychologists for the agency. More schools will be receiving an educational psychological service as additional psychologists are recruited by NEPS in 1999 and in the year 2000. It is not possible, therefore, to accurately predict, at this stage, the exact number of students for whom psychological assessments will be provided in 1999-2000.</P>
      <P>However the number of psychological assessments provided by my Department's psychologists during the past school year may provide an indication of the numbers of such assessments likely to be provided in 1999-2000. In primary schools, 2,111 students were interviewed by Department psychologists, of whom 1,714 had individual psychological assessments. In second level schools, 1,316 students were interviewed by psychologists of whom 802 had individual psychological assessments. During the school year 1998-99 there were 50 psychologists employed by my Department of whom 26 worked in primary schools and 18 in second-level schools. The other six psychologists were either assigned to supervising duties or were on special assignments for my Department.</P>
      <P>On its establishment NEPS employed 24 psychologists for work in primary schools and 18 psychologists for second level schools. The agency is currently recruiting 25 additional psychologists and it hopes to recruit a further 25 psychologists by the end of the current school year. Assuming that these numbers of psychologists are assigned to the primary and post-primary sectors in approximately the same ratio as at present, it may be expected that about 3,000 individual psychological assessments of students in schools will be carried out by the new service in 1999-2000, of which about 2,000 may be expected at primary level and about 1,000 at second level. This estimate takes account of the fact that the additional psychologists will join the new agency at various times during the school year and would not be available for school work during the full school year.</P>
      <P>It should be noted that individual psychological assessment of children is only one part of the psychologists' work. Supporting schools in preventing problems arising is also a most important part of the work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The management committee of NEPS, which includes officials from my Department and the Department of Health and Children, is addressing, as a matter of urgency, the needs of children <Col N="680" /> in schools not yet served by NEPS so that urgent cases can be attended to by NEPS psychologists and by the Department of Health and Children pending the expansion of the agency.</P>
    <P>Towards the end of the last school year, a number of psychologists were contracted to deal with a backlog of almost 200 cases primarily in relation to applications for special arrangements for the certificate examinations. Such an option would be considered in the future should the situation warrant it.</P>

      <P>Following the leaving certificate geography higher level examination on Monday 14 June, concerns were expressed by some candidates, teachers and parents that the compulsory Question No. 1 had been reduced from a three-part to a two-part question. There was also comment that, in the regional geography section, which contained four questions of which candidates had to answer one, the candidates were asked to divide a country into regions using one of five given countries as an example rather than allowing them to choose one country themselves from among the 14 countries stated in the syllabus.</P>
      <P>As is normal in the case of comments received about an examination paper, all concerns regarding this geography paper were referred to the chief examiner who considered them and discussed them with the advising examiners before the marking scheme was finalised.</P>
      <P>The chief examiner has reported that the marking process provided no evidence to suggest that the form of these questions adversely affected candidates' performance generally. The grades obtained by candidates in this year's examination are broadly similar to those of last year. It is also worth noting that the number of appeals in this subject in 1999 was similar to that in 1998.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied, therefore, that the format of this year's leaving certificate higher level geography paper did not adversely affect candidates' performance in the examination.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the recent decision of a parish priest to cut the Catholic Church's contribution to local primary schools.</P>
      <P>The State is obliged under the Constitution to provide for free primary education and to ensure that such education is available to children. This is achieved through the partnership between the State and local community, which is expressed in the State grant combined with the local contribution.</P>
      <P>Traditionally, school authorities have been required to supplement the State's capitation grant with a local contribution equivalent to 25 per cent of the State grant. However, in 1995, this local contribution was frozen at £10 per pupil in the case of mainstream schools, and at £9.50 per pupil in the case of schools designated as disadvantaged.</P>
      <P>However, I was conscious that some schools still experienced difficulties in raising the local contribution. Accordingly, early in 1999, I decided that the required minimum contribution should be further reduced. As a result, the amount required from schools in disadvantaged areas is now £5.50 per pupil, while all other schools will be required to pay £8.50 per pupil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result of my initiatives in this area, the local contribution has fallen very significantly below the traditional 25 per cent of the State <Col N="682" /> grant. It is my intention to work towards further reductions in the local contribution on a phased basis over the next number of years.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that I have substantially increased the level of capitation funding to primary schools over the last two years. In 1998, I increased the standard rate of the primary capitation grant by £5, and I secured a further increase of £10 in 1999. This brings the standard capitation grant to £60 per pupil, which constitutes a 33 per cent increase in the rate of the grant since I assumed office.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that the Government will continue to give priority to the question of increased funding for primary education as set out in the programme for Government.</P>

      <P>The issue of the uptake of the physical science subjects at leaving certificate level has been a matter of concern to me for some time. The underlying causes of the declining uptake of the physical sciences at leaving certificate level are complex and Ireland is by no means unique in relation to this particular problem. In fact, it affects most countries in the developed world to a greater or lesser extent.</P>
      <P>Last March I announced a wideranging initiative to address the issue. The major elements of this initiative are: the introduction of revised syllabi in leaving certificate physics and leaving certificate chemistry in September 2000 along with teachers' guidelines and reference handbooks; a review of the junior certificate science syllabus by the NCCA; a new physical science syllabus to replace the present combined physics and chemistry syllabus, is being prepared by the NCCA; the format of examination papers, specifically the structure and layout of question at junior certificate ordinary level and in leaving certificate physics and chemistry, is being revised; a comprehensive in-career development programme for teachers of physics and chemistry at both leaving certificate and junior certificate levels; increased provision for pre-service training for teachers of physics and chemistry; a significant refurbishment programme for school laboratories; and a special per capita grant of £10 for pupils taking leaving certificate physics and leaving certificate chemistry.</P>
      <P>I am confident that this initiative will make a significant contribution to addressing the decline in uptake in the physical sciences at leaving certificate level. I am satisfied at the level of participation in science at junior certificate and in biology at leaving certificate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that I am aware of the staffing difficulties to which he refers. I am currently in discussion with my colleague, the Minister for Finance, on this and other staffing issues currently arising in my Department. My objective is to ensure that all requests for special education services are responded to as speedily as possible and that the children in question receive the support to which they are entitled without undue delay.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that in November 1998, I announced a major new initiative in the special education area under which all children assessed as having special educational needs are now entitled to an automatic response to those needs. The response may take the form of full-time teaching or child care support, or both, depending on the number of children involved and their special needs. In the context of this new development, my Department has received a substantial number of applications from schools for resource teacher and/or special needs assistant support for pupils with special needs.</P>
      <P>To date, as a result of this development, my Department has received approximately 800 applications for special needs assistant support and 580 applications for resource teaching support.</P>
      <P>A total of 386 special needs assistant posts have been sanctioned since January 1999 to provide support for individual pupils attending mainstream and special schools. These special needs assistant posts are sanctioned on either a full or part-time basis depending on the special needs of the pupils in question.</P>
      <P>Over the same period, a total of 62 full-time resource posts have been sanctioned. A further 1,423 part-time resource teaching hours has been sanctioned for individual children or small groups of special needs children for whom a full-time post would not be warranted. This has resulted in an additional 200 schools having access to resource teaching services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While these developments represent a major advance in special needs provision, the Deputy will appreciate that there is a significant amount of &ldquo;catching up&rdquo; to be done in catering for the <Col N="684" /> many children for whom no support service was provided in the past.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that applications are being processed as speedily as possible within my Department's special education section, having regard to available resources and the need to ensure that each child's application receives appropriate expert attention.</P>
    <P>In order to cope with the demand which has arisen, the special education section of my Department has already been allocated eight additional temporary staff.</P>
    <P>The review which is currently being undertaken by my Department will identify the extent, if any, to which further resources are required and any necessary measures will be put in place to ensure an effective and efficient level of service delivery in this most important area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 21 and 45 together.</P>
      <P>While I have not met the USI in relation to its pre-budget submission, I have recently received a copy of its submission and I would like to say at the outset, that I agree wholeheartedly with the basic premise of the USI that investment in education has led to our current prosperity and that education is the key to maintaining that prosperity.</P>
      <P>In 1999, this Government will invest over £2.8 billion on education, of which some £680 million is in respect of third level education, when capital and current investment is taken into account. Furthermore, this Government has made unprecedented investment in third level education by way of the public/private partnership fund for advanced research and the Education Technology Investment Fund which will develop technology education at all levels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Specifically at third level, this Government has funded a major increase in the number of places in public colleges and that, as I have said previously, continues to be the priority. Third level enrolments this year will be in the region of 112,000 students as compared with an enrolment of under 61,000 a decade ago. Earlier this year I announced a major £75 million investment plan <Col N="685" /> targeted at skills areas, where there is a high level of employment growth. This investment will provide an additional 5,400 places, predominantly in the engineering and computer hardware and software areas. The Government is determined that Ireland will maintain its place at the forefront of technological developments worldwide, and investment in education is the key to this. This £75 million investment plan is just the latest in a range of unprecedented investment programmes at all levels of the education system. The largest building programme in the history of Irish education is currently under way and at third level this is transforming campuses throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I share the concerns of the USI in relation to the need to target disadvantaged students and students with disabilities and the Deputies will be aware of the specific funding initiatives I have announced in this regard. In particular, I have honoured the commitment in the programme for Government, An Action Programme for the Millennium, to the introduction of equitable support for students attending post leaving certificate courses. A maintenance grants scheme for students attending PLC courses was introduced with effect from the 1998-99 academic year. The grants are means tested and the rates of grant, income limits and other eligibility criteria are similar to those, which apply to the third level student support schemes generally.</P>
    <P>I have also addressed the position of mature students in general and independent mature students in particular, under the student support schemes. The rate of maintenance grant payable is determined by reference to the distance from the student's normal residence to the college which she or he is attending. In the case of independent mature students, their normal residence is taken as their address while in attendance at college. Accordingly, a large proportion of independent mature students only qualified for the lower adjacent rate of grant. With effect from the current academic year, all eligible mature students will qualify for the higher non-adjacent rate of maintenance grant at an estimated cost of £2.4 million over the next two years.</P>
    <P>On the specific question of disadvantaged access, the third level colleges have developed initiatives to tackle the problem of access for the disadvantaged to third level education, through targeted funding provided to the universities by the Higher Education Authority and funding from within the overall financial allocations to the institutes of technology. These initiatives involve links with second level schools and local communities. I have announced a specific allocation of £3 million over two years to promote access to third level amongst students from disadvantaged backgrounds, including people with disabilities. My Department has had discussions with the access officers of the colleges, the Union of Students in Ireland, the Higher Education Authority and other interested bodies in relation to this funding and I hope to be in a position to <Col N="686" /> finalise the arrangements for the funding in the near future. I have also provided a further £1.5 million over two years to address the issue of non-completion of courses and my Department is engaged in discussions with institutes of technology with regard to the measures for which this funding will be used.</P>
    <P>On the issue of student accommodation, the Government has already introduced special tax incentives to encourage the provision of student rented residential accommodation in this year's Finance Act.</P>
    <P>The question of future investment in education generally and third level education specifically is being considered and I am sure the Deputy will agree that this must be done in the context of competing priorities within all levels of education.</P>

      <P>The total number of teaching days at primary level undertaken by untrained substitute teachers in the first three months of 1998 was 28,376. In the corresponding period in 1999 a total of 28,563 teaching days were taught by untrained substitute teachers.</P>
      <P>The information in relation to the number of untrained teachers employed in second level schools is not available. However, it is my Department's policy that, as far as possible, second level teachers should teach the subjects in which they are qualified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since coming into office, I have been concerned that there are untrained personnel work<Col N="687" /> ing within the primary school system. I would take this opportunity to remind the Deputy that I have introduced a range of measures to boost substantially the supply of trained primary teachers. The intake of trainee primary teachers to the colleges of education in the 1998-99 session was 1,028 and the projected intake in the 1999-2000 academic year is 1,000.</P>
    <P>Between the 1999 and 2000 academic years a total of 1,380 newly trained teachers are due to graduate from the colleges of education. This includes 180 persons who will graduate prior to the end of the current school year. This represents a huge increase in the number of trained graduates as compared with 1995 when 291 graduated.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that I have approved a number of other initiatives to reduce the number of untrained personnel. B.Ed. graduates of St. Mary's College, Belfast who have studied Irish to honours level as an academic subject as part of their teaching qualification are now recognised as fully qualified. Since September 1998, all primary degree holders who hold the Higher Diploma in Education are paid as fully trained substitute teachers. Montessori trained teachers who successfully completed the course of three years duration at St. Nicholas, Dún Laoghaire, and the AMI which is recognised by the National Council for Educational Awards are also recognised as being fully qualified substitute teachers.</P>
    <P>My decision to recognise fully qualified teachers who trained outside the State to teach in certain categories of schools and classes without the necessity to hold an Irish language qualification is also contributing to an improvement in the supply of trained primary teachers.</P>
    <P>I am confident that these measures will reduce substantially the number of untrained teachers.</P>

      <P>My officials have been engaged, with officials of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, in a detailed review of the administration of the student support schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Initially, a joint working group representative of both Departments carried out an examination of options for the future administration of the schemes and produced a preliminary report which was submitted to both Ministers. The first meeting of this working group took place on 15 September 1997. Apart from four formal meetings, there was a considerable degree of contact <Col N="688" /> between members of the group prior to the finalisation of the preliminary report.</P>
    <P>Following an assessment of the preliminary report by both Departments, a range of issues was identified which required further detailed examination. Accordingly, officials from both Departments have been consulting on the resource and administration implications involved. There have been two formal meetings in this context, the most recent of which took place on 24 June 1999. The parameters of the detailed examination to be undertaken and the associated staffing involvement are being finalised between the two Departments.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that there are major implications, for example, for the local authorities and vocational education committees, in any proposals to change the administration of the schemes. It is my intention, therefore, that there will be full consultation with all interested parties and I have previously indicated that no irrevocable decisions will be taken in relation to any future arrangements prior to such consultation taking place.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the report referred to by the Deputy. The report is a valuable contribution towards raising awareness of bullying in schools and its findings were discussed in detail at a recent TUI seminar on bullying funded by my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Teachers are entitled to work in an environment which is free from any activity or behaviour that adversely affects their dignity. Under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, schools have an obligation as employers to ensure the safety, health and welfare of employees at work in so far as is reasonably practicable. Under the legislation, employers are required to identify the hazards; assess the risks to health and safety; and put appropriate safeguards in place. Bullying should be considered as a potential hazard and assessed accordingly and appropriate preventative measures taken. Teachers should be made aware of these measures and the support systems in place for those who experience difficulty. My Department has circularised schools regarding their obligations under the health and safety legislation. Schools are also advised to review the effectiveness of their bullying and health and safety policies on a regular basis in consultation with school <Col N="689" /> staff in order to ensure that weaknesses are identified and addressed.</P>
    <P>The national educational psychological service is available as a support service to schools where difficulties occur. In addition, my Department has established the employee assistance scheme for teachers on a pilot basis. Employee assistance officers provide a confidential support and advice service to teachers in situations where they encounter difficulties such as bullying in their workplace. My Department has also agreed to fund a TUI initiative in the training of trainers in the area of bullying.</P>
    <P>The adequacy and effectiveness of the measures in place to assist schools in dealing with incidents of bullying behaviour is kept under ongoing review by my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Schools in the drug task force areas would, for the most part, be eligible for disadvantaged area scheme status.</P>
      <P>Primary schools included in that scheme receive the following supports: supplementary capitation funding of £30 per pupil; 95 per cent building grant with a &ldquo;capped&rdquo; local contribution; television licence refund; maximum class size of 29 pupils involving a more favourable teacher/ pupil ratio than in other schools; preferential funding rates under the school books rental scheme.</P>
      <P>I should mention also the substance misuse education prevention programme for primary schools which was developed by my Department in co-operation with school managements, parents and teachers. The development of the programme, called &ldquo;Walk Tall&rdquo;, was completed by the end of 1998. The process of dissemination to primary schools generally, commenced early this year. The programme has been introduced in 725 primary schools at this stage. The aim is to have the programme disseminated to all primary schools over a two year period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a national co-ordinator for the dissemination and a team of six teacher trainers. The teaching staff of each school attend a one-day seminar on the implementation of &ldquo;Walk Tall&rdquo;. There are detailed educational resource materials for each class level in primary schools and these are provided free to schools as their staffs participate in the staff seminars. An ongoing programme of longer training courses for teachers has commenced as well and to date 15 such training programmes have been held. The administrative support for the dissemination process is pro<Col N="690" /> vided through West Dublin Education Centre. The financial resources provided by my Department are £500,000 in 1999 and it is planned to provide a further £500,000 in 2000.</P>
    <P>Post-primary schools included in the disadvantaged areas scheme receive the following supports: supplementary capitation funding of £30 per pupil; the allocation of 209 disadvantaged teaching posts to 190 of the schools in the disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>From the commencement of the current school year, the home/school/community liaison scheme has been extended to all first and second level schools which have disadvantaged area status. In addition, strategies are in place which are designed to tackle educational disadvantage and retention at second level including the eight to 15 initiative &ndash; a pilot programme aimed at developing models of good practice relating to retention with a view to their integration, after structured evaluation, into mainstream policy &ndash; and also the junior certificate school programme and the leaving certificate applied programme which are programmes designed for students who find the normal certificate courses unsuitable. There are also education measures promoted by agencies outside my Department such as the Combat Poverty Agency area-based partnership companies which have contributed to the retention of young people within the formal education system. These measures are successful but have not represented a complete answer to this complex problem. I intend to introduce in the near future new arrangements which will enable targeted schools to tackle early school leaving.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 27 and 56 together.</P>
      <P>The last general expansion of the disadvantaged areas scheme at primary level took place in 1994. The school in question applied for inclusion in the scheme but did not rank sufficiently high in terms of priority of need to secure inclusion on that occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="691" /> A subsequent study of educational disadvantage conducted by the Combat Poverty Agency and the Education Research Centre in 1996 concluded that disadvantaged status should be confined to 16 per cent of the school-going population. This study noted that such status had already been granted to 17 per cent of pupils. As an alternative to extending the disadvantaged areas scheme to additional schools, the study recommended that available resources should be targeted at schools with the greatest concentration of children from disadvantaged backgrounds.</P>
    <P>In keeping with the study's recommendations, resources which subsequently became available were targeted on schools selected to participate in the Breaking the Cycle of disadvantage scheme which was introduced to deliver the sort of targeted support recommended in the study.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputies that the needs of the school to which they refer will be fully considered in the event of any additional initiatives being taken to address educational disadvantage.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputies that work on the White Paper is now well advanced and I hope to be in a position to publish it quite soon.</P>
      <P>Initial work on the preparation of the White Paper on early childhood education began last year, when I convened the National Forum for Early Childhood Education. This forum provided an opportunity for all those involved in the area of early childhood education to come together and to share their views on future policy for early childhood education. The report on the forum, which was compiled by an independent secretariat, was published last November. The report constitutes a major input to the White Paper preparation process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The White Paper will set out Government policy on early childhood education and will provide a blueprint for the development of the sector. It will set out a range of proposals covering early education for children aged from birth to six years. The principal aim will be to raise standards and improve quality of provision of early childhood education services. While quality of provision generally will be addressed, particular attention will be given to the needs of those most <Col N="693" /> in need of assistance including children with special needs and children who are educationally disadvantaged.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the recommendations and financial arrangements in the White Paper must receive approval by Government before I can publish them. As I have not yet submitted the White Paper to Government, I am not, therefore, in a position to discuss these recommendations at this stage. For similar reasons, I am unable, at this stage, to provide details of the Estimate for 2000 for pre-school education although I can assure the Deputy that pre-school provision is being taken fully into account in the preparation of the Estimates.</P>

      <P>I have expressed my concern and disappointment at the industrial action taken by members of the INTO earlier this week. I do not consider that this is the appropriate course of action to pursue these issues.</P>
      <P>I am very much aware of the central role which principals play in our school system. I am also aware that the provision of effective supports to teaching principals is a complex issue.</P>
      <P>It was because of the need to examine the full range of issues that I established, last year, a working group to examine the rights, roles, duties and responsibilities of principals, both administrative principals and teaching principals, in primary schools. The review group, which was chaired by Teri Garvey, was representative of the partners in education and current and former principals comprised a majority of its membership. I remain committed to ensuring that principals in all our primary schools are effectively supported in their roles and I will consider in great detail the report of the working group.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, teaching principals already have a range of supports to assist them in carrying out their functions in schools. Since taking office, I have enhanced considerably the supports available to principals. For example, the fundraising burden faced by principals has been dramatically reduced, secretarial and caretaking assistance has been expanded and new funding for training has been introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am certainly concerned to support principals in their work, but the INTO should recognise that definite advances have been already implemented in this area and that closing schools cannot be justified as the way of pursuing their claims. There are a wide-range of issues involved in developing policy for principals in small schools. The INTO is aware, as I am, that, where these <Col N="694" /> concern the roles and responsibilities of principals, these have to be considered as part of the normal industrial relations negotiations process.</P>

      <P>As the Deputies will be aware the commission is an independent body, chaired by a judge of the High Court. Accordingly, the conduct of its proceedings will be a matter for the commission itself to decide. Upon the establishment of the commission it was given broad terms of reference as follows: to afford victims of abuse in childhood an opportunity to tell of the abuse they suffered to a sympathetic and experienced forum; to establish as complete a picture as possible of the causes, nature and extent of physical and sexual abuse of children in institutions and in other places during the period from 1940, or such earlier date as the commission considers appropriate, to the present, including the antecedents, circumstances, factors and context of such abuse, the perspectives of the victims and the motives and perspectives of the persons responsible for committing abuse; to compile a report and publish it to the general public on the activities and findings of the commission, containing such recommendations as the commission considers appropriate including actions which should be taken to address the continuing effects of the abuse examined by the commission and actions to be taken to safeguard children against abuse for the future; to appoint specialist advisers to supply information or elucidate areas of complexity, to conduct investigations, hold hearings, both private and public and conduct or commission research for the purposes of carrying out these terms of reference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first responsibility of the commission was to decide on certain preliminary matters as follows &ndash; to review the terms of reference and decide if they required alteration or addition, to recommend to Government what statutory pow<Col N="695" /> ers and protections they would need to carry out their mandate and to decide on how they would conduct their proceedings. The commission submitted an interim report in September in which they sought some clarifications of their terms of reference and I have been informed by the commission that a second report dealing conclusively with the preliminary matters will be made in the very near future.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to proceeding with any legislation necessary to the work of the commission as a priority and generally will assist the commission so that access to it by victims can take place at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>My approach has been to follow the practice in recent years and increase the reckonable income limits in line with movements in the average industrial wage in the previous year. I increased the reckonable income limits for the 1999-2000 academic year by 4.6 per cent, based on the increase in the average industrial wage for the period March 1997 to March 1998. I have also <Col N="696" /> applied the increase in the reckonable income limits to the allowance by which the income limits may be increased in respect of other family members pursuing a course of study. In such cases, for the 1999-2000 academic year, the reckonable income limits may be increased by £2,160 where there are two such children, £4,320 where there are three, and so on by increments of £2,160.</P>
      <P>Similarly in relation to the value of the grant, I have followed the practice of recent years and increased third level maintenance grants in line with inflation as measured by the change in the consumer price index for the period mid February to mid February each year.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will appreciate improvements in the student support schemes must have regard to overall resource constraints and other competing demands in the education sector. I have previously indicated my intention to first seek to deal with the more significant anomalies or disincentives in the grants schemes before dealing with the more general issue of grant levels and income limits.</P>
      <P>In this regard, my priority has been to honour the commitment given in the Programme for Government, An Action Programme for the Millennium, to introduce equitable support for students attending PLC courses. I have honoured that commitment and introduced a maintenance grants scheme for students attending post leaving certificate courses with effect from the 1998-99 academic year.</P>
      <P>I have also announced that, with effect from the 1999-2000 academic year, all eligible mature students will qualify for the higher non-adjacent rate of grant. I was particularly concerned about mature students and independent mature students in particular in regard to the rate of grant payable. This improvement is estimated to cost £2.4 million over the next two years.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 36 and 54 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The subject of attrition rates is a complex one <Col N="697" /> and figures on attrition across higher education have not yet been established on a common and comparable basis.</P>
    <P>In relation to the university sector, the Higher Education Authority carried out a study in 1994, which indicated an overall completion rate of 81 per cent, which is high by international standards, for those entering in 1989-90. The Authority has commissioned the Educational Research Centre, St. Patrick's College, Drumcondra to undertake a further detailed study in this area and a report should be available by the end of 1999.</P>
    <P>At my request, the Council of Directors of Institutes of Technology has commissioned the Educational Research Centre, Drumcondra, to also undertake a comprehensive study on the issue of non-completion in the institutes, which will consist of a quantitative analysis to track a cohort of students over a four year period and a qualitative study of students who leave without graduating.</P>
    <P>The research project team has visited each of the institutes of technology and has developed a standard format of questionnaire to which institutes of technology have responded regarding the variables that influence progression and retention for each course. The research project team is in the process of collating this data. Discussions are taking place with the Dublin Institute of Technology regarding a similar and comparable study.</P>
    <P>In addition to this I am supporting and promoting a number of initiatives in the technological sector to assist the compilation of a data base on attrition-drop out rates and to develop appropriate strategies to address the issues. The Council of Directors of the Institutes of Technology has established a national committee on retention with representatives from each institute to focus on &ldquo;maximising success rates&rdquo; for institutes' students. The committee has assembled a profile of current good practice in relation to retention across the sector. The profile has been made available to all institutes of technology.</P>
    <P>Institutes of technology continue to introduce a range of initiatives and support services seeking to improve completion rates. These include induction-orientation programmes, course information services, tutor services and systems designed for the early identification of &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; first year students.</P>
    <P>As part of a two-year funding initiative to tackle educational disadvantaged at third level, I am providing £1.5 million over the period 1999-2000 to address the issue of non-completion of courses in the technological sector. This funding supports and complements the programmes already in place and will have regard to the recommendations of the committee in relation to the funding of action projects and programmes both short and long-term based on best practice. In addition, I have indicated to the institutes of technology that £8 of the students services charge is to be dedicated to projects linked to attrition and access. The institutes have been requested to <Col N="698" /> furnish the proposals for the attrition-access initiatives which are to benefit in this way. I am also actively addressing the provision of science and technology in second level schools, a provision of particular importance in preparing persons for successful participation in technical courses at third level.</P>
    <P>A computerised management information systems project is currently being developed as part of the ongoing work to establish modern financial and administrative systems for the institutes of technology. The project has the aim of supporting the efficient and effective administration of the institutions and providing both the institutions and my Department with timely and accurate management information for a variety of purposes. This new system will provide enhanced information on attrition and the results from the initiatives above will be fed into this project.</P>

      <P>A consultancy report, which was submitted to my Department in 1993, dealt with the factors which contribute to the cost of school text books. The main conclusion of the report was that book rental schemes are the most practical way of limiting the cost of school books to parents.</P>
      <P>The report, copies of which were sent to all schools, contains a number of useful suggestions, including a code of good practice for successful operation of book rental schemes. My Department endorses the recommendations and urges school authorities to put in place book loan rental schemes to the greatest extent possible.</P>
      <P>The report recommended also that a special grant be made to disadvantaged schools which commit themselves to book rental schemes, to help overcome problems of seed capital. Since 1994 special grants have been provided, to primary and second level schools which are categorised as disadvantaged to assist in the establishment of book loan-rental schemes.</P>
      <P>My Department also provides grants to help with the cost of school text books for necessitous pupils in first level and second level schools. For the purposes of these grants, a needy pupil is a pupil from a family where there is genuine hardship because of unemployment, prolonged illness of a parent, large family size with inadequate means, single parenthood, or other family circumstances &ndash; such as alcoholism &ndash; which would indicate a similar degree of financial hardship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The book grant schemes are administered in schools by the principal teachers in a flexible way under the terms of the schemes based on their <Col N="699" /> knowledge of particular circumstances in individual cases.</P>

      <P>I am aware that there has been an increased intake by the colleges in the teacher education sector as a result of the growing need in this area. I understand the design capacity of the main facility of Mary Immaculate College, Limerick was for a student population of 750, while the number of full-time students for the 1998-99 period was 1,575 and that the design capacity of the main facility of St. Patrick's College, Drumcondra was for a student population of 800, while the number of full-time students for the 1998-99 period was 1,203.</P>
      <P>The additional student numbers have been accommodated by the variable use of space by the colleges and through the use of rented and temporary accommodation.</P>

      <P>Second level schools are asked to make a return on a twice yearly basis to their local FÁS office giving details of pupils who have left school prior to the leaving certificate. The information is entered by FÁS on a social guarantee register and the persons listed are then contacted by FÁS to discuss their education or training needs. The social guarantee register is one of the sources for recruitment onto Youthreach.</P>
      <P>Difficulties with the social guarantee register arise in a number of areas related to the response rate by schools, the elapse of time since the date of leaving, the fact that many pupils undergo prolonged absences before being deleted officially from the school register, and the ineffectiveness of written follow-up in reaching severely disadvantaged early school leavers. Therefore, the social guarantee register is only one of a range of methods used for recruitment onto Youthreach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Youthreach centres have developed referral networks under which close links are developed locally with schools, Garda and juvenile liaison, probation, welfare and youth services and com<Col N="700" /> munity groups, so that trainees can be recruited through these routes to join the programme. Open days, publicity, posters and leaflets are also used to create an awareness of the work of the centres. At local level, a district approach is used under which all relevant interests are consulted on priority area needs and plans for expansion. As part of the FÁS advocate service, 14 full-time staff have been made available to assist in providing counselling, progression and placement options for Youthreach trainees in FÁS and the vocational education committees. In addition, a guidance, counselling and psychological service was introduced in 1998 to support participants on the programme, and the budget for this was increased to £728,000 in 1999. Centres are encouraged to deploy an element of this budget to outreach work.</P>
    <P>The Education (Welfare) Bill, 1999 proposes the raising of the school leaving age and the establishment of an educational welfare board to monitor school attendance and support families at risk. Under the terms of the Bill, schools will be required to report on school attendance and expulsions to the educational welfare board, and the latter will be required to provide assistance to ensure that an appropriate prescribed minimum education is provided. The board will also have a role in supporting the continued education and training of those over 16 and under 18 who have left school early to enter work. Section 29 provides for the systematic sharing of personal data with other prescribed bodies for purposes of research, placement or tracking. These developments will enable a systematic and structured approach to be adopted to outreach.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department provides funding towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services in primary schools under two separate schemes. One scheme is the 1978-79 scheme for the employment of school secretaries and caretakers under which my Department meets the full cost of salary and employer's PRSI. This scheme is, however, being phased out as posts become vacant.</P>
      <P>Arising from the Programme for Economic and Social Progress, PESP, a second scheme was introduced in 1992 whereby my Department provides additional capitation grants for primary schools towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services. Under the PESP scheme, schools receive grants of £15 per pupil, based on their enrolments, which are paid as additions to the standard <i>per capita </i>grant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since its introduction in 1992, the scheme has been expanded in line with undertakings given in <Col N="701" /> the PESP. The scheme has been extended to include more schools by reducing the qualifying enrolment threshold to its current figure of 195 pupils, with an ultimate target of providing additional capitation grants to all primary schools with 100 pupils or more.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that with effect from January next, all primary schools with 100 or more pupils will be eligible for a grant of £30 per pupil towards secretarial and caretaking services under this scheme.</P>
    <P>My officials will be writing to all qualifying schools over the next couple of months confirming their inclusion, and setting out the details of the scheme.</P>
    <P>At second level the assistance provided by my Department towards the provision of caretaking and secretarial services reflects the different school management and ownership arrangements at second level.</P>
    <P>Voluntary secondary schools with enrolments of 200 or more pupils and not covered by the 1978 scheme, for school secretaries, are in receipt of additional <i>per capita </i>grants towards the provision of caretaking and secretarial services, subject to maximum of £8,750 for caretaking and £10,500 in the case of secretarial services.</P>
    <P>In the case of vocational schools and colleges, caretaking and clerical staff are allocated to vocational education committees on a scheme wide basis. It is a matter for the vocational education committee to deploy staff in the best manner possible to meet the needs of the committee and its schools.</P>
    <P>All schools in the community and comprehensive school sector have been provided with clerical and caretaking services.</P>
    <P>The question of increasing the level of grant payable to schools, which I increased by £5 per student in 1997 in respect of the secondary school secretarial grant, will be examined in the budgetary context and in light of available resources. I wish to assure the Deputy that I remain committed to improvements in the provision of additional assistance to schools for caretaking and clerical services.</P>

      <P>The declining uptake of the physical sciences has been of concern to me for some time and last March I announced a major initiative to address the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department is in ongoing contact with a number of bodies involved in science education in relation to the uptake of physics and chemistry at leaving certificate. At the suggestion of the national committee for physics of the Royal Irish <Col N="702" /> Academy a meeting was held on September 10 to discuss the declining uptake of the physical sciences. In addition to members of my Department the meeting was attended by representatives of university physics, chemistry and education departments, the NCCA, FÁS, Forfás and the Irish Science Teachers' Association.</P>
    <P>At this meeting it was decided to set up a sub-committee to prepare a report on possible initiatives by the various agencies to support the development of the physical sciences at second level and to suggest procedures for implementing these initiatives. In particular, the sub-committee is considering a proposal for the establishment of a task force to progress solutions and to liaise closely with the Department in its work in this area. I look forward to receiving these proposals. They will receive the fullest consideration from my Department within the context of current resources and commitments.</P>

      <P>The fundamental objective in this regard <Col N="707" /> is to increase retention rates so that pupils remain in school and complete senior cycle education. A range of measures is provided to prevent and address early school leaving including early intervention measures such as pre-schooling, remedial and home-school liaison services, Breaking the Cycle, co-ordination with other agencies, guidance and psychological services, and ancillary services and resources for schools in disadvantaged areas; curricular reforms to allow students to make choices relevant to their abilities and aptitudes &ndash; junior certificate schools programme, leaving cert applied and leaving cert vocational programme; second chance education and training through the provision of Youthreach and senior traveller training centres for unqualified school leavers and VTOS for long-term unemployed adults and a range of adult and community education measures; improved quality of education through investment in in-career development of staff, including school management and other strategies to cope with learning difficulties and disadvantage and counselling skills; and the provision of national certification for vocational training qualifications through the work of the NCVA and NCEA and the planned establishment of a national qualifications authority and further and higher education and training awards councils. These developments will assist in the promotion of quality standards in line with best international practice and the establishment of clear routes of progression from foundation awards to higher degrees.</P>
      <P>Arrangements are under way to expand the remedial and home-school-community liaison services, so that all primary and post-primary schools will have access to a remedial service, and all schools designated as disadvantaged will have access to a home-school-community liaison co-ordinator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the eight to 15 early school leavers initiative, my Department funds 14 pilot projects selected to test approaches to the development of integrated in-school and out-of-school responses to the needs of children at risk. The project will operate for two years from 1998-99 and 1999-2000. At second level, a new stay in school initiat<Col N="708" /> ive is beginning under which, in the first phase, up to 40 schools will be granted additional assistance to draw up a multi-annual written retention agreement with the Department which sets out a programme of actions to be implemented locally on a multi-agency cross-community basis in order to encourage more students to remain in school. The administration arrangements for the scheme are being finalised at present, and the scheme is expected to come into operation shortly.</P>
    <P>Work to establish a national educational psychological service is also progressing with the appointment of additional psychologists. The legislation under the Education (Welfare) Bill, 1999, is being processed, under which it is planned to raise the school leaving age and establish an educational welfare service to monitor school attendance and support families at risk so that their children remain in school.</P>
    <P>The Youthreach and Traveller programmes for unqualified early school leavers were expanded by some 2,637 places in FÁS and vocational education committees in 1998 allied with the development of a guidance, counselling and psychological service. A new child care measure has also been introduced for participants in VTOS, Youthreach and senior traveller training centres, facilitating direct provision of crèches, purchase of places on existing crèches, and payment of childminders &ndash; £2 million. In addition, the budget for adult literacy initiatives has been increased by a further £2.6 million in 1999 to £5.665 million.</P>
    <P>Information on the eight to 15 early school leaver initiatives, together with a list of Youthreach and senior traveller centres in the education sector has been provided in tabular form which I propose to circulate with the Official Report. The average unit costs for a Youthreach and traveller training centre place are £6,910 and £10,119 respectively, inclusive of training allowances.</P>
    <P>A range of other projects are supported by other Departments and agencies through the Springboard initiative, the work of area based partnerships, EU Community initiatives and Combat Poverty Agency demonstration projects. Details of these projects are available from the relevant agencies.</P>

      <P>The National Centre for Technology in Education, NCTE, has responsibility for the development of a strategic training programme for teachers in ICT in education. The following are the details of the provision of places for teachers on in-service training programmes in information and communication technology under Schools IT 2000: 1998, 24,909 places on 1,660 courses; 1999, 21,000 places on 1,400 courses. Some of these are being undertaken during this current quarter.</P>
      <P>The training course titles are as follows: phase 1 and phase 2 &ndash; ICT introductory courses; Internet and basic troubleshooting; ICT in the primary curriculum; post-primary curriculum based courses; special needs; pedagogic skills development for school integration project participants and specialised courses for ICT tutors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Thus, in the three year period from 1998 to the <Col N="713" /> end of 2000, a total of 60,109 places on 4,007 courses are being provided for teachers on ICT in education under Schools IT 2000.

      <P>The position generally is that post-primary transport routes are planned so as to ensure that, as far as possible, no eligible pupil will have more than three hours travelling and waiting time per day and no more than three miles to travel to a pick-up point for a service.</P>
      <P>The pupils concerned reside between 0.4 miles and 2.4 miles from the route of existing service. The service collects the pupils at 8.15 a.m. each morning, and sets them down at 16.05 p.m. in the afternoon. The school opens at 9.30 a.m. and closes at 15.45 p.m. The total travelling and waiting time is one hour 35 minutes. This level of service is within guidelines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While being sympathetic to the needs of the pupils in question, my Department has to consider the operation of the school transport <Col N="714" /> scheme as a whole and the requirement not to breach guidelines, which would have financial and policy implications for the transport service overall.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, it is not open to my Department to make alternative transport arrangements for the pupils in question.</P>

      <P>With regard to second level, this year provision was made for 225 additional teachers and this, together with the retention of some 130 teachers who would otherwise have been redeployed is enabling us to provide a remedial teaching service in every second level school and also to bring all disadvantaged schools into the home-school liaison scheme. I have also made improvements in the provisions available for guidance in our schools with a guaranteed minimum allocation now available to every school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to providing for additional teachers, I have, this year, introduced a new retention ratio for secondary schools. The impact of this is to <Col N="715" /> retain in schools teachers who would otherwise be liable to be redeployed. In all, some 150 teachers have been retained under this initiative and those teachers will continue to be available to improve the quality of education in our schools.</P>
    <P>The pupil teacher ratio at second level in the 1998-9 school year was of the order of 15:4:1. Allowing for the increase of some 225 teachers and a projected drop in enrolments, it is expected that the pupil teacher ratio will reduce to approximately 15:1:1 in the current school year.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may be aware that I have introduced a range of new initiatives to reduce the pupil teacher ratio in primary schools since taking up office. They include improvements in the staffing schedule for the appointment and retention of teachers and, particularly, reductions in the retention and appointment figures for one teacher schools. Other initiatives include the allocation of additional posts towards specifically helping the educationally disadvantaged and the introduction of a maximum general class size guideline of 30.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to advise the Deputy that the initiatives have helped to improve substantially the pupil teacher ratio at primary level. The application of the initiatives in the 2000-2001 school year will help to further improve the ratio.</P>
    <P>The current ratio based on the projected enrolments in primary schools in September 1999 is 20.4:1.</P>
    <P>The question of further improvements in the pupil teacher ratio will be considered in the context of available resources.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the findings to date from the whole school evaluation, WSE, project, it is important to emphasise that this was a pilot project, the purpose of which was to obtain information on how the process of WSE would work in practice and on the extent to which it could provide information on the working of the school system generally. Schools volunteered to participate in the project and for this reason those that took part &ndash; 35 in all, 18 primary and 17 second-level &ndash; could not be assumed to be representative of the totality of schools in the country.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding this, it is clear from the findings that WSE is broadly acceptable to schools and can contribute significantly to schools' planning and development. Both managements and teachers in the pilot schools welcomed the project and expressed considerable satisfaction with most aspects of the process.</P>
      <P>Now that the pilot project has been completed, my Department has initiated a new round of consultations with the education partners and I hope to be in a position to put proposals for the development of the process to the partners and the schools in the near future.</P>
      <P>From the reports given to schools in the project it was evident that in most schools there is a strong commitment on the part of management to the empowerment and development of staff and to supporting the professional culture of the school. In many schools, also, there is real and meaningful delegation of duties and responsibilities and staff are encouraged to he innovative and proactive in carrying out their duties.</P>
      <P>Because of the relatively small number of schools in the project, it is not possible to generalise on the quality of teaching across all schools. While aspects of the teaching and learning in particular subject areas were identified as needing further development in some schools, overall it is noteworthy that the reports indicate that the inspectors found much to praise in the learning and teaching they observed. Most of the recommendations they made for improvement related to matters of detail or curricular issues, rather than the overall quality of teaching.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As agreed with the education partners, only certain aspects of the school's functioning were the subject of the pilot project, and the availability of support services was not an issue that was evaluated. With regard to the outcomes for pupils, clearly all aspects of the school's functioning must impact on the quality of pupil learning and, in the pilot project schools at least, the <Col N="718" /> inspectors found many examples of high quality teaching and learning.</P>
    <P>In relation to the issue of class size, I should point out to the Deputy that this school year is seeing the first allocation of additional teachers to second level schools for some years. This year provision was made for 225 additional teachers and this, together with the retention of some 130 teachers who would otherwise have been redeployed, is enabling us to provide a remedial teaching service in every second level school and also to bring all disadvantaged schools into the home school liaison scheme. I have also made improvements in the provisions available for guidance in our schools with a guaranteed minimum allocation now available to every school.</P>
    <P>In addition to providing for additional teachers, I have, this year, introduced a new retention ratio for secondary schools. The impact of this is to retain in schools teachers who would otherwise be liable to be redeployed. In all, some 150 teachers have been retained under this initiative and these teachers will continue to be available to improve the quality of education in our schools.</P>
    <P>In the 1998-99 school year the pupil teacher ratio at second level was approximately 15.4 to 1. Allowing for the increase of some 225 teachers and a projected drop in enrolments, it is expected that the pupil teacher ratio will reduce to approximately 15.1 to 1 in the current school year. Within this, there are a large number of very small classes.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Deputy will agree that the principal concern in relation to class size must be the impact on educational attainment. In this regard, the great body of research indicates that the major impact of class size is to be found in the early years of primary education and for disadvantaged groups in particular.</P>

      <P>I support the development of an all-Irish second level provision in north-east Dublin.</P>
      <P>An examination carried out by my Department indicated the likelihood that there would be a significant level of demand for such a facility, in view of the growth in the number of all-Irish primary schools in the general area. This examination also highlighted the fact that there is surplus post-primary accommodation in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Earlier this year, one of the schools concerned offered the use of its surplus accommodation to the promoters of the all-Irish facility. The school in question has a strong disposition towards the Irish language and its teaching staff was very sup<Col N="719" /> portive of the proposed initiative. The offer involved immediate access to satisfactory classroom accommodation and as much autonomy as was practicable within the existing management structure. If the offer had been accepted, it would have enabled an all-Irish post-primary facility to commence in September 1999. Regrettably, however, the offer was refused on the basis that the promoters wished to have a fully independent school.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the considerations which led the promoters to reject the offer but I am aware, also, of existing arrangements of this nature operating successfully as part of a second-level school. In addition, as Minister for Education and Science, I have overall responsibility to ensure that the use of existing school accommodation is maximised.</P>
    <P>I had a constructive meeting with the promoters on Wednesday, 13 October 1999, at which they made a number of points to me. I undertook to consider the points made and I will be in further touch with them as soon as possible.</P>

Tá soláthar déanta do 225 múinteoirí sa bhreis. Mar thoradh ar an méadú sin agus ar an gcinneadh a rinneadh faoi 130 meánmhúinteoirí a choinneáil ina gcuid scoileanna in áit iad a athlonnú, táimid in ann seirbhís feabhais a chur ar fáil i ngach scoil dara leibhéal agus an scéim Chaidrimh Teaghlaigh/Scoile/Baile a chur i bhfeidhm i ngach scoil atá faoi mhíbhuntáiste.

Dá bharr sin, tá 150 múinteoirí eile á gcoinneáil ina scoileanna agus beidh fáil go leanúnach ar na múinteoirí sin chun feabhas a chur ar cháilíocht an oideachais atá le fáil inár gcuid scoileanna.</P>

      <P>The deposit fees referred to by Deputy Ferris refers to the standardised charge which the third level colleges levied in the context of the free fees initiative in the 1995-6 academic year for examinations, registration and student services. When introduced, this charge was fixed at a maximum of £150 for two academic years. At that time, the then Minister stated that the level of the charge would be reviewed. In the light of the arguments advanced by the universities that the true costs of the charges would on average <Col N="721" /> amount to £400 in 1997-8, the need for improved student services and the fact that the charge had been frozen since 1995, I accepted that the third level institutions could increase this charge to £250 for the 1997-8 academic year. In line with the 4 per cent increase agreed for third level tuition fees for the 1998-9 academic year, I also accepted a similar increase in the level of this charge to £260.</P>
      <P>The universities further increased this charge by 7 per cent to £278 for the current academic year and I would point out that this increase was made without my approval. Section 40 of the Universities Act, 1997, enables a university to determine and charge fees for student registration, courses, lectures, etc. The Higher Education Authority can review with the universities the fees charged by the universities and then, having consulted with me, the Higher Education Authority can advise the universities on the fees which in its opinion should be charged. Accordingly, there is no specific statutory requirement for the universities to seek the approval of the Minister for Education and Science for the increase in the student charge. Prior to this year, there was agreement as to the level of increase in the charge and my officials are engaged in discussions with the Higher Education Authority and the universities regarding an agreed procedure for reviewing fee levels in the future.</P>
      <P>In the light of the increase in the charge being levied by the universities, I agreed to an increase to £278 for the charge payable by students in the institutes of technology. However, this approval was on the basis that £8 of the increase would be specifically devoted to attrition/access initiatives in the individual institutions. This funding will complement the targeted funding of £3 million being specifically allocated to promote access to third level amongst students from disadvantaged backgrounds, including people with disabilities, and a further £1.5 million to address the issue of non-completion of courses in institutes of technology.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, students who are eligible for maintenance grants under the means tested student support schemes do not have to pay this charge. I believe that the effect of the charge has been to provide a sounder and more secure funding base for the services covered. I am concerned to ensure that the level of the services provided fully reflects the amount charged and as I have mentioned earlier, my officials are in discussions with the Higher Education Authority and the universities in this regard. I am also concerned that appropriate systems of consultation and accountability in the allocation of funding from the charge and in the determination of student services to be funded apply in all third level colleges. I understand that the Higher Education Authority's review of the consultative and decision making procedures in place in the various third level colleges in this regard will be finalised shortly.</P>

      <P>I am aware that students are experiencing difficulties in finding good affordable accommodation. This difficulty is a subset of the general housing squeeze which has been growing in recent years and is particularly acute in Dublin. I believe that the core issue is a need to increase the availability of dedicated student housing and the resultant release of pressure from the rented sector. Last year, at my Department's request, the Higher Education Authority consulted with the universities on the issue of student housing and the universities have been unanimous in proposing the availability of tax incentives for the provision of student residences on or near campus.</P>
      <P>The Government has responded to these difficulties by the provision of section 23-type tax relief for rented residential accommodation for third level students in section 50 of the 1999 Finance Act. The availability of tax incentives in the past resulted in the provision of a significant number of student residences. I understand that a number of colleges are examining proposals for student accommodation in the context of the tax relief arrangements.</P>
      <P>I believe that this response is the correct one rather than an across the board increase in grants which, at a considerable cost, would have no direct impact on helping students to compete in the rented accommodation sector.</P>

      <P>Under the Children Act, 1908, overall responsibility for the inspection of industrial and reformatory schools currently rests with the Minister for Education and Science and the chief inspector of schools. Under their direction, the inspection of these facilities is carried out by a designated inspector of industrial and reformatory schools, with the assistance of a child care adviser.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The designated inspector and the child care adviser have responsibility for monitoring the ongoing operation of the facilities and reporting and advising on standards of management in the <Col N="723" /> facilities and on the protection, care, safety and wellbeing of the children. Reports and findings are not currently published by the inspectorate.</P>
    <P>The recently published Children Bill, 1999, which will replace the Children Act, 1908, makes specific provision for the inspection of all aspects of residential care in the custodial facilities. Sections 188 and 189 of the Bill deal with the question of reports of inspections and investigations carried out by the inspector. They also provide for the preparation of an annual report by the inspector. The Bill provides for the laying of all such reports before the Houses of the Oireachtas, subject to the right of the Minister for Education and Science to omit any material where such omission is necessary to avoid identification of any person.</P>
    <P>I do not consider that it is necessary to establish the inspectorate of the facilities in question as an independent agency. Rather, I consider that the arrangements set out in the Children Bill, 1999, represent the most effective means of ensuring that an adequate inspection service is in place.</P>

      <P>I am aware of current supply pressures in the private rented sector. Section 50 of the Finance Act, 1999, was introduced specifically in order to relieve some of the supply pressure by providing a scheme of tax relief for rented residential accommodation for third level students. For the purposes of the scheme, properties qualifying for relief are campus areas, approved by an eligible educational institution, which are either on-campus or within an eight kilometre radius of the main campus.</P>
      <P>The provision of on-campus accommodation is ongoing in the third level sector and is primarily a matter for the educational institution authorities. My Department is aware that on-campus accommodation for 700 students is expected to be completed well in advance of the next academic year at the Galway campus of the Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology while approval for on-campus accommodation in respect of 450 bed spaces has been sanctioned by the University of Limerick.</P>
      <P>A number of developers have made initial inquiries or submitted applications to educational institutions in respect of developments which are within eight kilometres of the eligible institutions and to date four such applications have received approval from the educational institutions concerned.</P>

      <P>While many schools have warmly welcomed the introduction of the escort scheme and are in the process of putting their escort services in place, some schools have expressed concerns and reservations at taking on responsibility for the escort scheme.

      <P>I have recently spoken to the members of the management boards of special schools on this issue.

I have asked all schools involved to use the escort funding that has been made available to them to proceed with the scheme.</P>
      <P>At the same time, I have arranged for senior officials of my Department's to meet with representatives of the management body for the special schools to discuss the some specific concerns which have been raised by some of the schools. This meeting will take place in the near future.</P>

      <P>Schools IT involves three major initiatives: the Technology Integration Initiative &ndash; TII; the Teaching Skills Initiative &ndash; TSI; the Schools Support Initiative (SSI) which includes ScoilNet and The School Integration Project &ndash; SIP.</P>
      <P>Strand 1 of the TII proposed that each school be assisted in acquiring at least one multimedia computer system with Internet access before the end of 1999. In May 1998 my Department issued grants for the purchase of computer equipment totalling £13.6 million to all schools in the free education system. Each ordinary primary school received a grant of £2,000 plus £5 per pupil and special schools received a grant of £3,000 plus £20 per pupil. Primary schools with one or more special classes received an additional £1,500 plus £20 per special class pupil. In partnership with Eircom's &ndash; Telecom Éireann &ndash;  Information Age Schools' Initiative each school, including each primary school, was also provided with an Internet ready multimedia computer, a free telephone line and Internet access during 1998 and early 1999. Thus, strand 1 of the TII has been completed significantly ahead of schedule.</P>
      <P>Strand 2 of the TII has the objective of achieving an installed base of 60,000 multimedia computers in all schools by the end of 2001. As a result of the grants provided in May 1998, the Eircom Information Age Schools Initiative and the significant funding provided at local level by parents, local business, etc. I am satisfied that we are well on the way to achieving this strand 2 objective ahead of schedule. An expert study is also being commissioned which will guide the continuing implementation of the TII and provide detailed data on ICT equipment levels in schools.</P>
      <P>The NCTE has responsibility for the development of a strategic training programme for teachers in ICT in education. During 1998 a total of 11,765 places were provided for primary teachers on phase 1 and phase 2 &ndash; ICT introductory courses. A further 1,530 places were provided on Internet and basic troubleshooting and other specialised courses (for tutors). During 1999 a total of 8,010 places are being made available on phase 1 and phase 2 &ndash; ICT introductory courses. Course places for 1,460 are being provided on ICT in the primary curriculum and 1,440 places are being provided on Internet and basic troubleshooting and other specialised courses (for tutors). Three hundred places are being provided on special needs courses also. During 2000 it is estimated that a total of 7,500 ICT training places will be made available to primary teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Thus, in a three year period from 1998 to the end of 2000 a total of 32,545 course places are <Col N="728" /> being provided in the primary sector on ICT in education under Schools IT 2000. This is a significant achievement.</P>
    <P>The NCTE has responsibility for the development of ScoilNet. ScoilNet has been developed in partnership with Intel Ireland and I am delighted that I was able to launch the ScoilNet website on 28 September. I am confident that ScoilNet will be an excellent resource as regards the provision of information, advice and support to schools on curriculum matters, on the progress of Schools IT 2000 and also on educational ICTs issues generally.</P>
    <P>The School Integration Project is an essential element of Schools IT 2000. Over 500 schools responded to a call for innovative proposals in the use of ICT in teaching and learning. Following assessment and consultation with the NCTE, 48 innovative projects were identified involving a total of 228 schools, primary and post-primary. The cost of the SIP initiative will be over £3 million. Each project will explore and advance the integration of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) within teaching and learning in Irish schools. SIP is special in that it is a bottom-up initiative where schools were asked to propose their own project ideas in collaboration with other organisations. This led to the involvement of 28 sponsors from the public/commercial sector and 58 project partners drawn from third level institutions, local communities and other agencies. Further development of SIP is planned.</P>
    <P>To provide support to schools on a regional basis Schools IT 2000 proposed that IT advisers be appointed to the full-time education centres. Sixteen IT advisers have been appointed from the 1 September and the recruitment of a further four is now in train.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that Schools IT 2000 is meeting and indeed exceeding its targets. However, in order to ensure this and to assist future policy development in the area of ICT in education, the national policy advisory and development committee of Schools IT 2000 is commissioning a major evaluation of Schools IT 2000.</P>

      <P>There is an estimate from the National Survey of English Reading (1993) that about 6.5 per cent &ndash; 9.5 per cent of pupils have serious literacy difficulties. International surveys indicate literacy levels for Irish nine and 14 year olds of just above average. Data on the proportion of children found to be performing significantly below the expectation for their age group in mathematics are not available.</P>
      <P>The 1995 Third International Mathematics and Science Study involved Irish pupils in third and fourth classes. The results showed that the mean mathematics scores of Irish pupils in both class grades were higher than the corresponding international mean mathematics scores. Sweden did not participate but Irish pupils' mean achievements were better, except for those of pupils from the Netherlands, than those of other European countries participating, including England and Scotland.</P>
      <P>The reading performance of Irish nine year olds was assessed in the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement Study of 1991. Irish pupils scored above the international mean and in a group of five EU countries performed at the average level. Sweden was in a group of eight EU countries that performed significantly above the international average.</P>

      <P>The area based partnerships are funded at present as part of the EU aided Operational Programme for Local Urban and Rural Development 1994-99 co-ordinated by the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation. The continued operation of partnership projects after the current round of EU Structural Funds will be influenced by emerging developments generally regarding both the negotiations for the new National Development Plan and the finalisation of the Estimates for the year 2000.</P>
      <P>I am committed to the promotion of an integrated area-based approach to addressing educational disadvantage, and to the enhancement of links between education providers and community, youth, welfare, employer and training interests. My Department will continue to work closely with local development interests in the future to achieve the objective of integrated area planning and a strengthening of home, school and community links. The youth services have a critical role to play in this respect.</P>

      <P>In 1996, the student support schemes were extended to provide maintenance grants to undergraduate students pursuing approved third level courses in other EU member states.</P>
      <P>Prior to this, grants were only payable to students who were pursuing approved courses in the Republic and Northern Ireland. In general, the approved courses in other EU member states are full-time undergraduate courses of not less than two years duration pursued in a university or third level institution, which is maintained or assisted by recurrent grants from public funds. There are however a number of excepted courses including those in medicine, dentistry, veterinary medicine and teacher training courses including those leading to the award of Bachelor of Education, on the basis that these courses in Ireland were subject to a quota based on policy decisions on the appropriate levels of graduate output.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased with the progress being made by schools in relation to the implementation of relationships and sexuality education. I believe, however, that we need to continue our efforts to ensure that all children have access to an RSE programme which enables them learn about their own development and about their friendships and relationships with others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this regard I asked late last year that information be collected on the level of implementation of RSE in schools. The final figures of a national survey on the implementation of relationships and sexuality education are based on a 66 per cent response rate in respect of primary schools and a 64 per cent response rate at post-primary level. These indicate that 24 per <Col N="731" /> cent of respondent primary schools are already implementing an RSE programme and 57 per cent indicated their intention to teach RSE in some or all classes during the last school year. Sixty seven per cent of respondent post-primary schools are implementing RSE in some or all classes and 78 per cent indicated their intention to teach RSE in some or all classes during the school year.</P>
    <P>It must be borne in mind that the first step for schools in introducing RSE is to develop a school policy, which involves school management, parents and teachers in a collaborative process. Information seminars have been held for parents at school level and for boards of management-management authorities. Policy development seminars and whole school staff seminars have also been held. In this regard 67 per cent of primary schools and 68 per cent of post-primary schools have established RSE policy committees. The implementation of an RSE programme in schools follows from this process.</P>
    <P>The process of policy formulation through partnership is a relatively new experience for many school communities. Many schools have found this process to be a valuable and rewarding experience in so far as it gave them an opportunity to discuss a vision for their children's education, enunciate a school ethos and debate the issues involved.</P>
    <P>I recognise that schools are at different stages in implementing a programme. The information on progress collected from the survey will enable effective targeting of supports. In this regard the RSE training support service, with whom I am in regular contact, continues to monitor the implementation of RSE in schools and acts as a support to schools in this work.</P>
    <P>Senior cycle resource materials were issued to schools recently and it is expected that the remaining materials for fifth and sixth classes at primary level will issue next month. I intend, therefore, early in the New Year, to follow up with another questionnaire about the level of implementation.</P>
    <P>Given the nature of the process involved it is not possible to say when the overall programme will be completed. However, I am satisfied that significant progress has already been made and that this progress will continue.</P>

      <P>The ratio of primary pupils per multimedia personal computer is currently estimated to be approximately 16:1. This is based on a recent sample taken by the National Centre for Technology in Education. This is a significant improvement on the figure of 35:1 which resulted from the survey of schools undertaken in early 1998 by Éircom in association with my Department. Many European countries have not established pupil or teacher/computer ratios but from the details available it is clear that the ratios range from 25 primary pupils per computer to about eight primary pupils per computer.</P>
      <P>In the three year period from 1998 to the end of 2000, a total of 32,545 course places are being provided in the primary sector on ICT in education under Schools IT 2000. The majority of in-service courses are of 20 hours duration and some specialist courses are of ten hours duration. This provision of in-service for teachers on ICT in education is significantly higher than in any other European country and great credit is due to our teachers for their willingness and enthusiasm to undertake these courses.</P>

      <P>I am very much aware of the central role which principals play in our school system. I am also aware that the provision of effective supports to teaching principals is a complex issue. The role of each principal in different schools will vary depending on a wide range of factors, for example, the size of their school. Principals in the over 800 schools which have only one or two teachers obviously face a very different issues to those in larger schools. It was because of the need to examine the full range of issues that I established, last year, a working group to examine the rights, roles, duties and responsibilities of principals, both administrative principals and teaching principals, in primary schools. The review group, which was chaired by Teri Garvey, was representative of the partners in education and current and former principals comprised a majority of its membership.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, teaching principals already have a range of supports to assist them in carrying out their functions in schools. These include the middle management structure in schools, in accordance with which principals may delegate some functions to other teachers in the school. These structures were designed to compensate for the increasing levels of administration and management that arise as schools increase in size. Approximately three quarters of all primary schools have middle management structures. Principals in many schools also have access to secretarial and caretaking services funded by my Department.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, I recently announced a major investment of £2.7 million to provide for a substantial improvement to the secretarial-caretaking scheme in primary schools. In addition, various initiatives implemented by the Government have ensured that the fundraising burden placed on principals has been significantly reduced and important training supports have been put in place. I remain committed to ensuring that principals in all our primary schools are effectively supported in their roles and will certainly consider in great detail the report of the working group.</P>

      <P>There are currently 316 primary schools and 211 post-primary schools in disadvantaged areas included in the disadvantaged areas scheme. Primary schools included in the disadvantaged areas scheme receive the following supports: supplementary capitation funding of £30 per pupil; 95 per cent building grant; television licence refund; maximum class size of 29 pupils; and preferential funding rates under the school books rental scheme. Post-primary schools included in the disadvantaged areas scheme receive the following supports: supplementary capitation funding of £30 per pupil, and the allocation of 209 disadvantaged teaching posts to 190 of the schools in the disadvantaged areas.</P>
      <P>From the commencement of the current school year, the home/school/community liaison scheme has been extended to all first and second-level schools which have disadvantaged area status.</P>
      <P>In addition, strategies are in place which are designed to tackle educational disadvantage and retention at second level including the 8 to 15 initiative &ndash; a pilot programme aimed at developing models of good practice relating to retention with a view to their integration, after structured evaluation, into mainstream policy &ndash; and also the junior certificate school programme and the leaving certificate applied programme, which are programmes designed for students who find the normal certificate courses unsuitable. There are also education measures promoted by agencies outside my Department such as the Combat Poverty Agency area-based partnership companies which have contributed to the retention of young people within the formal education system.</P>
      <P>These measures are successful but have not represented a complete answer to this complex problem. I intend to introduce in the near future new arrangements which will enable targeted schools to tackle early school leaving.</P>
      <P>My Department is aware that it has been an issue of concern for the local drugs task forces that it is not represented on the task forces. My Department is also aware that an independent evaluation of the work of the local drugs task forces recommended that in view of the significant contribution it can make to their work, the Department of Education and Science should be represented on the LDTFs. It is my understanding that what the LDTFs require is a direct link to the Department's management so that educational issues arising in their areas can be addressed, resolved, explained or clarified as necessary. It is however acknowledged that my Department has no immediately identifiable structures on the ground through which this can be achieved.</P>
      <P>My Department is at present considering a number of options for the provision of representation on LDTFs with a view to having the matter resolved by the end of October 1999.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the findings of this report, which relies on the International Adult Literacy Survey published in 1997. The survey showed that 23 per cent of Irish adults scored at the bottom literacy level performing at best tasks which required the reader to locate a simple piece of information in a text, with no distracting information.</P>
      <P>The budget for adult literacy has been increased from a base of £850,000 prior to the Government taking office in 1997, to an annual budget of £5.665 million by the end of 1999. Following consultation with key interests, an adult literacy development fund was established to fund a range of pilot actions to inform future practice. The priorities identified for the fund were promotion of public awareness, outreach strategies to target those most in need, the establishment of referral networks on an area basis involving a wide range of local key actors, flexibility of timing of provision, and the development of a continuum from one to one voluntary tuition, to tuition in small groups, with the option of national certification. The number of clients catered has doubled to at least 10,000, referral networks have been developed and strengthened, and family literacy groups involving both adults and their children have been expanded. Open learning centres are being piloted, along with literacy groups for migrant women, travellers, and programmes for the unemployed in co-operation with the community employment scheme.</P>
      <P>FÁS welfare and employment services are working closely with vocational education committees ensure optimum co-operation to achieve the goals of the national employment action plan. Funding from my Department for the National Adult Literacy Agency has also been increased and has been used for awareness activities, enhanced links with other agencies, an increased focus on tutor training and support, training of tutors to support work-place literacy, and the development of quality standards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Staff development programmes are under way on a modular in-service basis in Waterford Institute of Technology for tutors and literacy organisers in co-operation with the National Adult Literacy Agency, leading to national certification from the National Council for Educational Awards. In addition, literacy programmes over the radio have been piloted and evaluated. Further expansion of radio and the use of television as a medium in literacy awareness promotion and literacy tuition are being explored. Progress in this area will be further strengthened in the context of the National <Col N="738" /> Development Plan and the planned publication of a White Paper on Adult Education.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department has been made aware by teachers and schools of concerns about the gradual accumulation, over a period of years, of unwanted chemicals which are no longer required for school work and also of chemicals in containers on which the labels are no longer present, and which cannot be identified. Responsibility for the management of their own chemical stocks and for ensuring the safety of students, staff and property rests with individual schools. My Department is co-operating with school management authorities in planning, developing and implementing a strategy to assist individual schools and teachers in dealing with the issue.</P>
      <P>In October 1996, my Department published a manual <i>Safety in School Science: A Code of Practice</i> and issued it to all schools. It contains general guidelines for best practice in school science, including a section on laboratory organisation and management which deals with matters such as storage, stock control and waste disposal. At the same time, my Department published a manual which it commissioned from Forbairt titled <i>Safety in the School Laboratory: Disposal of Chemicals</i>. This manual gives clear guidelines on the disposal of individual chemicals which are commonly found in school science laboratories. The manual explains how most of these chemicals may be safely disposed of in schools in accordance with the instructions given. My Department also contracted Forbairt to operate a help-line to further assist schools at that time.</P>
      <P>A questionnaire was issued to all second level schools asking them to identify and report on the amount of certain chemicals which are no longer required for school purposes and which could not be disposed of by the school in accordance with the guidelines given. The completed returns were collated and analysed by the curriculum development unit &ndash; CDU &ndash; of City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee. A report by CDU of this analysis was issued to all schools in February 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having regard to the results of the survey, my Department in conjunction with CDU and the Health and Safety Authority arranged for a training programme to further assist and advise all second level schools on disposal and storage issues. The programme was conducted in April and June 1998 for science teachers from all second level schools. It is envisaged that this <Col N="739" /> training programme will have enabled schools to further review their chemical stocks, to arrange for the safe storage of chemicals which will be required for future use and to arrange for the disposal of unwanted chemicals which can be disposed of safely in accordance with the guidelines already given. The curriculum development unit will update its data base of unwanted chemicals held by schools in the context of this further work.</P>
    <P>My Department has now established a pilot project in conjunction with the school management authorities and the Health and Safety Authority on the collection of unwanted chemicals which cannot be disposed of by schools themselves. A working group including representatives of my Department, the Health and Safety Authority and the school authorities has been established to oversee this pilot project. The pilot project is being carried out in a number of community and comprehensive schools in the Dublin area. Tenders have been accepted for the removal of unwanted chemicals from the schools concerned and it is expected that this stage of the pilot project will be completed by mid-November. Further elements of this strategy to assist schools in dealing with the issue will be developed based on the results of the pilot project and the development of the CDU data base.</P>

      <Quest>his Department's policy in relation to support services for deaf students; the funding, if any, he is providing for the training of sign language interpreters to assist deaf students to fully participate in education and training; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[20179/99]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <P>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin): All students are entitled to a response to their educational needs to ensure that they have available to them a level and quality of education which meets those needs. Students suffering disabilities are entitled to responses to their particular needs and my Departments engaged in putting such responses in place on an ongoing basis.</P>
    <P>At the primary and second levels, children with hearing impairment have access to a range of special education services. In some cases, the severity of the impairment may be such that placement in a special school or special class dedicated to children with hearing impairment is the most appropriate response. A range of such facilities is provided by my Department. At present, there are three special schools and 15 special classes at primary level catering for children with hearing impairment. All such facilities operate at a special pupil teacher ratio of 6:1 and attract special rates of capitation funding. In addition, there are three designated second level schools which cater for children with hearing impairment. <Col N="740" /> Additional teaching resources are allocated to these schools to support the pupils in question.</P>
    <P>In the particular case of St. Joseph's Special School for hearing impaired children in Cabra, Dublin, a pilot programme using Irish sign language is currently in operation and consideration will be given to extending this programme, if necessary, once the pilot phase has been completed. In some cases, a child with hearing impairment may be capable of functioning successfully in an integrated setting with an element of special support. Such support may be provided by the resource teacher service or the visiting teacher service. In addition, my Department provides funding to facilitate the purchase of specialised equipment to assist children with hearing impairment at first and second level to gain maximum benefit from the education system.</P>
    <P>At third level, the Universities Act, 1997, requires each university to prepare a statement of its equality policy addressing, inter alia, access of people who have a disability. Furthermore, the Higher Education Authority provides targeted funding to the universities for initiatives designed to promote access to, and participation in, higher education for students with disabilities. In 1998 a sum of £400,000 was made available for this purpose. Examples of initiatives funded to date, of particular relevance to deaf and hearing impaired students, include installation of loop systems, assistive technologies, counselling and other student support services &ndash; special alarm systems and staff training and awareness development.</P>
    <P>In addition, my Department operates a special fund for students with disabilities from which students with disabilities, including deaf and hearing impaired students, attending third level and post leaving certificate courses, may apply for assistance. The 1998 allocation to the fund was £250,000. Grants from the fund are made to students for the purchase of special equipment, special materials and technological aids, targeted interpreters and personal assistants.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy may be aware, I have announced details of a £6.9 million two year funding initiative to tackle educational disadvantage in the third level sector. Of this funding, £3 million is being specifically allocated to promote access to third level amongst students from disadvantaged backgrounds, including people with disabilities. My officials have had discussions with various interests such as the Higher Education Authority and the Association for Higher Education, Access and Disability in relation to this year's special fund, the arrangements for which are currently being finalised.</P>
    <P>In relation to the provision of courses for sign language interpreters, the National University of Ireland, Cork is currently concluding an interpreters course under the EU Horizon programme funded through the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. I understand that there are 12 students enrolled on this course. More general courses in sign language are offered <Col N="741" /> by Trinity College Dublin, Waterford Institute of Technology and National University of Ireland, Maynooth. The Higher Education Authority is currently examining a proposal from Trinity College, Dublin, to establish a centre for deaf studies and I understand that the authority is consulting with various interests in the field in relation to the proposal.</P>

      <P>I am very much aware of the situation in relation to the declining uptake of the physical science subjects at leaving certificate level. This situation is not unique to Ireland but reflects a trend which has been experienced in most countries of the developed world.</P>
      <P>The situation in Ireland is that the uptake of both physics and chemistry reached a peak of over 20 per cent of the leaving certificate cohort in the mid-1980s.

      <P>Last March I announced a wide-ranging initiative to address this issue. The initiative involves increased funding for school laboratories and equipment, comprehensive in-career development for teachers of physics and chemistry and the production of revised syllabi in leaving certificate physics and chemistry and junior certificate science.

It may not be feasible for each centre to have its own facility; (2) purchase of places in existing crèches, subject to a maximum of £50 per week per child for full sessions; (3) payment to childminders subject to the same maxima, subject to appropriate invoicing arrangements, compliance with registration requirements under the Childcare Act and satis<Col N="744" /> factory implementation of tax clearance arrangements.</P>
    <P>This investment is complemented by investment in childcare services by Area Development Management and by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
    <P>The latest figures available, taken at the end of June, 1999 showed that approximately 420 students on VTOS, Youthreach and Traveller programmes benefited from the measure. Feedback on the implementation of the measure indicates some difficulties in regard to the availability of cre±che facilities generally, rapidly rising childcare costs, and a shortage of childminders allied with fears of transferring from the black economy. My Department is examining these issues in consultation with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Area Development Management.</P>
    <P>The Green Paper on Adult Education recognises the need to improve access for adults returning to education, including removal of barriers such as the lack of availability of childcare. This issue will be further progressed in the context of developments under the National Development Plan and the White Paper on Adult Education.</P>

      <P>The reform of the second level curriculum began in the early 1990s with the phased introduction of revised junior certificate programmes in all areas. Congruent reform of the leaving certificate syllabuses is ongoing. To date, revised leaving certificate syllabuses have been introduced in eight subjects. At present, in-service of the c.4,000 teachers of leaving certificate English is in progress as a revised English syllabus will be examined for the first time in June, 2001. Revised syllabi will be introduced in physics and chemistry from September 2000. Work on the revision of other syllabi is well advanced and the remaining revised syllabi will be introduced on a phased basis from 2001 onwards</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Resourcing of the deepening of business-education links takes the following forms; (1) Work experience, usually of three weeks' duration, is part of the transition year programme, the leaving certificate vocational programme and the leaving certificate applied. This gives pupils the opportunity to experience the world of work and to reflect on that experience. Employers surveyed recently on their participation in work experience programmes with schools show broad satisfaction with these programmes. The majority of those <Col N="745" /> surveyed will take part again. Each transition year school receives a £50 per capita grant to cover this and other aspects of the programme. Each leaving certificate Applied school receives a <i>per capita </i>grant of £125. Each LCVP school and each leaving certificate applied school receives a .25 of a teacher allowance per 20 pupils taking the programme; (2) In collaboration with teachers, IBEC has designed a pack called Altramas, meaning fosterage in Irish, which aims to develop in students those personal, interpersonal and enterprise skills which will serve them well as they move from the school environment into the world of work; (3) the revised syllabus for leaving certificate business places a great deal of emphasis on the acquisition of entrepreneurial skills. Many schools integrate into their teaching of the revised syllabus <i>The Irish Times </i>Business 2000, which features case studies of leading Irish companies. Visits to the companies by pupils and visits by the companies to schools often form part of this  programme. This programme was devised in collaboration with my  Department's in-career development unit; (4) &ldquo;Enterprise Encounter&rdquo; is a resource devised by teachers for teachers of transition year pupils. It will also serve the needs of LCVP &ndash; Leaving Certificate Vocational Programme &ndash; and leaving certificate applied pupils. It focuses on small businesses and aims to create positive attitudes to enterprise, self-employment and innovation; and (5) Mini-companies, a form of work simulation, are part of most transition year programmes. They introduce students to the realities of the work-place in a safe environment. Some of the products of these companies are viable, a fact commented on by visitors to the mini-company trade fairs, a number of which are held every year.</P>
    <P>I am very satisfied with the effectiveness of links between IBEC and second level schools. The business and education links programme, established by IBEC, aims to help pupils to appreciate the world of business and contributes to the development of pupils' work skills by means of classroom talks, company visits and linked activities. Opportunities are also offered to teachers to spend time on placement within the company. A survey carried out on this programme showed that by the end of 1997, 84 link activities had taken place involving 21 companies, 42 schools and 1,583 students. Just under half the students involved were in transition year. The survey showed that 61 per cent of students involved were very satisfied with the experience, and 25 per cent moderately satisfied. Some 81 per cent of the companies which took part in the survey said they were very satisfied, while 14 per cent were moderately satisfied. Among the teachers, 57 per cent declared themselves very satisfied and 29 per cent moderately satisfied. IBEC is expanding this programme from year to year. There are currently 120 companies and 200 schools involved.</P>
    <P>In addition, my Department has contributed to developing education/business linkages either fin<Col N="746" /> ancially through the establishment of support services for the introduction of revised syllabi in business, accounting and through the transition year, LCA and LCVP support services or in kind through support given by relevant Department officers to all of these initiatives.</P>

      <P>I am very conscious of the importance of the role of science education in the context of our increasingly technological society and rapidly expanding economy. I have recently instituted a number of measures to further support the development of science education. The supports include (1) increased funding for school laboratories and equipment with an expenditure of £15 million over the three years 1990-2001; (2) comprehensive in-career development programme for teachers of physics and chemistry with 800 teachers of physics and chemistry receiving two and a half days' in-service in the current school year; (3) the secondment of 13 teachers of physics and chemistry on a full-time basis from September 1999 to support the in-career development programme; (4) a £10 <i>per capita </i>additional payment from September 1999 for pupils taking physics and chemistry at leaving certificate level; (5) an increase in the provision for pre-service training through a new degree programme for Science teachers at DCU; and (6) the production of revised syllabi in leaving certificate physics and chemistry and junior certificate science.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, section 17 of the Education Act, 1998 provides that the students in a recognised post-primary school may establish a student council in their school, and <Col N="747" /> that each board of management shall encourage the establishment of a student council and facilitate and give reasonable assistance to students in this venture. The rules for the establishment of a student council will be drawn up by the board of management in accordance with guidelines issued by me as Minister.</P>
      <P>I see the establishment of student councils as an important development in our second-level schools, recognising the important and indeed central role of students in our schools, and providing an opportunity for the development of a locally based democratic and transparent forum for the representation of student's views. I know from the recent speeches of members of this House during the debate on the Education (Welfare) Bill, that this sentiment is shared throughout this House.</P>
      <P>I am pleased therefore to be able to assure the Deputy that urgent consideration is being given to this matter. I intend to publish a paper on the establishment of student councils within a matter of weeks, which will be circulated widely, to allow for consultation with the partners in education. I will consider carefully the views and opinions raised during this consultation as I finalise the guidelines for the establishment of student councils.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied that there are suitable arrangements in place for the recognition in this State of teacher qualifications awarded in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>In this regard, a scheme of provisional recognition operates at primary level whereby individuals who are recognised as fully qualified primary teachers in the United Kingdom or other EU member states, may be appointed on a provisional basis to a post in a primary school for a period of three years in advance of acquiring the Irish language qualification. On attainment of the Irish language qualification, such teachers are then recognised as fully qualified primary teachers in this State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should point out that not all teachers who attain the B. Ed. standard in St Mary's College, Belfast, may be recognised as fully qualified for primary teaching in this jurisdiction; only those who have taken Irish as a main degree subject for the B.Ed. degree may be recognised as fully qualified. It has also been agreed in principle that <Col N="748" /> St. Mary's would organise a course in professional Irish for those of its students who wish to qualify to teach in the Republic but do not have Irish as a main B.Ed. degree subject. Students who successfully complete this course would also be fully recognised to teach in national schools in the Republic.</P>
    <P>Applications for similar recognition for their graduates from other teacher training colleges in Northern Ireland will be given full consideration by my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have received representations on behalf of Irish lecturers employed by Italian universities and my <Col N="750" /> Department has been following this matter closely. Of the 1,400 lecturers of non-Italian nationality employed by Italian universities, approximately 40 are Irish citizens. For some considerable time, they have encountered difficulties in relation to their contracts and conditions of employment. The European Commission is vested with responsibility for enforcing provisions of the treaties in cases such as these and, as the Deputy is aware, the Commission has now brought an action against Italy to the European Court of Justice, claiming that the Italian authorities had failed to uphold the principle of non-discrimination on grounds of nationality. While the Italian authorities have yet to respond fully to the allegation, the Commission contends that Italy is in infringement of article 48 of the EC Treaty.</P>
      <P>The situation of the 40 or so Irish citizens affected is, of course, also a matter of concern to my Department. Officials from the Irish permanent representation in Brussels have been in contact with the Commission to ascertain the full facts of the case and to discuss the procedures which will follow. The Commission has already issued a letter of notification, dated 9 July 1998, followed up by a reasoned opinion, dated 28 January 1999, and still contends that the matter complained of has not been remedied. It is now pursuing the matter in the European Court of Justice. Although any member state may apply to intervene in these proceedings, such intervention is rare.</P>
      <P>At present I am fully satisfied that the commission is fulfilling the role assigned to it by the treaties in bringing this action before the European Court of Justice.</P>
      <P>The question of a direct approach to the Italian authorities, in concert with the governments of other EU member states whose nationals are similarly affected, has been considered. However, as the matter is one of exercising a right of equal treatment under the EU treaties, it would seem appropriate not to take up the matter as a bilateral Ireland-Italy issue, but rather to take advantage of the remedies set out in the treaties for persons whose rights are infringed. The right of the foreign lecturers to equal treatment with Italians derives from their status as EU citizens, and the protection of that right should similarly be afforded in an EU framework.</P>

      <P>This applicant applied to join the scheme under the joint management arrangement with her spouse.</P>
      <P>It is a condition of the scheme that in a joint management application, a participant or a participant's spouse on reaching their 66th birthday must apply to the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs for both the contributory and non-contributory old age pension. If such a pension is awarded it must be offset against the farm retirement pension. Evidence of the application and the reply from that Department must be submitted to my Department before payment of the farm retirement pension can be issued.</P>
      <P>This applicant's spouse has reached 66 years of age and has been informed of this requirement by letter. When the necessary reply from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs is submitted the application for the farm retirement pension can be processed and payment made backdated to 8 February 1999, the date of valid application.</P>

      <P>Where a child inherits from a parent and has received no previous gifts or inheritances from any source since 2 December 1988, a tax free threshold of £192,900 applies. In the case of a brother or sister, the tax free threshold of £25,720 applies. However, possible hardship is taken into account by the Revenue Commissioners when determining the terms of payment of capital acquisitions tax where the threshold is exceeded, for example, payment by instalment may be arranged, and tax may be postponed in certain cases.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the tax burden facing certain individuals, particularly on the inheritance of the family home where they have been residing. I refer the Deputy to what I said in the House in response to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 371, 372 and 392 on 29 September. In those replies I indicated that in the context of the forthcoming budget, I am examining the capital acquisitions tax code in some detail.</P>
      <P>The forecasted yield for 1999 from inheritance tax alone is about £83 million. This revenue greatly assists the Government's programme and helps achieve the ongoing goal of reducing the tax take on employment incomes. For this reason, any significant changes to the tax must be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 127 and 128 together.</P>
      <P>The payment of subvention is governed by the Health (Nursing Homes) Act 1990, which came into effect on 1 September 1993. It had been hoped to increase the rates of subvention this year but it has not been possible to do so as substantial additional funding in excess of £9 million has had to be provided to meet the rising costs of the scheme. The additional expenditure is due to a number of factors such as the increase in the number of people in receipt of subventions, their higher levels of dependency, resulting in more people receiving the higher rates of subventions, and the change in regulations whereby the ability of adult sons and-or daughters over 21 years of age to contribute is no longer taken into account. The amount made available for the scheme this year is £33 million. Any possible increase in the subvention rate next year will depend on budgetary circumstances and competing priorities at the time.</P>

The purpose of this measure was to enhance the PRSI status of community employment workers and to put them on a par with other class A workers in so far as social insurance entitlements are concerned.</P>
      <P>In the case of persons who qualify or re-qualify for unemployment benefit their earnings in the relevant tax year will determine whether or not they receive a graduated rate or the full rate of unemployment benefit. Persons entitled to a reduced or graduated rate of unemployment benefit are entitled to claim unemployment assistance if it is more beneficial to them. However, long-term unemployment assistance is not payable where the claimant is entitled to full rate unemployment benefit.</P>
      <P>I have explained to the House on many occasions that I am not in a position to introduce special concessionary arrangements for CE workers who qualify for unemployment benefit without having equal regard to the position of other short-term social welfare payment recipients. Any such concessions could only be considered in light of available resources and in the light of other priorities.</P>

      <P>The school meals scheme is a statutory scheme which assists in the provision of free school meals to certain children attending national schools in specified areas. My Department has no function in initiating school meals programmes in schools. This Department's function is confined to reimbursing local authorities up to a maximum of 50 per cent of their expenditure on the provision of such meals and approving participation in the scheme.</P>
      <P>There are no proposals to extend the scheme to include community workshops which already receive capitation fees, training allowances, and assistance towards travel expenses from the Department of Health and Children. Widening the scope of the scheme would result in increased expenditure for both my Department and the local authorities which could only be considered in a budgetary context.</P>
      <P>However, a review of the school meals scheme has recently commenced as part of my Department's series of programme expenditure evaluations and the administration of the scheme and how it should be targeted will be examined in that context.</P>

Resource teachers may, as part of their work, be required to teach the full primary curriculum to the pupils to whom they are assigned and it is therefore necessary that they be competent to teach each aspect of it.

This said, I have asked my officials to review such circumstances as may allow for greater flexibility in the qualifications required of resource teachers.</P>

Anuraidh d'iarr an Roinn seo agamsa ar an Údarás um Ard-Oideachais dul i gcomhairle leis na hollscoileanna maidir le cúrsaí lóistín do mhic léinn.

      <P>Is é an cur chuige atá agam i gcás deon-<Col N="766" /> taisí cothaithe ná cloí leis an modh imeachta a bhí ann le blianta anuas, is é sin deontaisí cothaithe tríú leibhéal a mhéadú de réir an ráta boilscithe a bhunaítear ar athrú an Consumer Price Index ó lár Feabhra bliana amháin go lár Feabhra na bliana dar gcionn.</P>
      <P>Mar a thuigfidh an Teachta, is gá pé feabhsú a déanfear ar na scéimeanna tacaíochta do mhic léinn a chur i gcomhthéacs bacanna ar acmhainní i gcoitinne agus brúanna eile sa chóras oideachais. Chuir mé in iúl cheana go bhfuil sé i gceist agam déileáil leis na haimhrialtachtí nó na hábhair frith-spreagúil is mó i scéim na ndeontas sar a thugaim faoi cheist ghinearálta leibhéal deontaisí agus teorainn ioncaim.</P>
      <P>Sa chás, is é is túisce dom mar sprioc ná cloí leis an ngeallúint a tugadh sa Chlár Rialtais An Action Programme for the Millenniun tacaíocht ar bhonn cothrom a thabhairt do na mic léinn sin atá ag tabhairt faoi chúrsaí PLC. Tá cloíte agam leis na ngeallúint sin mar gur chuireas ar fáil scéim Deontaisí Cothaithe do mhic léinn atá i mbun chúrsai PLC ó 1998/99 amach.</P>
      <P>D'fhógair mé freisin go bhfaigheadh gach mac léinn lan-fhásta a bheadh i dteidil a leithéid an ráta deontais frith-chongarach níos airde fós. Bhíos buartha ach go háirithe i dtaobh mic léinn lán-fhásta, agus iad siúd atá neamhspleách ach go háirithe, i gcomhthéacs an ráta deontais a íocfaí. Meastar go gcosnóidh an feabhsú seo £2.4m. as seo go ceann dhá bhliain.</P>

      <P>A major objective of schools IT 2000 is to facilitate the integration of ICT into teaching and learning in primary schools. I have already outlined, on a number of previous occasions, the excellent progress that has been made to date with regard to the development of ICT infrastructure and the training of teachers. In order to further assist the achievement of this objective my Department, with the NCTE, is commissioning an expert study to consider current and future technology infrastructure options for schools. This will consider, <i>inter alia, </i>equipment selection, wiring and deployment of equipment options for primary schools. This study, which will commence in the very near future, will guide the continuing implementation of the technology integration initiative &ndash; TII &ndash; and will be updated on a regular basis.</P>

      <P>The proposal to which the Deputy refers has been considered by my Department.</P>
      <P>In normal circumstances, pupils leave the special school system at the end of the school year in which they reach their eighteenth birthday. In certain circumstances, such as in the case of a pupil studying for State examinations, my Department may sanction an additional year in a special school. However, it is generally the case that where suitable alternative educational provision is available to the students, an additional year would not be sanctioned.</P>
      <P>The proposal to which the Deputy refers centred on allowing an additional year's attendance at the special school for five particular students who would normally have left the school at the end of the last school year. As there is a vocational training centre on the same campus and the programme proposed by the school for these students was similar to the service available at the vocational training centre, it was considered that a general introduction of an additional year's attendance at the special school would constitute a duplication of existing supports.</P>
      <P>However, the particular needs of each of the students in question were reviewed by my Department and arising from this review, three of the five pupils were granted an additional year in the school based on their individual special educational needs.</P>

      <P>In 1996-97, the student support schemes were extended to provide maintenance grants to eligible students following certain full-time under-graduate courses of at least two years' duration in another EU member state. The extension of the schemes at that time did not include courses at post-graduate level and accordingly, there is no grant aid available for students pursuing post-graduate studies abroad.</P>
      <P>Any extension of the current arrangements to provide for students pursuing post-graduate courses abroad could only be considered in the light of available resources and other competing demands within the education sector.</P>
