    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 29, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The Good Friday Agreement provides us with the best opportunity for securing lasting peace and stability in Northern Ireland. It is the foundation on which democratic institutions can be provided, equality and rights can be guaranteed and people can be allowed live in peace and security. The best hopes for the future of Northern Ireland depends on the successful implementation of the Agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The review of the implementation of the Agreement, which is being chaired by Senator <Col N="5" /> Mitchell, takes as its starting point three principles: an inclusive Executive exercising devolved power; decommissioning of all paramilitary arms by May 2000; and decommissioning to be carried out in a manner determined by the International Commission on Decommissioning.</P>
    <P>The aim of the review is to determine how to overcome the difficulties which exist in the practical implementation of those principles and this is its only focus. I firmly believe that these difficulties can be overcome. Our overriding objective is to implement the will of the people of this island, as expressed in referendums last year, and we will continue to work with the British Government and the pro-Agreement parties to achieve that objective.</P>
    <P>On a visit to London on 6 September last, I met with Prime Minister Blair in Downing Street to discuss issues relating to the Mitchell Review. Prime Minister Blair and I, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Dr. Mowlam, have been in close contact with Senator Mitchell and the pro-Agreement parties in the days and weeks leading up to, and since, the commencement of the Review. At all times we have stressed the reality that political progress in Northern Ireland and the successful implementation of the Agreement depend on the willing co-operation of the parties to overcome the difficulties that exist. I believe that we can find a way through, and that the parties believe that the Agreement is our best chance to achieve a lasting and secure peace. The position regarding further meetings with the Prime Minister will be kept under review.</P>
    <P>I did receive a request for a meeting from Dr. Paisley and I shall meet him tomorrow to discuss issues relating to property of the Free Presbyterian Church in this State, in County Monaghan.</P>
    <P>Regarding the status of the IRA ceasefire, in the context of a number of worrying incidents over the summer months that have been attributed to the IRA, I would like to assure the House that the Government is continuing to monitor the ceasefires of all the paramilitary organisations, in close consultation with the British Government. I utterly condemn the murder of Charles Bennett and the activity of paramilitary organisations, particularly intimidation and punishment beatings and the continuing sectarian attacks in Antrim and Down, and I welcome Mr Trimble's condemnation yesterday of loyalist violence. However, in the round, I concur with the Secretary of State's judgment that, although these matters are of the gravest concern, the IRA ceasefire has not broken down. On the question of what constitutes a breach of the ceasefire, the two Governments are kept fully briefed on security matters by the security forces, North and South. In judging whether parties are adhering to the commitments they made, fine political judgments must be made, looking at all the evidence in the round, and it is for the Governments to make those judgments. It is vital now that all sides focus on the review that is currently under <Col N="6" /> way. Every effort must be made to ensure that the conditions are put in place that will copper-fasten lasting peace and stability. There has been real progress in recent years and we must not underestimate the benefits that the ceasefires have brought. A political agreement is the only way to ensure that the tragedies of the past are not repeated.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the issues of decommissioning and the formation of an inclusive Executive are being considered within the framework of the Mitchell review that is currently under way. My comments of I8 July reflected an apprehension that, as specific deadlines in the Agreement had not been kept and following on from that, some parties might foresee some difficulty in achieving other deadlines. It is now for the parties, under the review, to agree a mutually acceptable way forward that is in line with the Agreement, including centrally on this issue.</P>
    <P>The Irish Government warmly welcomed the Report of the Independent Commission on Policing, chaired by Chris Patten. I thank Chris Patten and his colleagues for all their hard work in completing what was a very complex and demanding task. I recognise that policing, in the context of the deep divisions in Northern Ireland and the sacrifices that have been made, is an emotive issue and I appreciate that, for many, some of the proposed changes are difficult to accept. However, I believe that the commission's recommendations address, in a balanced way, a broad range of important and sensitive issues. The recommendations aimed at promoting and strengthening co-operation between the police forces on both sides of the Border are welcome and have the full support of the Governments. I hope that, following the consultation process on the implementation of the recommendations which follow on from the very detailed terms of reference given to the commission under the Agreement, implementation proceeds rapidly. In this regard, I welcome the proposal to appoint an oversight commissioner who will be responsible for ensuring that the changes proposed are implemented in a comprehensive and effective way.</P>
    <P>I met with representatives of the Garvaghy Road Residents' Coalition on Thursday, 9 September last. We discussed the situation in Portadown and recent mediation initiatives. It remains our view that any resolution of the problems arising in Portadown must be based on agreement flowing from meaningful dialogue, and that in any determination the Parades Commission must take into account all the criteria set out in legislation, including disruption to the life of the community and the impact of the parade on relations within the community.</P>
    <P>I met with the Justice for the Forgotten group on 22 April 1999 and reported on that meeting to this House in my reply of 12 May. On that occasion I informed the group that the recommendations of the victims commissioner, the former Tánaiste, Mr. John Wilson, would have to be <Col N="7" /> taken into account as the Government had put the Dublin and Monaghan bombings under his remit. Following publication of Mr. Wilson's report, the interdepartmental committee met with the Justice for the Forgotten group to discuss the recommendations set out in the report regarding the Dublin-Monaghan bombings. I would like here, in this House, to thank Mr. Wilson for all his work in undertaking such a difficult task and for preparing such an excellent, comprehensive report.</P>
    <P>As Deputies may be aware, Mr. Wilson, in the case of the Dublin-Monaghan bombings, recommended that an independent private inquiry be carried out by a former Supreme Court judge. Mr. Wilson set out detailed terms of reference for the inquiry and recommended that the report of the inquiry be published.</P>
    <P>In the case of Seamus Ludlow, Mr. Wilson also recommended that an independent private inquiry be carried out by a former Supreme Court judge but, in order not to compromise any criminal prosecution, this inquiry should not publish its report.</P>
    <P>The Government, at its meeting yesterday, agreed to accept Mr. Wilson's recommendations on these cases and also to inquire into the bombing in Dundalk. After some further consultations, the inquiries will be established as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>On the issue of a future role for the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, this is not a matter for me or the Government but for the chairperson and all the participating parties. I have previously said here that, in the context of the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, I would see the role that was played by the forum as being more appropriately fulfilled by institutions and arrangements provided for in the Agreement. Accordingly, at this time I believe that it would be best to await the outcome of the review before deciding on the future of the forum.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach said on 18 July that he thought some of the paramilitary organisations who are obliged to decommission their weapons before May 2000 might have difficulty doing so. Which paramilitaries did he have in mind and is he still of that opinion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>During the talks at the end of June and in early July, Sinn Féin representatives indicated to me that they could run into severe difficulty, if there were further delays, in holding to the May 2000 deadline. My reference, therefore, was to Sinn Féin. It is the view of General John de Chastelain in recent days, and I support it, that May 2000 has to hold. He believes that full decommissioning of arms and not partial decommissioning is still achievable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it the Taoiseach is now aligning his position with that of General de Chastelain and no longer holds the view he <Col N="8" /> expressed on 18 July. I welcome that. Does the Taoiseach believe the killing of Charles Bennett constituted a breach of the IRA ceasefire?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the first matter, I was, as I try to do on these issues, relaying what people say and not whether I agree with them. As it happens, I did not agree with that one; May 2000 must hold. However, when a party of probably the most significant paramilitary group states it might have difficulties, I must relay that. General de Chastelain is the person best placed to state the position and I agree with what he says.</P>
      <P>The horrific murder in early August was a deplorable act. The Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, stated as much on behalf of the Government on that occasion and many times subsequently during her many meetings in Northern Ireland. It was incompatible with normal democratic life. The Government supported the judgment of the Secretary of State &ndash; with whom it was in close contact throughout that period &ndash; that while it was to be utterly and absolutely condemned, broke all democratic principles and certainly was not in line with the Mitchell principles, in the round, however, it was not a breakdown of the ceasefire. I also concur with the Secretary of State's remarks that it was close to a breakdown.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>This has been explained by the Secretary of State and by the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, and I concur with their views. Under the Northern Ireland Sentences Review Act, when there is consideration of the ceasefire breaking down, all aspects of it are to be taken into account: whether the paramilitary movement concerned has abandoned the ceasefire, if it is likely to go back to war, if it is the intent of the entire organisation, if it can be taken that it no longer subscribes to the Mitchell principles or, at least, its political wing subscribes to the Mitchell principles and if the organisation is unlikely to make an effort to hold the ceasefire together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Secretary of State did not make the judgment without having a meeting with Sinn Féin at which she forcibly condemned what had happened and stated that she believed it was the IRA. I must caution that there are cases still outstanding, as she said, but that was her judgment and I will go with her statement. She concluded, however, that while these terrible deeds happened &ndash; and she deplored them in the strongest terms &ndash; she still believed the leadership of Sinn Féin and the leadership of those it influences had not broken the ceasefire and would continue to work. She forcibly asked the political movements, particularly Sinn Féin, as we have done since &ndash; the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy O'Donnell, made a statement at that time &ndash; to control in so far as they <Col N="9" /> can &ndash; and, hopefully, that is completely &ndash; people who carry out such deeds.</P>

      <P>I have two specific questions representative of the range of questions I have on the clár if you will allow me to put them separately to the Taoiseach.  First, an aontaíonn an Taoiseach gurb é bealach na síochána bealach Shinn Féin i gcónaí? Does the Taoiseach acknowledge that Sinn Féin is committed to entirely peaceful and democratic means? Does he agree that since the failure of the Ulster Unionist Party to nominate Ministers to the Executive on 15 July a very serious situation has existed, a situation that, I contend, threatens the very existence of the Good Friday Agreement? Does he accept that what is needed now is a very clear focus by both Governments and all who support the Agreement, including, I hope, all parties in this House, to ensure that the anti-Agreement forces within unionism are not allowed to succeed in overturning the wishes of the overwhelming majority of the people of both islands?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>In these times, a Cheann Comhairle, I accept that Sinn Féin is committed to the Mitchell principles and ensuring that we can move forward in a peaceful way. Hopefully the Good Friday Agreement can be implemented but it will need everybody's assistance; 15 July was not a very good day, but we must move on. It is a process and I hope that Sinn Féin and all the other parties, particularly the pro-Agreement parties, can help Senator Mitchell in the review and the two Governments to find a way forward. Deputy Ó Caoláin knows that everyone will have to play a part in that. Senator Mitchell does not have a magic wand; neither have I. Even all the energy that all of us can put in will not solve these issues. We all must stretch to the limit our understanding of each other's position to find a resolution, and I am sure the Deputy and Sinn Féin will do that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin:</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, very briefly on the specific focus of Questions Nos. 4 and 5, I asked the Taoiseach whether he is aware of the great distress of the families of the victims and survivors of the Dublin/Monaghan bombings and also the family of Seamus Ludlow, and their deep disappointment? While I wish to be associated with the commendation of former Tánaiste, John Wilson, on the work he carried out heading the Victims Commission, nevertheless there is great disappointment at the section of the report of the commission recommending privately conducted inquiries into these cases. Indeed, there is quite an amount of disquiet over this and I note the Taoiseach's indication of a decision of the Cabinet yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I make a further appeal here today as there is unquestionably a view not unrelated to the series of points that have been exposed by Don Mullan and others in their work over recent years that the reason, or part of the reason, for the resist<Col N="10" /> ance to public scrutiny of the Dublin/Monaghan bombings are the Garda/British intelligence contacts; they are preventing a full tribunal of inquiry. I have raised this before in the House and the Taoiseach is aware of the situation and the concerns&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>This is very important matter. I and other Deputies have paid a great deal of attention to it over a long number of years. I have been at several meetings and I know members of political parties here have taken a deep interest in this issue. I am trying to move it to a situation that has not existed before. To do that, the recommendation of Commissioner Wilson was that we must try to establish the facts and that somebody must look at all the available papers to see whether there are sufficient grounds for an inquiry. I do not think the victims or their legal representatives disagree with this view because they have been working with the interdepartmental group to try to establish an inquiry. To set up an inquiry, we must inquire into some evidence and facts. If we moved into a position where, as is believed by everybody, people outside the State were involved in this matter, moved in for this purpose, and if these events happened, we would not have witnesses to call. We do not have the people who drove the cars or the people who parked the vans. We have none of these people and we do not have a great deal of evidence, as I have said.</P>
      <P>However, there is some evidence and the advice of Mr. Wilson is that we would get a Supreme Court judge or a former Supreme Court judge to examine all the evidence in three of these cases &ndash; the Dublin-Monagahan case, the Seamus Ludlow case and the Dundalk bombing case &ndash; to see whether there is sufficient evidence to build an inquiry. That process must take place first &ndash; that has certainly been the legal advice and I do not think it is disputed.</P>
      <P>To take the other view of setting up an inquiry with practically nothing prepared will not get us very far. I hope that during the process with the Supreme Court judge, contact with the legal representatives of the victims can be maintained. What other way can the Government try to achieve an outcome to this very difficult issue? I hope people can support this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have spent many days during the summer discussing this matter with legal people, in the main, who say that to go the other route would be a &ldquo;needle in the haystack&rdquo; syndrome. I do not want to be seen to set up something which will only achieve that. A Supreme Court judge will be appointed and will examine and discuss all papers and documents in relation to these matters. If <Col N="11" /> there is a basis for an inquiry, we will move in that direction.</P>
    <P>Of course, Mr. Wilson has made a distinction between the two cases. He has said that the report in the Seamus Ludlow case should not be published because of criminal prosecutions but that the evidence in the Dublin-Monaghan case should be published.</P>

      <P>I have a number of supplementary questions, the first of which relates to the position in regard to the ceasefire. Are the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister still of the view that the position of the IRA represented a seismic shift, as reported or opined by the Prime Minister in July, in relation to decommissioning? Is the Taoiseach of the view that that position has been maintained and that, as a consequence, a successful outcome to the review of the Agreement, currently being conducted by Senator Mitchell, is in prospect?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>If we had been able to get total clarity on that issue, we may not have had the difficulties we had in the early days of July. Prime Minister Blair and I believed that what we were told was the seismic shift. We set up meetings with the Unionist Party and Sinn Féin in order that they could speak to each other. Those discussions took place in a friendly manner and I believe people were being truthful and honest. However, the reality is that the Ulster Unionist Party did not see the certainty and clarity we saw. They heard the message but could not be certain of it and I accept that is their position. I do not think it was bad faith or misunderstanding on anyone's part, it is merely that the manner in which things are said and heard within parties is not the way things always are.</P>
      <P>To reply to the Deputy's question, the issue must be made even clearer now. While it may be clear to me, it must also be clear to the Ulster Unionist Party. That position must be made clearer in the review and I know that is an issue which Senator Mitchell will explore. On the other side, the UUP must make it absolutely clear to Sinn Féin that if that happens and if the issue they are stating is made clear, they will move on the institutional issues. It is <i>quid pro quo.</i></P>

      <P>All summer, through a number of public meetings and many private meetings <Col N="12" /> between the parties &ndash; they are now in the public domain so they are not that private &ndash; we have been trying to build up trust and confidence. The issue is one of belief. Things are said and heard but the question is whether people believe them on each side. That is continuing under the Mitchell review. There have been a few very successful meetings, not to conclusions but at least undoing many of the difficulties that arose out of Castle Buildings and 15 July, on all sides. I do not want, in any way, to purport blame because that is a hopeless exercise but to try to build up confidence again. I believe that a little more strengthening and clarification of what was on the table, so to speak, on both sides will bring about a major shift, but it must be clearly understood, as must timings. I do not wish to be over-optimistic or over-pessimistic &ndash; it would be wrong to be either &ndash; but there is the possibility. What we are doing and what the Secretary of State, Mo Mowlam, and the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, have been doing with the parties is trying to develop that over recent weeks, with some success.</P>

        <b>: </b> Is the Taoiseach concerned that while a peace process is supposed to be developing in the North there is, unfortunately, growing evidence that the communities are being more and more polarised? Does the Taoiseach agree that it is not a peace process if it involves merely politicians at the top who are, after all, based on forces that are based on sectarian divisions in society? It is not a peace process unless it involves moves towards real conciliation at the base of society and particularly in working class communities. Is the Taoiseach aware from reports that while the process has been going on working class areas are becoming more and more segregated? Throughout Northern Ireland the bunting, graffiti and murals that are springing up everywhere mark out, more and more, territory that is either exclusively Catholic or exclusively Protestant. Does the Taoiseach agree that is a very worrying development which needs to be changed by involving people in the process? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the Dublin and Monaghan bombings and the aspirations of the families of the victims, has the Taoiseach been shown evidence that British military intelligence may have been involved in those atrocities and, if so, will he <Col N="13" /> undertake to publish the evidence? Does the Taoiseach agree that because of these allegations, any inquiry should be in public rather than behind closed doors?</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Sectarianism in any form, North or South, is a bad thing and has to be condemned. We have seen some of that in our own jurisdiction this year. Of course, the difficulties of people being burned out of their homes and forced out of estates is still very worrying. In the Garvaghy Road and the surrounding areas we have seen that. We have also seen it in attacks of SDLP members in Lurgan, Antrim and Down. This year the intimidation, particularly against SDLP people, must be condemned. Over this winter we must try to find some basis for a model and dialogue on the marches because most of these issues, in one form or another, emanate from marches. This year, thankfully, so far we have not had too much difficulty with marches but there have been some difficulties. More than 3,000 marches have taken place so far, and there will be about 300 between now and Christmas. They are all potentially very difficult, but there be some understandingin that regard because out of them comes hatred, bigotry and secretarianism. However, if people were to engage directly with each other, perhaps we could make more progress. That still remains the difficulty, but many initiatives are still going on, although many others have failed.</P>
      <P>On the better side of things, there were very few incidents in the marches, except perhaps on the Lower Ormeau Road, and Apprentice Boys' march into Derry. Unfortunate events surrounded that and some heavy handed activities by the RUC that morning did not help the day; that evening there was thuggery by people who had no interest in any peace process or anything else other than breaking the law. There has been a big decline this year &ndash; probably by more than a third &ndash; in various violent activities. We must be grateful for that as we move into the autumn of 1999, but we still have to deal with sectarianism. It is sad that in 1999 people are burned, threatened, intimidated and forced to leave their homes because of their religious belief and for no other reason but, unfortunately, that continues to happen.</P>
      <P>I am not sure to which estate the Deputy was referring but there is one estate in Northern Ireland that was built for the Nationalist community as an extension of an area some years ago but now only a handful of Nationalists remain in it; that is quite extraordinary. Along the peace line many loyalists have been driven out of their homes &ndash; and that still happens. There are many community, trade union and religious groups working across the divide like never before to improve on this initiative. UNISON and many other groups are making successful progress and we have to support their endeavours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the Dublin/Monaghan bombings, <Col N="14" /> I have said what I have said. I should correct myself on one matter. The reason I did not name the Supreme Court judge is that it not easy at present to have a retired Supreme Court judge or a Supreme Court judge for that matter. It might have to go to a High Court judge or an eminent legal person but, hopefully, a High Court judge. I just wanted to correct that. I hope that we can make successful progress on this. The Deputy was correct in saying that some papers have been looked at and many things have been said, but it would be better if an eminent legal person were to look at all this first and then publish whatever he or she were to find.</P>

It is not much good for amateurs to be looking at these things. That has been happening for the last 25 years and if we are to get anywhere, and, as I said before, if an eminent legal person, hopefully a Supreme Court judge, could substantiate enough grounds to have a tribunal and issue a report, then so be it. That is what the Government will do, but we cannot start from scratch. One cannot set up a tribunal into something that is very narrow.

The Taoiseach said that the Unionists heard the message but could not be certain about it and that a bit more strength of what was on the table could be clarified in regard to the matter.

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>We are looking at the Patten proposals in terms of the totality of what we have to do. I will certainly look at the points made by the Deputy. The issue for many of the five days was how decommissioning could be dealt with, how it could happen and in what order. It is clear to everybody that decommissioning will not happen until the institutions are in place. In the event that the institutions are put in place and the UUP take the opportunity, the considerable risk, what would happen if there is no delivery on decommissioning? What was debated in those long hours and days was precisely how that could happen, how long it would take and in what way it would happen. The message we were hearing was that it would happen under General John de Chastelain in a way agreed and set out by him which would lead to the issue being satisfactorily dealt with. The problem was that there was no certainty. David Trimble said last week or the week before that while he heard that part of the message he also heard that we may not succeed. I have to be fair in these matters. The problem is that while one hears the story, there is a proviso, &ldquo;Sorry, I might not be able to do it after we make the agreement&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>There has to be certainty. I tried at the time, it was not that we did not see it. I brought the two sides together. I asked Sinn Féin if it would meet the negotiating body of the UUP and it did. I asked Sinn Féin if it would meet all the elected representatives of the UUP and it agreed but the offer was not taken up. We have therefore moved a long way. It was a pity, Sinn Féin having moved to that extent &ndash; meeting the negotiating body of the UUP to explain its position and Martin McGuinness being prepared to make a presentation to the entire party &ndash; the parties concerned were a long way apart in terms of how the messages were received. Without getting into the nuts and bolts which I do not want to do because the matter will be taken up another day, that explains where we are at.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his very helpful response. Would it be fair to say that the commitments given by Sinn Féin on decommissioning were adequate but that the problem was that it did not appear to have the authority to make those statements in a fashion that would bind anybody to deliver on them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>As with any leadership, when one makes an agreement, one does one's best to implement it. When Martin McGuinness took up his position on the decommissioning body on behalf of Sinn Féin in September last year he did so in good faith. I think he did it to work under that process &ndash; under the international decommissioning body &ndash; to achieve the situation that Sinn Féin agreed to, which is that there would be decommissioning by May 2000. I do not know precisely, and it is not much good speculating, how the leadership of Sinn Féin would go about bringing that through the entire republican fam<Col N="16" /> ily, but I assume from all I have heard and learnt that it would not be easy. I think people were being honest on the Sinn Féin side in saying: &ldquo;We will do our utmost&rdquo;. I do not think they said it as a way out, and the interpretation that they did so is unfair. I think they genuinely would have gone through the processes necessary to achieve this.</P>
      <P>Equally, I understand that if David Trimble was to go back some months later &ndash; I do not want to get into times or spans &ndash; that would be a matter for General John de Chastelain. Some of the comments about a week and a day were entirely unhelpful because the Sinn Féin leadership never agreed to a week or a day. There were spins going out that were entirely unhelpful, untruthful and dishonest because Sinn Féin never agreed to these things. Of course they were creating difficulties for Sinn Féin, which was right in those matters because it never agreed to these things. David Trimble could have found himself agreeing to a position and then, some months later, he had nothing. He had set up the Executive in Northern Ireland, everything was working and nothing was going to happen on the other matters. It is not that I agree, it has nothing to do with me agreeing or disagreeing, but I can understand the positions. I still believe &ndash; I do not think this was fully understood in the early part of the summer &ndash; that these gentlemen are nearer than people think. It is not easy but I still think that we are not many miles apart.</P>

I also wish to raise the inquiry into the Dublin and Monaghan bombings announced by the Taoiseach following yesterday's Cabinet meeting. I take it this inquiry does not include an earlier bombing in Dublin, namely, that in Sackville Place. Has consideration been given to including the Sackville Place bombing in the inquiry? If so, why will there not be an inquiry into this matter? Why has it been omitted?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>If I can I wish to finish on the issue raised by Deputy Quinn. There were three principles on which we were working and which we set down on that occasion, namely, that the parties would re-affirm the three principles agreed on 25 June, a week earlier: an inclusive executive exercise and devolved powers, decommissioning of all paramilitary arms by May 2000 and decommissioning to be carried out in a manner determined by the international commission on decommissioning. There were three very specific items and, while there was discussion about how the third one would happen, it was a matter to be determined. It was not in any way a grey area &ndash; the issues were very clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>I put it to the Taoiseach that part of the difficulty that was reflected by Mr. Trimble and others was that while the British Prime Minister and the Taoiseach were clear they had heard a seismic shift and were convinced of a change in the position on what has been a net point going back a number of years, namely, arms and <Col N="18" /> decommissioning, no written indication of that was transferred from Sinn Féin to the Ulster Unionist Party, and that still remains the position. Is that a correct understanding?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but not to the detail about which Deputy Quinn is talking. In reply to Deputy Flanagan's question, I think the review will go on a little longer than people thought. However, I ask Deputies not to ask me to specify how long I think that will be. Originally, at the end of July, we said the end of September, that is tomorrow. My judgment is that it will go on into a good part of October. In relation to the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, there was no consideration of the Sackville Place bombings which I recall. They had not been mentioned at all. The bombings in Dundalk had been mentioned but had not been included in recommendations by Mr. Wilson. The Cabinet decided to include those because there had been many representations from the people and religious groups in Dundalk over a long number of years. I am sure if issues arise concerning these matters in the course of looking at the records the justice will conclude on them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie:</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise two matters with the Taoiseach. In relation to the Patten report, does he agree that, while ideally the creation of new institutions in Northern Ireland, particularly a partnership sharing government and the creation of an acceptable police service supported by both traditions in Northern Ireland, should go hand in hand, if there is to be any delay in relation to the new institutions the creation of an acceptable police service is so fundamental that implementation of the Patten report should go ahead? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the first day of the new Dáil session I wish to raise again the issue of the disappeared. Will the Taoiseach take the opportunity to inform the general public, particularly the relatives of the disappeared, that despite the events of the summer and, in most instances, the fruitless and frustrating digging which took place, the Government and the Garda will be totally unremitting in searching for the bodies of the disappeared and that those disappeared will include those who <Col N="19" /> were not on the IRA list, such as Charlie Armstrong and Gerry Evans from Crossmaglen? Will the Taoiseach please give an assurance that the efforts will be totally unremitting and that the digging will start again if the slightest additional evidence is forthcoming?</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the Patten report, of course it stands that a good policing force is required one way or another; the difficulty is in the implementation of the report. It is part of the Good Friday Agreement that the police authority would include members of the Assembly represented in the same way as d'Hondt &ndash; proportionately within the authority. That is a good thing. There would be grave difficulties, however, in trying to get it all working as envisaged by Mr. Patten without the other institutional aspects of the Good Friday Agreement.</P>

I remind Deputies that the temporary arrangements for setting time limits for Priority and Ordinary Questions, agreed by resolution of the Dáil on 5 May have lapsed. This means that we revert to the previous system under Standing Orders, that is, Priority Questions will last for 20 minutes and if the fourth and fifth questions are not reached they can be taken as ordinary questions.

    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Ms O'Donnell):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government continues to attach the highest priority to the implementation in full of the Good Friday Agreement. While substantial progress has been made, and continues to be made, in the implementation of the Agreement's non-institutional aspects, it has not been possible to establish the institutions in the absence of an agreed basis for the formation of the Executive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="20" /> As the Deputy will be aware, the Taoiseach and Prime Minister decided on 20 July to establish a review of the implementation of the Agreement and invited Senator George Mitchell to act as a facilitator. This review is tightly focused on the practical implementation of the three principles agreed by all pro-Agreement parties on 25 June, namely, an inclusive Executive exercising devolved powers; decommissioning of all paramilitary arms by May 2000; and decommissioning to be carried out in a manner determined by the International Commission on Decommissioning.</P>
    <P>Following some initial contact with the parties, Senator Mitchell began his work with them on Monday, 6 September. He has had a series of meetings, in a range of formats, in each of the weeks since then, which resumes tomorrow. Officials of the Department of Foreign Affairs have been present in Belfast throughout and, together with the Secretary of State, Dr. Mowlam, I have met Senator Mitchell twice during this period, most recently last Thursday, 23 September. The Minister for Foreign Affairs has also been in contact with Senator Mitchell. It would not be appropriate to divulge the substance of our discussion or to speculate in detail on what the outcome of the review might be. We believe, however, that the Senator is doing an outstanding job and is proceeding in a balanced and systematic way, as is his usual manner.</P>
    <P>While the outstanding difficulties are both well known and substantial, and have defeated previous efforts to overcome them, there is still reason to believe that a successful resolution is possible. I believe that the parties want to find an accommodation and to make the Agreement work, as is the democratically expressed will of the people, North and South. The real problem at the heart of the impasse has been the quality of trust between the parties. It is crucially important, therefore, that each party does all it can to stimulate mutual trust. The Government stands ready to support them fully in that task.</P>
    <P>The most significant other development in the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement over the recess period was the publication on 9 September of the report of the Independent Commission on Policing. The Government warmly welcomed this report as thorough and comprehensive and its recommendations, taken together, have the potential to realise the Agreement's objective of a professional, effective, accountable, representative and widely acceptable police service.</P>
    <P>While the Government is deeply concerned at, and totally condemns, all acts of violence, including the murder of Charles Bennett, so-called punishment attacks and expulsions, and continuing sectarian attacks on Catholics in certain parts of Northern Ireland, it remains our view that the paramilitary ceasefires have not broken down. Nevertheless, we will continue to monitor the situation carefully.</P>
    <P>The full implementation of the Agreement represents the best chance for the achievement of <Col N="21" /> lasting peace and stability. It is essential, therefore, that the golden opportunity to break the impasse that Senator Mitchell's review represents is grasped fully and quickly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the Government's view that the formation of an executive with a one month deadline for decommissioning, an idea which has been raised by some Unionists and responded to by some Sinn Féin sources presents possibilities for success?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will accept that it would not be appropriate for me to speculate on any possible formulae that might be put forward by various parties at various points. It is clear that at the time of The Way Forward proposal, an option deemed by the two Governments to have some prospect of success and acceptability, it was not the sequencing or the substance of that proposal that was defective. The quality of the trust between the two protagonists was defective at the time. Notwithstanding the stated commitment of the two parties to accept The Way Forward proposal in principle, it was clear that the political capacity of the respective sides to deliver on those commitments was in doubt and that was the reason there was a very disappointing failure to establish the executive on 15 July.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell:</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister of State tell the House what progress has been made regarding the stand off at Drumcree and if she is optimistic about the outcome? Does she share the assessment of the recent press reports giving the view of the RUC Chief Constable that certain IRA and other terrorist groups are regrouping with a view to co-operating in terrorist activity and has the Government taken steps to counteract them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell:</NameTxt>
      <P>On the issue of the Garvaghy Road, the Government is convinced that any resolution of the issue of contentious parades can only be brought about through local agreement and accommodation. Such accommodation can only be achieved when there is genuine dialogue and mutual respect between the differing parties. There are ongoing efforts on the part of the two Governments and others in seeking an agreed settlement in relation to the Garvaghy Road. I welcome the commitment of both the Orange Order and the local residents group to continue with their efforts to establish an agreed basis for a resolution and the Government would urge both sides to act with restraint. We remain committed and a significant amount of effort has gone into mediation in this regard. That will continue to be the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the reports of a threatened return to violence by dissident elements on both sides, of course this is an ongoing cause of concern to both Governments. It is an ongoing cause of concern to parties representing paramilitary groups which are on ceasefire and all other parties. It <Col N="22" /> remains our view that, notwithstanding the existence of dissident activity, both political and paramilitary, the best course is to galvanise the efforts of the pro-Agreement parties and to work towards the full implementation of the Agreement.</P>
    <P>As the Taoiseach has outlined, during the summer there were various aspects of dissent indicated, for example, by the gun running and the murder of Charles Bennett, actions which both Governments absolutely condemn. Notwithstanding those activities, which are very disturbing and not to be minimised in any way, both Governments remain of the view that, in the round, the ceasefires remain intact for the purposes of continuing with the peace process and including those parties who are signatories to the Good Friday Agreement. We consider that the ceasefire is intact for the purposes of continuing with our negotiations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell:</NameTxt>
      <P>My question to the Minister of State was very specific. Does she share the view of the RUC Chief Constable that the so-called real IRA and some other groups, such as the INLA and Continuity IRA, are getting together to plan some sort of terrorist spectacular at or near the Border? Has the Government taken steps to deal with those matters?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell:</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the Omagh bombing the Government and the security forces on both sides of the Border have been extremely vigilant in relation to distant activity on both sides, both republican and loyalist paramilitary activity. Post Omagh, the House legislated for the most draconian anti-terrorist legislation and the provisions of that legislation remain in place. Certainly, the commitment of the security forces in the Republic and in Northern Ireland to be vigilant in relation to that type of distant activity is absolute. I have no detailed information on the spectacular, to which the Deputy refers. All I can say is that we have in place sufficient security intelligence resources to be vigilant in this regard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 77 and 80 together.</P>
      <P>The Government is gravely concerned at the situation in East Timor, and shares fully the sense of outrage at developments there since the announcement of the outcome of the popular consultation.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs, as Personal Representative of the EU Presidency, observed at first hand the ballot which took place on 30 August. He has paid tribute to the outstanding work of the United Nations Mission for East Timor &ndash; UNAMET &ndash; which organised the popular consultation, and to the men and women from the Garda Síochána and Permanent Defence Forces who were part of that mission. All of those who observed the consultation process were impressed by the way in which the people of East Timor, despite widespread intimidation, registered for the poll and subsequently turned out to vote in overwhelming numbers of 96.6 per cent. In so doing, they expressed clearly their courage and determination to exercise their right to decide their own future.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs, as head of the EU Observer Mission, submitted a report to the UN Electoral Commission indicating that the process had been conducted in a free and fair manner, despite the widespread intimidation. He later reported in similar terms to his EU colleagues at their meeting in Finland on 4 and 5 September.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs held a number of high level meetings, both before and after the vote, with President Habibie, Foreign Minister Alatas, and Mr. Xanana Gusmao in Jakarta, as well as with the local authorities and community leaders in Dili. He urged on all the necessity to respect fully the outcome of the ballot.</P>
      <P>The result of the ballot, as announced by the UN Secretary General on 4 September, was that 78.6 per cent of the voters favoured independence. However, a deliberate campaign of terror and intimidation aimed at the people of East Timor immediately followed. There have been horrendous reports of atrocities. It is clear many have been murdered, although no precise figures are yet available. Many others were deported, either to West Timor or other parts of Indonesia. Hundreds of thousands of others were forced to take shelter in the mountains where they have been suffering extreme deprivation. Houses and facilities have been wantonly destroyed throughout East Timor. As the Minister for Foreign Affairs indicated in his address to the United Nations on 25 September, East Timor now faces a grave humanitarian crisis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has been taking all possible steps to mobilise international support for military intervention and humanitarian assistance. In the immediate aftermath of the announcement of the vote, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs personally contacted leading international figures, including the UN Secretary General, President Clinton, the Prime Minister of <Col N="24" /> Australia and a large number of Foreign Ministers. The concerns of the Irish Government were formally communicated to the United Nations Security Council on 6 September, and the Permanent Representative, Ambassador Ryan, put forward, on instructions, the strong views of the Government in the debate of the Security Council on 11 September.</P>
    <P>At the meeting of the EU General Affairs Council on 13 September, the Minister for Foreign Affairs called for increased EU pressure on Indonesia and clear condemnation of the violence. This was agreed. The EU also agreed a comprehensive arms embargo against Indonesia. The Council made clear that the EU looked forward to recognising East Timor once the process towards independence had been completed. The Government welcomes these steps and looks forward to their implementation at an early date.</P>
    <P>The UN Security Council, in Resolution 1264 of 15 September, established a framework in which the crisis could be resolved and the provisions of the 5 May Tripartite Agreement implemented. It authorised the establishment of a multinational force to restore peace and security, demanded that those responsible for violence be brought to justice, and called for access for the urgent delivery of humanitarian aid.</P>
    <P>In view of the highly unsatisfactory security situation and the continuing legal responsibility of the Indonesian Government for security in East Timor until ratification in November by the Indonesian Parliament of the transfer of authority to the United Nations, strong pressure is now being exercised on Indonesia to accelerate this timetable. This would result in a clearer mandate for INTERFET and reduce the danger of conflict involving Indonesian forces.</P>
    <P>The multinational force &ndash; INTERFET &ndash; is now being deployed and is gradually widening its area of control and restoring peace. The Government has announced its willingness to contribute 40 members of the Army Ranger Wing, subject to the approval of the House. Detailed discussions with the Australian authorities and other participants are now in hand. The Government will bring the issue before the House at an early date, once proposals have been finalised.</P>
    <P>As regards the bringing to justice of the perpetrators of crimes against humanity, the Government has fully supported the call of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mrs. Robinson, for the establishment of an international commission of inquiry. At a special session of the Commission on Human Rights, which took place in Geneva under Irish chairmanship from 23 to 27 September, the EU put forward specific proposals in this regard. I am glad to report that these proposals were adopted by a substantial majority. This should clear the way for the establishment of the commission of inquiry.</P>
    <P>The Government has also taken up in New York the application of the relevant provisions of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. Informal consul<Col N="25" /> tations on the procedural and substantive aspects are continuing, taking account of the developments at the Commission on Human Rights and other action under consideration by the Secretary General.</P>
    <P>The Government shares the Deputies' concerns about the plight of the displaced persons and refugees. As many as 500,000 people have been forced to leave their homes or have been forcibly removed to camps in West Timor and others parts of Indonesia. Mr. Gusmao has called for international assistance to ensure the safe return of refugees and the Government fully supports this.</P>
    <P>The UN civilian mission &ndash; UNAMET &ndash; is being redeployed on the ground. As East Timor has no functioning civilian administration, the Secretary General is considering bringing forward plans to put the UN interim administration in place, earlier than envisaged in the 5 May agreement, to address the task of emergency reconstruction.</P>
    <P>The Government has approved a grant package of £1 million to meet the humanitarian and rehabilitation needs of the hundreds of thousands of refugees and displaced people both in East and West Timor. The assistance will meet immediate humanitarian needs such as food, water and medical supplies and will help with initial reconstruction. It will also contribute towards efforts to help those dispersed against their will to other parts of Indonesia. All assistance will be co-ordinated with other donors to ensure an efficient and effective response to those in need. To date £400,000 has been allocated to the UN High Commission for Refugees, the United Nations Children's Fund and to the United Nations Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs. These agencies have a presence on the ground and will strengthen their response capability as the situation improves.</P>
    <P>The European Community Humanitarian Office has also responded to the crisis on behalf of the member states. To date 5 million euros have been allocated to cover emergency humanitarian aid. Further funding is envisaged based on estimates of needs in light of day-to-day developments.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister of State for the extensive reply. At what point did the Government become aware that there was going to be a crisis following the referendum? Does she accept the view expressed by the Finnish Presidency that the European Council of Ministers were caught by surprise by the violent reaction of the Indonesian military forces and the militia backed by them? Surely the Government must have known that this would be the reaction and that it would appear that the United Nations were unprepared or did not make any preparations for responding to that situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell:</NameTxt>
      <P>The referendum in East Timor took place as a result of the 5 May agreement <Col N="26" /> between Indonesia, Portugal and the United Nations. Indonesia would not accept the idea of international peacekeepers at that time and it took upon itself the responsibility for security. It must now explain its failure to provide that security in the interregnum following the consultation. However, the referendum would not have taken place without the 5 May agreement. It is important to remember that the people in East Timor wanted that referendum. Notwithstanding the intimidation during the election campaign, which was reported by the Minister in his role as representative, a relative calm existed on the day of the referendum which showed it was possible to turn on and off the violence. The Indonesian Government should now explain why it did not adequately control its troops to ensure that violence did not resume.</P>
      <P>This debacle has been a test of the credibility of the United Nations. The Security Council unanimously adopted Resolution 1264 on 15 September, two weeks following the referendum. During those two weeks horrendous atrocities were perpetrated on the people of East Timor. The response of the international community was not fast enough, although it was considerably faster than in other recent cases, such as Kosovo. While we regret that the resolution was not adopted sooner, the focus should now be on ensuring that those aspects of the resolution are implemented in full.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister of State share the concerns expressed by Trócaire which has asked for the genocide convention to be invoked and has quoted from a UN report which states that the East Timor situation can more properly be described as genocide compared to that in Kosovo? Does she agree with the statement that it seems to have more in common with the situation in Rwanda in 1994 or with Hitler's Final Solution? Does she share the four objectives of Trócaire &ndash; to establish an independent panel of experts and a war crimes tribunal, to obtain support for the UNHCR and humanitarian agencies, to ensure the safe and voluntary return of refugees to East Timor and to disarm and disband the militias? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I share her admiration of the Irish UNAMET deputation, including the gardaí who came under fire there. I also express my admiration for the heroism of the Irish Rangers who have volun<Col N="27" /> teered their services. Does the Minister of State share my concern that this is probably the most dangerous task facing the Army since the Congo? I ask her to assure the House that all necessary logistical and equipment support will be in place and that they will have all the resources they need to defend themselves adequately when they arrive in East Timor. When will the Irish Rangers depart for East Timor? </P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell:</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards invoking the genocide convention, Resolution 1264 demands that those responsible for violence in East Timor be brought to justice. Ireland supports the steps already taken by Mrs. Robinson, the UN Commissioner for Human Rights, to achieve this. The best approach is for the international community to have the maximum cohesion and weight. Attention and effort should be concentrated on action already progressing. That is why the Government supports the efforts of the UN Commissioner for Human Rights and the UN Secretary General. Resolution 1264 provides for everything that would be required in this situation from the international community. The Government is concentrating on ensuring that Resolution 1264 and the efforts of the UN Commissioner for Human Rights are fully implemented.</P>
      <P>The Government has offered to send our soldiers to assist the Australian led force in East Timor. I agree with the Deputy that this is an extremely dangerous situation. Our capacity to deliver humanitarian assistance depends on the security situation there. At present, the situation is chaotic and insecure with militias still at large and attacking civilians. The danger is they will attack members of the force. Preparations and negotiations are ongoing between the Defence Forces and the Australian authorities and as soon as these plans are in place, the matter will come before the Dáil and permission will be requested to send the Army there.</P>

      <P>Given that the weapons used by the Indonesian army and presumably the militias supplied by the Indonesian army have come from the United States and the United Kingdom, will the Government ensure that trade will not recommence under any circumstances given the history of the use of those weapons against the population of East Timor? </P>
      <P>Will the Minister of State indicate why it is necessary for the United Nations to await Indonesia's transfer of authority to the United Nations when the right of Indonesia to invade East Timor has not been recognised by the United Nations or by Ireland? I understand the practicalities but I wonder about the legalities as it is not the sovereign authority. Surely the United Nations' decision to wait for sanction from the Parliament of Indonesia to act in East Timor is a denial of its rights under the Charter of the United Nations? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="28" /> While we are concerned to ensure that the authorities in Indonesia are brought to heel, we must ensure that civil society and the democratic forces in Indonesia, which are seeking to establish democracy, will not be penalised by the United Nations or the European Union and that support for these organisations and for the development of democracy will not be stopped.</P>

      <P>At a meeting of the General Affairs Council on 13 September and in interviews afterwards the Minister for Foreign Affairs made it clear that he wished the four month embargo was for a longer period. The embargo now in place is subject to a review at the end of the four month period and can be extended if circumstances so require. Ireland will insist that the situation be rigorously examined as part of that review. It is clear that the provision of arms to the Indonesian state and authorities over the years has been a cause of deep concern to those who were worried about the use of those arms by militias in East Timor. The embargo has been in place since 13 September but we will press for its extension.</P>
      <P>As regards the legal recognition of the independence of East Timor, certain basic conditions must be met under international law. It must have a permanent population, the territory must be defined, there must be a recognisable body to govern it and the entity must have the capacity to enter into relationships with other states. While the first and second conditions have already been met, the third and fourth have not, so this is part of the difficulty in recognising the independence of East Timor. Under the 5 May agreement, which provided for the referendum, the next step is to implement its result and as part of this, the United Nations will shortly take over the administration of East Timor in an interim capacity. Its work will include helping the East Timorese to develop their capacity to govern themselves and become independent in the terms I mentioned.</P>
      <P>The EU has declared that independence must proceed without delay and that the Union looks forward to recognising East Timor once the process towards independence is complete. The significance of this declaration should not be underestimated and Ireland will assist in ensuring independence happens as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to helping the East Timorese in a developmental sense, I had strong hopes, once a peaceful transition to a democratic and independent state happened, that the Government could consider development co-operation programmes in East Timor. Sadly, the conflict and what happened following the referendum has put that on hold because of the security situation. However, the extent of our response by way of humanitarian relief to the value of £1 million reflects Ireland's long standing commitment to East Timor and shows that we will help them now, as the international community is bound to help them, as they move towards independence. <Col N="29" /> However, they will need the long-term assistance of the international community to achieve that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to report to the House on developments in relation to Ireland's proposed participation in Partnership for Peace and to outline the timetable which the Minister for Foreign Affairs envisages for joining PfP.</P>
      <P>Participation in PfP is based on the principle of self-differentiation, that is, a state selects for itself the areas of interest that will provide the basis for its co-operation under PfP. The nature and scope of Ireland's participation will be set out in a national presentation document which will be presented to Dáil Éireann for consideration and approval once it has been approved by the Government. Recently, there have been useful informal official level discussions with the NATO secretariat on practical and administrative arrangements for participation in PfP which confirm our existing understandings of what is involved. The content of Ireland's presentation document, of course, remains a matter for this State alone. The focus of the presentation document, which will be brought before the Dáil, will be on peace-keeping and forms of co-operation consistent with Ireland's approach to international peace and European security.</P>
      <P>Following further Government consideration of the issue in the near future, a motion approving Ireland's participation in PfP will be submitted to this House, together with the presentation document. The intention is to seek early Dáil approval so that Ireland can join PfP in the course of October. Ireland would join PfP by signing the PfP Framework Document. It is the intention simultaneously to hand over to the NATO Secretary General our national presentation document. Ireland would also be entitled to participate in the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council which provides the overarching framework for political and security related consultations among PfP members. Our intention is to appoint representatives to the NATO headquarters. As the other neutral states participating in PfP have done, it is our intention to accredit the Ambassador to Belgium, who also acts as Permanent Representative to the Western European Union, to NATO.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As has been made clear in the House on previous occasions, a referendum on this matter is not required as PfP would not be in conflict with our neutrality. Participation in PfP will be in full accordance with our policy of military neutrality; participation in PfP does not entail membership of NATO or any alliance commitments. PfP does not change the situation under which Irish participation in crisis management missions, whether <Col N="32" /> peacekeeping, as in Lebanon, or peace enforcement, as in the Balkans or East Timor, requires a UN mandate. PfP will in fact enhance the capabilities of the Defence Forces to meet the challenges of UN mandated peacekeeping in the next century.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister of State confirming that the Taoiseach's commitment to a referendum has been abandoned? Is that the situation? Will she tell the House how she squares her comments that the appointment of an ambassador to NATO will go ahead when on several occasions in the past when I raised this issue the House was not told that this would happen? On one occasion the Taoiseach told the House that Ireland would not appoint an ambassador to NATO. Does the Minister of State agree that this back door approach to joining the Partnership for Peace, in terms of promising a referendum and then abandoning it and stating that an ambassador would not be appointed and then appointing one, and that by not being upfront with the people, this process has been brought into disrepute?</P>
      <P>The Minister of State said we are preparing to participate in peacekeeping. Will she confirm that the Government is also considering preparation to participate in peace enforcement? Who is conducting the negotiations on behalf of Ireland to enter Partnership for Peace?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I confirm the Government's position that there is no need for a referendum on this issue. This is the advice of the Attorney General. It is clear there is no basis or need for a referendum. That is the considered view of the Attorney General whose advice has been sought. PfP has no implications for sovereignty. Participation would not be in conflict with neutrality. There is no conflict between participation in PfP and our policy of military neutrality. All other neutral EU states and Switzerland are participants in PfP. Forty three countries are involved in PfP, 24 of which are not members of NATO. The explanatory guide published by the Minister for Foreign Affairs gives a detailed and very open account of PfP and what is entailed by its membership.</P>
      <P>Regarding the appointment of a representative, I know that on last or previous occasion the Minister for Foreign Affairs answered questions in the Dáil he was asked whether we would appoint an ambassador to NATO. The Minister was unsure at that stage, but now&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell:</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;I am informed the proposal is to appoint the ambassador to Belgium, who also acts as permanent representative to the Western European Union, as our representative to NATO.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the distinction between peacekeep<Col N="33" /> ing and peace enforcement, participation in PfP will not mean a move away from our traditional involvement in UN peacekeeping. Peacekeeping in support of the UN is a key element of our foreign policy. The contribution has received widespread recognition over many years. However, the UN is increasingly reliant on regional security organisations to support and carry out missions on its behalf, as we have seen in Bosnia, where the UN, NATO, OSCE and the European Union co-operate as a matter of routine. The UN Secretary General, Kofi Annan, has actively encouraged this trend and NATO's role in it. Ireland has already moved into the new UN approach to European regional peacekeeping through our participation in SFOR, the stabilisation force in Bosnia, and most recently in KFOR, the international security presence in Kosovo. Both these missions are mandated by the UN but conducted by NATO. PfP is an important forum for co-operation in the area of peacekeeping, including peace enforcement.</P>

        <b>:</b> Does the Minister of State agree, leaving aside the Government's efforts to dress up Partnership for Peace as some kind of humanitarian process, that PfP, as the framework document objectives make clear, is really a military alliance? Does she agree the Government is bringing the country into a militarisation situation with some of the biggest military powers in the world? Does she also agree that PfP will be tied in to the armaments industry, which will give a further twist to the production of arms carried out by the biggest NATO countries for massive profits for conglomerates? Does she not find this extremely repugnant? How can she be involved with it, especially given that leading NATO countries &ndash; the United States and Britain &ndash; armed the Indonesian dictatorship and were responsible for and culpable in the horror perpetrated against the East Timorese people for 20 years? Why is the Government afraid to go in front of the people, have a full debate in the open, a campaign, a referendum and a vote? Does the Minister of State accept, if we are to take her party on face value as one which supposedly represents the interests of people and democracy, that this flies in the face of democracy by denying the people a voice in what is a serious step of bringing this country into what is really a military alliance?</P>

      <P>Our proposed membership of PfP is not in any way membership of a military alliance. Ireland's participation in PfP has no connection with membership of NATO. We have no plans to join NATO. Our policy regarding participation in PfP should be seen in the light of changing international circumstances and, in particular, the increased importance of peacekeeping and crisis management. PfP is an important framework for co-operation in this area.</P>

      <P>I recognise the Minister of State represents the Government and not necessarily the Fianna Fáil view on this matter. Nevertheless, it is her responsibility to answer questions in the House. The Fianna Fáil Party went before the electorate in the general election and sought a mandate to oppose membership of Partnership for Peace and, if there were any proposal to join it, to seek the approval of the people for such a proposal. That position changed in the last six months or so. The Taoiseach, in the House and in response to questions from me, indicated that he was seeking a new mandate in the European elections for this new shift in policy. The reality is that the Fianna Fáil Party was returned to the European Parliament with less seats, and one of its elected MEPs campaigned and won a seat on the basis of opposing joining Partnership for Peace. I put it to the Minister of State that the political basis for a referendum is very clear. The major party in Government made a solemn promise that there would be consultation with the people on this issue. Does the Minister of State agree that what is being done now is politically unsustainable given the revolt emerging in the backbenches of Fianna Fáil on this issue?</P>
      <P>Will the Minister of State indicate, in terms of whatever agreement the Government proposes to arrange with this NATO-sponsored organisation, if it is the intention that any actions Ireland take under the agreement in Partnership for Peace would require a UN mandate?</P>

I am here to <Col N="35" /> respond on behalf of the Government. It is the Government's political and legal judgment that there is no need for a referendum on this issue. We have encouraged democratic debate on this. The Taoiseach put forward Fianna Fáil's changed position in the context of the European elections. It has sought a mandate for that change in direction.</P>

Does she agree the best way to prepare for these Petersberg Tasks is through Partnership for Peace and that if the European Union, through the Petersberg Tasks and the role it has in directing the Western European Union, were prepared to take on these tasks, we would be much better prepared to intervene and to <Col N="36" /> assist in situations like Kosovo and East Timor and even in the earthquakes in Greece and Turkey? Will the Minister of State, therefore, join me in denouncing those people who constantly go on television and radio and whinge and whine about our lack of preparation when there is a need for peace enforcement, peacekeeping and humanitarian aid and then, when we seek to join an organisation like Partnership for Peace, try to obstruct it and imply it is a defence commitment, when it is not?</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Mitchell's analysis. There is no institutional link between the EU and PfP, but the European Union has agreed in the Amsterdam Treaty to play a role in the Petersberg Tasks. They are the humanitarian and rescue activities, peacekeeping and crisis management. PfP has proved its importance as a framework for co-operation in these areas of activity, as can be seen from the participation in PfP of all of our EU partners, including the other EU neutral states. For neutral members of the EU, PfP is an important planning framework for the Petersberg Tasks. I agree with the Deputy.</P>

      <P>Many people want to know why we have this unseemly haste, this U-turn. Are we being put under pressure by the USA on this matter? The Minister of State's statement today makes the Taoiseach's claim that PfP has nothing to do with NATO seem like a load of bunkum. Does the Minister agree that is the case? Is she familiar with the newly published book <i>Preventive Defence</i> which was written by the brains behind PfP, William J. Perry and Ashton Carter, and particularly with the part of the book where they say PfP is a stepping stone towards NATO. It is put very bluntly and quoted by Fintan O'Toole in <i>The Irish Times</i> recently.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell:</NameTxt>
      <P>The first question the Deputy asked was in relation to whether it is a military alliance. I have already said it is not a military alliance. It is a facility whereby we and our fellow members of the European Union will be able to participate in peacekeeping and crisis management and other relevant aspects which are an extension of our current peacekeeping activities in the world. The procedure for participating is voluntary and straightforward. Participation in PfP is based on the principle of self-differen<Col N="37" /> tiation. In other words, we can tailor what we need to do, what we want to do, how deeply we want to get involved in peacekeeping and peacemaking. We can tailor that by way of our presentation document. That will be debated fully in the House. There is no secrecy about it. It will be debated fully and the people will have every opportunity to express their views on it.</P>

      <P>Faoi mar is eol don Dáil is é seo an dara Bille maidir le hÚdarás na Gaeltachta a foilsíodh i mbliana. Bhain an chéad Bhille, i.e., an Bille um Údarás na Gaeltachta (Leasú), 1999, go sonrach leis an tréimhse ama incheadaithe is faide idir thoghcháin don údarás a mhéadú ó chúig bliana go dtí cúig bliana agus sé mhí. Tá an Bille sin ina Acht anois le cúpla mí anuas ar ndóigh. Dúirt mé nuair a bhí an Bille gairid sin á phlé anseo sa Dáil i mí Bealtaine go raibh an Rialtas tar éis toiliú le moltaí ón Aire Ealaíon, Oidhreachta, Gaeltachta agus Oileán maidir le hathstruchtúrú a dhéanamh ar Bhord Údarás na Gaeltachta agus go mbeinn ar ais sa Dáil le Bille chun na críche sin. Ag an am sin mheas mé gur sa Dáil a dhéanfaí an Bille a thabhairt isteach ach ní mar sin a tharla, áfach. Tíolacadh an Bille don Seanad agus ghlac an Seanad leis gan leasú ar 1 Iúil. Is ar chúis theicniúil go ngairtear an Bille um Údarás na Gaeltachta (Leasú) (Uimh. 3), 1999, ar an mBille seo seachas Bille Uimh. 2.</P>
      <P>Beidh níos mó le rá agam faoi fhorálacha an Bhille ar ball ach sula ndéanaim é sin is fiú súilfhéachaint a thabhairt ar an méid atá bainte amach ag an Údarás ó bunaíodh é.</P>
      <P>Tá an t-Údarás ar an saol le beagnach fiche bliain anuas agus tá sé tráthúil mar sin féachaint ar an méid atá bainte amach ag an gcomhlacht Stáit ó bunaíodh é agus ar oiriúntacht an struchtúir atá ann faoi láthair chun dul i ngleic leis na dúshláin atá os a chomhair sna blianta tosaigh den mhílaois nua atá romhainn.</P>
      <P>Bunaíodh an t-Údarás ar 1 Eanáir, 1980, faoin Acht ud, 1979, i gcomharbacht ar Ghaeltarra Éireann, an comhlacht Stáit a bhí freagrach as forbairt thionsclaíoch sa Ghaeltacht ó 1958 ar aghaidh agus a bhí mar chuid de chóras na Státseirbhíse roimhe sin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ba fhreagra é an tAcht um Údarás na Gaeltachta, 1979, ar éileamh phobal na Gaeltachta i <Col N="54" /> rith na seachtóidí ar eagras forbartha ar a mbeadh ionadaíocht láidir ag an bpobal agus a mbeadh cumhacht agus feidhmeanna aige a chuirfeadh ar a chumas tabhairt go fuinniúil faoi fhorbairt na Gaeltachta agus faoi neartú agus cothú na Gaeilge mar theanga pobail na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>De réir fhorálacha an Achta bhunaidh sin bhí trí chomhalta déag ar an mBord, seachtar acu á dtoghadh go daonlathach ag pobal na Gaeltachta agus an seisear eile &ndash; an Cathaoirleach ina measc  &ndash; á gceapadh ag an Aire. B'athrú nuálach chun feabhais é an leagan amach sin, ón ré roimhe sin, a thug ugach agus misneach do na pobail Ghaeltachta trí dheis a thabhairt dóibh a n-ionadaithe féin a roghnú le bheith ag feidhmiú ag an leibhéal is airde ceannaireachta san eagras nua sin. Is struchtúr sainiúil atá ann i gcás an údaráis  &ndash; struchtúr nach bhfuil ag aon Bhord Stáit eile.</P>
    <P>Tá sé le maíomh anois gur tháinig glanmhéadú ar an bhfostaíocht iomlán sa Ghaeltacht gan teip ó 1983 i leith. Faoi thús na bliana seo, bhí 8,174 dhuine fostaithe go lánaimseartha i dtionscail a fuair cúnamh ón údaras. Lena chois sin, bhí 3,483 dhuine eile fostaithe go páirtaimseartha nó go séasúrach i dtionscail a bhfuil baint ag an t-údarás leo.</P>
    <P>Tá infheistíocht mhór déanta ag an údarás sa bhonneagar tionsclaíoch, idir mhonarchana agus seirbhísí gaolmhara, sa Ghaeltacht o 1980 i leith. Méadaíodh an t-achar spáis tionsclaíoch ó 148,000 mr. cr. go 248,000 mr. cr. ó 1980 i leith. Tá forbairt shuntasach déanta ar eastáit thionsclaíochta éagsúla ar fud na Gaeltachta. Tá ionaid cheardaíochta forbartha in áiteanna éagsúla. Tá tionscal bríomhar closamhairc sa Ghaeltacht anois ag soláthar clár den scoth do Theilifís na Gaeilge (TG4)  &ndash; tionscal a tosaíodh ón mbonn beagán le cois deich mbliana ó shin. Is faoi stiúir agus straitéis an Údaráis a tháinig borradh agus fás faoi thionscal na feirmeoireachta agus na próiseála éisc sa Ghaeltacht. Rinneadh forbairt ar aerstráicí agus ar sheirbhísí gaolmhara &ndash; aersheirbhísí ar thrí oileán Árann &ndash; agus, trí pháirtíocht ghníomhach an údaráis, rinneadh forbairt shuntasach ar Aerfort Idirnáisiúnta Dhún na nGall ag Carraig Fhinne.</P>
    <P>Tá clár gníomhaíochtaí á chur i bhfeidhm ag an Údarás ar mhaithe le caomhnú agus leathadh na Gaeilge mar theanga pobail na Gaeltachta. Tá breis agus 80 naíonra á mhaoiniú ag an Údarás, tá clár tacaíochta ar fáil do chlubanna óige, cuirtear urraíocht ar fáil d'fhéilte áitiúla, do chomórtais liteartha agus do thionscnaimh teanga; tá áisitheoirí ealaíon fostaithe i ngach réigiún trí chomhfhiontar idir an tÚdarás agus An Chomhairle Ealaíon; agus tá clár tacaíochta teanga ar fáil do chomhlachtaí Gaeltachta tríd an scéim dá ngairtear Fondúireacht an Údaráis.</P>
    <P>Níl aon amhras orm ach go bhfuil obair mhaith déanta ag an Údarás ó thaobh forbairt na Gaeltachta de agus tréaslaím leis an údarás mar eagras, leis na comhaltaí boird go léir ó thús go dtí an lá inniu ann agus le foireann an údaráis a <Col N="55" /> thug agus atá ag tabhairt seirbhíse den scoth do mhuintir na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Tá an t-imshaol forbartha agus tionsclaíochta ag athrú go tréan agus tá mianta gairme an aosa óig ag athrú de bharr an ardchaighdeán oideachais atá anois orthu le hais mar a bhíodh. Le freagairt do mhianta gairme na glúine nua seo caithfidh an t-údarás féachaint le hinfheistíocht a mhealladh sa réimse nuatheicneolaíochta, teileachumarsáide, próiseáil eolais, ríomhthráchtáil agus idirlín chomh maith leis an infheistíocht sa réimse déantúsaíochta agus acmhainní nádúrtha.</P>
    <P>Lena chois sin, is dúshlán mór don Údarás forbairt a ghiniúint agus a dháileadh sna ceantair bheaga agus sna ceantair iargúilta sin nár ghnóthaigh a gcion chothrom fós den bhorradh eacnamaíochta a tharla le cúpla bliain anuas. Is dúshlán mór é chomh maith an phleanáil fhorbartha a dhéanamh sa dóigh go ndéanfar cúram ceart den struchtúr sóisialta agus siamsaíochta ionas go mbeidh dálaí maireachtála chomh tarraingteach sa Ghaeltacht agus atá ar fáil in aon áit eile. Thar aon rud caithfidh an tÚdarás an Ghaeltacht a fhorbairt mar áit ina mbeidh an Ghaeilge mar ghnáththeanga ag an bpobal.</P>
    <P>Is í an bhunfhealsúnacht atá laistiar den Bhille seo ná bonn daonlathach an údaráis a leathnú. Faoi láthair den trí chomhalta déag ar bhord an údaráis &ndash; toghann muintir na Gaeltachta seacht gcomhalta agus ceapann an tAire an seisear eile (an Cathaoirleach san áireamh). Rinneadh gearáin liom go minic ar mo chuairteanna ar na Gaeltachtaí beaga nach raibh deis acu faoin struchtúr atá ann faoi láthair ionadaí a thoghadh ar bhord an údaráis agus go raibh go leor ceantair bheaga Ghaeltachta nár ainmníodh ionadaí astu ach an oiread. Faoin mBille seo is fiche comhalta a bheidh ar bhord an údaráis. Toghfaidh muintir na Gaeltachta seach nduine déag den líon sin agus ceapfaidh an tAire an triúr eile (an Cathaoirleach san áireamh). Tá líon na dtoghlach do thoghcháin an Údaráis á mhéadú ó thrí cinn go dtí seacht gcinn, i.e., toghlach ar leith i ngach contae ina bhfuil limistéar Gaeltachta. Mar sin beidh guth ag Gaeltacht na Rinne i gContae Phort Láirge agus ag Gaeltachtaí na Mí (Ráth Cairn agus Baile Gib) ar bhord an údaráis feasta agus beidh deis chomh maith ag ceantair bheaga Ghaeltachta sna mórchontaetha Gaeltachta ionadaithe a thoghadh.</P>
    <P>Tá i gceist freisin sa Bhille seo deireadh a chur leis an ról atá ag an Aire i gceadú tograí de chuid an Údaráis. Beidh coiste meastóireachta á bhunú, áfach, chun scrúdú a dhéanamh ar thograí a chuirtear faoi bhráid an Aire faoi láthair agus chun moltaí a dhéanamh don údarás ina dtaobh. Beidh níos mó le rá agam faoi sin ar ball. Faoi láthair tá córas Coistí Réigiúnacha á fheidhmiú ag an údarás ar bhonn neamhreachtúil. Faoin mBille seo tá bonn reachtúil á chur faoi na coistí sin. Tá an deis á glacadh sa Bhille chun uasdátú a dhéanamh ar ghnéithe éagsúla den Acht um <Col N="56" /> Údarás na Gaeltachta, 1979. Díreoidh mé anois ar fhorálacha ar leith den Bhille.</P>
    <P>Is forálacha caighdeánacha iad Alt 1agus 2 a dtugann míniú ar an téarma &ldquo;an Príomh-Acht&rdquo; agus a gcuireann mínithe breise isteach sa Phríomh-Acht.</P>
    <P>Leasaítear le halt 3 alt 6 den Phríomh-Acht trí fhoráil a dhéanamh do struchtúir Boird athbhreithnithe 20 comhalta a dtoghfaidh muintir na Gaeltachta 17 díobh. An tAire Ealaíon, Oidhreachta, Gaeltachta agus Oileán a cheapfaidh an Cathaoirleach agus beirt chomhalta eile. Ní bheidh duine a bhí ina iarrthóir nó ina hiarrthóir sa toghchán deireanach chuig an Údarás incheaptha ag an Aire mar Chathaoirleach. Feasta beidh 17 gcomhalta tofa in áit 7 gcomhalta tofa ar bhord an Údaráis agus laghdófar líon na gcomhaltaí a ainmneoidh an tAire ó sheisear go dtí triúr. Maidir leis na comhaltaí seachas an Cathaoirleach, a ainmneoidh an tAire, beidh scóip ag an Aire daoine a ainmniú, mar shampla, ó cheantair bheaga Ghaeltachta sna mórchontaetha Gaeltachta nach raibh in ann comhaltaí a thoghadh ar an Údarás. Beidh deis ann freisin ionadaí ó fhoireann an Údaráis b'fhéidir, státseirbhíseach, duine le taithí gnó san earnáil phríobháideach, nó oileánach, srl, a cheapadh.</P>
    <P>Faoi alt 4 scriosfar an ceanglas in alt 8 (5) d'Acht 1979 lena gcleanglaítear ar an údarás toiliú an Aire a fháil chun tionscal a scor. Níl gá le ceanglas mar seo anois &ndash; ceanglas a cuireadh isteach sa Phríomh-Acht chun na tionscail tuaithe a bhí faoi úinéireacht Ghaeltarra Éireann a chosaint. Tá foráil á déanamh freisin lena ndeimhnítear go bhfuil cumhacht ag an údarás sceímeanna, deontais, srl. a riaradh ar gá cistí Comhphobail Eorpaigh nó cistí eile a eisíoc ina leith. Cé go mbíonn an t-údarás ag brath ar an Státchiste don chuid is mó dá chuid airgid bíonn cistí airgid eile ar fáil dó agus tá an fhoráil seo á cur isteach le nach mbeidh aon amhras ann maidir le cumhacht an Údaráis chun na cistí sin a úsáid.</P>
    <P>Leasaíonn alt 5 alt 10 den Phríomh-Acht, is é sin an t-alt a bhaineann le cúnamh airgid ón údarás chun críocha tionscail. I láthair na huaire leagtar síos córas maidir le dhá theorainn don údarás a shonrú &ndash; teorainn a bhféadfaidh an t-Údarás, in aon chás áirithe, cúnamh airgid faoina réir a thabhairt dá rogha féin; agus teorainn a bhféadfaidh an t-údarás, in aon chás áirithe, cúnamh airgid de bharr uirthi a thabhairt le ceadú roimh ré ón Rialtas.</P>
    <P>Má bhíonn cúnamh airgid, in aon chás áirithe, idir na teorainneacha thuas i gceist caithfear toiliú an Aire a fháil.</P>
    <P>Leis an mBille seo tá i gceist an córas sin a leasú. Beidh ar chumas an údaráis i gcónaí cúnamh airgid a thabhairt dá rogha féin faoi bhun teorainn áirithe. Beidh gá i gcónaí freisin le cead an Rialtais má tá cúnamh thar theorainn a shonróidh an tAire i gceist do thogra. Tá ciall leis sin mar tá sé táb<Col N="57" /> hachtach go mbeadh deis ag an Rialtas tograí móra ón Údarás a scrúdú. Bíonn a leithéid i gceist leis na heagrais forbartha tionscail eile freisin. Ar ndóigh, i gcás tograí den chineál sin scrúdófar iad ag an Aire freisin.</P>
    <P>Tá deireadh á chur leis an bhforáil maidir le cead an Aire a lorg agus a fháil do thograí. Ina háit sin, tá foráil nua, fo-alt (2A), á cur isteach in alt 10 den Phríomh-Acht faoina shonróidh an tAire Ealaíon, Oidhreachta, Gaeltachta agus Oileán teorainn, tar éis dul i gcomhairle leis an Aire Fiontair, Trádála agus Fostaíochta agus le comhthoiliú an Aire Airgeadais, de mheid is lú ná an teorainn le haghaidh chead an Rialtais a éileoidh gur gá ceadú an choiste meastóireachta, arna bhunú faoi alt 7 den Bhille, a fháil roimh ré i gcás cúnamh airgid ón údarás ar mó ná an méid sin é in aon chás áirithe.</P>
    <P>Go bunúsach líonfaidh an Coiste Meastóireachta an bhearna a bheidh ann ag éirí as deireadh a bheith á chur leis an bhforáil maidir le cead an Aire. Tiocfaidh an Coiste Meastóireachta ann in áit cead an Aire.</P>
    <P>Tá foráil nua eile, i bhfo-alt 6, á cur isteach in alt 10 den Phríomh Acht faoina bhféadfaidh an tAire Ealaíon, Oidhreachta, Gaeltachta agus Oileán teorainn de mhéid an chúnamh airgid a fhéadfaidh coiste réigiúnach de chuid an údaráis a thabhairt dá rogha féin in aon chás áirithe ina limistéar a shonrú. Beidh níos mó le rá agam faoin gCoiste Meastóireachta agus faoi na coistí réigiúnacha ar ball.</P>
    <P>Déanann alt 6 alt nua, alt 10A, a chur isteach sa Phríomh-Acht a dhéanann foráil do thrí choiste réigiúnacha de chuid an údaráis a bhunú: Ceann don limistéar arb é na codanna sin den Ghaeltacht é atá suite i gcontae Dhún na nGall; ceann don limistéar arb é na codanna sin den Ghaeltacht atá suite i gContae Mhaigh Eo, i gContae na Gaillimhe agus i gContae na Mí; agus ceann don limistéar arb é na codanna sin den Ghaeltacht é atá suite i gContaetha Chiarrai, Chorcaí agus Phort Láirge. Is iad a bheidh ina gcomhaltaí de na coistí sin ná comhaltaí tofa an údaráis don limistéar a bheidh i gceist. Déanann an t-alt seo foráil chomh maith maidir le coistí eile de chuid an údaráis a bhunú.</P>
    <P>Tá coistí réigiúnacha ag an údarás cheana féin agus iad ag feidhmiú ar bhonn neamhreachtúil. Tá sé tábhachtach i mo thuairimse go dtabharfaí aitheantas cuí do na coistí sin trí iad a chur ar bhonn reachtúil. Níl i gceist cumhachtaí sonracha a leagan síos do na coistí sin sa Bhille. Feictear domsa gur gnó don údarás é seo.</P>
    <P>Déanann alt 7 alt nua, alt 10B, a chur isteach sa Phríomh-Acht a dhéanann foráil do choiste meastóireachta de chuid an údaráis a bhunú a mbeidh sé d'fheidhm aige meastóireacht a dhéanamh ar thograí a bhaineann le cúnamh airgid ón údarás lena mbaineann alt 10(2A), arna chur isteach ag an mBille. Líonfaidh an coiste meastóireachta an bhearna a bheidh ann ag éirí as deireadh a bheith á chur leis an bhforáil maidir le cead an Aire a fháil do thogra. Déanfaidh an coiste meastóireachta scrúdú ar thograí mhóra, i.e., tograí a <Col N="58" /> mbeidh cúnamh i gceist dóibh that theorainn a bheidh le sonrú.</P>
    <P>Déanann alt 8 alt nua, alt 10C, a chur isteach sa Phríomh-Acht a leagann amach, <i>inter alia, </i>comhaltas an choiste meastóireachta agus a dhéanann foráil go mbeidh d'inniúlacht ag comhaltaí an choiste sin gnó an choiste a sheoladh trí mheán na Gaeilge. Feicfear go mbeidh trí chomhalta tofa de chuid an údaráis, príomhfheidhmeannach an údaráis nó ionadaí dá chuid ó fhoireann an údaráis, ionadaí ó mo Roinn-se agus ionadaithe ón nGníomhaireacht Forbartha Tionscail (Éire), i.e., IDA (Ireland), agus ó Fhiontraíocht Éireann, i.e., Enterprise Ireland, ar an gcoiste. Tá córas leagtha síos san alt seo feisin maidir le feidhmiú an choiste, srl.</P>
    <P>Beidh comhaltaí tofa den údarás ar an gcoiste agus beidh an taithí speisialta atá acu ar riachtanais na Gaeltachta ina chabhair mhór don choiste sin ina chuid oibre. Chomh maith leis sin beidh na hionadaithe ó na heagrais forbartha tionscail eile ar an gcoiste an-chabhraitheach dó maidir le tograí a scrudú. Nil aon amhras orm ach go rachaidh an coiste meastóireachta go mo chun tairbhe d'fheidhmiú an údaráis.</P>
    <P>Le halt 9 tá forálacha sonrach á gcur isteach sa Phríomh-Acht maidir le ról, téarmaí ceapacháin, srl., phríomhfheidhmeannach an údaráis. Feicfear go úsáidtear an teideal &ldquo;príomh oifigeach fheidhmeannach&rdquo; sa Bhille mar atá sé dréachtaithe. Tuigim gur fearr leis an t-údarás an teideal &ldquo;príomhfheidhmeannach&rdquo; agus sna cúinsí sin beidh leasú dá réir á mholadh agam ag céim an choiste.</P>
    <P>Déanann alt 10 forálacha nua maidir le foireann an údaráis a chur isteach sa Phríomh-Acht in áit na bhforálacha atá in alt 12 den Phríomh-Acht. Go bunúsach is uasdátú foclaíochta atá i gceist anseo agus níl aon athrú bunúsach sa treis.</P>
    <P>Déanann alt 11 forálacha nua maidir le nochtadh eolais a chur in áit na bhforálacha atá in alt 15 den Phríomh-Acht. Arís is uasdátú foclaíochta atá i gceist seachas aon athrú bunúsach. Tá uasmhéid na fíneála is feidir a ghearradh ar dhuine a sháraíonn alt 15 den Phríomh-Acht á mhéadú ó £100 to dtí £1,500. Agus is léir go bhfuil boilsciú i bhfeidhm.</P>
    <P>Le halt 12 tá forálacha cuimsitheacha nua maidir le nochtadh leasanna ag comhaltaí agus ag foireann an údaráis agus ag sainchomhairleoirí agus ag comhairleoirí a fhostaíonn an t-údarás á gcur isteach sa Phríomh-Acht in áit na bhforálacha atá i mír 8 den Chead Sceideal a ghabhann leis an bPríomh-Acht.. Leagann fo-alt (7) síos gur coir é gan leas a nochtadh agus gurb é an píonós sa chás fineáil nach mó ná £1,500 nó príosúnacht ar feadh téarma nach faide ná 12 mí, nó iad araon. Is gá níos mó béime a chur ar nochtadh leasanna ag comhaltaí. srl., agus tograí á bplé/á gceadú. Mar sin tá athdhréachtú ar na bhforálacha sa Phríomh-Acht.</P>
    <P>Déanann alt 13 forálacha nua maidir le comhaltas chomhalta d'fhoireann an údaráis i gceachtar Teach den Oireachtas nó i bPairlimint na <Col N="59" /> hEorpa a chur isteach sa Phríomh-Acht in áit na bhforálacha atá in alt 16 den Phríomh-Acht.</P>
    <P>Níl aon fhoráil shonrach sa Phríomh-Acht maidir le hordacháin ón Aire a thabhairt don údarás. Déanann an t-alt seo alt nua, alt 20A, a chur isteach sa Phríomh-Acht a chuireann ar chumas an Aire ordacháin a thabhairt don údarás. Baineann fo-alt 20A(1) le hordacháin ghinearalta polasaí a thabhairt. Ní bhainfidh ordachán le togra ar leith nó le tosaíocht a thabhairt do limistéar amháin den Ghaeltacht thar aon limistéar eile. Níl ordachán den chineál sin tugtha go dtí seo ach tá sé tábhachtach go mbeadh cumhacht shonrach ag an Aire ordacháin a thabhairt. Baineann fo-alt 20A(5) le hordacháin a thabhairt ag an Aire maidir le tabhú caiteachais ag an údarás, le cúnamh airgid a bheith á thabhairt ag an údarás, le diúscairt talún, foirgneamh, áitreabh nó gléasra ag an údarás, agus le scaireanna i gcomhlacht corpraithe á ndíol ag an údarás. Is é atá i gceist anseo ná foráil a chur isteach sa Phríomh-Acht a chinnteoidh go bhfuil cumhacht ag an Aire ordacháin mar seo a thabhairt don udarás. Tá ordacháin den chineál i gceist tugtha ag an Aire ó bunaiodh an t-údarás. Leis an bhforáil seo níl i gceist aon srianta breise a chur ar an údarás &ndash; i bhfírinne táimse tar éis srianta a bhí ar an údarás maidir le caiteachas a thabhú a mhaolú go mór &ndash; ach cinnteoidh an t-alt go bhfuil an chumhacht reachtúil ann chun ordacháin dá leithéid a thabhairt más gá. Baineann fo-alt 20A(6) le hordacháin ón Aire maidir le ceisteanna foirne. Arís tá ordacháin á dtabhairt don údarás ó thráth go chéile maidir le cúrsaí foirne agus níl aon rud nua i gceist seachas a dheimhniú go bhfuil cumhacht ag an Aire ordacháin a thabhairt. Tá feidhm reachtúil á thabhairt d'aon ordacháin a tugadh roimh thosach feidhme an ailt.</P>
    <P>Cuireann alt 15 struchtúr toghlaigh nua ar bun do thoghcháin chun an údaráis in áit na gceann atá leagtha amach in alt 29 den Phríomh-Acht. Is é atá i gceist ná go mbeadh ionadaí amháin le toghadh ag an bpobal sna limistéir Ghaeltachta sna trí contaetha Gaeltachta leis an daonra is ísle, i.e., go mbeidh duine amhain ó Chontae na Mí, ó Chontae Phort Láirge agus Corcaigh. Tá sé sin á dhéanamh d'aon ghnó chun cinntiú go mbeidh ionadaíocht ag na pobail Ghaeltachta sna limistéir Ghaeltachta sna contaetha sin ar an údarás. I gcas na gcontaetha eile is ionadaíocht de réir daonra atá i gceist chomh fada agus is féidir agus chomh fada is a luíonn sé le réasún. Beidh ceathrar le toghadh ag an bpobal sna limistéir Gaeltachta i dTír Chonaill, seisear i gContae na Gaillimhe, beirt i gContae Chiarrai agus beirt i gContae Mhaigh Eo.</P>
    <P>Measaim gur socrú sásúil, cóir agus oiriúnach é seo. Léiríonn na figiúirí a thabharfaidh mé anois nach bhfuil aon difríocht gur fiú trácht air idir Gaeltacht Dhún na nGall, Gaeltacht na Gaillimhe agus Gaeltacht Mhuigh Eo ó thaobh ionadaíochta de i gcoibhneas le daonra de faoi na socruithe nua toghchánaíochta atá leagtha amach sa Bhille seo. Maidir le Ciarraí bhí an rogha ann <Col N="60" /> suíochán amháin nó dhá shuíochán a thabhairt agus shocraigh mé ar dhá shuíochán.</P>
    <P>Seo mar a bheidh. Tá 24,072 dhuine ina gcónaí i nGaeltacht Thír Chonaill. Tá ceithre shuíochán ann agus beidh duine amháin tofa in aghaidh chuile 6,018 dhuine. I nGaillimh tá 35,968 dhuine ina gcónaí sa Ghaeltacht ansin de réir an daonáirimh agus beidh sé shuíochán acu nó duine amháin tofa do gach 5,997 dhuine. I gContae Mhuigh Eo tá 11,494 dhuine ina gcónaí sa Ghaeltacht agus beidh dhá shuíochán acu, sé sin comhalta amháin do gach 5,747 dhuine. I gCiarraí tá 8,145 dhuine ina gcónaí sa Ghaeltacht, beidh dhá shuíochán nó duine amháin á thoghadh do gach 4,072 dhuine. Tá sé sin chomh cothrom agus is féidir.</P>
    <P>Leasaíonn alt 16 alt 32 den Phríomh-Acht le freastal a dhéanamh ar an athrú nach dtoghfar i dtoghlaigh áirithe ach duine amháin chun an údaráis faoin struchtúr nua.</P>
    <P>Déanann alt 17 roinnt leasuithe ar an gCéad Sceideal a ghabhann leis an bPríomh-Acht lena n-áirítear nósanna imeachta nua a bhunú a bhaineann le dícháiliú comhalta de chuid an údaráis.</P>
    <P>Foráiltear le halt 18 d'aisghairm ailt 10(3) den Phríomh-Acht le cead an Aire do thograí de chuid an údaráis; níl gá a thuilleadh leis an bhforáil sin toisc go mbeidh Coiste Meastóireachta á bhunú chun breithniú a dhéanamh ar thograí de chuid an údaráis os cionn leibhéal cúnaimh áirithe &ndash; tograí le cúnamh den mhéid i gceist leo ar gá cead an Aire dóibh faoin reachtaíocht atá i bhfeidhm faoi láthair. Baioneann alt 11 den Phríomh-Acht le feidhmeanna de chuid an údaráis i dtaca le hoiliúint oibrithe a aistriú ón údarás chun na Comhairle Oiliúna (FÁS anois) dá socrófaí ar a leithéid a dhéanamh. Níor baineadh feidhm as an bhforáil sin riamh agus, toisc nach bhfuil gá leis, táthar á haisghairm. Maidir le mír 8 den Chéad Sceideal a ghabhann leis an bPríomh-Acht a bhaineann le nochtadh leasa táthar á haisghairm toisc go bhfuil forálacha nua cuimsitheacha á gcur in áit na bhforálacha i mír 8 le halt a 12 den Bhille seo.</P>
    <P>Is forálacha caighdeánacha atá anseo maidir le tosach feidhme, gearrtheideal agus comhlua. I dtaca le tosach feidhme de tá gá le foráil mar seo ionas go mbeidh ar chumas an Aire lá nó laethanata a cheapadh le hordú nó le horduithe d'fhorálacha sonracha den Bhille arna achtú don theacht i bhfeidhm, mar shampla, leasú ar alt 10 den Phríomh-Acht (teorainneacha le haghaidh cúnamh airgid ón údarás), bunú coistí reigiúnda agus Coiste Meastóireachta.</P>
    <P>Leis an mBille seo beidh an t-údarás &ndash; an eagraíocht fhorbartha réigiúnach don Ghaeltacht  &ndash; á neartú, beidh an bonn daonlathach faoi á leathnú agus beifear á threalmhú don dúshlán mór atá roimhe i mblianta tosaigh na Mílaoise nua.</P>
    <P>Faoi mar is eol don Teach mhéadaigh an tAcht um Údarás na Gaeltachta (Leasú), 1999, an tréimhse ama incheadaithe is faide idir thoghcháin don údarás ó chúig bliana go dtí cúig bliana agus sé mhí. Ciallaíonn sé sin go gcaithfidh an chéad toghchán eile a bheith ann roimh 9 Nollaig seo <Col N="61" /> chugainn. Ach an Bille seo a bheith rite, beimid in ann díriú ar na socruithe don toghchán, dáta a roghnú, srl. Bheadh sé mar aidhm agam an toghchán a rith roimh dheireadh mhí na Samhna. Ní miste a rá freisin go bhfuil rialacháin leasaithe toghchánaíochta á ndréachtú ag mo Roinn faoi láthair. Beidh gá le rún a rith i ndhá Theach an Oireachtais chun feidhm a thabhairt dóibh. Tá gá le huasdátú a dhéanamh ar na rialacháin atá ann mar gheall ar na leasuithe atá déanta sa chód toghchánaíochta le tamall anuas.</P>
    <P>Cé go bhfuil éileamh á dhéanamh ag comhaltaí an údaráis ar dháta an toghcháin a chur siar arís sílim gur cheart dom glacadh le toil an Oireachtais faoi mar a léiríodh é san Acht um Údarás na Gaeltachta (Leasú), 1999, a ritheadh i mí na Bealtaine.</P>
    <P>Molaim an Bille don Teach.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is cosúil nach bhfuil mórán suime ag lucht na meán cumarsáide i gcúrsaí Gaeltachta, ní fheicim mórán díobh thart. B'fhéidir go bhfuil siad ag éisteacht in áit éigin eile.</P>
      <P>Fáiltím roimh an mBille seo agus aontaím le cuid dá bhfuil ann. Bhí mé féin anseo i 1979 nuair a ritheadh an Príomh-Acht tríd an Dáil. Ba é a bhí i gceist leis go mbunófaí údarás a mbeadh tacaíocht aige agus a chuirfeadh ar chumas mhuintir na Gaeltachta saol a bheith acu sa Ghaeltacht le cúrsaí eacnamaíochta feabhsaithe ionas go mbeidh obair ann dóibh féin agus dá bpáistí. Ag déanamh aithbhreithnithe ar obair an údaráis go dtí seo, is léir go bhfuil an-obair déanta i nGaeltachtaí áirithe ach nach fíor sin i ngach áit. Is dócha go raibh brú polaitíochta i gceist i gcás na nGaeltachtaí móra i nDún na nGall, Conamara agus i gCiarraí agus i gcuid de na Gaeltachtaí eile &ndash; sa Mhí, i gCorcaigh agus i gContae Mhuige Eo &ndash; níl aon scéal chomh maith sin. Tá níos mó ná 1,400 duine ag obair faoi láthair i dtionscail áirithe i nGaoth Dobhair agus sa chontae i gcoitinne. Is maith sin agus ní bheadh na jabanna sin ann ach go raibh an t-údarás ábalta fostóirí a mhealladh isteach sna ceantair sin.</P>
      <P>Bunaíodh an t-údarás chun forbairt eacnamaíochta a chur ar bun sa Ghaeltacht taobh istigh de na limistéir atá leagtha amach sa Acht. Nuair a bhreathnaítear ar an mBille, feictear dúinn nár éirigh leis an údarás i ngach Gaeltacht. Ba mhaith liom níos mó béime a fheiceáil ar an bprionsabal ar a bunaíodh an t-údarás an chéad lá riamh. Ar leathanach 8 de ráiteas an Aire, tá sé ráite go bhfuil 35,983 dhuine ina gcónaí i nGaeltacht na Gaillimhe, go bhfuil 11,494 dhuine i nGaeltachtaí i Muigh Eo, arís de réir an daonáirimh. Tá a fhios againn uilig nach bhfuil Gaeilge ar bith ag cuid mhaith de na daoine seo atá luaite anseo. Tuigeann gach duine é sin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Má bunaíodh an t-údarás chun an Ghaeltacht a fhorbairt, is léir gur éirigh leis an eacnamaíocht a fhorbairt cuid mhaith ach nár éirigh leis forbairt a dhéanamh ar an teanga nó ar an gcultúr. Tá an cás ag éirí níos measa i gcónaí mar tá níos mó daoine i gcónaí ag tógáil tithe laistigh de na limis<Col N="62" /> téir Ghaeltachta agus gan Gaeilge acu ná meas ar an teanga.</P>
    <P>Táimid ag déanamh athstruchtúrú ar an údarás chun go leanfaidh sé leis an obair a tugadh dó ach níl smacht ar bith aige ar chuid de na daoine atá ina gcónaí taobh istigh de na Gaeltachtaí. Cuid mhaith de na daoine atá ina gcónaí sna limistéir Ghaeltachta anois, níl suim dá laghad acu i gcúrsaí Gaeilge nó in Údarás na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Aontaím leis an Aire go bhfuil sé níos féaráilte go mbeadh ionadaíocht níos mó ag na limistéir bheaga Ghaeltachta. B'fhéidir go mba chóir go mbeadh triúr ag Contae Mhuigh Eo ach tuigim an chaoi ar roinneadh na figiúirí. Ba mhaith liom go gcuirfeadh an tAire Stáit ainmneacha na limistéar nó na townlands a mbeidh cead vótála acu sa chéad toghchán eile os comhair an Tí. Caithfidh sé díriú ar an ábhar go mbeidh an chuid is mó de na daoine atá i dteideal vótála gan suim i gcúrsaí Gaeilge ná i gcúrsaí an údaráis. Sin fadhb atá agamsa leis an údarás. Ba chóir dó díriú ar chúrsaí cultúir agus teanga chomh maith le tionscal. B'in an chúis a bunaíodh é.</P>
    <P>Ní aontaím leis an gcoiste meastóireachta atá luaite sa Bhille. Bhí mé féin im' Aire sa Rialtas deiridh agus nuair a thagann proposal ón Aire Gaeltachta faoi bhráid an Rialtais, cuirtear ar aghaidh é go dtí na rannaí Stáit agus tagann sé ar ais le go ndéanfaí cinneadh faoi. Leis an gCoiste Meastóireachta, tá an chumhacht á tarraingt ar ais ón údarás. Tá na baill ar an údarás tofa, déanann siad togra a mheas agus cé go ndeir an tAire Stáit go bhfuil obair mhaith déanta ag an údarás le fiche bliain anuas, an mbeidh siad níos fearr as leis an gCoiste Meastóireachta seo? Nach bhfuil sé ar chumas na mball seo proposal a mheas? Seans nach n-aontódh an t-údarás agus an coiste le chéile i gcónaí ach tá sé deacair go leor faoi láthair tionscal ar bith a mhealladh isteach sa Ghaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Feictear domsa go bhfuil cúnamh agus cumhacht á thabhairt don údarás ach nach bhfuil cead acu cinneadh a dhéanamh maidir le togra ach go gcaithfear é a chur ar aghaidh go dtí an coiste meastóireachta seo.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis na coistí réigiúnda, is anseo a bhí deacrachtaí polaitíochta ag an údarás le blianta fada. Bhí cead ag na coistí réigiúnda neamhoifigiúla seo cinntí a dhéanamh faoi airgead a thabhairt do thionsclóirí cé nach mbeadh i láthair ag cruinnithe uaireanta ach beirt nó triúr.</P>
    <P>Tá a fhios agam mar iar-Aire gur maith an rud é gur tháinig an Teachta Ó hUiginn isteach sa Rialtas ag an am sin agus gur léirigh sé do na hairí a bhí ag freastal ar na cruinnithe sin cad é a bhí ag teastáil uaidh maidir le forbairt na Gaeltachta de nó maidir le cinneadh ar bith. Má chuirtear an coiste meastóireachta seo agus nach dtagann go dtí an Rialtas faoi thogra Gaeltachta ach ráiteas ón Aire Airgeadais nó ón Aire Fiontair agus Fostaíochta, ní bheidh an blas agus an meon céanna le fáil is a bheadh le fáil ón Aire Gaeltachta. Rachaidh an chumhacht pholaitiúil i léig nuair nach mbíonn an tAire Gaeltachta ag labhairt ar an ábhar. Deir sé anseo go mbeidh Airí eile ag <Col N="63" /> freastal ar an gCoiste Meastóireachta agus nach mbeidh an tionchar céanna ag an Aire Gaeltachta is atá aige faoi láthair ach deirtear liom anseo anois go mbeidh.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is maith sin. Ach má tá na coistí réigiúnacha neamhoifigiúla seo le bunú go hoifigiúil, ba mhaith liom go leagfaí coinníollacha síos dóibh ionas nach mbeadh ráflaí le clos ar fud Gaeltachtaí áirithe go bhfuil Aire nó Teachta áirithe airgead ón údarás do phroposal seafóideach.</P>
      <P>Mar Theachta ón Iarthar, tá sé fíorthábhachtach go mbeadh an Rialtas seo in ann cúnamh agus tacaíocht a thabhairt do mhuintir na Gaeltachta chun saol maith a chaitheamh ina n-áit dhúchais. Ba chóir don Aire Stáit taispeáint don tír cad é is Gaeltacht ann agus cad atá á dhéanamh aige faoi na limistéir Ghaeltachta nach bhfuil Gaeilge á labhairt iontu. Freisin, ó thaobh an toghcháin de, tá na baill tofa nár chóir go mbeadh an toghchán ann i mbliana mar go mbeidh an aimsir go dona um Shamhna. Anuraidh bhí an aimsir go breá ag an tráth sin. Má tá suim ag daoine sa ghnó, tiocfaidh siad amach. Beimid ag labhairt leo go gairid agus níl a fhios agam an gcuirfidh mé leasú síos.</P>
      <P>B'fhearr le gach duine toghchán a chur ar an mhéar fhada. Cuireadh an Acht tríd an Oireachtas i mbliana agus tá sé leagtha síos ann go gcaithfidh toghchán a bheith ann go luath ach b'fhéidir go mba fearr é a fhágáil go dtí an samhradh.</P>
      <P>Tá cumhachtaí nua á thabhairt don Aire anseo ordacháin a thabhairt don údarás agus ba mhaith liom samplaí agus soiléiriú ar seo. B'fhéidir gur gnáthrud é seo agus go mba chóir dó a bheith ann.</P>
      <P>Nuair a bheas an Bille seo rite beidh na baill nua ag freastal ar údarás nua. Caithfidh siad a thuiscint nach mbeidh aon chumhacht bhreise acu, go bhfuil Gaeltachtaí ann atá ar bheagán Gaeilge agus nach bhfuil suim ag na daoine iontu i gcúrsaí Gaeilge, agus go bhfuil sé i bhfad níos deacra anois tionsclóirí agus infheisteoirí a mhealladh isteach i nGaeltachtaí anois.</P>
      <P>Tá sé leagtha síos ag an Aontas Eorpach go bhfuil cuid mhaith den tír seo faoi mhíbhuntáiste ó thaobh infrastruchtúr de. Dúirt BSL le gairid nach bhfuil an líne cumhachta go dtí iarthar na hÉireann leagtha síos agus nach bhfuil sé ar chumas an údaráis tionscail a mhealladh go dtí an Ghaeltacht cheal aibhléise.</P>
      <P>Tá mianadóireacht ar siúl faoi láthair ar Chiumhais an Atlantaigh agus i nGort an Choirib agus beidh gás nádúrtha ag teach i dtír, b'fhéidir trí cheantar Gaeltachta, agus ba cheart go leagfar síos sa phlean náisiúnta a fhoilseofar go luath go mbeadh baint ag an údarás leis an bhforbairt seo, ionas go mbeadh an chumhacht riachtanach acu chun tionsclóirí a mhealladh isteach ón Eoraip. Muna ndeirtear é sin go soiléir sa phlean, ní bheidh an t-údarás in ann an jab atá beartaithe ag an Aire Stáit dóibh a dhéanamh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="64" /> Beidh mé ag éisteacht leis an díospóireacht agus socróidh mé roimh chéim an choiste an gcuirfidh mé leasú síos.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea:</NameTxt>
      <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh an mBille seo agus mar ionadaí do Dháilcheantar Phort Láirge tá áthas orm go mbeidh ball tofa ag Gaeltacht na Rinne ar an gcéad údarás eile.</P>
      <P>Nuair a cuireadh an Bille deiridh os comhair na Dála níos luaithe i mbliana, luaigh an tAire Stáit go mbeadh reachtú cuimsitheach ag teacht. Ní dóigh liom gur Bille cuimsitheach an Bille seo. Beidh cúrsaí daonlathais níos fearr ann ach níl aon chumhachtaí nua á tabhairt don údarás.</P>
      <P>An Coiste Meastóireachta seo, deirtear go mbeidh baill an choiste seo inniúil ar ghnó an choiste sin a sheoladh i nGaeilge. An rud atá ait mar gheall air sin, má fhéachtar siar ar Bhille 1997 don údarás, níl dualgas ar bhaill an údaráis ná ar fhoireann an údaráis Gaeilge a bheith acu ach tá sé curtha isteach anseo don Choiste Meastóireachta. Ba mhaith liom soiléiriú ón Aire Stáit ar seo.</P>
      <P>Rud a ghoilleann ormsa go bhfuil sé i gceist go mbeadh cumhacht veto ag an gCoiste Meastóireachta seo, ar dhá shlí. Muna bhfuil an coiste sásta togra éigin a mholadh, beidh deireadh leis an togra agus ní féidir leis an údarás níos mó airgid a thabhairt do thogra ar bith ná mar a cheadaíonn an coiste. Ar an tslí sin, feictear domsa go bhfuil cumhacht an údaráis á laghdú. Beidh sé níos daonlathaí mar údarás ach fós beidh sé faoi stiúir ag fo-choiste neamhthofa.</P>
      <P>Rud eile a ghoilleann orm ná má fhéachtar an seanBhille, go dtí seo bhí beirt ó Dhún na Gall, triúr ó Ghaillimh, Muigh Eo agus ón Mhí agus beirt ón deisceart. Bhí triúr de na baill tofa ag teacht ó Dháilcheantair an Aire Stáit. Anois, beidh naonúr ag teacht ón na contaetha céanna agus tá a chontae féin ag déanamh go maith as. Tá an tAire tar éis athrú bunúsach a dhéanamh ar an gcothromaíocht.</P>
      <P>Cén fáth go gcaithfidh sé a bheith de chumhacht ag an Aire beirt agus an Cathaoirleach a ainmniú uaidh seo amach? Cén fáth nach féidir le pobal na Gaeltachta an Cathaoirleach a thoghadh? Tá sé sin tábhachtach don daonlathas. Más rud é go bhfuil an tAire i bhfách an daonlathais, cén fáth nach dtoghtar gach ball?</P>
      <P>Ba cheart go mbeadh comhalta ar an údarás ó na ceardchumainn, rud atá thar a bheith tábhachtach inniu. Ba chóir go mbeadh ionadaíocht ar an údarás ag oibrithe an údaráis mar lánbhaill. Tá daoine ag obair don údarás agus sin iad na daoine a chuireann na socruithe agus na cinntí i bhfeidhm. Tá sé thar a bheith tábhachtach go mbeadh seans acu an t-eolas agus an taithí sin a thabhairt go dtí an bord.</P>
      <P>Níl aon rud anseo mar gheall ar pháirt níos mó a thabhairt do mhná na Gaeltachta i ngnóthaí an údaráis, ar an gCoiste Meastóireachta nó ar aon fho-choiste eile. Ba mhaith go ndéanfadh an tAire rud éigin dearfa faoi seo chun áit a thabhairt do mhná de cheart. Baineann sé seo leis na boird Stáit go léir.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="65" /> Níl an t-údarás cosúil le boird Stáit eile mar tá mandate an-leathan acu. Cuid den mandate sin ná go bhfuil sé de dhualgas ar an údarás an Ghaoluinn a chaomhnú agus a fhorbairt mar mheán cumarsáide sna Gaeltachtaí. Ní dóigh liom go bhfuil ag éirí leo. Níl ag éirí leo &ndash; tá an mhalairt ag tarlú. Sin an rud is tábhachtaí &ndash; an Ghaeilge a chaomhnú agus a fhorbairt.</P>
    <P>Bhí an tAire Stáit ag caint sa Dáil i mbliana faoi scéim atá aige chun déileáil le teorainn na Gaeltachta. Tá sé i gceist aige go mbeadh caighdeán teanga ann do gach Gaeltacht agus áiteanna sa Ghaeltacht nach bhfuil sin ann ag an nóiméad, go mbeadh seans acu teacht aníos go dtí an caighdeán sin. Ba chóir go mbeadh an seans céanna ag áiteanna atá cóngarach don nó taobh istigh den Ghaeltach má theastaíonn uathu.</P>
    <P>Caint atá sáite againn go dtí seo. Ní bheidh aon athrú ar theorainn na Gaeltachta le linn saol an Rialtais seo ach ní féidir linn fanacht bliain nó dhó. Más rud é go bhfuil áiteanna sa Ghaeltacht nach fíor-Ghaeltachtaí iad, ba cheart tabhairt faoi sin láithreach, agus más rud é go mbeadh reigiún cóngarach don Ghaeltacht, nó in aon áit ar fud na tíre, a ba mhaith leis cailíocht na Gaeltachta, sin seans a ba chóir dó a fháil. Ba mhaith liom rud dearfach a chloisteáil ón Aire Stáit faoi seo mar go dtí seo níl ann ach caint agus fadhb í seo atá práinneach go ndéanfar réiteach uirthi.</P>
    <P>Ó thaobh an choiste mheastaíochta agus an dualgas ar na baill go mbeidís in ann a gcuid oibre a dhéanamh frid an Ghaeilge, cé bheadh mar scrúdaitheoir air sin? Cé a dhéarfadh &ldquo;tá sin ag an chaighdeán atá ag teastáil ach níl sin&rdquo;? Sin gné eile den rud céanna ach cuireann sé ionadh orm nach bhfuil sé riachtanach ar na baill agus ar na hoibrithe sa reachtaíocht go mbeadh go leor Gaeilge acu go bhféadfaidís a gcuid oibre a dhéanamh frid an Ghaeilge.</P>
    <P>Nach bhfuil sé in am go mbeadh cumhachtaí níos leithne ag an údáras, go speisialta ó thaobh comharthaí oifige, foilseachán agus foirmeacha a bhíonn á gcur amach ag comhairlí condae nó cibé údáras áitiúil atá ann? Cén fáth nach bhfuil an Rialtas sásta, mar ceapaim go bhfuil an t-Aire Stáit sásta, i bhfad níos mó cumhacht a thabhairt don údáras? Níl sin ag tarlú.</P>
    <P>Bhí díospóireacht againn i mbliana faoi paitsí talún chun tithe a thógáil sa Ghaeltacht. Tá sin thar a bheith deacair a dhéanamh anois do na daoine ag a bhfuil an Ghaeilge acu ó dhúchas a chónaíonn sa Ghaeltacht. Is ceart go mbeadh banc talún ag an údáras sa Ghaeltacht sa dóigh is go mbeadh ionad ann chun foirgnimh a thógáil do thionscal ar bith, go mbeadh go leor talún ar fáil go bhféadfadh an comhairle contae tithe a thógáil sa Ghaeltacht agus go mbeadh paistí talún ar fáil do mhuintir na Gaeltachta ar phraghas a thiocfadh leo a íoc, agus as sin, á mealladh chun fanacht ina gcónaí ina n-áit dúchais nuair a bheidh siad pósta nó clann acu.</P>
    <P>Níl an ceardchumannachas láidir go leor sna tionscail atá bunaithe sa Ghaeltacht. Níl sin maith do na daoine a bhíonn ag obair sna comhlachtaí úd. An rud a thagann leis sin ná nach mbíonn an <Col N="66" /> pá ard go leor i gcuid dena monarchain. Ba cheart go mbeadh sé mar pholasaí ag an údáras go mbeadh an ceard-chumannachas i bhfad níos láidre sa Ghaeltacht agus mar gheall air sin go mbeadh feabhas ar shaol na ndaoine a bhíonn ag obair sna tionscail éagsúla atá bunaithe ann.</P>
    <P>Tá mé buartha faoina coistí poiblí a bhíonn sa Ghaeltacht. Ba cheart go mbeadh scéim ag an údáras cabhair a thabhairt dona fochoistí poiblí seo &ndash; rúnaí páirtaimseartha, oiliúint agus mar sin de. Caithfidh an t-údáras bheith an-ghnóthach sa mhéid sin as seo amach.</P>
    <P>Is rud é a dhéanann an-damáiste don Ghaeltacht ná nuair a fhaigheann mic léinn áitiúla cailíochtaí sna hollscoileanna agus coláistí reigiúnacha, ní bhíonn go leor postanna ar fáil sa Ghaeltacht leo sa dóigh is go mbeadh siad in ann filleadh ar a n-áit dúchais. Déanann sin an-dochar don Ghaeltacht mar tá an Ghaeltacht ag cailleadh daoine óga a mbeadh ar a gcumas an-chuid a dhéanamh don phobal dá mba rud é go raibh siad ina gcónaí sa Ghaeltacht. Tá na tionscail ann ach níl go leor acu fóirsteanach dóibh.</P>
    <P>Nuair a bhíonn Ranna Stáit á gcur timpeall na tíre, tá sé tabhachtach go cuirfí cuid acu isteach sa Ghaeltacht i dtreo is go mbeadh níos mó postanna ar fáil, postanna le pá maith &ndash; an t-airgead a bheadh ag teacht isteach don Ghaeltacht, chabhródh sin leis an eacnamaíocht. Sin rud a ba cheart d'Údarás na Gaeltachta i bhfad níos mó béime a leagan air. Ach ní féidir leis an t-údarás mórán a dhéanamh muna mbíonn tacaíocht acu ón Rialtas.</P>
    <P>Rud nach bhfuil luaite sa Bhille seo agus bhí mé ag súil go mbeadh rud éigin le rá faoi ann agus sin an Rannóg Cultúir agus Teanga. Is é caomhnú na teanga an rud is tábhachtaí cé go bhfuil an tionsclaíocht ag teastáil do chaighdeán maireachtála sásúil. I rith an tsamhraidh thug mé faoi deara nach raibh ainm Gaeilge ach ar shiopa amháin i sráid d'ocht siopaí nó mar sin i sráidbhaile Gaeltachta. Cad is cúis leis seo?</P>
    <P>Tá comharthaí áirithe ag léiriú domsa go bhfuil an eacnamaíocht agus an turasóireacht níos tábhachtaí ná caomhnú agus forbairt na Gaoluinne. Conas mar is féidir leis an údarás a aidhmeanna teanga a bhaint amach? Tá gá le teagmháil níos fearr idir an údarás agus na húdaráis áitiúla. Tá gá le fochoistí de na húdaráis áitiúla i gcontaetha Gaeltachta ar a mbeidh baill ón gcomhairle chontae agus ón údarás. Tá na coistí réigiúnda á gcur ar bhonn reachtúil sa reachtaíocht seo ach níl ansin ach cuid den fhreagra. Tá gá le teagmháil níos mó idir na boird sláinte agus an t-údarás agus tá gá le hiachall a chur ar dhaoine dul ina bhun seo.</P>
    <P>Ó thaobh pleanála de, tá daoine ón iasacht ag ceannach tithe sna Gaeltachtaí nó á dtógáil mar thithe samhraidh agus ar an lámh eile de, tá sé deacair ar aos óg na Gaeltachta teach a cheannach ina ndúiche féin. Muna mbíonn tionchar ag muintir na Gaeltachta ar chúrsaí pleanála nuair atá an plean contae á shocrú, leanfaidh an scéal mar atá mar níl aon srian á chur leis an gcineál forbartha a luaigh mé thuas.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="67" /> Léigh mé sa nuachtán go bhfuil an tAire Stáit ag dul i gcomhar le haos óg na Gaeltachta agus molaim áit a thabhairt don aos óg ar an údarás chun go mbeidh siad páirteach sa phleanáil fhadtéarmach a bhíonn ar bun. Bíonn tuairimí ag daoine óga uaireanta nach dtagann le tuairimí an establishment ach tagann athruithe ar an saol agus is minic gur i dtreo thuairimí na ndaoine óga na hathruithe seo. Bheadh an t-údarás níos fearr as ach tuairimí an aosa óig a bhreith leis.</P>
    <P>Maidir le leathanach 9, alt 4B, mar gheall ar institiúidí an Aontais Eorpaigh, ní thuigim i gceart ón méid atá anseo an mbeidh an t-údarás in ann déileáil leis na hinstitiúidí sin iad féin nó an mbeidh lámh ag an Aire Airgeadais ann? D'fhéadfaí an rud atá anseo a léamh ar dhá bhealach. Cén fáth nach mbeadh sé de cheart ag an údarás dul chun cainte leis an Eoraip maidir le scéimeanna a dhéanfadh maitheas don nGaeltacht gan aon chur isteach ó éinne eile? B'fhéidir go ndéarfadh an tAire Stáit linn cad atá i gceist san alt seo.</P>
    <P>Fáiltím roimh an reachtaíocht agus roimh an fheabhas i gcúrsaí daonlathais ach bhí mé ag súil le níos mó ón mBille seo. Beidh seans againn leasuithe a dhéanamh air ag Céim an Choiste chun é a fheabhsú. Níl díospóireacht fhorleathan ag tarlú áit ar bith mar gheall ar an nGaoluinn. Tá daoine tar éis casadh uaithi, daoine eile a bhfuil fuath acu di de bharr rudaí a tharla dóibh ar scoil.</P>
    <P>Ba chóir go mbeadh díospóireacht ann a leathnódh an tuiscint atá ann ar shaibhreas na teanga agus an chultúir. Tá gá le foclóir nua-aimseartha agus d'fhéadfadh an t-údarás ceann a chur le chéile. De réir na reachtaíochta seo, beidh sé de chumhacht ag an Aire ordú a thabhairt don údarás rudaí ginearálta a dhéanamh.</P>
    <P>Roimh an tsamhraidh, dúirt an tAire sa Teach seo go mbeadh an foclóir á leathnú. B'fhéidir go bhfuil ach faoi láthair níl aon fhoclóir againn a d'fhéadfadh mac léinn gach téarma a fháil ann. Tá an-chuid téarmaí ag teacht isteach sa Bhéarla agus sa Ghaeilge ón teicneolaíocht nua.</P>
    <P>I mbliana ba léir ó thorthaí an Teastais Shóisearaigh go bhfuil caighdeán na Gaeilge ag titim. Tá i bhfad níos mó ag teastáil ó thaobh foclóra agus ba mhaith go n-iarrfadh an tAire Stáit ar an údarás nua rud éigin a dhéanamh faoi.</P>

      <P>Tá lúcháir orm an Bille seo a fheiceáil os comhair na Dála agus ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil leis an Aire Stáit as an tacaíocht a thug sé do thionscail sa Ghaeltacht, don údarás, do mhuintir na Gaeltachta agus do mhuintir na n-oileán. Ní mór leanacht ar aghaidh leis an obair mhaith.</P>
      <P>Tá fiche bliain imithe thart ó ritheadh an Príomh-Acht. Níorbh eol dom go raibh mo chomhTheachta ó Chontae Mhuigh Eo anseo ag an am.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ó cuireadh tús le h-Údarás na Gaeltachta tá cuidiú agus saol úr tugtha aige don Ghaeltacht. I <Col N="68" /> nGaeltacht Thír Chonaill, tá 400 duine fostaithe in eastát tionsclaíochta Ghaoth Dobhair. Ní bheadh duine ar bith acu siúd ag obair i dTír Chonaill murach Údarás na Gaeltachta. Tá na mílte punt ag teacht isteach sa cheantar gach seachtain dá bharr agus gan é ní bheadh an daonra sin sa cheantar agus bheadh meath mór tagtha ar ár dteanga dúchais.</P>
    <P>Go minic, d'éirigh leis an údarás de bhrí go raibh sé áitiúil agus gur thacaigh sé le grúpaí áitiúla a bhí ag iarraidh tionscal a bhunú ina gceantar féin. Bhí comhoibriú ann i gcónaí idir na coistí paróiste, baill na gcomhairlí contae, na Teachtaí Dála agus Údarás na Gaeltachta. Tá an t-údarás an-tábhachtach dúinne i dTír Chonaill mar go n-éistíonn siad le muintir na Gaeltachta. D'aithin an t-údarás na riachtanaisí áitiúla agus bhí siad sásúil airgead a chur ar fáil chun seirbhísí mar an aerstráice ag Carraig Fhinne agus báid fharantóireachta a chur i gcrích. Cuidíonn an aerstráice go mór leis an gcontae. Bhíodh daoine ag gearán nuair a luadh é i dtosach ach is cuidiú mór é do thionscal agus do thurasóireacht na Gaeltachta agus an chontae. Tá súil agam go leanfar leis an tseirbhís go dtí Baile Átha Cliath agus go dtí Glaschú agus go n-eireoidh freisin le hAer Árann.</P>
    <P>Léirigh an tascfórsa a bunaíodh i mí an Mheithimh go bhfuil infrastruchtúr de dhíth ar an nGaeltacht fós  &ndash; uisce, séarachas agus deisiú bóithre. Tá daoine bréan de bheith ag éisteacht liomsa ag gearán faoin N56, faoin mbóthar ó na Cealla Beaga go dtí Gleann Cholmcille agus faoin mbóthar ar chúl an Eireagail. Tá feabhas air ach tá go leor le déanamh. Táimid buíoch den Aire Stáit as an airgead a cuireadh ar fáil le déanaí don bhóthar ón gCarraig go Gleann Cholmcille agus ar an N56 ag Dún Lúiche. Cuidíonn sé sin leis an infrastruchtúr Gaeltachta ach tá gá fós le córais uisce agus séarachais do na heastáit thionsclaíochta chun an fostú iontu a mhéadú. Is é an turas ó Litir Ceanainn go Gaoth Dobhair, ó Chill Chártha agus an Charraig chuig na Cealla Beaga an gearán is mó a bhíonn ag lucht an eastáit thionsclaíochta. Tá súil againn go mbeidh comhoibriú anois idir Roinn an Aire Stáit agus Comhairle Chontae Dhún na nGall, anois go bhfuil na deontais ann don obair.</P>
    <P>De réir an Bhille, beidh ionadaíocht níos mó ag pobal na Gaeltachta ar an údarás amach anseo. Is eol do mhuintir na háite cad iad na riachtanaisí is mó ach ag an am céanna feictear dom nach bhfuil an uimhríocht cothrom. Ag éisteacht le leathanach trí d'óráid an Aire, dúradh go raibh ceantair bheaga Gaeltachta ag gearán nach mbíonn ionadaíocht acu ar an údarás. Ag éirí as an mBille seo tá an tAire Stáit ag rá go leigheasfar an scéal seo. Ach i mo chontae ní aontaíonn muintir na Gaeltachta leis an tuairim sin. Tá an contae mór agus tá na ceithre phobal Gaeltachta ann scaipthe ó chéile. Beidh ar a laghad pobal amháin ann nach mbeidh aon ionadaí acu agus an am céanna beidh seisear ionadaí ann ó Ghaeltacht na Gaillimhe. <Col N="69" /> Tá míshástacht mhór i measc mhuintir Ghaeltacht Thír Chonaill. Níl duine ar bith ón nGaeltacht Lár nó ó Ghaeltacht Chill Chartha ar an gcomhairle chontae. Ní thoghfar duine ón nGaeltacht beag sin ar ar údarás mar tá pobail níos mó ag na Gaeltachtaí eile sa chontae. Tá mé ag iarraidh ar an Aire an Bille a athrú ionas go mbeidh seisear againn i dTír Chonaill agus cúigear ag Gaeltacht na Gaillimhe. Thabharfadh sin guth do mhuintir uilig na Gaeltachta. Deir cuid acu nach bhfuil guth acu faoi láthair agus nach bhfuil fostaíocht acu dá bharr agus ba chóir guth a thabhairt do na Gaeltachtaí beaga. Tá brú ar chuid de na tionscail sna ceantair sin agus níl an t-infrastruchtúr á chur ar fáil do thionscail úra sa Ghaeltacht Lár, i mBaile na Finne, sa Chlochán, i gCill Chartha, i nGleann Cholmcille agus sa Charraig.</P>
    <P>Tá an tAire Stáit ag smaoineamh, is cosúil, ar thoghchán a reáchtáil i mí na Samhna nó ag tús na Nollag. Dúirt a lán daoine liom ag an deireadh seachtaine go mba fearr fanacht go dtí lár an earraigh. Tá daoine tuirseach tar éis na toghcháin áitiúla agus is cosúil go mbeidh fo-thoghchán ann i mBaile Átha Cliath. Tá a fhios ag an Aire Stáit go mbeidh sé dorcha go luath i lár an gheimhridh agus go mbeidh sé deacair dul amach ag canbhasáil ag an tráth sin den bhliain.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis na tionscail thraidisiúnta éadaí agus mar sin de atá againn sa Ghaeltacht, is dóigh liom go bhfuil siad ag dul i léig. Tá daoine óga an cheantair oilte sa teicneolaíocht  &ndash; tá coláiste teicneolaíochta againn i Litir Ceanainn  &ndash; agus níl na daoine óga ag fanacht sa Ghaeltacht. Tá sé in am don údarás níos mó béime a chur ar na tionscail úra seo  &ndash; teileachumarsáid, IT agus mar sin de  &ndash; ionas go mbeidh na daoine óga in ann fanacht ann agus saibhreas na teanga a choimeád ann.</P>
    <P>Tá infrastruchtúr eile de dhíth orainn sa Ghaeltacht freisin &ndash; línte ISDN, fibroptic cable agus cumhacht leictreachais i bhfad níos airde ná mar atá ann faoi láthair. In iardheisceart Thír Chonaill, níl ach cumhacht 38Kw ag dul isteach sna ceantair agus ní leor é sin chun solas a choinneáil lasta gan trácht ar innealltóireacht agus mar sin de. Tá sé práinneach anois an t-infrastruchtúr nua-aimseartha a chur ar fáil sna Gaeltachtaí agus an sean-infrastruchtúr &ndash; bóithre agus eile  &ndash; a fheabhsú.</P>
    <P>Is cinnte go mbeidh guth níos láidre ag muintir na Gaeltachta amach anseo cé go mbeidh daoine tofa ar an mbord. Tá sárobair déanta ag an mbord atá ann faoi láthair agus tá seirbhís mhaith faighte againn uathu. Tá súil agam go mbeidh cumhachtaí níos mó ag an údarás amach anseo agus go mbeidh níos mó cuidiú ann don teanga. Is trua a rá gur deacair páistí a chloisteáil ag caint Gaeilge nuair a bhíonn siad ag imirt. Tá brú ar an teanga agus tá súil agam go gcaillfear í. Tá saibhreas sa chultúr agus sa Ghaeltacht. Tá scoileanna Gaeltachta ann atá ag fáil níos lú tacaíochta ná na gaelscoileanna lasmuigh den Ghaeltacht. Tá sé in am dúinn an saghas céanna cabhrach a <Col N="70" /> thabhairt do na scoileanna lánGhaeilge sa Ghaeltacht chun an teanga a choimeád beo. Muna mbíonn an teanga ag na daoine óga, ní bheidh sé ann i gceann fiche bliain eile.</P>
    <P>Molaim an Bille go mór. Tá go leor déanta ag an údarás le fiche bliain agus tá go leor le déanamh acu chun fostaíocht úr a chur ar fáil i mo cheantar féin. Ba mhór an chailliúint é Fruit of the Loom. Buíochas le Dia tá fostaíocht nua ag teacht isteach. Ach tá dífhostaíocht an-mhór i dTír Chonaill agus táimid ag iarraidh ar Údarás na Gaeltachta rud éigin a dhéanamh chun níos mó fostaíochta a chur ar fáil sna Gaeltachtaí Lár agus fosta seirbhísí a chur ar fáil do mhuintir na Gaeltachta. Nílimid ach ag iarraidh cothrom na Féinne a fháil.</P>
    <P>Molaim an Bille go mór agus tá súil agam gur éist an tAire Stáit leis an méid a bhí le rá agam maidir leis na baill tofa ar bhord an údaráis, go mbeadh cúigear ann agus b'fhéidir go mbeadh sé in ann an toghchán a chur siar go dtí an t-earrach.</P>
    <P>Táim ag iarraidh ar dhaoine óga agus ar mhná a gcuid ainmneacha a chur os comhair na bpáirtithe éagsúla chun go dtoghfaí níos mó daoine óga agus ban agus go mbeadh guth láidir acu ar an údarás.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom mo chuid ama a roinnt leis an Teachta Creed má tá sin ceart go leor.</P>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimh an Bille agus is iontach an rud é an chéad lá ar ais i ndiaidh laethanta saoire an tsamhraidh go bhfuil Bille Údarás na Gaeltachta ag dul tríd an Dáil. Ní shílim gur ró-mhinic a chuirtear Bille tríd an Dáil a bhfuil an chuid is mó den díospóireacht air i nGaeilge.</P>
      <P>Seo an dara Bille um Údarás na Gaeltachta a cuireadh os comhair na Dála i mbliana. Bhí an ceann deireanach againn roimh an tsamhraidh agus ba é a phríomhaidhm ná síneadh ama a thabhairt don Bhord atá ann faoi láthair. Tuigim ó óráid an Aire Stáit go bhfuil go dtí an 20ú Nollaig ag an bhord. Dealraíonn sé go bhfuil a intinn déanta suas ag an Aire Stáit is cuma cad a tharlaíonn sa Dáil agus go mbeidh an toghchán againn i mí na Samhna.</P>
      <P>Tá an dearcadh ann ar fud na Gaeltachta gur chóir an toghchán a chur siar go dtí an bhliain seo chugainn nuair an bheidh an lá níos faide agus an aimsir níos fearr. Sílim go ndéanfaimid athmhachnamh ar dháta an toghcháin ar an dtaobh seo den Teach idir seo agus b'fhéidir an tseachtain seo chugainn nuair a bheidh léargas níos fearr againn maidir leis an aimsir i mí na Samhna.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá sé tráthúil go bhfuil an Bille seo á thabhairt isteach. Bhí sé geallta ag an Aire Stáit le tamall go raibh sé chun bille cuimsitheach a thabhairt isteach, ach níl fhios agam an bhfuil sé chomh cuimsitheach sin ach ar a laghad tá sé istigh. Tá sé tráthúil go bhfuil an Bille againn ag an am seo mar tá an t-údarás ag feidhmiú anois le 20 bliain. <Col N="71" /> Chuaigh an t-údarás i mbun dualgaisí ar an gcéad lá de mhí Eanáir 1980. Tá athruithe móra tagtha ar na Gaeltachtaí uilig idir an dá linn. Ba é Gaeltarra Éireann a bhí againn roimh an údarás agus ba iad an chéad dream a rinne iarracht fiúntach fostaíocht a chur ar fáil sa cheantar Gaeltachta againn féin. Ba le linn réimeas Gaeltarra a bunaíodh eastát tionsclaíochta Ghaoth Dobhair agus maíonn muid uilig agus maíonn an t-údarás féin gurb é sin an seod is loinrí i gcoróin an údaráis. Tá 1,400 duine ag obair ann agus muna mbeadh an eastát tionsclaíochta sin ann bheadh an saol crua sa Ghaeltacht ó thuaidh.</P>
    <P>Idir 1966 agus 1979 a leagadh síos an bunchloch den fhostaíocht a cuireadh ar fáil sa cheantar sin.</P>
    <P>Tuigim ó óráid an Aire Stáit go bhfuil breis agus 8,000 duine sna Gaeltachtaí ar fud na tíre anois fostaithe i dtionscail a fuair cúnamh ón Údarás. Is cinnte muna mbeadh an cúnamh sin ann nach mbeadh an fhostaíocht ann. Dá mbeimis ag brath ar na heagraíochtaí fostaíochta eile a bhfuil cúraimí náisiúnta acu bheimis i gcomórtas maidir le fostaíocht de le Liatroim agus Ros Comán. Mar sin táimid buíoch den údarás agus tugaimid aitheantas dóibh as an méid atá déanta acu ó thaobh na fostaíochta de.</P>
    <P>Ar ndóigh níl an fhostaíocht cothrom ar fud na nGaeltachtaí uilig agus go minic bíonn Gaeltachtaí beaga láidre ó thaobh na Gaeilge agus an chultúir de i gceantair iargúlta agus uaireannta déanann an t-údarás dearmad orthu sin. Smaoiním ar an nGaeltacht Lár i mo cheantar féin in iar-dheisceart an chontae, ceantair ar nós Gleann Cholmcille, Cill Charthaidh agus An Charraig.  Dúnadh monarcha i gCill Charthaidh an tseachtain seo caite agus cailleadh poist ansin. Tá súil agam go ndéanfaidh an tAire Stáit féin agus an t-údarás iarracht speisialta fostaíocht nua a chur isteach sa cheantar sin. Sular tháinig an túdarás chun cinn tá cuimhne agam féin ar am go raibh idir 300 agus 400 duine ag obair i gCill Charthaidh, baile beag Gaeltachta in iar-dheisceart an chontae. Bhí siad ag plé le tionscal an éadaigh, ag sníomh agus ag fíodóireacht agus mar sin de ach sna hochtóidí tháinig athruithe móra agus tá tionscail eile ansin anois gan an oiread céanna daoine ag obair iontu. Níor cuireadh fostaíocht úr ar fáil sa cheantar agus sin ceann de na háiteanna go gcaithfimid díriú air.</P>
    <P>Níl stair na tionsclaíochta nó na fostaíochta thar moladh beirte sa Ghaeltacht Lár agus is minic a bhíonn na daoine ag gearán fosta in iar-thuaisceart an chontae &ndash; Fanaid agus Ros Ghoill &ndash; go bhféadfaí níos mó a dhéanamh dóibh. Sin an t-aon locht a bheadh agam ar an Údarás, nach ndéantar freastal i gcomhnaí ar na ceantair Ghaeltachta uilig.</P>
    <P>Cé go bhfuil fostaíocht curtha ar bun sa Ghaeltacht níl fhios agam an bhfuil an teanga agus an cultúr chomh láidir sa Ghaeltacht agus a bhí siad 20 bliain ó shin. Sílim go bhfuil maolú ag teacht <Col N="72" /> ar an teanga sna ceantair Ghaeltachta uilig. Tá a fhios agam gurb é príomhdhualgas an údaráis fostaíocht a chur ar fáil ach sílim go bhfuil dualgaisí teanga agus cultúir orthu fosta ach níl fhios agam cé chomh domhain nó chomh láidir is atá na dualgaisí sin.</P>
    <P>Sna fiche bliain amach romhainn caithfimid aire níos cúraimí a thabhairt do na gnéithe sin de shaol na Gaeltachta mar má imíonn an teanga ní bheidh aon difríocht idir sinn féin agus an chuid eile den tír. Tá mé cinnte go dtuigeann an tAire Stáit na deacrachtaí mar tá cuid mhaith dá shaol caite aige ina chomhnaí sa Ghaeltacht. Tá súil agam nuair a bheidh an leasú seo déanta go gcuirfear níos mó béime ar an teanga agus ar chúrsaí cultúrtha. Ritheann an tÚdarás féilte agus imeachtaí cultúrtha anseo is ansúd agus bíonn a dtacaíocht ar fáil i gcomhnaí d'fhéilte áitiúla a bhfuil Gaeilge á úsáid ionntu. Bíonn féilte mar sin ar fud na Gaeltachta uilig agus ní bhíonn an túdarás easnamhach i gcúpla céad punt nó mar sin a chur ar fáil. Bíonn toradh maith ar an airgead sin agus caithfimid cur leis san am atá amach romhainn.</P>
    <P>Tá trí athrú bunúsach i gceist ag an Aire Stáit sa Bhille seo. Tá sé i gceist ballraíocht bhord an údaráis a mhéadú ó 13  &ndash; seachtar tofa agus seisear ainmnithe &ndash; go 20 &ndash; 17 tofa agus triúr ainmnithe.</P>
    <P>Tá ceathrar le toghadh ó Thír Chonaill agus seisear ó Ghaeltacht an Aire Stáit agus tabharfaidh mé tacaíocht iomlán don Teachta ar chúl an Aire Stáit má chuireann sí síos rún ag moladh go méadófaí ballraíocht Thír Chonaill ó cheathrar go cúigear. Thabharfadh sin seans níos fearr do Ghaeltachaí beaga ar nós iar-dheisceart an chontae, an Ghaeltacht Lár, Fanaid agus na hoileáin &ndash; agus tá 800 duine ina gcomhnaí ar na hoileáin i dTír Chonaill &ndash;  guth a bheith acu ar an údarás.</P>
    <P>Beidh mé i dteangbháil leis an Teachta Ó Cionnaith féachaint cad is féidir linn a dhéanamh faoi sin.</P>
    <P>Fáiltím leis an gcinneadh an bhallraíocht tofa ginearálta a mhéadú. Leathnaíonn sé bonn daonlathais an údaráis agus beidh cur isteach níos mó ag muintir na Gaeltachta san údarás mar go mbeidh an oiread sin acu le toghadh ar an mbord.</P>
    <P>Iarraim ar an Aire Stáit nuair a bheidh an triúr ball eile á cheapadh aige machnamh a dhéanamh ar Ghaeltachtaí beaga cosúil le hiar-dheisceart Thír Chonaill má bhíonn siad fágtha gan ball tofa taréis an toghcháin.</P>
    <P>An dara athrú mór atá le cur i bhfeidhm ná an Coiste Meastóireachta atá le cur ar bun. Níl fhios agam conas a oibreoidh sin. Go dtí seo nuair a bhí monarcha mór agus deontas níos mó ná milliún punt i gceist chaithfeadh sé dul thart ar na ranna rialtais uilig, filleadh ar an Aire agus fanacht ansin le cead an Aire. Níl fhios agam cad é an ról a bheidh ag an Aire as seo amach. An é an Coiste Meastóireachta a dhéanfaidh an cinneadh feasta? An ndéanfaidh an coiste cinneadh <Col N="73" /> taréis dul i gcomhairle leis an Aire? An mbeidh teora leis an méid gur féidir leo a scríobh amach i seiceanna? Cad é an srian a bheidh ar an gCoiste Meastóireachta? Tá fhios agam go bhfuil srian ar an Aire. Tá teora leis an chiste atá ag Roinn na Gaeltachta agus ag an údarás. Tá sé iontach tábhachtach go mbeadh ionadaíocht láidir ag an Údarás ar an gCoiste Meastóireachta. Ní bheadh an oiread sin muiníne agam as na daoine eile ón méid a chonaic muid go dtí seo. Seans ar ndóigh go ndéanfaidh siad níos mó don Ghaeltacht ná mar a rinne siad go dtí seo.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith linn míniú a fháil ón Aire Stáit maidir le cad tá le tárlú. An mbeimid ag braith ar an Choiste Meastóireachta nó an dtiocfaidh sé sa deireadh go dtí an tAire agus go dtí an Rialtas?</P>
    <P>An tríú athrú mór atá sa Bhille ná na coistí réigiúnacha atá le bunú. Tá coistí réigiúnacha ann cheana féin agus ceann i dTír Chonaill. Ceathrar ball atá air idir bhaill tofa agus bhaill ainmnithe. Is dócha go bhfuil an rud céanna ann san iarthar agus sa deisceart. Is dócha gurb é an t-aon athrú anseo ná go bhfuil siad á gcur ar bhonn reachtúil Bhí siad <i>ad hoc</i> go dtí seo. Is iomaí tionscal beag a bhíodh i dTír Chonaill agus gan mórán suime ag daoine ó Ghaeltacht eile iontu ach amháin chun a rá dá bhféadfadh duine i dTír Chonaill deontas a fháil chuige seo cén fáth nach bhféadfadh duine ó Ghaeltacht eile deontas a fháil? B'fhéidir go mbíonn siad ag foghlaim óna chéile.</P>
    <P>Bimid i gcomhnaí ag caint faoi chumhachtaí breise a thabhairt don údarás agus cur isteach níos mó a thabhairt dóibh ar chúrsaí turasóireachta. Tá go leor le tabhairt ag na Gaeltachtaí don turasóireacht. Tá na radharcanna is áille sa tír sa Ghaeltacht idir shléibhte, fharraige, aibhneacha agus locha agus tá an turasóireacht cultúrtha ceangailte leis an cheol agus leis an teanga agus mar sin de. Ba chóir go mbeadh siad sin go léir á gcur chun cinn ag an údarás agus is mór an trua nach bhfuil tagairt ar bith do sin sa Bhille.</P>
    <P>Tá tionsclaíocht sa Ghaeltacht ag brath go mór ar infrastructure nó ar chúrsaí cumarsáide. Tá feabhas mór tagtha ag chúrsaí teileachumarsáide ó bunaíodh an túdarás 20 bliain ó shin. Chun teangbháil a dhéanamh le Baile átha Cliath cheana bhí ort dul trí Ghaobh Dobhair, Leitir Cheanainn, Sligeach, Gaillimh agus Nua Eabhrach fiú, gnó a ghlacfadh an lá ar fad.</P>
    <P>Ach tá fhios agam go dtuigeann an tAire Stáit go maith go bhfuil easnamh mór ó thaobh infrastruchtúir de maidir leis na bóithre, séarachas agus mar sin de i mo cheantar féin.</P>

Caithfidh mé ar dtús mo bhuíochas a ghabháil leis an Teachta McGinley as a chuid ama a roinnt liom.</P>
      <P>Fáiltím roimh an Bille agus aontaím leis an chuid is mó atá ann. Ach tá mé mí-shásta faoi nach bhfuil sa Bhille. Tá neart fadhbanna ag daoine a bhfuil comhnaí orthu sa Ghaeltacht agus tá eolas maith agam ar na fadhbanna sin mar tá Gaeltacht Mhúscraí i mo Dháilcheantar féin. Tá obair iontach déanta ag Mícheál Ó Scanaill atá ina bhall tofa ar bhord an údaráis ón gceantar sin.</P>
      <P>Tá súil agam go bhfuil a fhios ag an Aire Stáit go bhfuil an-chuid daoine ag obair anois sna monarchana i mBaile Bhúirne agus i gCúil Aodha. Ba mhaith an rud é freisin go mbeadh daoine ag obair sa mhonarcha atá díomhaoin i mBéal Átha an Ghaorthaidh le cúpla mí anuas. Tá a fhios agam freisin go raibh Mícheál Ó Scanaill ag iarraidh tacaíochta ón rialtas chun Coláiste Íosagáin i mBaile Mhúirne a cheannach thart ar bhliain ó shin. Tá a lán deiseanna ann chun rud éigin iontach a dhéanamh leis an áit.</P>
      <P>I agree with most of the reforms contained in the Bill. However, I am disappointed by what is not in the Bill. Deputy Kenny referred to the fact that the primary reason for the establishment of Údarás was to preserve the language and culture of Gaeltacht regions. While it has been an economic success, by and large, in terms of attracting investment to those areas, questions must be raised about its achievements in respect of preserving and fostering the Irish language and culture as a living culture. I have some criticisms to make in that regard.</P>
      <P>A very simple matter which came to my attention some time ago &ndash; and I know the Minister of State is familiar with this problem &ndash; is the problem of Gaeltacht primary schools relative to gaelscoileanna. I raised this matter on the Adjournment four or five months ago and I was promised the Minister for Education would make an announcement on the matter imminently. I thought the intent was to announce that Gaeltacht primary schools would not lose their additional teacher until they reached the staffing schedule that applies to gaelscoileanna. Unfortunately, the Minister had not agreed to that yet. It is very disappointing because a number of Gaeltacht schools have lost teachers for the current academic year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am particularly concerned, given the division <Col N="75" /> of the country into areas with and without Objective One status, that there is nothing in the Bill that recognises the difficulties which will be faced by regions without Objective One status, particularly the more peripheral Gaeltacht regions, in their endeavours to attract new industry. How is Údarás na Gaeltachta, as an industrial development agency, going to attract inward investment to areas without Objective One status if it is offering a two tier system of grant aid? In regard to the Gaeltacht areas without Objective One status, we are, to an extent, rearranging the deckchairs on the <i>Titanic</i> because, without making a significant Exchequer fund available to them to attract additional inward or international mobile investment, the ability of these areas to create employment opportunities will, over a period of years, decline significantly.</P>
    <P>I also wish to raise the issue of the manner in which the Gaeltacht housing grants are administered. It is ridiculous that we do not recognise the <i>de facto</i> situation on the ground, where someone from the Gaeltacht marries someone from outside the Gaeltacht. One is fluent in Irish and committed to it, while the other moves to the Gaeltacht. The inspector might inspect the fluency in Irish of only one member of the household, who may be married or cohabiting. The Gaeltacht grant is denied because only one member of the household is fluent in Irish. That is a simple administrative matter which means a loss of £4,000 to applicants for Gaeltacht grants who are disqualified for that reason. Some discretion is called for in that regard.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liomsa fáiltiú roimh an mBille seo freisin. Na Teachtaí a labhair go dtí seo, tá Gaeltacht acu ina nDáilcheantar. Ainneoin gur tógadh mé sa Ghalltacht agus gurb ann atá mo Dháilcheantar, ba mhaith liom labhairt ar an mBille seo mar creidim go bhfuil todhchaí na Gaeilge ag brath ar thodhchaí na Gaeltachta. Sa mhéid seo, tá an-obair déanta go dtí seo ag Údarás na Gaeltachta chun an Ghaeltacht a choimeád beo agus daoine a choimeád ag obair ann agus an cur na Gaeilge chun cinn. Fáiltím roimh an mBille seo chun an t-údarás a dhaingniú agus a láidriú.</P>
      <P>Leis an mBille seo, beidh an t-údarás i bhfad níos daonlathaí. Ba mhaith go seasfadh mná agus daoine óga sna toghcháin atá le teacht. De réir mar a thuigim níl ach bean amháin tofa ar an údarás  &ndash; Connie Uí Fhatharta  &ndash; agus is sárbhean í ach ní leor bean amháin. Ní mór daoine nua a mhealladh isteach san údarás mar beidh cumhachtaí nua ag daoine chun a gceantair féin a fhorbairt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fáiltím roimh an ionadaíocht nua a thabharfaidh guth ar an mbord do na Gaeltachtaí ar fad. Go stairiúil, ní raibh ach na Gaeltachtaí móra le feiceáil ar an údarás ach beidh mé ag súil anois le <Col N="76" /> daoine a fheiceáil air ó Ráth Cairn agus ón Rinn agus breis daoine ó Chiarraí, mar a bhfuil mo chroí Gaeilge féin.</P>
    <P>Neartóidh sé seo na Gaeltachtaí beaga mar beidh níos mó cumhachta acu tionscal a fháil dá gceantar féin agus daoine a choimeád ann dá bharr chun an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn.</P>
    <P>Tá ról ag an údarás leas na Gaeltachta a dhéanamh. Ról leathan é sin agus ról dúshlánach. Caithfidh siad eacnamaíocht na Gaeltachta a fhorbairt agus fostaíocht a chruthú maraon le cultúr agus teanga sainiúil na Gaeltachta a shlánú. Tá sé de dhualgas ar an údarás stádas na Gaeilge mar theanga phobail i ngach Gaeltacht, idir mhór agus bheag, a chinntiú. Tá sé an-deacair d'aon bhord.</P>
    <P>Faoi gach ceann de na ceannteidil sin, tá an-chuid bainte amach ag an údarás. Dúirt an tAire Stáit go bhfuil breis is 8,000 dhuine fostaithe anois sa Ghaeltacht i bpoist lánaimseartha a chruthaigh an t-údarás. Tá breis 3,000 dhuine fostaithe ann go páirtaimseartha. Nuair a fhéachtar an mbliain seo caite, chruthaigh an t-údarás breis is 1,300 post. Sin an treo ceart mar tá siad san iomaíocht le háiteanna eile. Tá na Gaeltachtaí iargúlta agus tá sé deacair tionscail a mhealladh isteach iontu. Bhíodh sé níos fusa tionscail a mhealladh go Conamara ná go haon áit eile toisc go raibh sé cóngach do chathair na Gaillimhe. Ba mhaith go gcuirfí béim amach anseo ar thionscail a mhealladh go Ciarraí, go Dún na nGall agus go Muigh Eo, go háirithe chuig áiteanna iargúlta.</P>
    <P>Is í an fhostaíocht a mheallfaidh daoine chun fanacht sa Ghaeltacht. Bhí me an-bhuartha mo chomhTheachtaí a chlos á ra go bhfuil siadsan buartha faoi staid na Gaeilge sna Gaeltachtaí. Bhí mise ag ceapadh go raibh an Ghaeilge ag dul i nirt i mBaile Átha Cliath chun cur leis an nGaeilge láidir sa Ghaeltacht. Is ábhár éadóchais a chlos go bhfuil an Ghaeilge i mbaol sa Ghaeltacht. Ainneoin aon todhchaí atá i ndán don Ghaeilge i mBaile Átha Cliath, ní mhairfidh an teanga má gheibheann sí bás sa Ghaeltacht. Caithfidh an tAire Stáit mar Aire Gaeilge chomh maith le hAire Gaeltachta dul i gcomhar leis na hAirí eile féachaint an bhfuil an chabhair atá ag teastáil d'fhostaíocht, do na scoileanna, don infrastruchtúr agus chuile rud eile sa Ghaeltacht á fháil acu.</P>
    <P>Aithním an obair atá déanta ag an údarás ó thaobh an chultúir agus ó thaobh na teanga. Luadh féilte agus áisitheoirí ealaíon agus comórtais litríochta ach an leor sin má tá an Ghaeilge i mbaol?</P>
    <P>Tá sé de dhualgas ar an údarás an Ghaeilge a chinntiú ach tá an Ghaeilge ag brath ar na daoine óga atá á dtógáil sna Gaeltachtaí. Molaim an méid atá déanta do na clubanna óige agus do na naíonraí ach ba mhaith liom níos mó infheistíochta a fheiceáil á dhéanamh sna grúpaí sin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>We should not lose sight of why we want all Ansbacher names released in a proper way. There is public outrage about systematic tax evasion. Money that could have been applied to building schools, hospitals and roads was kept hidden from the Revenue Commissioners in what are believed to be some of the most spectacular acts of selfish greed since the State was founded.</P>
      <P>This justified outrage jeopardises the achievement of a new national pay agreement. It is vital to social progress and national competitiveness that there is such an agreement and social peace. Fine Gael has put forward the simple proposal that the Companies Act, 1990, be amended to allow a Dáil committee to publish, with due notice, all 120 names in the Ansbacher depositors list. This is the kernel of the motion for debate this evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A simple and speedy parliamentary route is <Col N="78" /> available to Government, to allow Report Stage of the Companies (Amendment) Bill (No. 2) to be taken this week so an amendment can be made to section 21 of the 1990 Act, which was already discussed on Committee Stage of the current Bill, to designate a committee of Dáil Éireann as a competent authority within the meaning of the 1990 Act which would have discretion to publish information, books or documents which are submitted to it. The process of amending section 21 of the 1990 Act, using the Bill which is already before the House, will take only a day. It is not something that must go through five stages. All that is required is one amendment on one stage of the Bill. This can be done promptly, in a matter of one hour or less.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, Deputy Ahern, presumably advised on these matters by the Attorney General, was hopelessly misinformed yesterday when he told reporters at the National Ploughing Championships that the law could not be retrospectively changed to allow for the publication of the 120 names of the Ansbacher account holders. There are many clear legal precedents for such retrospective action of non-penal effect if it is in the national interest. The Taoiseach was personally involved in passing such retroactive legislation.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Finance in 1994, he introduced a retrospective tax concession, section 19 of that year's Finance Act, to benefit people with art works and stately homes which, it transpired, benefited only one taxpayer, Mr. Ken Rohan, who was apparently known to the Taoiseach from certain dinners they had within sight of these pictures. This was retrospective legislation. The 1993 tax amnesty, which was much discussed today, was also introduced by the Taoiseach when he was Minister for Finance and that, too, was retrospective legislation. It was retrospective in two respects. It conferred benefits on tax evaders who did not pay their tax on time in the past to the relative disadvantage of those who did. It was also retrospective in another interesting respect in that it introduced new penalties for those who did not avail of the amnesty. These would be retrospective in their effect as to taxes that were not paid prior to the enactment of the tax amnesty. It is arguable that this aspect was retrospective penal legislation. However, it was certainly retrospective.</P>
    <P>Even more importantly, the Taoiseach was at the Cabinet table in 1990 when the Government introduced retrospective legislation to help the Goodman group. I hope Deputy O'Malley scrutinises this precedent because he has an interest in this issue. The Companies (Amendment) Act, 1990, contained a retrospective provision which allowed the Goodman organisation to seek protection from its creditors even though the credit in question had been extended prior to the Act being passed. The people who were owed money by the Goodman group found that, by virtue of an Act introduced in the Oireachtas when the Taoiseach was a member of the Government, <Col N="79" /> their credit was devalued by retrospective legislation.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, therefore, is well aware that retrospective legislation can be introduced in accordance with the Constitution. None of the legislation I mentioned has been challenged as unconstitutional. If it is possible retrospectively to give a benefit to a person who has pictures in their house, to give a tax amnesty which reduces the tax liabilities of tax evaders but not of compliant taxpayers, to change the Statute of Limitations Act in 1991, as the former Deputy Ray Burke did to allow people to make claims they would not have been entitled to make at the time the injury occurred, to reduce the rights of people who were foolish enough to lend money to the Goodman group to the benefit of that group, surely it is possible to change retrospectively the Companies Acts to permit the publication of the Ansbacher lists.</P>
    <P>I do not accept that it is unconstitutional to do this and I challenge the Taoiseach's competence in giving misleading legal information on this issue. The Taoiseach said it was not constitutionally possible. He is wrong. Retrospective legislation is not only possible but was introduced by the Taoiseach during his political career in this House. I have serious doubts about the competence of those who are giving the Taoiseach legal advice, if this is the content of that advice.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach knows perfectly well that retrospective legislation can be introduced if it is in the public interest. It is in the public interest that the full list be published with due notice to those who are on it. The fact that selections from alleged names on the list have been released systematically and carefully over recent days to different newspapers reinforces my call for a change in the law to allow the full list to be released in a planned way in accordance with the law and with due notice to the people concerned, giving them a fair opportunity to put their explanations or denials or silence, as they choose, on the public record. This will give them time to think but will require them to have their names published.</P>
    <P>The Ansbacher list has, it appears, been partially leaked in a selective and malevolent way by people who have a clear agenda. The Tánaiste has speculated that the agenda might be to destroy the inquiry, but I might speculate about other motives for the releases. Either way, leakers always have an agenda. Clearly, now that there is serious evidence that there is a process of leaking going on, the best way to stop it is to release all the names in a planned and fair way, as Fine Gael proposes.</P>
    <P> The Government should not sit by while there is continued selective and malevolent leaking of this list. The Ansbacher list is definitely in the possession of at least two Fianna Fáil Ministers &ndash; Deputy McCreevy and the Taoiseach &ndash; and at least two Progressive Democrats &ndash; the Tánaiste and, it would appear, the Attorney General &ndash; who are at the Cabinet table.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite possibly, information, perhaps not from the list itself, may well be in the possession of a coterie of party colleagues, spin doctors and others to whom conversation or innuendo or even unspoken communications may have been conveyed. That is possible, as all of us know.</P>
      <P>In any event there is strong evidence that the contents of this document are being leaked selectively and the Taoiseach and, in particular, the Tánaiste have grave questions to answer about this because the Tánaiste is responsible for its confidentiality. She initiated this inquiry and is responsible for authorising the Taoiseach to be a recipient of the document, which was not provided for in the legislation. She is responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of a report that was prepared for her at her request and if it transpires that these leaks are from the report, then it will have grave consequences for her.</P>
      <P>If she believes, as I understand it from one comment she made, that the leaking is being carried out by people who want to sabotage her inquiry, then that is all the more reason for her to furnish the Ansbacher list in full to the Garda Commissioner, Pat Byrne, so that he can check the names that have appeared in the newspaper against the names that appear on the list and decide if there is <i>prima facie</i> evidence of leaking. If there is then he can then conduct an in-depth interview with each person who has seen this document, including the Tánaiste, the Taoiseach, the Attorney General and the Minister for Finance, and all the other officers of the courts and elsewhere. We are told there are 15 people involved but, perhaps more, perhaps less. However, if the Garda Commissioner is satisfied that there is a sufficient degree of congruence between the names appearing in the newspapers and those which appear on the list, he should then make the judgment as to whether inquiries should be initiated.</P>
      <P>The commissioner and, indeed, the Garda Síochána have a record of being extremely assiduous in pursuing leaks where the Government is concerned. Before the presidential election not only was an individual taken for questioning to a Garda station and his house raided, but the media was made aware of this by someone quite soon after it occurred and it was possible for it to know a day or two before the election that this vigorous Garda activity was under way. I hope similar private and public displays of assiduousness will be shown by the Garda in pursuing these leads. Indeed, I am confident that it will, but that cannot happen unless the Tánaiste gives the Garda Commissioner the Ansbacher list because he has no way of knowing whether the leaks are accurate or false given that he has no basis of comparison between the Ansbacher list and the names which appeared in the newspapers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that the Tánaiste will come to the <Col N="81" /> House, as I requested this afternoon, and say that she is making the arrangements to authorise, at the very minimum, the release of the Ansbacher list to the Garda Commissioner because if she is not willing to do that, then she is not willing to see the leakers exposed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>That depends on whether the Tánaiste is correct that giving information to the public would prejudice a prosecution. If she is, obviously, the people who have most to gain would be the people whose names appear on the list. If, on the other hand, the Tánaiste is not correct, then the people who would have most to lose would be those whose names are being released. It depends entirely on whether the Tánaiste's legal interpretation is correct.</P>
      <P>I prefer not to agree with it because I do not think that non-prejudicial publication in any way adversely affects the prospects of prosecution. It is possible that leaking prejudices a prosecution, but I do not believe that the release of the information with due process, in accordance with law passed in this House, could interfere with the prospects of prosecution, as the Tánaiste seemed to argue.</P>
      <P>It is extremely important that the public knows this matter is being dealt with resolutely. It would not be reasonable to allow the publication of these names to be postponed for months, or even years. Perhaps people's names could appear on some list of tax evaders in two or three years without anyone knowing whether its source was the Ansbacher inquiry. A settlement could be made, a name could appear and nobody would know the nature of the process that led to that.</P>
      <P>This inquiry has been undertaken on the initiative of a politician, the Tánaiste, following the passage of legislation in this House. It appears to be the subject of leaks and it is very important that the air should be cleared by allowing the full list to be released with due notice to the persons concerned and if the Tánaiste is willing to do that, I seek an assurance from her that she will furnish the list to the Garda Commissioner so that he can decide whether there is evidence of leaking and not the Tánaiste or the Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="82" /> I do not know who is on the list but I will accept the commissioner's word if he says that there is no significant coincidence between the list that has appeared in the newspapers and the Ansbacher list and if he says there is no significant evidence, therefore, of leaking, I will accept that. However, I do not think that I should be asked to accept that from politicians who have possession of the list, for perfectly proper reasons, of course, but who would, therefore, be tempted to act as judges in their own cases.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 21 of the Companies Act, 1990, sets out the manner in which the report of an inspector, such as Mr. O'Brien, shall be reported to what is described as &ldquo;competent authorities&rdquo;. The competent authorities listed are the Minister &ndash; the Tánaiste in this case; a person authorised by the Minister; an inspector appointed under the Act; the Minister for Finance; an officer authorised by the Minister for Finance or any court of competent jurisdiction; a supervisory authority or the Central Bank.</P>
      <P>It seems that under subsection (b), a person authorised by the Minister has been interpreted by the Tánaiste to include the Taoiseach and she has sent a report to him. Section 21(2) of the same Act states that a person who publishes or discloses any information, book or document in contravention of this section shall be guilty of an offence which, of course, is a criminal offence in this case. It seems it is quite clear from the series of leaks in the newspapers in recent days that such a criminal offence has been committed.</P>
      <P>The Garda Síochána must investigate this offence. On the face of it, the Garda Síochána does not need to be instructed when there is <i>prima facie</i> evidence of a criminal offence but, of course, it will fall at the first fence if the Tánaiste's defence on the Order of Business today is brought into play, that there may not be any leak at all.</P>
      <P>The Leader of Fine Gael, Deputy John Bruton, has stated that there is an obligation on the Government to provide the Garda Commissioner with a report, to designate him as the Taoiseach was designated as a competent authority in order that he would be in a position to check the leaks against the names in the report. Any other course of action would simply be evasion of its responsibilities on the Government's part.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance have copies of the inspector's report. Taking into account the political flavour of the leaks, it is reasonable for us, in Opposition, to assume that the source of the leaks is political. Only the Tánaiste and the Taoiseach can remove that suspicion from the minds of members of the Opposition and the general public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The defence of the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste on today's Order of Business was that no such leak has occurred. The suggestion seems to be that the people whose names were circulated as holders of Ansbacher accounts did not hold such accounts. If the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste really <Col N="83" /> believe that, they must act to protect the good names of innocent citizens. I would like to remind the Tánaiste of the Government's obligation under Article 40.3.2 of the Constitution which states:</P>
    <P>The State shall, in particular, by its laws protect as best it may from unjust attack and, in the case of injustice done, vindicate the life, person, good name, and property rights of every citizen.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste must do that under law and the most ready law available to her is what has been suggested by Deputy Bruton, namely, the recommital of the Companies Act and the extension of the section of competent persons. The Tánaiste must decide that a competent person is either a committee of this House or the Ceann Comhairle of this House. Following due notice and due process, the names may be released in a fair and just fashion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">

      <P>The Government Whip, the Minister of State, Deputy Brennan, has been the chief Government spokesperson in this affair. He is not a competent authority under the Act and, so, should not have a copy of Mr. O'Brien's report. Yet, in a recent interview on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo;, he put information into the public domain which was not in the affidavit sworn by Mr. Appleby before the High Court. Deputy Brennan said that all persons who held Ansbacher accounts were guilty of tax evasion and that no compliant taxpayer held such an account. The Tánaiste must tell us how Deputy Brennan knew this when he is not a competent person and should not have the information which he gave out.</P>
      <P>The Tánaiste and the Taoiseach should consider the enormity of Deputy Brennan's statement. We now have a situation where the Minister designated by the Government to explain its position and support it in this case is actually guilty of a criminal offence under section 21(2) of the Companies Act. He should not have the information, he put information into the public domain, information which he stated categorically and without qualification. He stated that all the 120 people named are guilty of tax evasion because they could not have held an account for any other purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This makes it absolutely mandatory on the Tánaiste and the Taoiseach to act. We must get out of the mire into which the Tánaiste has led us. We are now in a situation where a Government Minister may be guilty of a criminal offence, where a whole series of citizens have been named as holders of Ansbacher accounts and are, consequently, tax evaders, if Deputy Brennan is correct. Yet the Tánaiste refuses to act. She mutters her way through the Order of Business &ndash;&rdquo;.there may not be leaks, there might have been <Col N="84" /> leaks.&rdquo;. She will neither involve the Garda Commissioner nor categorically state her position.</P>

      <P>We have all experienced the outrage of taxpayers during recent days. They are fearful that the evaders will escape because of the provisions of the 1993 tax amnesty. It is worth looking at that proposition because that is now one of the great fears of compliant taxpayers. In saying that, if people evaded paying their tax as a result of the Ansbacher accounts, those responsible should be named in this House. Responsibility rests with the Taoiseach who was the Minister for Finance who introduced the 1993 amnesty. Any judicious leaks of Government memoranda to vindicate himself and embarrass his then leader, as we saw in this morning's newspapers, is another example of selective leaking in the Taoiseach's political interests. He should be a man and stand up for what he has done. If people evaded taxes which were due as a result of the amnesty, responsibility lies with the then Minister for Finance, the current Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>It is worth looking at the position which arose in that amnesty. It is quite clear that if somebody availed of the amnesty and complied with the terms of the 1993 Act, they have no tax liability regardless of whether they have an Ansbacher account. The responsibility lies with the Taoiseach if that is the position.</P>
      <P>It may be, however, that those who held Ansbacher accounts did not avail of the amnesty. There is some evidence, particularly the document entitled &ldquo;Covering the Footprints&rdquo; which was in the affidavit, to suggest this. It seems that the high powered tax advisers who advised people who held Ansbacher accounts were more concerned that the general knowledge of the scheme's existence should be kept secret than that information about an individual taxpayer would be released. They were far more concerned that the Revenue Commissioners should not hear about such evasion schemes than they were about the actual tax details of an individual depositor. Consequently, they may have advised &ndash; there is some circumstantial evidence to suggest they did &ndash; that &ldquo;ar eagla na heagla&rdquo;, in case anyone discovered the existence of this great scam, people should not avail of the tax amnesty. If that happened, the Revenue can investigate and become involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the 1993 tax amnesty, a special collector issued two pieces of paper to people who availed of the amnesty. One was a certificate that they <Col N="85" /> could wave at the sheriff if he arrived for the dining room table and the good chairs saying &ldquo;No, you can't come in here, I availed of the amnesty&rdquo;, but the other was an actual receipt which nominated the amount paid, the 15 per cent, and also the capital amount by way of income tax or capital gains tax due as the amnesty covered both.</P>
    <P>If that is the case, the Revenue can look at the Ansbacher accounts, find out whether there was a deposit of £500,000 and, if the receipt states that £30,000 was received, which would suggest that only £200,000 was declared, the Revenue has a way open to it on the basis of <i>prima facie </i>evidence that a full declaration was not made. The Revenue can go to the appeal commissioners who must adjudicate on the matter. If the appeal commissioner decides there is a <i>prima facie </i>case that full disclosure was not made, the Revenue will receive <i>carte blanche</i> to seek a full audit and the whole protection of the amnesty will fall down.</P>
    <P>I would remind the House that the Finance Act, 1999, gave general powers to the Revenue Commissioners, which were very strong powers indeed. One is the power to go to court to investigate a class of taxpayer rather than an individual taxpayer. The Revenue Commissioners can now say there is a class of taxpayers who had deposits in the, so-called Ansbacher accounts and we want to investigate them in full. They have the power to look at the Ansbacher accounts, to look at the individual deposits, to match them against the receipts issued by the special collector to those who availed of the amnesty and if the two do not match they can go back again through the route of the Appeal Commissioners and establish a <i>prima facie </i>case. Actually, the words &ldquo;<i>prima facie</i>&rdquo; case are not used in the section. The phrase used is &ldquo;. if the Appeal Commissioner has a reasonable opinion that full disclosure was not made&rdquo;. This can be invoked and full audits can be done. I do not think the regulations are stacked in favour of persons who have evaded tax as they may appear at first. Deputies who were here for the debate on the amnesty will recall that not only did it apply up to 5 April 1991 but one of the conditions was that tax returns for 1992-93 would also have to be filed and, of course, if a person declared black economy money in the amnesty he would have to weight his returns in 1992-93 to reflect that. The Revenue Commissioners, looking at the weighting of returns in 1992-93 and subsequent years as black money became white, would have a route into Ansbacher account holders.</P>
    <P>If it all falls down, it falls down because the political judgment of one individual was flawed. That is the present Taoiseach, then Minister for Finance, Deputy Bertie Ahern, who came to the House, gave certain assurances and looked for the consent of the House to give an amnesty to people who are the bandits of modern Ireland. They would not pay their fair share and put their shoulders to the wheel when people were dying because of cutbacks in hospitals, when children in <Col N="86" /> schools were failing to learn to read because there were not sufficient teachers and when compliant taxpayers, in the national interest, made serious sacrifices while these people were given a mandate to plunder by the present Taoiseach when he was Minister for Finance.</P>

        <b>:</b> I am absolutely amazed at the bland, blasé and indifferent approach of the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to this issue. I am very surprised, but then again, it was recounted in the House today that if the Tánaiste was sitting where Deputy Quinn was and sat there for a period of time, we would have an entirely different performance from her. I ought not to be surprised because if the Minister sitting beside her, Deputy Cowen, and the Minister who has departed, Deputy Michael Smith, had availed of the hospitality of which she availed there is no doubt that we would have another Sheedy affair and a possible Cabinet stand-off. There seems to be one rule, with regard to moral principles, for the Tánaiste and another when it comes to setting down definitions for others.</P>
      <P>There has been a series of deliberate and selected leaks. The Tánaiste will know that this document was made available to a very limited number of people &ndash; to her, the Taoiseach &ndash; we understand now after some contradictions and confusion yesterday &ndash; the Minister for Finance and a few others.

What we have is a black propaganda campaign, a sinister series of leaks that would do justice to the German propaganda machine under Goebbels. We have a deliberate attempt to discredit honourable people. All one has to do is look at the leaks and one will see people involved, either on the periphery or directly, with Fine Gael.

        <b>: </b>Not satisfied with that he goes on to say, &ldquo;I am sure that Deputy Bruton could clarify to the country whether it was him or not&rdquo;. On Friday, 17 October, the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, linked Eoghan Harris and Roy Dooley with Deputy John Bruton in relation to the leaking of this affair and, from the pontifical chamber of RTE, he told the nation, &ldquo;Fine Gael obviously changed their strategy about a week or ten days ago and we now have descended to this&rdquo;. A matter of days later, on the Order of Business, the Minster, Deputy Cowen, said that a member of Deputy Bruton's staff took the documents away and he said, &ldquo;That is a fact&rdquo;. A few days later, on Tuesday, 28 October, Tommy Morris, a well known Find Gael activist, was detained in the early hours of the morning, the media were tipped off and, at Lucan Garda Station, a melée of media greeted his arrival. He was released without charge and, coincidentally, three days later the presidential election was held and Mary McAleese was, happily, elected President. Where there had been zeal, enthusiasm and absolute dogged determination to arrest and smear somebody, they suddenly disappeared. There were leaked documents but Tommy Morris did not <Col N="88" /> leak them and nobody associated with Fine Gael leaked them, yet the moment the presidential election was over the investigation ceased. There was another dimension to this. It was the first time in the history of the State, as far as we can recall, that the gardaí were used as political instruments.</P>
      <P>What is happening is extremely dirty, black and sinister. The Tánaiste, the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and a limited number of people had access to that documentation. It is in the public domain and is now the prattle of pubs and clubs. The Tánaiste has an obligation, because names are being selectively leaked, to come clean and to bring the documentation into the public domain by amending the legislation to make provision for this to be done. Otherwise, she will have failed in her public duty and will have deserted the people who vested trust in her to carry out this assignment. It is an important assignment and she was going well, but she is now floundering badly.</P>

    <P>&ndash;expresses confidence that the very wide powers given to Inspectors under the Companies Act, 1990 will enable them to complete their assignment successfully;</P>

      <P>These wild and reckless claims have no place in Irish political life and have more to do with mob justice and lynch law than with democratic politics. Comments from the Opposition betray a flawed understanding of the Companies Acts and the constitutional obligations of the State when conducting investigations into wrongdoing &ndash; civil or criminal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1990 Companies Act envisages two phases in carrying out investigations. The first is the deployment of authorised officers under section 19. Their job is similar to that of an investigating garda. They can report suspected wrongdoing. Their reports, like Garda reports, are meant to <Col N="90" /> be secret. If the authorised officer discovers sufficient evidence to warrant further investigation, the Minister can apply to the High Court to appoint inspectors to inquire into these matters. It is the High Court which decides in the last analysis whether it is fair and just to publish its inspectors' reports. In this way due process is guaranteed. Persons accused of wrongdoing have the right to hear the accusation and answer it in private. They are not named and shamed in public unless and until the High Court decides that they have received due process and it is right to publish the findings against them.</P>
    <P>This is the set of safeguards, which we put in place nine years ago for the investigation of company-related wrongdoing in a manner, which upholds due process under our Constitution. It is now envisaged that we amend the law to allow suspicions and allegations be made public and the people concerned may not be aware of the allegations or even that they are suspected at all. If we conducted criminal cases by publishing Garda files or books of evidence without first showing them to suspects, the concept of civil liberty would not exist.</P>
    <P>Suggestions have been made in the House today that I should send the report to the Ceann Comhairle so that Members here can read it and make it public. That cannot be done under section 21 of the Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen:</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney:</NameTxt>
      <P>We are advised that if the law was changed to allow the reports of authorised officers to be made public, they would have to be compiled in a completely different way. The authorised officer would have to behave like a judge or the chairman of a tribunal or like an inspector. He would have to conduct hearings and allow each and every person to be dealt with according to due process. That would be the end of authorised officers as we know them. Section 19 would become section 8. Day to day investigation of corporate wrongdoing would cease.</P>
      <P>There are two reasons for rejecting the Opposition's arguments for changing the law to make such reports public. First, it cannot be done in this case because the people affected have not received due process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">

      <P>All of the information gathered by Mr. Ryan was obtained on the understanding and in the knowledge that it would not be made public. Second, it would completely demolish the effective enforcement of company law in the same way as extending the Freedom of Information Act to Garda files.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On foot of the information set out in Mr. Justice McCracken's report, I used my powers under section 19 of the Companies Act, 1990, to appoint <Col N="91" /> authorised officers to inquire into the affairs of both Garuda Limited, trading as Streamline Enterprises, and Celtic Helicopters Limited. The authorised officer appointed to look into Celtic Helicopters submitted an interim report to me and, on the basis of the information contained in that report, I appointed Mr. Ryan in January 1998 as authorised officer under section 19 to examine the affairs of Ansbacher (Cayman) Limited.</P>
    <P>Gerard Ryan and his team did an outstanding job. They worked extraordinarily hard over the past 18 months, uncovering evidence of very serious breaches of company law, tax law and exchange control regulations. It should be noted that in the course of their investigations they did not secure any co-operation from Ansbacher (Cayman) Limited. Mr. Ryan and his team did everything that they could do within the limited powers assigned to them under section 19 of the Act. Once he had completed his report, Mr. Ryan lodged it with me on 22 June last.</P>
    <P>I read the report. Having considered advice from my own Department and legal advice, I concluded that in order to advance properly the investigation into the affairs of Ansbacher (Cayman), the appointment of High Court inspectors under section 8 of the Companies Act was essential. Accordingly, I made application to the High Court under section 8 of the Act on 30 July last and that application was ultimately heard last week on 22 September, when the High Court agreed to my request for the appointment of Mr. Justice Declan Costello, Mr. Paul Rowan and Ms Noreen Mackey as inspectors to investigate and report on the affairs of Ansbacher (Cayman) Limited.</P>
    <P>The order made by the High Court requires the inspectors to examine and define the nature of the company's Irish business; to identify as far as possible all of the parties who were either officers, agents or clients of the company, or who otherwise assisted it in carrying out its business; to examine whether the Companies Acts were breached by the company or its officers and, if so, to identify the breaches involved and the persons in default in each case; to examine whether the affairs of the company were conducted with intent to defraud its creditors; and to report on any related matters.</P>
    <P>I turn to the question of releasing into the public domain details of those named in Mr. Ryan's report into Ansbacher (Cayman). I accept that there is great public and political curiosity as to who is named in the report and I am not going to allow curiosity to govern considerations of this issue. There are very valid reasons the names or other details set out in Mr. Ryan's report cannot be made public at this stage. First, to do so is expressly forbidden under section 21 of the 1990 Companies Act. Second, publication would be in breach of a specific order of the High Court, and, third, it would be contrary to natural justice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Harney:</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot give credence to any media speculation. The media know who is doing the leaking, if there are leaks. The media know who is feeding the names. I will deal with this later. There are only two types of people feeding names, either those who are stupid and irresponsible or those who want to close down the inquiry.</P>
      <P>Certain information was included in the affidavit submitted to the High Court. I point out that this was only a sample of the evidence and was the minimum legally required to support the appointment of inspectors. I ask those who are calling for immediate publication to consider for a moment the impact of such a course of action. Immediate publication would threaten the integrity of the process which is currently under way. It would also pose a very real threat to a number of other important inquiries that are currently being carried out and finalised by the authorised officers under section 19 of the Act.</P>
      <P>There is also a real danger that publication could allow people who were involved in serious wrongdoing to evade the consequences of their actions. If the process were to mean that guilty people could get away scot-free and avoid any sanction, is that what this House really wants?</P>
      <P>I should also point out that immediate publication would be grossly unfair to those not involved in any wrongdoing whatsoever and who have a right to protect their good names. No fair-minded person who reads that report could suggest that 120 people were involved in wrongdoing and not all of them, Deputy Noonan, were depositors. Some were the beneficiaries of deposits, others had trusts in their name and some had deposits, so they were not all depositors.</P>

      <P>I wish to clarify the situation in relation to the distribution of the authorised officer's report which I received on 22 June. At that stage a copy was sent to our legal advisers, including the Attorney General. At the time of making my application to the High Court for the appointment of inspectors I sent a copy of the report to the Taoiseach in his capacity as Head of Government. I do not think anybody could say it was unreasonable of me to authorise that the Taoiseach should receive a copy of the report given the significance and importance of what is contained in it.</P>

      <P>I am taking advice on that matter. If there are leaks I might. I am not confirming that there have been any leaks and the Deputy, as I said to him in correspondence, is wrong to assume that there have.</P>
      <P>Once the High Court had made its order on 22 September copies of the report were sent to the Revenue Commissioners, the Central Bank and the Minister for Finance who, apart from the Taoiseach and myself, is the only member of the Government to have received or, to the best of my knowledge, seen a copy. By direction of the High Court copies were also sent to the six directors of Ansbacher Cayman Limited, to Mr. Padraig Collery and to the company's legal advisers in early August 1999.</P>
      <P>Scurrilous allegations are being made about the leaking of details from the authorised officer's report to the media. There is a veiled allegation that I personally may have broken the law and released information from the report. I refute any such allegation totally. Over the last 18 months I have devoted considerable time and attention to the Ansbacher inquiry. A dedicated team of officials in my Department put in a huge effort to bring this whole process to its current advanced stage. They have uncovered a huge volume of evidence and identified very serious issues in relation to breaches of the law of a grave nature. I take this opportunity to thank Mr. Gerard Ryan and his team for the work they have done. They deserve the recognition of this House for their efforts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From all that I have said it should be clear that a deliberate leak of information from Mr. Ryan's report could destroy all that has been achieved so far. Nobody has more to gain from such an outcome than guilty parties who may be under investigation and who, in some cases, made several attempts to close the whole thing down over the <Col N="94" /> last 18 months. Nobody has more to lose from it than me. I have been aware of the contents of this report for quite some time, as have a small number of officials in my Department, and the authorised officer had reason to discuss many of the details of the report that was emerging over the past 18 months. They and I have gone to extraordinary lengths to ensure there was no publication of its contents.</P>
    <P>I will neither confirm nor deny the accuracy of reports which have appeared in the national media in recent days. I recognise that the media have a job to do. I ask them, however, to act in a responsible manner on this very sensitive issue. Latin scholars among us will be familiar with the <i>cui bono </i>principle &ndash; to whose good does a particular action redound. The only beneficiaries of leaks will be those who want to destroy the process of investigation which is under way. The media know who has been feeding names. I wish I knew. This information is coming either from someone who is extremely foolish and irresponsible or from someone who is determined to destroy the process which is under way.</P>

The stakes are high. High Court inspectors are carrying out an investigation which could ultimately lead to serious sanctions against those guilty of wrongdoing. I have great faith in the integrity and professionalism of the inspectors appointed by the High Court led by Mr. Justice Costello. I have great faith in their ability to carry out their appointed task in a manner that is fair and just to all concerned. I ask this House to share that faith with me and not to put any more citizens through what some people have been put through over the past few days.</P>

I am puzzled by that contradiction. How is it wrong for <i>The Irish Times </i>to publish 40 names but right for the Government to publish 120? How can it be argued that that would not prejudice the people concerned? The Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners has said that he is not working on the assumption that any of them is guilty. He will interview them and determine whether there is a tax liability due. It appears that Fine Gael and some Members opposite want show trials, through the media, of people who may be innocent, including members or former members of Fine Gael.

      <P>Those people are making two very simple demands of the Government which must be met. They want the so-called Ansbacher account holders who systematically evaded their taxes to cough up and be called to account. The public is asking that the maximum penalty be applied to those wealthy individuals who blatantly evaded tax and, if this is established, that some form of criminal sanction should apply. I call on the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Revenue Commissioners to apply the sanctions available under the 1993 amnesty legislation which imposes an eight year jail sentence on those involved in tax evasion for sums in excess of £100,000. There has been much talk about the amnesty legislation but nobody has pointed out that under it an eight year jail sentence may be imposed on those who continue not to declare their income. It is not widely known that the amnesty legislation placed an obligation on those who had evaded their taxes to avail of it. If not, graduated penalties of up to eight years in jail would apply.</P>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners should use existing law on tax evasion and settlements so that those Ansbacher account holders who have been guilty of serious tax evasion can have their names published officially with reference to the fact that this occurred in relation to their Ansbacher accounts. In other words, they should depart from the practice of simply naming the occupation of the person concerned and provide the additional information with regard to the type of activity that led to the tax evasion.</P>
      <P>The Opposition has made much of the name and shame dimension to this controversy. The reality is that the Government, particularly the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, has pursued the right approach. What is required is the maximum punishment for serious tax evaders and the maximum recovery of taxpayers' money. In addition, the Government should continue its budget tax priorities of returning tax cuts and money to middle and low paid PAYE workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems we have a landscape of inquiries, carnivals and circuses concerning public inquiries. The Labour Party originally tried to argue that the 120 individuals should be included within the remit of the Moriarty tribunal. All that would achieve would be to give the Bar Library about ten years work which is totally ridiculous &ndash; 120 individuals to be investigated in the context of a tribunal, with no possibility of criminal prosecutions. This is complete nonsense, and I am sur<Col N="97" /> prised that Labour, the defender of the ordinary taxpayer, as it characterises itself, would advocate something of that order.</P>

      <P>In more than 20 years as a public representative I have never experienced such a sense of anger and outrage among compliant taxpayers as that created by the recent disclosures about the scale and extent of the Ansbacher scandal. The public anger is very understandable and it would be a great mistake for the Government to underestimate the depth or extent of that anger. Failure to take measures to deal with the genuine public fury will further undermine public confidence in the political process, and almost certainly reduce the Government's chances of successfully negotiating a new national agreement with the social partners.</P>
      <P>The public's anger is understandable. This was not a case of a few clever businessmen or their advisers opportunistically availing of loopholes in the tax system to minimise their tax liabilities. On the basis of what we know from the affidavit sworn in the High Court last week by Mr. Ryan, it is clear that what existed amounted to a systematic and well-executed criminal conspiracy to defraud the Exchequer, involving some of the country's leading business figures. This is not to suggest that each person who had an involvement with Ansbacher (Cayman) Limited was involved in this conspiracy or was a criminal. However, nobody can seriously dispute that a criminal conspiracy existed.</P>
      <P>All one has to do is look at the affidavit sworn by Mr. Appleby which includes, among others, the following findings:</P>
      <P>The business of Ansbacher (Cayman) Limited was carried on with an intent to defraud its own creditors, namely, the Revenue Commissioners. The business was carried on with intent to defraud the Revenue Commissioners being creditors of third parties, namely, the Irish-resident individuals and companies with </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="98" /> whom it dealt. Officers of the company destroyed, mutilated or were privy to the destruction or mutilation of books. The company operated a banking business in Ireland without a licence. The company facilitated breaches of exchange control regulations.</P>
    <P>These are not my words but those of the Government's official, Mr. Appleby. There is much more, numbered accounts, business being conducted by telephone rather than in writing and back to back loans. These are not the activities of honest, tax-compliant citizens.</P>
    <P>Against this background, the public and national interest will best be served by facilitating the earliest possible publication of the names of those identified in Mr. Ryan's report to the Tánaiste, ensuring that this is done in such a way as to avoid prejudicing the right of anyone to due process and a fair trial. This can be done but what the Government is lacking is the political will, not the ability to do so. The Labour Party has published a Private Members' Bill which provides a simple legal formula to allow this to be done.</P>
    <P>From the very beginning, the Labour Party believed that the most appropriate body to investigate the Ansbacher accounts was the Moriarty tribunal. The effectiveness of that tribunal to date is a fair vindication of that political judgment. However, on two occasions, Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats voted down Labour's proposals to appropriately amend the terms of reference of the tribunal. Had the Government accepted our proposal, the names of the account holders and the nature of the transactions would have come into the public domain and those involved would have been publicly asked to account for their activities. Unlike a tribunal of inquiry, the High Court inspectors will be required to carry out their investigations in private. Maybe this is what was intended all along. Maybe that is why the Taoiseach was so vociferous in ensuring that there would be no reference to the Moriarty tribunal. Maybe privacy has its own political cache.</P>
    <P>While the expectation is that the names will be published when the inspectors deliver their final report to the High Court, notwithstanding anything the Minister of State, Deputy Seamus Brennan, said on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo;, my understanding is that the final decision will be at the discretion of the court. In other words, there is no guarantee. By nodding, the Tánaiste is signalling that she cannot give a guarantee to the House that the names of the Ansbacher account holders will ever be made public. In addition, it is not clear how long it will take for the inspectors to conclude their investigations. In these circumstances, there is a compelling obligation on the Government to examine every and any legal option to place relevant information drawn from Mr. Ryan's report into the public domain. Maybe in reply to the House, the Tánaiste or someone on behalf of the Government will give an indication of the expected duration of the High Court <Col N="99" /> inspectors' report. Is it three months, six months or a year?</P>

      <P>The Tánaiste is well aware of media and newspaper editorials, some of which have changed their tune between Monday and today. The response of the Government to the very reasonable request from the public and Opposition parties that this information should be made available has been misleading and disingenuous, to say the least. The Government argues that, as the law stands, it is prevented from releasing the information to the Dáil by section 21 of the Companies Act, 1990. However, there is no legal or constitutional principle that prevents the Oireachtas from changing the law.</P>
      <P>Government spokespersons originally suggested that the Government was prevented from changing the law by the principle of non-retrospection. We had that in dollops from the Minister of State, Deputy Seamus Brennan, on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo;. This is nonsense. Article 15.5, the relevant constitutional principle, states: &ldquo;The Oireachtas shall not declare acts to be infringements of the law which were not so at the date of their commission.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill we have tabled does nothing of the <Col N="100" /> kind and, strictly speaking, it is not retrospective at all because it does not alter the legal status of anything already done. It would simply allow the Tánaiste to inform the Dáil of information she, and as we now know many others, currently hold.</P>
    <P>There are umpteen examples of valid laws with retrospective elements. The Proceeds of Crime Act for instance specifically allows seizure of property acquired or obtained before the passing of the Act and this provision has been upheld by the courts. The Taoiseach, when Minister for Finance, infamously on one occasion made extraordinarily generous changes to the Finance Act, 1994, which applied retrospectively over ten years and which benefited only one individual who was, coincidentally, a generous donor to and diner of the Fianna Fáil party.</P>
    <P>There is another relevant example of retrospection which emerged in today's DIRT hearings before the Committee of Public Accounts. The former Minister for Finance, Ray MacSharry, quoted from his Seanad speech on the Second Stage of the 1987 Finance Bill when he said:</P>
    <P>I will also be concerned to ensure that the return on all deposits taken by relevant deposit takers in whatever form attract the tax, and I will introduce with retrospective effect whatever measures are necessary to achieve this.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste accepts that the Companies Act, 1990, needs to be amended to extend the range of persons or bodies to whom information obtained by the authorised officer may be released. On 16 February 1999, replying to a priority question from my colleague, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, Deputy Harney said:</P>
    <P>The Minister is precluded from making public the results of such inquiries . It is a defect because a Minister is acting in the public interest and when matters come to the Minister's attention it is right that they should be brought into the public arena.</P>
    <P>This quotation is from column 708 of the Official Report, lest I am not quoting the Tánaiste accurately. These are the words of the Tánaiste: &ldquo;it is right in the public interest that when matters come to the Minister's attention that they should be brought into the public arena&rdquo;. What has suddenly changed? A month later, on 24 March, responding to another question from Deputy Rabbitte about the series of investigations being carried out on her behalf, the Tánaiste said &ldquo;The issues are so serious that they should be in the public domain and not just go to the competent authorities&rdquo;. This quotation is from column 890 of the Official Report. What has changed? Why this conversion to secrecy?</P>

      <P>Let us turn to the legislation. The Government has already accepted that the terms of section 21(3) of the Companies Act, 1990, are <Col N="101" /> too narrow in terms of the number of persons or bodies authorised to received information secured in an investigation carried out by an authorised officer. On the Committee Stage debate on the Companies (No. 2) (Amendment) Bill, 1999, currently going though the Dáil, the Government tabled an amendment which accepted the principle of a Labour Party Private Members' Bill to include a tribunal of inquiry among the so-called &ldquo;competent authorities&rdquo; entitled to receive information secured by an authorised officer. The Government amendment actually increased from eight to 15 the number or bodies or persons so authorised.</P>

      <P>During the debate on Committee Stage on 21 July last Deputy Rabbitte also tabled an amendment which would empower the Tánaiste to provide to either House of the Oireachtas or a committee of either House information, books or documents obtained by an authorised officer in the course of an inquiry. Replying on behalf of the Government, the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Noel Treacy &ndash; and he is not a man to wander from his script &ndash; said the &ldquo;.. amendment appears to make sense, but I wish to reflect on it further .&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputy. I could be accused of other things if I was to quote that. To recap &ndash; the Tánaiste has twice told the Dáil that she would like to see information secured by an authorised officer brought into the public domain, her Department seeks to substantially increase the number of bodies or persons who may receive this information and the Minister of State at her Department regards a proposal to allow the Dáil or Seanad to have such information as making sense. Yet now we have a sudden and dramatic U-turn and the Tánaiste refuses to do what she herself was advocating just a few months ago.</P>

      <P>Having lost the argument about retrospection the Government has changed tack and is arguing that to put any names into the public domain would prejudice the right of these people to a fair trial and enable wrong doers to &ldquo;get off&rdquo;. However, the names of close to a dozen individuals or firms who had an alleged involvement with the Ansbacher operation have already been put into the public domain through the affidavit sworn in the High Court last week by the Tánaiste's representative.

      <P>In addition, it is clear that there has been a systematic and selective campaign to release some of the names of those included in Mr. Ryan's report. The Tánaiste must accept political responsibility for the manner in which these names have been leaked. It is her report and her responsibility. As I pointed our earlier, the categories of people who can legally receive such information under section 21(3) are quite limited and do not, for instance, include the Taoiseach. I ask the Tánaiste to state specifically what person she has designated as a person authorised to receive the information under the terms of section 21(3)(c) of the Act. Today on the Order of Business she indicated that the only person she had designated to receive the information was the Taoiseach. Does that mean that the Attorney General has not received the report? If this is so how is it that journalists were given to believe by Government representatives that the Attorney General had, in fact, received it?</P>

      <P>Failure to make the names known will lead to a potentially ludicrous situation, if it has not already done so. We know from the limited information available that those involved in the Ansbacher scam include people who were regarded as pillars of society, captains of industry, members of the boards of some of the most powerful and prominent companies in the State, the type of people who are regarded, especially by Fianna Fáil, as the sort of people who make ideal members of the boards of State companies.</P>

      <P>If these names are not published, how will any Minister considering making key appointments to State boards know whether the person being considered is in fact a tax criminal who may shortly face criminal proceedings?</P>
      <P>I accept that the publication of the names would not be without difficulties &ndash; we accept that &ndash; but it can be done, and it should be done with care. I invite the Tánaiste, if she has not already done so, to read the editorials of the various national newspapers today and yesterday in respect of this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>If our Bill were to be enacted and become law, I would envisage a situation where the Tánaiste would give seven days prior notice to each person mentioned in the report of the authorised officer and undertake to publish and circulate at the same time, and at the Minister's expense, such statement as any one of them might want to make relating to the circumstances in which their name appeared in the report.</P>
      <P>Last week's disclosures regarding the Ansbacher scandal came against a background of the opening of negotiations between the Government and the social partners on a possible new national agreement. Any delay in publishing the names will create further distrust among workers and further jeopardise the chances of a successful outcome to the negotiations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tax evasion continues to be a problem. Despite repeated efforts to tighten up the law, people continue to break the law because it seems to them that the risks involved are at an acceptable level. People do not go to jail for tax evasion. The worst they usually have to face is the payment of back taxes plus a financial penalty. Last week an official of the Revenue Commissioners was sentenced to seven years in prison for attempting to defraud the State of more than £3 million, and quite rightly in my view. When, however, are we <Col N="105" /> going to see sentences of this nature not just for those who attempt to defraud the system from within, but who actually rob the system from outside?</P>
    <P>Tax evasion continues to be a problem and it will be a problem until such time as we deal with it effectively. It is time that we, as a society, accepted that tax evasion is not a victimless crime and treated it accordingly. Every pound in tax evasion means either an extra pound added to the tax bill of compliant taxpayers or a pound less to fund schools, hospitals, social welfare or other vital public services. While the full extent of the loss to the Exchequer from the Ansbacher scam has yet to be established, it is likely to run into tens, if not hundreds, of millions of pounds.</P>
    <P>What has intensified the anger of compliant taxpayers is that this massive evasion was going on when PAYE workers were carrying a particularly crippling and disproportionate share of the tax burden and when they were being asked to accept &ldquo;in the national interest&rdquo; cutbacks in essential services on which they and their families depended. Let me quote a phrase which might strike a resonance with some people of the Government side of the House, &ldquo;cutbacks that hit the old, the sick and the handicapped&rdquo;, the weasel words of one of Ansbacher's most prominent clients.</P>
    <P>What is even more galling, however, is that the same business community, of which the Ansbacher account holders were such prominent members, was busy lecturing PAYE workers about the need for restraint and for cutbacks in public expenditure. The disclosures have done enormous damage to the standing and reputation of the Irish business community. The damage is compounded by the Government's refusal to release the information in Mr. Ryan's report and, as a result, a cloud of suspicion hangs over much of the Irish business community, unreasonable and unfair as that might be. I am surprised, however, at the comparative silence of the representative organisations for business and commerce in this country. Leaders of these organisations must consider what steps they can take to rehabilitate the reputation of business in the light of the fallout. A start would be for these organisations to make it clear that there will be no place within their ranks for those who have been involved in tax evasion.</P>
    <P>Those of us who in the past raised the possible existence of a privileged élite with political influence, an inside track when it came to key business deals, and a disdain for meeting their tax obligations were derided from the Fianna Fáil benches, and particularly by one former Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party, as political extremists, envious of the success and achievement of Irish business.</P>

      <P>If we were wrong, we were wrong only to the extent that we significantly underestimated the greed and avarice of this group. To put it bluntly, we did not know the half of it.</P>
      <P>The anger of taxpayers, who loyally paid their taxes week in and week out despite the pain involved, is perfectly understandable. They were misled and taken advantage of. Their loyalty was taken for granted. Their children, their parents, their sick, were required to depend on inadequate and often second class services.</P>
      <P>It should also be acknowledged that many taxpayers feel let down by a political system that did not take adequate steps to ensure that scandals like Ansbacher could not happen. Collectively, politicians must now look at ways in which the injustice done to compliant taxpayers can be recognised. As an initial step a decision should be made by the Government to ring-fence all of the money recovered as a result of the DIRT inquiry or the investigations into the Ansbacher affair and this should be paid in the form of a rebate to current and former taxpayers in recognition of the loyalty and the disproportionate burden they were asked to carry when so many others were escaping scot free. This should include all of the money recovered either as unpaid tax or as penalties.</P>
      <P>Of course much more than this is required to deliver a fully fair tax system but this, I would suggest to the House and to the Tánaiste in particular, would be a fitting gesture that would not only recognise the loyalty of compliant taxpayers but that we, as a society, are no longer prepared to tolerate tax evasion.</P>
      <P>I wish to convey to the Tánaiste, if she has not already appreciated the conveyance, to her party back-benchers and to the Fianna Fáil Party that they ignore at their peril the anger across the State from compliant taxpayers, they ignore at their peril the common editorial line coming out from the national, provincial and regional newspapers and they should monitor the change in opinion that has been expressed by those newspapers since Sunday.</P>
      <P>In her remarks the Tánaiste said that I had criminalised 120 people in my radio interview on Sunday. Anyone who had a secret numbered account, who did his business by phone, who ensured that a trail of paper and records was mutilated in the manner described by Mr. Appleby and Mr. Ryan, was <i>prima facie</i> engaged in criminal evasion of taxes. These were not regular banking clients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Tánaiste, sadly, knows much more about these things than we do but she trailed it up on 31 December when she talked about &ldquo;Exposed: a golden circle of swindlers&rdquo;. If anyone has been doing a political striptease about this matter, it <Col N="107" /> has been the Tánaiste. The time has come for her to expose fully those involved and to publish this report in line with her comments to Deputy Rabbitte over the last number of months.</P>
    <P>We have clearly seen that the arguments of retrospection do not stand up. The Minister has the power but lacks the political ability. We are calling on her to exercise that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan:</NameTxt>
      <P>A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I thank you for the opportunity to raise this important matter which is affecting a huge number of farmers. This is the second time this year that I have requested the Minister for Agriculture and Food to take immediate steps to refund 100 per cent compensation to the farmers concerned. In an Adjournment debate on 4 February 1999, the Minister replied to me as follows:</P>
      <P>I am pleased to have this opportunity of . . . setting out the arrangements which were agreed at the EU Council of Agriculture Ministers meeting in December [1998] to compensate farmers for the reduction of approximately 5 per cent in certain direct payments which has resulted from the introduction of the euro on 1 January 1999 . . .</P>
      <P>The green rates which applied to certain direct payments to farmers, that is, livestock premia, arable aid, farm retirement pensions, REPS payments and certain forestry payments, were frozen in 1995.</P>
      <P>The Minister went on to state that:</P>
      <P>. . . the agri-monetary arrangements for the introduction of the euro, which were agreed at the Council of Agriculture Ministers in December [1998], include compensation for such losses.</P>
      <P>Compensation will be paid over the next three years. Full compensation, 100 per cent funded by the EU, will be provided in 1999. Two further annual tranches of compensation will be paid, each reduced <i>vis-a-vis</i> the level of the previous tranche by at least a third of the amount paid out in the first tranche; these will be funded equally by the EU and member states, with the member state's contribution being optional.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has failed to honour his promise. The Department, in a letter to a constituent in south-west Cork in September, admitted that the Minister did not apply, until March 1999 &ndash; four full weeks after I raised the matter here &ndash; to the EU for 100 per cent compensation to be paid to <Col N="108" /> participants in the scheme of early retirement from farming.</P>
    <P>I have the letter here. It states that:</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture and Food applied in March of this year to the EU for 100 per cent compensation to be paid to participants in the scheme of early retirement from farming. The early indications from the EU were that they would be in a position to pay the first amount of compensation in the middle of 1999 with a further payment at the end of the year. However, to date the EU have not confirmed details of compensation amounts to be paid to Irish farmers under the scheme. It is anticipated that details should be finalised in the next few months.</P>
    <P>It is a pity the Minister for Agriculture and Food is not present to answer this. He deliberately misled the House and me in February 1999 when he said he had made an application for the refund of this compensation to the farmers. Yet, in a letter to a constituent, dated September 1999, the Minister stated he did not apply for it until a month after I raised the matter here. I urge the Minister to come into the House and put the record straight. I hope the Minister of State, Deputy Davern, can explain why it took four to five weeks, after I raised the matter here, for the Minister to ask the EU to refund the farmers concerned.</P>
    <P>What other sector of the community would consent to a 5 per cent cut in their pensions on which they rely for a livelihood since giving up farming? No other sector in the community would accept a 5 per cent cut in REPS grants etc. I urge the Minister of State, Deputy Davern, to impress on his senior Minister, Deputy Walsh, the necessity to rectify this anomaly immediately and not to cod the Irish farmers.</P>

      <P>Arrangements were agreed at the EU Council of Agriculture Ministers meeting in December 1998 to compensate farmers for the expected reduction in certain direct payments which would result from the introduction of the euro on 1 January 1999. In the event, that reduction proved to be 5.055 per cent.</P>
      <P>It was agreed that compensation would be paid over three years. Full compensation, 100 per cent funded by the EU would be provided in respect of 1999 payments. Two further annual tranches of compensation would be paid, each reduced <i>vis-a-vis</i> the level of the previous tranche by at least a third of the amount paid out in the first tranche; these further annual tranches would be funded equally by the EU and the member state, with the member state's contribution being optional.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="109" /> While these compensation arrangements were approved in principle in December 1998, Commission Regulation (EC) No. 755/1999 setting out the amounts of compensation for each member state concerned in respect of livestock premia, early retirement and rural environment protection measures was not adopted until April 1999. In accordance with the regulations, a formal application setting out details of the compensation required and the payment method proposed in each area concerned was submitted by my Department to the European Commission on 30 April 1999. Following correspondence and contacts with the Commission Services, a revised application for compensation was forwarded to the Commission on 23 September 1999. As the Commission is allowed a further period of two months to consider the revised application, approval for payment of the compensation is expected by the end of November at the latest. I will, however, be pressing the Commission for approval at an earlier date.</P>
    <P>However, in the case of the rural environment protection scheme, with the exception of two of the supplementary measures, following consultations with the Commission, the full amount in Irish pounds hitherto payable can now be paid and this will be done in the next week or so.</P>

      <P>The Deputy cannot attack the Minister of State, Deputy O'Keeffe at the same time. Arrangements will be made for payment of the compensation under the other schemes as soon as the Commission approval is received. However, the compensation in the case of the special beef premium will be paid with the final instalment of that premium and payment of the extensification premium will not arise until May-June 2000.</P>
      <P>In relation to arable aid, Commission Regulation (EC) No. 1639/1999 setting out the detailed amounts of compensation for each member state was not adopted until 26 July 1999, as the amounts could not be calculated until the beginning of the marketing year, i.e. 1 July. The detailed proposals for disbursement of these amounts will be forwarded to the Commission shortly and approval is expected within two months thereafter.</P>
      <P>The Minister, Deputy Walsh, is doing an exceptional job and I know that in his heart the Deputy appreciates it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you for the opportunity to raise this important issue of REPS inspections and the inspection of retirement applications. The <Col N="110" /> Minister and his Department should be aware of the serious problem in the office in Navan, due to staff shortages, for a very long time. I have in my possession representations from farmers who come under the 5 per cent REP scheme. No later than today, my constituency office has informed me that they were only dealing with the 5 per cent inspections that were taken out of the system to be put by for inspection in February 1999.</P>
      <P>It means that the inspection files for June, July, August and September of this year will not be dealt with under the present system until 2000. People with small incomes from 40 or 50 acres of land will be deprived of their money from the Department until next year. Why can a system not be put in place so that at least 75 per cent of the payment will be made subject to an inspection? This would be reasonable and fair and it would give hope to those people whose incomes have decreased in recent years.</P>
      <P>I know people who applied for the farm retirement scheme seven months ago but whose applications have not yet been processed because of a lack of staff. I do not want the Minister to give us the reply that was given to Deputy Johnny Brady today when he asked a parliamentary question on it. It states that the backlog of work in some of the rural development and environmental schemes has arisen in the Department's office in Navan, County Meath, due to recent retirements and resignations. However, this has been a problem since last December. That reply is incorrect and unfair to the people I and the other Deputies in my constituency represent. The office has been understaffed for a long time. The Minister informed us that an RDE inspector was appointed last Monday, 27 September, but two more people are required to do the work in that office. I ask the Minister to give a commitment that people will be seconded from elsewhere to this office to deal with the work. The situation is unfair to people with small incomes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern:</NameTxt>
      <P>I sympathise with the Deputy's point. The inspections seem to be done at random because I have already had my third REPS inspection this year and a special beef premium inspection.</P>
      <P>The rural environment protection scheme and the scheme of early retirement from farming have both been extremely successful and this is shown by the scale on which they have been taken up by farmers. In 1994, which was the first year of REPS, there were 500 participants. This year that number has increased to almost 43,000. The early retirement scheme began with 1,000 participants in 1994 but it now has more than 8,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The success of these schemes is most welcome but it brings its own problems. REPS is worth a projected £160 million to the farming sector in 1999 and the early retirement scheme is worth up to £80 million. Both schemes are funded partly by the Exchequer and partly by the EU. They are governed by EU regulations and they are both necessarily subject to a high degree of control and <Col N="111" /> inspection to ensure that participants continue to meet their obligations. The enormous growth in the number of participants has placed an increasing strain on the limited human resources which my Department can dedicate to them among the many other programmes and services it must deliver.</P>
    <P>Applications under REPS are submitted to my Department's local farm development service offices. Nationally, the average time taken to process an application for first payment is less than four weeks.</P>
    <P>However, 5 per cent of new applicants are subjected to a detailed pre-payment check, including on-farm inspection, and the processing of these cases naturally takes longer. In the case of applications for REPS payments in the second and subsequent years, 45 per cent are recommended for payment by the district superintendent generally within a few weeks. The remaining 55 per cent are subjected to on-farm checks which take on average eight weeks to do prior to going for payment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern:</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of non-compliant participants there are further delays in processing. As regards the early retirement scheme, 10 per cent of applications are subject to a pre-payment check and 10 per cent of all participants are compliance-checked annually.</P>
      <P>The Deputy referred specifically to the situation in County Meath. There were 1,091 participants in REPS and 279 participants in the early retirement scheme in County Meath at the beginning of this year. In addition to the heavy demands placed on my Department's limited resources by the volume of participants in the two schemes and the level of inspections required by the control procedures, there are certain local factors in County Meath which have contributed to the delays to which the Deputy referred. The current staffing complement of the Navan office is two rural development and environment inspectors, one district superintendent, one supervisory agricultural officer and two technical agricultural officers. One of the two RDE inspectors retired earlier this month and a replacement was appointed shortly afterwards. The second RDE inspector is resigning and my Department will actively pursue the filling of his post.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The post of district superintendent has been vacant since the previous occupant was transferred to another office at the end of August. My Department is also pursuing the filling of that post as a matter of urgency but, pending an appointment to it, the more pressing work has been carried out by district superintendents from the Dublin and Louth offices in addition to their normal duties. These officers have approved a significant number of payments to farmers participating in REPS. Some 81 such payments were sent in the post today and a further 20 are cleared <Col N="112" /> for payment. I assure the Deputy that the officer filling the post is an extremely efficient and well qualified lady.</P>
    <P>Except where there are queries relating to files, REPS inspections are up to date for County Meath. As regards the early retirement scheme, while compliance inspections are up to date, some backlog remains on the processing of new applications and this problem is receiving attention. My Department is committed to providing an acceptable level of service to it clients. At the same time, it must be conscious of the need to maintain a level of control which will guard against errors and abuses in the operation of the various schemes for which it is responsible. My Department is constantly reviewing both its procedures and the way it deploys its limited human resources with a view to meeting both objectives to the greatest extent possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is unfortunate the Minister for Health and Children has not been able to attend tonight to reply to this debate.</P>
      <P>Yesterday the distressing story of a 52 year old man with Alzheimer's disease was featured in the <i>Evening Herald</i>. Up to two years ago this man was leading a perfectly normal life but, with the rapid onset of Alzheimer's disease, he now requires constant care. Seven months ago he was placed in a private nursing home in Dublin but his family have been told by the nursing home that it is no longer able to care for him because of the nature of his illness.</P>
      <P>This heartrending story is not unusual. Hundreds of families throughout the country are acutely aware of the huge shortfall in care facilities for people with dementia. Nursing home facilities for such people are grossly inadequate, particularly for male patients. Many nursing homes, like the one we heard about yesterday, are forced to turn down patients with acute dementia because of their inability to meet the care needs of these patients.</P>
      <P>With nowhere else to go, these patients are often placed in general hospitals which are totally unsuited to their needs. Unfortunately, it is often the case that because a general hospital does not suit Alzheimer's patients' needs, they are sedated to a much greater extent than is medically necessary. This is simply to allow them to be contained within hospitals. This is a totally unacceptable practice and only arises because of the severe lack of places available for such patients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When it comes to providing private care, most families do not have the money to place their loved ones in a care facility that will provide the type of professional care that they so desperately require. As it stands, families with a member in a private nursing home are entitled to receive a maximum of £120 a week as a subvention. This leaves a huge shortfall to be met. My reason for raising this issue is that it was recently brought starkly to my attention by a constituent whose 79 <Col N="113" /> year old father has acute dementia. He has been cared for by his 75 year old wife for the last number of years. She has provided tremendous care and attention in a loving setting at home, but it has reached the point where she will not survive herself if she continues doing so. The family applied for a subvention and they were granted the maximum amount of £120. They sought a nursing home place and they eventually found a suitable place in Whitehall in the Alzheimer's centre, where the man settled in well.</P>
    <P>When the family went to claim the subvention from the health board, they were told they were not entitled to it because the man was in a nursing hospital facility rather than a nursing home. I appeal to the Minister of State to ensure that a minor technicality such as this does not prevent a family ensuring that their loved one receives the type of care and attention to which he is entitled and which they desperately want him to have at the end of his days. When they brought this matter to my attention, I contacted the Eastern Health Board which checked every nursing home in the city of Dublin that was capable of catering for Alzheimer's patients. It was unable to find a place. There is one facility on the north side of Dublin which may be suitable but, unfortunately, there are no beds there at present. The family were told that they would have to wait until a patient died.</P>
    <P>They are not prepared to move their father out of a nursing facility which meets his needs exactly. As it stands, the family will have to make up the huge shortfall because it is not a cheap facility by any means. Under great pressure, the family is prepared to scrimp and save and to put together the money to make up the balance. However, I cannot understand why the Minister of State cannot approve the payment of the £120 subvention in this case. I point out that the family has no other choice whatsoever. It is out of the question for this man to come home and for his elderly wife to care for him and there is nowhere else in the entire Eastern Health Board area which can cater for this man.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister in the strongest possible manner to ensure that a small, minor technicality will not get in the way of this man receiving the care he needs. I urge him to ensure that the subvention can be paid to the man in this suitable facility which happens to be a nursing hospital.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt):</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Shortall for raising this issue. I wish to advise her that I look after the elderly section which includes the dementia area. This is why the Minister, Deputy Cowen, is not present. It is appropriate that I should deal with the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The payment of subvention in private nursing homes is governed by the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, which together with regulations made under the Act came into effect on 1 <Col N="114" /> September 1993. The provisions of the Act specifically exclude institutions within the meaning of the Mental Treatment Acts, 1945 to 1966. Private hospitals of the type referred to by the Deputy are not, therefore, covered by the nursing homes subvention scheme. However, there are a range of other options available in relation to the provision of services for people with dementia.</P>
    <P>Regarding these services, I have been informed by the Eastern Health Board that the level of service provision by way of long stay facilities, contract beds and public psychiatric hospitals provide sufficient flexibility in the system to meet the range of current demands.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy gives me a chance to reply, I will take her points on board. The Deputy may be already aware that certain private nursing homes provide care for particular categories of patients, such as those suffering from dementia. Persons seeking admission to such a nursing home may be eligible for assistance under the subvention scheme and application should be made to the appropriate health board by or on behalf of the person concerned. I will pass on the particular circumstances of the case raised by the Deputy to the chief executive officer of the Eastern Health Board for his attention. I understand the Deputy has already done so but I will also do it.</P>

      <P>In relation to the private nursing home subvention scheme generally, I wish to add that £33 million is being spent on the scheme in the current year. This represents a substantial increase on the 1998 figures arising mainly from the increased number of people in receipt of subventions and more people being assessed as having higher levels of dependency.</P>
      <P>I have taken note of the Deputy's comments and I will take them on board when I contact the chief executive officer of the Eastern Health Board. As the Deputy said, dementia is a problem and there may not be suitable facilities readily at hand. However, the chief executive officers have flexibility and I will exhort them to perhaps do something for this particular patient.</P>

        <i>(Mayo)</i>
        <b>:</b> The awarding of a public service vehicle licence to the man convicted in 1995 of raping and having unlawful carnal knowledge of a 14 year old girl was grossly irresponsible on the part of the State. How somebody who was in jail following one of the most high profile and controversial court cases to come before the courts in recent times, and which eventually led to the young victim having an abortion in Britain, was deemed by the State to be suitable to hold a taxi licence is incomprehensible and indefensible. The blame lies fairly and squarely on the State.</P>
      <P>Cabinteely Garda station, which received the initial application for the licence, should not have been operating on forms which were three years out of date. However, even using the old forms, there is no excuse for awarding the licence to somebody convicted of such a serious crime. The Criminal Records Office, to which the application was sent from Cabinteely, had the man's name, date of birth and previous criminal record. Although he had changed address, the CRO warned Cabinteely that a man with the same name had a criminal record for the unlawful carnal knowledge of a 14 year old girl. At this stage, there should have been an immediate and thorough check done to ensure that the applicant was not the convicted person. No such check was done. The form was passed to the local Garda superintendent who passed it on to the Carriage Office at Dublin Castle and the licence duly issued. The negligence does not end there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to the National Taxi Drivers Union, one of their members recognised the hackney driver last November and reported the matter to <Col N="116" /> the Carriage Office. It assumed that the driver would be called in and his licence revoked. This was not done. According to the Garda, one of its members also observed the man driving a hackney and informed his superiors as far back as July 1998. It is established that human error on the part of a garda was to blame and it was decided not to revoke the licence because a psychologist's report from Arbour Hill, where the man served his sentence, allegedly described him as not possessing violent tendencies. Surely anybody who knows anything about criminal behaviour knows well that of all the areas of human misconduct, the likelihood of reoffending is highest among sex offenders. This case involves somebody who raped a 14 year old, first, being issued with a licence and, second, being allowed to retain his licence even though the matter of his criminal record had come to the notice of the authorities on at least two occasions.</P>
    <P>It is no excuse to defend the decision to allow him to retain his licence by maintaining that the man could challenge the decision in court. A court would not stand over a decision to award such a licence in the full knowledge of the man's previous conviction, it would not permit someone to retain a licence where the service he was providing involved picking up girls and young children after darkness and in secluded situations, nor would it elevate the constitutional right of the convicted person to earn a living over and above the constitutional right of a young girl to travel in a taxi in safety.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister spell out his version of exactly how this man got this licence? Will the Minister say why the authorities did not revoke this man's licence when it came to their attention, and if an examination has been carried out or an investigation or inquiry into the identity of existing PSV licence holders established, to ensure that such licence holders have not been convicted of sexual or other violent crimes in the past? The Minister must reassure the public tonight that no such situation will ever be repeated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell" hpid="Ms O. Mitchell Ms O. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I will highlight a related matter &ndash; that there are close to 4,000 hackney cabs operating in Dublin with no external identification. We are all aware, and parents are particularly aware of the dangers for women and young girls, who are often alone at the darkest and loneliest times of night when they enter even a clearly marked, fully licensed taxi driven by someone with a full and valid PSV licence issued by the Garda. How much greater are those dangers for the same girls when they enter unmarked cars in the same circumstances &ndash; unmarked cars which may or may not be driven by one of the 4,000 valid hackney drivers? The Minister may not be aware that young girls are being picked up every night of the week in this city by unscrupulous people in cars purporting to be hackneys. It is particularly so in the busy, dark winter nights in the run-up to Christmas when demand is high.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="117" /> The regulations which allow external identification, which in itself is only a minimal safeguard, have been agreed but have been unsigned on the desk of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, for some months. They must be signed before someone is hurt. I do not know if the Minister is aware that the word on the street is that the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, does not wish to upset the taxi industry by allowing external identification for valid hackneys. I assure the Minister that the upset of the taxi industry, awesome as it can be, will be nothing compared to the upset of the public if a young girl is raped or murdered in one of these unmarked cars. I plead with the Minister to speak with the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, about this matter. As we come into winter, it is time to have the regulations signed and hackney cabs made clearly identifiable in this city.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot speak for the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, but anyone who knows him, even fleetingly, will accept that the last thing of which one could accuse him is being afraid of any lobby group. I am as concerned as any Member that the procedures used by the Garda authorities for the licensing of public service vehicles are adequate to ensure that PSV licences are granted only to persons who are fit and proper to hold such licences. The legal position is that the legislation concerning small public service vehicles &ndash; taxis and hackneys &ndash; is set out in the Road Traffic (Public Service Vehicles) Regulations, 1963, (S.I. 191 of 1963) as amended. The primary legislation is the Road Traffic Act, 1961, (Part VII) as amended.</P>
      <P> While the Minister for the Environment and Local Government is responsible for all road traffic legislation, including small public service vehicle legislation, under current arrangements the Garda Commissioner has responsibility for the following: enforcement of the regulations, including inspections of vehicles; licensing of drivers of public service vehicles; enforcement of the relevant road traffic legislation governing the operation of hackneys and taxis, such as correct fares, assaults and hackneys plying for hire; and approval of ranks. Prosecutions under the above regulations are taken by the Garda Carriage Office, Dublin Castle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand local authorities are responsible for the licensing of hackneys and taxis, creating or altering taxi meter areas, and determining the number of taxis in a taxi meter area. The issue of the processing of public service vehicle applications with regard to the suitability of applicants is a matter for the Garda authorities, and responsibility for ensuring that persons are fit to be granted a licence rests with the authorising officer in accordance with the provisions of the Road Traffic (Public Service Vehicles) (Amendment) (No. 2) Regulations, 1970, (S.I. 200 of 1970). In these circumstances, the Deputies <Col N="118" /> will appreciate that I had no prior knowledge of this case until it came into the public domain.</P>
    <P>I have been advised by the Garda authorities that a working group has been set up to review existing procedures for the processing of public service vehicle applications. I expect this review will address the issues raised regarding the procedures for ensuring that PSV licences are only granted to appropriate persons. I have been assured that any change in existing procedures considered necessary will be put in place as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>In terms of the background to the case referred to by the Deputy, I am informed by the Garda authorities that the individual convicted in the X case applied for a PSV licence at his local Garda station. A check was made regarding the applicant's character and a conviction recorded against him was not matched. A licence was subsequently granted to him on 22 September 1997. I understand from the Garda authorities that this matter first came to their attention in August 1998. The case was reviewed and the licensee was interviewed on several occasions. A medical report on the licensee was considered along with legal advice on the matter. Having reviewed all the information available, the Garda authorities decided not to revoke the licence. On 21 September 1999, on receipt of further information, the Garda authorities decided to revoke his licence.</P>
    <P>As the House is aware, the Government's An Action Programme for the Millennium contains a commitment to introduce a register of sex offenders. In February last, I sought and obtained Cabinet approval for the preparation of heads of a Sex Offenders Bill to provide for the establishment of such a register, the principal focus of which is to be on offences against children. On 1 June, following consideration by the Cabinet of the heads, I received approval for the drafting of the Bill. In addition to the register, the Bill will deal with post-release supervision of sex offenders by the Probation and Welfare Service and separate legal representation in certain circumstances for complainants of rape and serious sexual assault. It will also include provision for a new civil court order against a sex offender whose behaviour in the community gives the Garda reasonable cause for concern that the order is necessary to protect the public from serious harm. In addition, it will create an offence for a convicted child sex offender to seek or accept employment involving unsupervised access to children without informing the employer of the conviction.</P>
    <P>These measures arise, in the main, from the discussion paper on the law on sexual offences which I published in May of last year and are in line with the responses received to that paper. Preparation of this legislation is being given a high priority within my Department and I expect to be in a position to publish the Bill during the current Dáil session. I trust the new legislation, when enacted, together with any revised procedures <Col N="119" /> established following the Garda authorities' review of the matter, will assist in ensuring that licences are issued only in appropriate circumstances in all cases.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="120" /> The Dáil adjourned at 9.10 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 30 September 1999.</P>

      <askee>Taoiseach</askee>
      <Quest>if projects promoting reconciliation between North-South and East-West only were selected for funding under the Irish Sailors and Soldiers Land Trust Fund; whether the funds were distributed only to organisations actively concerned with reconciliation that favour the Belfast Agreement and are not engaged in any sectarian activities; the criteria considered in the distribution of the funds; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>As I stated in my reply to a question on this matter on 1 June last, the Irish Sailors and Soldiers Land Trust Act, 1988 provides that the money received from the trust be disposed of for the purposes of projects or undertakings, including the Royal National Lifeboat Institution, involving co-operation between the State and Northern Ireland or the State and Britain or relating to the island of Ireland as a whole.</P>
      <P>In December of last year, my Department placed advertisements in the Irish national and Northern Irish newspapers as well as the <i>Irish Post</i> in Britain, inviting applications from organisations or individuals for funding for projects which would fall under the terms of the 1988 Act and, in particular, would promote mutual understanding and reconciliation, or which would sustain and develop ventures on an island of Ireland basis or which would promote the welfare of the Irish community in Britain.</P>
      <P>In assessing submissions, priority was given to organisations that would have difficulty obtaining commercial sponsorship; or where the organisation or proposal would not normally or readily be funded by other Government Departments, statutory agencies or other public authorities, by reference to functions discharged or services provided. Furthermore, because of the relative availability of funding from other sources for North-South co-operation, priority was accorded to projects or undertakings as between the State and Britain, and relating to the island of Ireland as a whole.</P>
      <P>Following an assessment process which was undertaken by an interdepartmental committee, 59 applications were selected which best met the criteria for disbursement of the funds available. Included amongst these are a significant number containing cross-community or cross-tradition elements that provide opportunities for the Government to demonstrate, in a very practical way, the commitments entered into under the Good Friday Agreement to promote reconciliation on the island of Ireland and between the people of Ireland and Britain to show respect for the diversity of traditions in the island.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="122" /> Reflecting the priorities decided by me, 52.6 per cent of the total funding was allocated on an east-west basis &ndash; 36.2 per cent to projects involving the Irish community in Britain and 16.4 per cent to other projects involving east-west co-operation. 47.4 per cent of the funding was allocated to projects on the island of Ireland &ndash; 32 per cent to projects relating to the island of Ireland as a whole and 15.4 per cent to projects involving North-South co-operation.</P>
    <P>I believe that the 59 projects selected constitute a balanced package and I am delighted to have had the opportunity to provide much needed assistance to so many worthwhile initiatives. I have previously circulated with my reply to questions, a list of the successful applicants and I am doing so again with this reply.</P>
    <P>The 59 projects to be assisted are as follows: Aberdeen &ndash; Research Institute of Irish &amp; Scottish studies; Action Group for Irish Youth; An Teach Bán, County Donegal; Armagh Observatory; AVARI; Beyond '96 Youth Club; Boomerang; Bradford &ndash; Irish diaspora research unit; Bray &amp; North Wicklow Women's network; British Irish Association; British Association of Irish Studies; Cambridge Group for Irish Studies; CARA Housing Association; Centre for Peace and Development Studies; Childrens Holiday Scheme; Copernicus project; Cork Lions Club; Corrymeela; Cost of the Troubles Study; Cystic Hygroma; Family Welfare Association; Federation for Ulster Local Studies; Glencree Centre for Peace &amp; Reconciliation; Huddersfield Irish Association; Irish Association for Cultural, Economic &amp; Social Relations; Irish Episcopal Commission for Emigrants; Irish Commission for Prisoners Overseas; Irish Community Care Manchester; Irish Genealogical Research Society; Irish in Britain Representation Group; Bath &ndash; Spa University; Irish Youth Choir; Islington Women's Counselling Centre; World War 2 &ndash; study of military wrecks; Journey of Reconciliation Trust; Keele University &ndash; Dept. of Criminology; Leicester Irish Studies Centre; London Irish Centre; Military Heritage of Ireland Trust; Oxford Hertford College; Parents for choice; Royal National Institute for Deaf &amp; National Association for the Deaf; RehabCare Coventry; RNLI; Royal Dublin Fusiliers; Royal Irish Academy; R.E.A.C.H across the Diamond, Derry; South London Family Service Unit; Safe Start Trust; Salmon of Knowledge &ndash; Shankill school and St. Mary's B.N.S. Rathfarnham Scouting Ireland; UCD Dept. of Folklore; Ulster Society; University of North London; University of Bradford; Voluntary service international; WIRE (Warrington); Women on Ireland Network &ndash; Britain; YMCA Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 31 to 45, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I visited Russia from 14 to 16 September on the first official bilateral visit by a Taoiseach. My visit had two main objectives: to strengthen bilateral political relations between our two countries and to promote Irish exports and business contacts in Russia. I believe that the visit was highly successful in both respects.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, my visit to Russia coincided with the terrorist atrocities which resulted in such a large loss of life in the Moscow area and elsewhere in Russia. I took the opportunity of my visit to convey the condolences of the Irish Government and people on these attacks.</P>
      <P>As regards the political element of my visit to Russia, I met with Prime Minister Putin on Wednesday, 15 September. I also met Governor Mukha of Novosibirsk. On Thursday, 16 September I met Mr. Gennady Seleznyov, Speaker of the Duma; Mayor Yuri Luzhkov of Moscow; Mr. Yegor Stroyev, Chairman of the Federation Council; Governor Vladimir Yakovlev of St. Petersburg; and Former Prime Minister Yevgeni Primakov.</P>
      <P>In addition to these meetings, I had a series of trade related meetings with the accompanying business delegation and their Russian business contacts. I was accompanied during my visit to Russia by a large delegation representing 28 Irish companies, drawn from the software, telecommunications, educational services and agri-food sectors. I also met with members of the Irish business and expatriate community in Russia.</P>
      <P>I discussed a wide range of issues during my meeting with Prime Minister Putin on 15 September, including the economic progress Russia has been making; the growing political and economic relations between our two countries; EU-Russia relations; Ireland's forthcoming Presidency of the Council of Europe; and the Northern Ireland Peace Process. I also raised the continued purchase of Irish beef by Russia. The Prime Minister assured me that the Russian veterinary authorities will continue to play a constructive role in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We discussed East Timor and the question of an urgent and appropriate response from the international community. Prime Minister Putin <Col N="125" /> also highlighted the potential difficulties ahead for the 150,000 refugees from Kosovo and Eastern Slavonia currently in Serbia as winter approaches.</P>
    <P>Following our meeting, Prime Minister Putin and I signed Agreements on Co-operation in Combating Illegal Drug Trafficking and Fighting Crime. The agreements essentially provide for co-operation, information exchange and expertise sharing. I understand they will be laid before the House shortly by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The Prime Minister and I also issued a joint statement on bilateral co-operation in the field of management training for Russians.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, Ireland is seeking election to non-permanent membership of the UN Security Council next year for the term 2001-2002. I am heartened by the broad support which our candidacy has been attracting among many UN member states. Russia as a permanent member of the Security Council does not declare its position until the vote takes place, however, I was encouraged by the approach of Prime Minister Putin to this matter who noted the close coincidence in approach between our two countries towards many international issues.</P>
    <P>I met with President Arafat at Shannon on 21 September. He arrived in Shannon from Cairo and he briefed me on his meeting there with President Mubarak. We discussed the outlook for the Final Status Negotiations, which were launched on 14 September. He also briefed me on the recently concluded Sharm-El-Sheikh Memorandum which restarted the implementation of the Wye Agreement and assured me that Palestinian commitments would be complied with in full. The President expressed his thanks for the support of the EU in relation to Sharm-El-Sheikh and for the Middle East Peace Process in general. We had a discussion about settlements and he briefed me on progress on the Lebanese and Syrian tracks of the Middle East Peace Process. I was pleased to learn from him that there has been some progress towards the construction of a port in Gaza. We also discussed bilateral relations between Ireland and the Palestinian Authority, including the opening of our Representative Office in Ramallah, which we intend will take place before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>I will attend the Special European Council on Justice and Home Affairs in Tampere, Finland on 15 and 16 October. I will meet President Prodi who will also be attending the summit. Prime Minister Lipponen of Finland wrote to me on 27 September setting out the draft agenda for the meeting. It is structured around three main themes: immigration and asylum policy; a European judicial area, including improving citizens access to justice; and the fight against organised crime. I will be meeting with Prime Minister Lipponen this evening as part of his tour of capitals in advance of the special European Council and we will discuss the draft agenda and Ireland's priorities in the justice and home affairs area.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="126" /> My Department is in constant contact with the Department of Foreign Affairs and our embassies abroad in relation to developments on the EU agenda. As I outlined to the House previously, I have established a Cabinet committee to co-ordinate EU business. Its core members are the Tánaiste, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Foreign Affairs. In addition, the Attorney General and other Ministers will attend, as appropriate, on particular issues. This forum allows for the required focus to be given to the important issues which are arising on the EU agenda. The committee's next meeting will take place immediately in advance of the Tampere European Council.</P>
    <P>In addition to informal telephone contacts, it is increasingly the case that on the eve of each European Council, I meet with Prime Minister Blair to discuss both developments in Northern Ireland and the issues on the agenda of the relevant council. Most recently, I met him in advance of the Cologne European Council and would expect to meet him again in the context of the Tampere European Council.</P>
    <P>In relation to my future travel programme, I hope to visit Hungary, Slovenia and our Defence force personnel serving with KFOR in Kosovo from 2 to 4 November. I will also be attending an OSCE Summit of Heads of State and Government in Istanbul on 18-19 November and the European Council in Helsinki on 10-11 December. During my bilateral visits, I have extended invitations to all my counterparts to pay reciprocal visits to Ireland. Other than the visit this evening by Prime Minister Lipponen and the visit next week by Xanana Gusmao, no other inward visits are planned at this time.</P>
    <P>While I have not written to President Prodi in the last three months, he has written to me on the occasion of the investiture of the new Commission.</P>

      <P>In July 1999, my Department declared that its year 2000 compliance programme was complete. My Department has prepared contingency plans to ensure business continuity in the event of year 2000 problems arising. These plans have been approved by management and are currently undergoing external audit.</P>
      <P>A substantial proportion of the time of staff in the IT division of my Department has been devoted to the y2k issue over the past two years. It is not feasible to estimate the cost of this separate from other work of the division. Other expenditure to date identified as relating to tackling the year 2000 problem has been £15,500 approximately. Most of this represents the cost of upgrading hardware and software.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 50 and 51 together.</P>
      <P>At the SMI launch on 22 July, I made a number of announcements on the achievements of the SMI to date and the future work programme. The key theme of the launch was Delivering Quality Public Service &ndash; responding to the needs of a changing environment. The launch focused on a number of initiatives designed to improve the functioning of the Civil Service and to enhance its capacity to deliver high-quality services effectively. Most of these initiatives build on the reports of working groups which were set up under the SMI in recent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Briefly these are: deepening the quality customer service initiative; introducing an action programme for regulatory reform; extending the <Col N="128" /> scope of freedom of information legislation; new financial management systems; developing human resource management issues, including performance management and recruitment; and promoting gender equality.</P>
    <P>Details of these can be seen in the documents contained in the packs which were circulated at the launch. I have arranged for these to be made available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    <P>In my speech that day, I referred to the progress that has been made in recent years in the reform of the public service. I also highlighted the need to continue widening and strengthening the programme of reform throughout the civil and public service. To this end, a number of measures have been taken to ensure that this process is managed effectively. Briefly these are: the SMI implementation group has been broadened to include Departments with large numbers of employees and Departments with responsibility for the wider public sector. This new implementation group is meeting tomorrow to consider its new work programme and how best to progress the deepening of the SMI, based on this sectoral approach.</P>
    <P>The liaison group on widening the SMI to the public service last met in July and is due to meet again early in October. This group comprises representatives from those Departments with responsibility for the various sectors and exists to monitor and progress the SMI modernisation process in the wider public service. It reports directly to the implementation group.</P>
    <P>Central to all these reforms is the effective management of performance. The Government has decided that Ministers and Secretaries General should proceed immediately to develop systems of performance management suited to the business needs of the different sectors. This process will be overseen by the implementation group.</P>
    <P>With regard to the specific issue of equality in the Civil Service, I highlighted the need for more to be done to address this issue. The main problem is the dearth of women in senior management grades and, despite the best of intentions, the lack of progress made in redressing this imbalance. To this end the Government, in July of this year, approved a package of measures which include: the development and adoption of a new equality policy to be drafted by a high-level equality group; a programme of affirmative action in the areas of recruitment, placement-mobility, training and development, promotion, work and family responsibilities, language and sexual harassment and policy delivery; the adoption of strategic objective setting at departmental level, including the setting of increasingly specific equality goals, to be achieved over a stated period of time and the putting in place of new equality structures, locally and centrally, to support implementation of the new policy.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance in his address at the launch stated that additional resources will be deployed in the equality area and the full report <Col N="129" /> on gender imbalance in the Civil Service, produced by the Institute of Public Administration will be published shortly. It is expected that the high level equality group will have its first meeting in the near future to begin work on these issues.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 52 to 61 inclusive together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Social partnership has played a hugely signifi<Col N="130" /> cant role on the transformation of Ireland over the past decade &ndash; in both economic and social inclusion terms. The Government is deeply committed to the process, as exemplified by the latest Progress Report on Partnership 2000 which has been placed in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    <P>The development of the partnership model has been a priority and this is, perhaps, most clearly illustrated by the wide-ranging and systematic monitoring mechanisms in place and the establishment of the National Centre for Partnership. The further development of the model in the years ahead remains a priority, particularly in terms of deepening partnership at the enterprise level but, for that to happen, there must be confidence on the part of till participants that the terms agreed will in fact apply.</P>
    <P>Against that general background, the Tánaiste, the Minister for Finance and I met with representatives of IBEC and ICTU separately on 13 September. We conveyed the Government's concern at the apparent willingness of some groups to substitute strikes and industrial conflict for the partnership approach and a corresponding concern that the terms of Partnership 2000 should be honoured fully by all sides. We emphasised that the Government has honoured the terms of the present and previous partnership agreements, especially in the area of public service pay.</P>
    <P>It is clear that IBEC and ICTU share the Government's view that social partnership has delivered substantially in terms of employment creation, higher living standards across the board, better public services, and improved public finances.</P>
    <P>In our meeting with ICTU specifically, it was agreed that social partnership is only possible in a climate of trust, based on the honouring of commitments. It was further agreed that, in the present context, developments in any part of the public service cannot be viewed in isolation, but will have direct implications for pay and conditions generally through established relativities. This reinforces the importance of developing a new framework for the management of public service pay in its entirety.</P>
    <P>It was also agreed with ICTU that social partnership could evolve to support a continuing improvement in living standards &ndash; keeping the benefits of a high value-added, high income and socially inclusive economy. It was further agreed that discussions on the shape of a renewed model of social partnership, to succeed Partnership 2000, would continue. These would include the shaping of a consensus through the forthcoming NESC Strategy Report, the radical investment programme set out in the National Development Plan, and the continuing talks on a new framework for managing public service pay.</P>
    <P>Regarding the July plenary meeting of Partnership 2000, the main item on the agenda was an overview assessment of progress on social inclusion. The principal areas covered were unemployment, educational disadvantage, income adequacy, urban disadvantage, rural pov<Col N="131" /> erty and equality issues. Further meetings under the present partnership agreement are planned &ndash; the social partners are meeting in secretariat format today and in plenary mode on 18 November to review overall implementation.</P>
    <P>In response to Deputy Bruton's question on the National Competitiveness Council, I met with the chairman and a number of members of the council on 13 July. The members briefed me on papers they had prepared on the issues of social cohesion, telecommunications and e-commerce and skills. This was one of a series of meetings between the council and relevant Ministers.</P>
    <P>Subsequently, on 13 September, the Competitiveness Council published a Statement on Social Partnership which concludes that &lsquo;social partnership has been central to the significant social and economic progress made in Ireland over the past ten years'. The council believes it is essential that formal partnership agreements be maintained and has identified a number of issues pivotal to Ireland's international competitiveness which need to be addressed in a new agreement. I share the council's views in this regard.</P>
    <P>As regards the work programme of the NESC, I understand that this will be settled by the council on the completion of its strategy report at the end of October. The council and the NESC are now sharing premises and support services. I expect that the legislation to place both bodies and their shared support structure on a statutory basis will be published before the end of this session.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>As I informed the Deputy previously, the Government announced on 13 October last that it had agreed to commission a feasibility study for the development of a stadium for the new century and appointed a stadium steering committee to oversee the process. A consortium of consultants led by Price Waterhouse Coopers was appointed to conduct the feasibility study. I understand the study has just been completed and is currently being examined by the stadium steering committee. On receipt of the study from the steering committee, I intend to bring it at an early date to Government for consideration and decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The nature of this high prestige initiative is such that it requires cross-departmental and cross-organisational co-ordination and my Department is best placed to do that. There is a significant time commitment involved and the official who acts as secretary of the stadium steering committee has undertaken this task in <Col N="132" /> addition to his normal duties. In addition to the administrative costs arising from the work of the stadium steering committee, the main cost to my Department will be that of the feasibility study which is £380,033 or £485,542.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 63 and 64 together.</P>
      <P>The information society represents enormous opportunities and challenges for Ireland. The Government is keenly aware of the importance of ensuring that Ireland takes full advantage of modern information and communications technologies, or ICTs, both in the fields of e-commerce and e-government. We need to respond quickly to make sure that the benefits of the information society are availed of by Irish citizens and Irish businesses. That is reflected in the Government's Action Plan on the Information Society &ndash; published earlier this year and also accessible on my Department's website.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the recommendations of the action plan, implementation is monitored and guided by an interdepartmental group with representation at Assistant Secretary General level and a four person team &ndash; the Information Society Policy Development team, which works closely with CMOD in the Department of Finance and liaises as appropriate with other expertise elsewhere in the civil and public service.</P>
      <P>The team, the full complement of which has only been in place since summer, has produced a progress report on the action plan; worked with Departments to identify resource requirements for action plan projects for the remainder of 1999; and prepared draft guidelines for Government websites &ndash; to be issued next month, following consultation with Departments. The current main focus is on assessing resource requirements for action plan projects for next year and beyond.</P>
      <P>In July, the Government agreed to the interim allocation of approximately £7.7 million for projects arising under the action plan for the remainder of 1999. These include projects to provide internet access to the public through the local library network, electronic filing of tax returns, and &ldquo;Netd@ys&rdquo;, an Information Society Commission initiative to promote Internet awareness. I am circulating a full list of the projects to which this funding relates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="133" /> I would clarify that this funding will be managed by the Department of Finance, not by the Information Society Commission. The Information Society Commission will, like other Departments and agencies, be allocated funding in respect of particular initiatives for which it is responsible under the action plan.</P>
    <P>This funding relates only to anticipated expenditure on the projects in question to the end of 1999. Projects in question must be assessed and <Col N="134" /> approved by an evaluation team which includes representation from the Department of Finance and my Department. The evaluation process is under way at present.</P>
    <P>In approving funding for 1999, the Government also agreed in principle to further substantial expenditure on information society projects over the coming years. The amount of expenditure required is currently being assessed with a view to determining requirements for the 2000 Estimates.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Netd@ys is an annual, international initiative to promote the effective use of</P>
      <P>interactive media in learning and teaching. In previous years, the initiative has been co-ordinated in schools in Ireland by the National Centre for Technology in Education. This year, the Information Society Commission has teamed up with the NCTE to expand on the activities of previous years by involving not just the schools but the community at large.</P>
      <P>Netd@ys 1999 will run from 13 to 21 November. Schools, libraries and other commercial and voluntary organisations are being encouraged to open their doors to the public over that period so that people can access and learn about the internet The commission has also hired five mobile computer laboratories  &ndash; or computer gyms, as they are known &ndash; which will be located at various places around the country to provide additional access points for the public.</P>
      <P>Information material is being developed by the commission, in conjunction with the NCTE, to assist organisations participating in the initiative. Special information packs are also being prepared specifically for schools, which will include suggested ways of involving the broader community in the initiative.</P>
      <P>The Information Society Commission will also launch a millennium project &ndash;&ldquo;eWish for a new millennium&rdquo;&ndash; to encourage people to access a special website and to record their personal wish for Ireland as we enter the new millennium. In this way, a permanent record of the wishes of the Irish people will be created and a representative selection will be published on CD and on the internet</P>
      <P>In addition to a contribution of £150,000 by the Government towards the Netd@ys initiative, the Commission has also secured sponsorship from Eircom to help with the costs of the school packs, hiring the computer gyms and advertising, and RTE has agreed to become broadcast sponsor.</P>

      <P>The intranet for the Government secretariat will enable Ministers' offices to establish an electronic link with the secretariat. The first issue, which is being addressed at present, is to identify the appropriate electronic security to safeguard documents being transmitted electronically. These security features will in turn determine the computer and communications infrastructure on which the intranet will be based.</P>
      <P>Designing and implementing the intranet will also involve a re-appraisal of the existing manual methods for dealing with what is an almost exclusively paper based system, so that the potential of the available communications and computing technology can be exploited to allow for the electronic submission of documents, for streamlining the consultation processes which are part of Government procedures, and for the transmission of Government memoranda, agendas and decisions. Consultations will be held with Departments in due course on the development of new processes and procedures which will be required.</P>
      <P>The intranet is intended primarily to provide facilities for Ministers' offices to link and conduct business electronically with the Government secretariat.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 67 and 68 together.</P>
      <P>The Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995, deals comprehensively with the matter of gifts to officeholders. Section 15 of the Act provides that gifts which exceed £500 and which are given to an officeholder by virtue of office be deemed to be gifts to the State. In these circumstances the gift, or in certain circumstances its value, is transferred to State custody or the Exchequer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Act expressly exempts gifts given by a <Col N="138" /> friend or relation of the recipient for personal reasons only.</P>
    <P>Government guidelines prepared in accordance with section 15(4) of the Act provide that all officeholders are expected to adhere to the fundamental principle that an offer of gifts, hospitality or services should not be accepted where it would, or might appear to, place him or her under an obligation. The guidelines go on to make specific provision for dealing with such matters. Again, the guidelines provide that the supply of property/services below £500 in value or made for personal reasons by a friend or relative are exempt.</P>
    <P>Under the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995, each Member of Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann must make an annual statement of registrable interests. Registrable interests excludes living accommodation etc. supplied by a relation or friend of the person for personal reasons only, unless its acceptance might reasonably be seen to have been capable of influencing him or her in the performance of functions as a member, office holder, etc.</P>
    <P>The Cabinet Handbook refers to the statutory requirements and contains a copy of the guidelines to which I have already referred.</P>
    <P>It is evident that the treatment of gifts is addressed comprehensively in the statutory framework and the steps to be taken in different circumstances are clearly specified. The Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995 was a long time in preparation and strikes a fine balance between the right of individuals to have personal lives and the need for accountability in the conduct of official business. I regard the balance struck as appropriate. I have no proposals by way of fresh legislation or addition to the Cabinet Handbook which would interfere with the balance so painstakingly established in the Act.</P>

My Department is currently examining the responses received from other Departments and is considering how proposals for constitutional amendments might best be brought forward in a structured and consolidated way.

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews):</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the Deputy is referring to a Channel 4 programme, broadcast on 15 July this year, which alleged widespread interception by the British authorities of communications originating in this country. At that time, I instructed the ambassador in London to raise these allegations at a very senior level in the British Foreign Office. The ambassador emphasised the public concern, and that of the Government, about the allegations contained in the Channel 4 report. He was informed that it is the policy of the British Government neither to confirm nor deny allegations of specific intelligence activities, and therefore his interlocutor was not in a position to comment on the detailed points raised in the Channel 4 report. However, he informed the ambassador that the interception of telecommunications by British authorities was carried out in accordance with the British Interception of Communications Act, 1985.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Interception of Communications Act <Col N="141" /> makes it an offence to intercept communications by post or by means of a public telecommunication system except under the circumstances set out in the Act. In this regard, warrants authorising the interception of communications may only be issued by a Secretary of State, and only where the warrant is considered necessary in the interests of national security; for the purpose of preventing or detecting serious crime, or for the purpose of safeguarding the economic well-being of the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>Warrants may be issued for a maximum period of two months. While a Secretary of State may renew a warrant, there is a duty to cancel any which are no longer considered necessary. In 1998, 2,031 interception warrants were authorised, of which 487 were in force on 31 December 1998. This would represent only a small fraction of communications.</P>
    <P>The Act also establishes an independent oversight regime in the form of the Interception Commissioner. It also provides for a tribunal to investigate complaints where a complainant believes that his or her communications have been intercepted in breach of the Act.</P>

      <P>I refer Deputies to my earlier answer to Priority Question No 79 from Deputy Mitchell. On the issue of costs and budgetary implications, participation in PfP imposes no mandatory financial contributions. PfP is voluntary and based on the principle of self-differentiation. Each partner funds its own participation. There will be administrative implications arising from Ireland's participation in PfP, for example the leasing of office space in the PfP wing at NATO's Brussels Headquarters, and at Mons, where Ireland currently maintains a single liaison officer from the Permanent Defence Force arising from our participation in SFOR and KFOR. There will also be staffing costs arising from our participation in PfP. Some of these costs will arise in the Department of Foreign Affairs Vote, and others in the Vote of the Department of Defence. Estimates of these costs are under preparation for consideration by the Government.</P>
      <P>As has been made clear to the House on previous occasions, Ireland's practical participation in PfP will focus on co-operation in peacekeeping. The question of resources for peacekeeping is of course primarily a matter for the Minister for Defence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="143" /> I am aware of the document referred to in Deputy Gormley's question which sets out views on a number of issues, including PfP. Debate on these issues, including PfP, is of course to be welcomed. The Deputy will be aware that the Government has consistently sought to encourage discussion of, and awareness of the question of PfP. To this end, the Government published in May of this year an explanatory guide which sets out in some detail what is involved in PfP.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Treaty of Amsterdam contains a commitment to maintain and develop the Union as an area of freedom, security and justice. With a view to ensuring that this was given early practical effect, the Council and the European Commission were requested to submit an action plan on how best to implement these important provisions. The Vienna European Council in December 1998 considered and approved the action plan which contained proposals in relation to co-operation in the field of civil and criminal law, and in regard to asylum and immigration. As a further indication of the importance which the Union attaches to progress is this area, it was agreed during the Austrian Presidency that a Special European Council devoted to justice and home affairs issues should take place at Tampere, Finland on 15/16 October. This will be only the second occasion in which a Special European Council has been convened devoted to a single topic.</P>
      <P>Ireland has participated actively in preparations for the Tampere meeting. These have included discussions at the General Affairs Council on 13 September, and at the informal meeting of Justice and Home Affairs Ministers on 16/17 September which was attended by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy John O'Donoghue. These will be continued this evening when the President of the European Council, Prime Minister Lipponen of Finland visits Dublin for discussions with the Taoiseach, and is expected to provide an update on preparations for the summit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the Amsterdam Treaty, and its provisions on Justice and Home Affairs, now in effect, the Presidency, with support from member states including Ireland, have suggested that Tampere should focus on a number of central issues aimed at strengthening co-operation in the fields of immigration and asylum, the fight against cross-<Col N="144" /> border crime and the establishment of a European judicial area, including ensuring improved access to justice on a Union-wide basis. Recognising that Tampere also provided a valuable opportunity to bring the Union closer to its citizens, we have urged that Tampere should provide an impetus to efforts by the European Union to tackle issues such as crime prevention, violence against women, youth crime and co-operation in the fight against drug-trafficking. In terms of responding to organized crime, we have drawn attention to our legislation aimed at combating money laundering, and the effective work of the Criminal Assets Bureau.</P>
    <P>As regard immigration and asylum, we have supported the view expressed by the Finnish Presidency on the need for a more coherent cross-pillar approach by the European Union, one which ensures that the Union and member states act in a co-ordinated manner. This would facilitate careful consideration of the reasons for, as well as the consequences of, immigration, and ensure that Community policies take into account the root causes of migration flows.</P>
    <P>The Treaty of Amsterdam also re-affirms that the laws of the European Union are guided by the fundamental rights and freedoms established by the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms to which each member state of the Union is a party.</P>
    <P>In order to spell out more clearly the rights and freedoms to which the Union subscribes and on which those resident in the territory are entitled to call, the European Council meeting in Cologne on 3-4 June 1999 decided that a body should be set up to formulate a Charter of Fundamental Rights. The Council envisaged that such a Charter would &ldquo;contain the fundamental rights and freedoms as well as basic procedural rights guaranteed by the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and derived from the constitutional traditions common to the member States, as general principles of Community law&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It was also decided that the drafting body would comprise representatives of the institutions of the Union (Commission, European Parliament, European Court of Justice) and national Parliaments. The Heads of State and Government of the member states are to nominate representatives to the body. Consideration of these nominations is currently under way.</P>
    <P>The working methods to be adopted by the body are being discussed at present by the General Affairs Council which is expected, at its meeting of 11 October, to make recommendations to the special session of the European Council in Tampere on 15-16 October. The European Council should then be in a position to request the body to begin substantive work on the drafting of the Charter which would be formally adopted by the European Council meeting to be held during the French Presidency towards the end of the year 2000.</P>
    <P>The human rights unit of the Department of <Col N="145" /> Foreign Affairs &ndash; in co-operation with the legal division &ndash; has been actively involved in the preparatory stages of this initiative, which commenced during the German Presidency of the EU earlier this year. Now that we are approaching the substantive or drafting stage, the Human Rights Unit will continue to monitor this matter closely and will work with the Taoiseach's representative on the drafting body in order to ensure that Ireland's human rights perspectives are expressed during the drafting of this Charter.</P>
    <P>We look forward to further discussion about all aspects of the Tampere meeting with Prime Minister Lipponen later today. Because of the on-going nature of the discussions, it is not feasible to circulate detailed documentation about the meeting. However, I will consider further, once the agenda is finalized, how best to keep the House informed of developments in the run-up to Tampere, and information on the outcome of the Special European Council will, of course be made available to the House in the normal fashion.</P>

I also indicated that, subject to approval of the House, the Irish contribution would be 40 members of the Army ranger wing. The multinational force is being established under the leadership of Australia on the authority of the Security Council. Under the terms of Resolution 1264 the force will only be deployed within East Timor. Planning for participation by Ireland has already started and it entails consultation with Australia.</P>
      <P>Approximately half the force has already been deployed, including units necessary to establish the beach-head and to secure bases for the remainder of the force. I envisage that after the necessary parliamentary procedure the Irish contribution would be deployed as soon as possible. The precise timing of this is a matter for the Minister for Defence.</P>

      <P>In recent years, there has been a steady increase in <Col N="146" /> the number of applications to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. In part, this reflects the enlargement of the Council of Europe to 41 member states, all of whom are parties to the European Convention for Human Rights.</P>
      <P>According to the information provided by the court, there are currently in the region of 10,000 applications pending of which approximately one third are considered as backlog. In addition, there are over 47,000 provisional files, around one third of which can be expected to become registered applications.</P>
      <P>In order to respond to the increase in applications and the considerably enlarged jurisdiction of the court, Protocol 11 amended the European Convention for Human Rights. The intention of the Protocol was to revise the monitoring and control mechanisms of the Convention to make its system of human rights protection quicker and more efficient. Protocol 11 established a new and permanent Court of Human Rights which was inaugurated on 1 November 1998.</P>
      <P>As the new court is less than a year in operation it is difficult to be conclusive at this stage as to what additional measures may be necessary to cope with its increasing workload.  The matter is presently the subject of a detailed examination by a working group established by the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe.</P>
      <P>It has already been decided to reallocate financial resources to the court in the year 2000 to deal with the backlog. As incoming Presidency of the Council of Europe, Ireland will have a key role in ensuring that the court secures the necessary resources to function effectively. The Irish permanent representative in Strasbourg chairs the special committee dealing with the financial reallocation required for the year 2000.</P>
      <P>As regards the longer term, I agree with the views expressed recently by the President of the new court regarding the need for an increased political commitment by all States parties to the convention. If the workload of the court is to be reduced, full respect at the national level for the provisions and mechanisms of the convention is essential.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 86, 125 and 200 together.</P>
      <P>The burden of debt on developing countries, especially the poorest, is a serious challenge to the international community. The levels of debt repayment required of many heavily indebted poor countries far exceed flows of development assistance. It is not acceptable that the efforts of many of the most impoverished countries to achieve sustainable development are so constrained by the debt overhang.</P>
      <P>I raised this issue in my recent address to the United Nations General Assembly. I stated that Ireland wishes to see the strongest possible link between debt relief and poverty alleviation. It is the poorest and most marginalised who have borne much of the burden.</P>
      <P>In 1996 the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative was launched by the World Bank, the IMF and major donors specifically to provide debt relief for these countries in respect of their debts to the international financial institutions. However the criteria for debt relief were too stringent with the result that only a small number of the 41 countries classified as heavily indebted poor countries have qualified for relief.</P>
      <P>At their meeting in Cologne in June 1999, the heads of Government of the G7 countries agreed on major improvements, including a relaxation in the qualification criteria, to the HIPC initiative. This should result in faster, wider and deeper debt relief. In addition the G7 agreed that bilateral creditors will grant up to 90 per cent relief on eligible debt. The financing of this enhanced HIPC is the focus of attention in the World Bank and the IMF at their annual meeting in Washington. The multilateral financial institutions will have to raise $13.3 billion to implement the initiative.</P>
      <P>The enhanced HIPC does not amount to a full debt cancellation for heavily indebted poor countries. However, if implemented early and in full it will make a major contribution to easing the problem. It will be essential to ensure that the enhanced HIPC receives the finance it requires as soon as possible. We are sympathetic to proposals that, in addition to bilateral contributions, there should be a substantial EU contribution to the HIPC initiative.</P>
      <P>The growing demand for full debt cancellation, such as the Jubilee 2000 campaign, is understandable in view of the impact the debt has on the poorest countries. The strength of international feeling on this issue is recognised and undoubtedly influenced the G7 in their decision to reform the HIPC initiative. Certainly debt cancellation should be explored by bilateral and multilateral donors whenever possible or feasible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Full and absolute debt cancellation poses diffi<Col N="148" /> cult and complex questions of both finance and policy. Many heavily indebted poor countries have made strenuous efforts to reform their economies to qualify for debt relief.  Under the enhanced HIPC the debt of these countries should fall to levels which are sustainable and which do not drain resources from key social sectors such as health and education. This will be of immense benefit.</P>
    <P>The creditor governments who will be called on to pay very substantial amounts in support of debt relief want to ensure that it has a positive impact on development. There is, therefore, a difficulty in considering debt relief, let alone cancellation, for countries whose economies are grossly mismanaged. In addition, other issues such as internal conflict, corruption and human rights abuses are also relevant in assessing debt alleviation.</P>
    <P>Ireland is not a bilateral creditor of the developing countries. We strongly welcome measures, whether through debt relief or debt cancellation, which help relieve the burden. On a national level we have agreed to contribute funds of over £31 million to help ease the debt burden of heavily indebted poor countries. Bilaterally we have already contributed £9.5 million to debt relief in Tanzania and Mozambique, two priority countries of Irish Aid. We are also contributing £22 million through the World Bank and the IMF to the financing of the HIPC initiative.</P>
    <P>The Government has also adopted a number of guiding principles on developing country debt. In addition to supporting reform of the HIPC initiative, the Government agreed to encourage the international community, including bilateral creditors, to take a generous and flexible approach to the heavily indebted poor countries. Both the Minister for Finance and I in our discussions in the EU and at the World Bank fully respect this principle. Together with other like minded countries we continue to press for greater efforts to be made, by whatever means, to resolve once and for all this challenge to development.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Treaty of Amsterdam, which came into force in May, incorporates into the Common Foreign and Security Policy the Petersberg Tasks, that is humanitarian, rescue, peacekeeping and crisis management tasks. The crises in the Balkans during the 1990s have given support to the view that the EU should be better able to act at an early stage to prevent and manage such crises and the Amsterdam Treaty's provisions respond to that viewpoint.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Cologne European Council in June adopted an important Declaration on European <Col N="149" /> Security and Defence. The Cologne decisions reflect the EU's wish to give further impetus to the development of the EU's capabilities for conflict prevention, peacekeeping and crisis management, on the basis of the Treaty of Amsterdam.</P>
    <P>The Cologne European Council focused on possible ways of enhancing the EU's ability to take effective and informed decisions in relation to peacekeeping and crisis management. Various possibilities have been mooted. The Finnish Presidency will submit a further progress report to the Helsinki European Council in December. The Cologne European Council mandated the General Affairs Council to consider how the Western European Union's Petersberg Task functions could be adapted and brought into the EU to allow the EU to fulfil its responsibilities under the Amsterdam Treaty in the area of Petersberg tasks.</P>
    <P>Ireland is examining this approach, which emphasises the Petersberg tasks but leaves the Western European Union's Article V mutual defence clause to one side. The Cologne Declaration explicitly makes clear that the different status of member states in regard to collective defence guarantees will not be affected.</P>
    <P>The purpose, as set out at Cologne, is to increase the EU's ability to contribute to international peace and security in accordance with the principles of the UN Charter. It is important that all EU members have the right to participate in Petersberg tasks. We welcome therefore the Cologne conclusion that the goal is to develop an effective EU-led crisis management in which both allied and neutral members of the EU can participate fully and on an equal footing.</P>
    <P>Also of importance is the issue of the EU's ability and capabilities to respond rapidly to international crises. In this connection, the Western European Union is currently undertaking an Audit of Assets and Capabilities for Petersberg tasks. The Western European Union Observers are associated with this Audit which should be completed before the Helsinki European Council.</P>
    <P>These are issues for further reflection under the Finnish Presidency and subsequently. The current aim of the EU is to take the necessary decisions by the end of the year 2000. Security and defence issues within the EU are intergovernmental matters, subject to the sovereign decision of the member states. It is accepted that participation in Petersberg tasks is a voluntary and sovereign decision for member states in each and every case.</P>
    <P>In a separate but related process, the EU is examining its capacities for non-military crisis management. For example, the possibility is being considered of a stand-by capacity to pool national civil resources and expertise for responding to crises. Work on this issue is still at an early stage. I very much welcome the objective of this work which will go hand in hand with the work on Petersberg tasks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 89 and 130 together.</P>
      <P>The devastating earthquake which hit the Marmara region of Turkey on August 17th has left over 15,000 dead and thousands more injured. The disaster resulted in an immediate and generous response from the international community. In the immediate aftermath of the earthquake, the Turkish Government declared a state of emergency for the region and requested international assistance. Ireland was among the first countries to respond to the humanitarian needs of the people affected by the earthquake making an initial grant of IR£200,000 to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent to enable them to purchase essential supplies such as food, water and any available medicines locally. As the scale of the devastation became clearer and more information on the needs of the victims became available, the Government announced a further grant of £500,000 to provide for the survivors of the earthquake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In response to an appeal by the Turkish Government for various essential items which were in short supply, part of the second grant was used to purchase essential medical and emergency supplies in Ireland. In total two shipments of medical supplies, antibiotics and water purification tablets weighing over 4 metric tonnes were <Col N="151" /> flown to Istanbul by Aer Lingus and Turkish Airlines free of charge.</P>
    <P>Allocations were also channeled through the United Nations Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs to assist them in their role of co-ordinating the relief effort and through the United Nations Children's Fund.  UNICEF is providing sanitation and shelters in the camps which have been set up to house the homeless.</P>
    <P>During the course of the United Nations General Assembly, the Minister for Foreign Affairs met with Foreign Minister Cem of Turkey and discussed further ways in which Ireland could be of assistance. The European Union also responded to the disaster, with the European Community Humanitarian Office (ECHO) announcing an initial grant of 2 million euros in emergency humanitarian assistance just hours after the earthquake. A further grant of 2 million euros was made available as needs became clearer. This is part of a planned 30 million euro package of assistance. ECHO is focusing on addressing the needs of the persons made homeless by the disaster, providing weather resistant shelter and ensuring basic medical care.</P>
    <P>With regard to the immediate and long-term reconstruction effort in Turkey, this is being funded on a multilateral basis. The European Commission is proceeding with plans for new and substantial assistance for rehabilitation and reconstruction to come from European Investment Bank lending as well as macro-financial assistance and MEDA II (Mediterranean Assistance Development Programme) funds. It is proposed that loans of up to 600 million euros be provided to Turkey to assist in the reconstruction process. In addition, 150 million euros earmarked as regional aid for Turkey, will be allocated to assist in the reconstruction effort.</P>
    <P>In relation to the recent earthquake in Greece, the government of Greece did not request any international financial assistance in the aftermath of the earthquake given their own relatively developed response capability. Specialist search and rescue teams were dispatched from countries experienced in dealing with such emergencies.</P>

      <P>My colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, replied to a similar question from the Deputy on 22 June. In the meantime, there has been no material change in the position, due to the con<Col N="152" /> tinuing impasse regarding the establishment of the Executive and decommissioning.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, all of the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement are interconnected, and are intended to come into being at the same time. Therefore, the blockage in the creation of the executive has effectively halted progress on arrangements for the establishment of the North-South institutions, including the North-South implementation bodies.</P>
      <P>As was indicated to the Deputy in June, decisions on the location and headquarters of the implementation bodies will be a matter collectively for the two administrations, North and South, and it would not be appropriate for me to pre-empt the outcome of that decision-making process by elaborating at this point on the details of individual possible locations.</P>
      <P>However, I am happy to confirm that my colleague the Minister for Foreign Affairs and I are both fully aware of the excellent case being made for Cavan by the Deputy, and I can assure him that his representations will be treated with the fullest and most serious consideration.</P>

      <P>Late in the evening of 17 July there was an attempted armed robbery outside the official residence of the Irish ambassador to Nigeria, Mr Joe Lynch, who was returning with his wife from the airport. The attempt was foiled by a member of the Nigerian police force. Neither the ambassador, his wife nor any of the Nigerian security personal present was injured.</P>
      <P>On learning of the incident, the Minister immediately had the Department undertake, in consultation with the ambassador, a review of the security arrangements at the residence. Consequently, the perimeter security and the physical security arrangements within the compound were further upgraded. Ambassador Lynch also had discussions with the police authorities with a view to improving the level of police protection provided. These security measures have since been kept under continuing review. Any further measures which prove necessary will be put in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has spoken with Ambassador Lynch to express his concern at the incident and has assured him that any assistance that he and his wife should require will be provided. The security of Irish personnel at diplomatic missions abroad and of their families is a matter of primary concern for the Minister and for the Department.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 94 and 108 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Relations with Turkey are a matter of great importance to the European Union. The EU's formal relations with Turkey date back to the 1963 Association Agreement, and, following the decision taken in Luxembourg in December 1997 to enlarge the EU, Turkey has argued for the <Col N="154" /> recognition of its candidature for membership. This question has been under discussion since that time and Turkey has firmly placed the development of its relations with the EU in the context of formal recognition of its candidature.</P>
    <P>The main criteria for EU membership laid down by the Copenhagen European Council (the Copenhagen criteria) are: stability of democratic institutions, a functioning market economy, the ability to withstand competitive pressure and market forces within the EU and the ability to take on the obligations of membership.</P>
    <P>The Luxembourg European Council of December 1997 confirmed that Turkey's eligibility for EU accession would be examined on the basis of the same criteria as for other applicant States. Ministers agreed, however, that Turkey had not yet satisfied the political and economic criteria necessary for the opening of accession negotiations.</P>
    <P>There was a lengthy discussion of EU/Turkey relations at the informal ministerial weekend on 4/5 September. On that occasion, Ireland, together with the vast majority of EU ministers, expressed their wish to have the Helsinki European Council give a clear signal to Turkey by formally endorsing Turkey's candidacy for EU membership. Together with other EU member states, Ireland takes the view that the determination of application for membership of the EU should continue to be governed, as agreed at the European Council in Cologne, by the Copenhagen criteria. To fulfill these criteria, Turkey would have to accept democratic reform, an independent judiciary, recognise minorities and accept human rights norms and practices. Accordingly, recognition of Turkey's candidacy would be the first step on what may prove a lengthy road to possible eventual EU membership.</P>
    <P>We are heartened by the positive steps under way in recent months in Greek-Turkey relations. I was happy that Foreign Minister Cem was able to participate in a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Brussels on 13 September. We must continue with our endeavours to bring closer EU-Turkey relations.</P>

      <P>I appointed Mr Rory McCabe to advise me on major issues arising in the European Union. The three six-month consultancy contracts were for the periods 2 January 1998 to 30 June 1998, 1 September 1998 to 28 February 1999 and 1 March <Col N="155" /> 1999 to 31 August 1999. The contract has not since been renewed.</P>
      <P>The remuneration provided for in each of the contracts was £150 per day, up to a maximum of £3,000 per month, plus VAT less withholding tax. Mr. McCabe was in addition entitled to travel and accommodation expenses and subsistence at normal Department rates for any travel undertaken in connection with his services.</P>
      <P>Mr. McCabe has advised me regularly on European Union issues and has provided the agreed services for a minimum of 20 days in each of the months covered by the contract. This advice was provided to the Minister directly and did not entail regular attendance at the Department. There is, accordingly, no record of his attendance at the Department. No written reports were involved.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 96 and 113 together.</P>
      <P>Ireland is seeking election to one of the two non-permanent seats on the United Nations Security Council which are designated for the &ldquo;Western Europe and Others&rdquo; Group of States for the two-year term 2001/2002. The election will take place in the 188-member UN General Assembly in October 2000. The election is being contested by three other candidates; Norway, Turkey and Italy.  Successful candidates will require the support of two-thirds of those States present and voting. In effect, this means that the support of around 120 States will be needed to secure election. The election is by secret ballot.</P>
      <P>I have sought support for Ireland's candidacy on all appropriate occasions, including on official visits abroad. Since September last, he has personally discussed Ireland's candidacy with the Foreign Ministers or Prime Ministers of approximately 100 member states of the United Nations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In September last, before the campaign entered a more intense phase, we had around 30 commitments. This level of support has been built on and the Government is determined that by September-October 2000 when the election takes place we will have the necessary number of votes to secure election. As I have indicated previously, as this is a contested election, he is reluctant to indicate the exact level of support committed to Ireland at this stage. Let me say simply that the <Col N="156" /> Government is very gratified by the broad support that Ireland's candidacy has attracted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews):</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland attaches the highest degree of importance to promoting and maintaining close relations between the European Union and the United States and we have worked consistently with our partners in the EU to strengthen and enhance the various frameworks through which those relations &ndash; both political and economic &ndash; are conducted.</P>
      <P>The EU and the US hold regular summit meetings at six-monthly intervals involving the US Presidency, the Head of State or Government of the EU Presidency and the Commission President. The summits provide an opportunity to review relations and any difficulties which may have arisen, or any issues which either side fears might give rise to any difficulty, are discussed. The most recent summit was held in Bonn on 21 June 1999.</P>
      <P>At the summit which was held in London in May 1998, the EU and the US agreed to establish a Transatlantic Economic Partnership, &ldquo;the TEP&rdquo;. This is a significant initiative, aimed at promoting economic growth, principally through the reduction of regulatory and other non-tariff barriers to trade in goods and services between the EU and US. The partnership calls for close dialogue and co-operation to achieve substantial further trade liberalization within the framework of the World Trade Organization negotiations. In that connection, I agree with the view expressed by the President of the Commission, Mr. Romano Prodi, at the European Parliament on 14 September 1999 that the opportunity which the forthcoming World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference, to be held in Seattle from 30 November to 3 December 1999, offers to both the EU and the US to build a reinforced transatlantic partnership, capable of showing real joint leadership, should be fully seized.</P>
      <P>The Transatlantic Economic Partnership also provides for cooperation in a number of important sectors such agriculture, services, manufactured products, industrial customs duties, global e-commerce, trade related aspects of intellectual property rights, or &ldquo;TRIPS&rdquo;, investments, public procurement and competition. Ireland played a constructive role in the TEP negotiations. At the summit held in Washington in December 1998, both sides committed themselves to the full implementation of the partnership notwithstanding ongoing trade disputes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most recent summit in Bonn on 21 June 1999 considered a number of ongoing trade disputes between the EU and the EU, including the dispute which has arisen over the EU's banana <Col N="157" /> import regime and the ban on imports into the EU of hormone-treated beef. It should be borne in mind that these difficult and complex disputes account for only a small fraction of EU-US overall trade, which otherwise tends to flow without undue problems. It is worth noting in the context of the spirit of partnership which exists between the two sides that the Bonn Summit also adopted an agreed declaration on Early Warning and Problem Prevention. The declaration amounts to an ambitious approach to the early identification and resolution of bilateral disagreements before they become major trade disputes and provides that any issue which might have an impact on EU-US relations may be raised. It calls for better co-ordination by each side, both internally and bilaterally and sets out agreed procedures for dealing with potentially problematic issues. The overall objective is to improve the capacity of each side to take the other side's interests into account at an early stage when formulating policy, legislative, or regulatory decisions, without thereby limiting each side's existing decision-making authority.</P>
    <P>Political aspects of EU-US relations are dealt with at a number of different levels including the six-monthly summit meetings. Foreign Ministers of the EU and US meet annually at the United Nations, most recently on 22 September in New York. On that occasion, they discussed the Stability Pact for South East Europe, the new dynamic in the Middle East Peace Process, UN action on East Timor, Turkey, human rights, trade issues and US arrears to the UN. There are also frequent EU-US meetings at official level.</P>

      <P>The plight of those from both communities who have been sent into forced exile because of paramilitary intimidation is a matter of deep concern to the Government. It is undoubtedly a breach of the law and, more fundamentally, of the basic human rights of those concerned. The Government supports the wish of these individuals to have the threats against them lifted and believes that they should be allowed to return home safely. They should never have been forced to leave.</P>
      <P>The general issue is, from time to time, raised with the British Government through the framework of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference. The Government has also, at all times, in its contacts with parties with influence on paramilitary groups, highlighted the need to adhere to the principles of non-violence and democracy as enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement.</P>
      <P>I would strongly urge all those with influence in this area to help put a complete end to threats against individuals who wish to return to their own home areas. I firmly hope that, in the new context created by sustained peace, society will be finally freed from these totally unacceptable practices.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 101, 119 and 121 together.</P>
      <P>The Government strongly supports reform of the United Nations, in line with the commitment to this end in An Action Programme for the Millennium. The issue has been pursued vigorously by the Government. It was raised most recently by the Minister for Foreign Affairs in his address to the UN General Assembly on 25 September.</P>
      <P>In the light of the slowness in responding to crisis situations and potential humanitarian disasters, notably in Kosovo earlier this year and in a number of conflict situations in Africa, there is a growing debate on how the international community can most effectively react. This debate is focusing on the need for clarification of the principles and the establishment of agreed criteria for external intervention. In this regard, there is an evident need to reconcile the requirements of international human rights provisions with other principles such as national sovereignty or non-intervention as established by the UN Charter. Ireland is actively involved in this debate and is currently engaged in discussions with like-minded countries, notably in a group known as the Human Security Network, which meets under the joint chairmanship of Canada and Norway.</P>
      <P>In March 1997, the Secretary-General, Mr Kofi Annan, presented a reform agenda for the United Nations to be implemented on the basis of a two-track process. The first track related to managerial initiatives and decisions falling within his authority. The second track involved a longer-term programme of reform to include fundamental proposals that could only be decided intergovernmentally, that is, by the representatives of the member states meeting in the General Assembly.</P>
      <P>The track I proposals have been substantially agreed and are being implemented. They include the establishment and implementation of the UN Development Assistance Framework under which UN agencies involved in development assistance will co-operate more closely at country level in an effort to avoid duplication. Agencies in the field will also be based together in a common UN house. The framework, although in operation for only a year, is already introducing much needed co-ordination and the better use of resources. A UN Development Group, under the Chair of the Administrator of the UNDP, has also been established to bring greater coherence to development assistance policies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of the Secretary General's reform programme, the UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs replaced the Department of Humanitarian Affairs. Ireland, with other donor countries, actively supported the setting up of this new UN office. Its mandate is to co-ordi<Col N="160" /> nate the international response to humanitarian crises, to assist in developing humanitarian policies and to act as advocate for the victims of crises and ensure that the humanitarian perspective is taken into account in overall peace-building efforts. The improvement in the past two years in the overall response capacity of the international community has been notable.  </P>
    <P>The track II reform proposals on which progress has been made include the establishment of a senior management group under the chairmanship of the Secretary General and the creation of a new post of Deputy Secretary General with important responsibilities in the development field. Ms Louise Frechette of Canada was appointed to this position in January 1998.</P>
    <P>A substantial number of reform proposals requiring General Assembly approval have not yet been endorsed. These include important proposals in the development area.</P>
    <P>One of the most difficult issues is the question of Security Council reform. The Charter of the United Nations provides, in order to ensure prompt and effective action by the organisation, that its member states confer on the Security Council primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security, and agree that in carrying out its duties under this responsibility the Security Council acts on their behalf. The General Assembly decided in 1993 to establish a working group, open to all UN member states, to consider all aspects of the question of an increase in the membership of the Security Council and other matters related to the council. The issues involved are enlargement of Security Council membership, the council's working methods and its decision-making procedures including, crucially, the use of the veto.</P>
    <P>Ireland supports a small, regionally balanced increase in both permanent and non-permanent seats to create an enlarged council of between 20 and 25 members. We strongly believe that any agreement on enlargement should not diminish the possibility for smaller UN member states to serve on the Council as non-permanent members. As the Deputies are aware, Ireland is a candidate for membership of the Council for 2001-02.</P>
    <P>On Security Council working methods, there appears to be fairly wide consensus that these should be more formalised and transparent, involving greater consultation by the council with other UN organs, including the General Assembly and Secretary General, and, in peacekeeping matters, with troop contributing countries.</P>
    <P>Ireland would like to see the veto eliminated altogether but, recognising the strong opposition of the permanent five, has proposed that they be invited to accept a limitation of the veto, and to exercise it only when they consider the question of vital national importance, taking into account the interests of the United Nations as a whole. At the same time any new permanent members of the council would declare that they would never exercise the veto.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="161" /> I regret that the working group has not yet been unable to report any consensual progress to the General Assembly. I assure the House that Ireland will continue to play an active and constructive role in these negotiations.</P>
    <P>In his speech to the General Assembly on 25 September, the Minister for Foreign Affairs expressed his full support for the UN Secretary General in his efforts to bring about a renewed, reformed and more vigorous UN. This is essential to ensure the UN's continued capacity to contribute effectively to conflict prevention and to social and economic development. Ireland and its EU partners have sought to stress that the reform process is not simply a cost cutting exercise but one which is aimed at strengthening and renewing the UN system.</P>
    <P>While a number of important reforms have taken place, particularly in the reorganisation of the UN's role in the delivery of development and humanitarian assistance, the pace of reform has not, unfortunately, been as we would wish. We very much hope that the Millennium Summit and Assembly in 2000 will provide fresh impetus in the reform process. We look forward to an action oriented outcome which will strengthen the organisation as it enters the new century.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government takes the view that the establishment of democratic structures in Kosovo will require action chiefly by the United Nations Interim Administration in Kosovo (UNMIK) and the other international organisations active in Kosovo over the medium term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the short time that it has been deployed, UNMIK has made significant progress in exceptionally difficult circumstances. It has established structures to allow the people of Kosovo to play a role and share responsibility for the development and future of the province. Foremost among these structures is the Kosovo Transitional Coun<Col N="163" /> cil which meets on a weekly basis and is chaired by the special representative of the UN Secretary General and Head of UNMIK, Mr Bernard Kouchner. This body brings together representatives of all the political parties and ethnic groups in Kosovo. This includes Kosovo Albanians, Kosovo Serbs, Turks and Roma. To give it greater responsibility for the administration of Kosovo the special representative has proposed the establishment of a number of directorates answerable to the transitional council which will be responsible for housing, health, education and public utilities and which will be co-chaired by a UNMIK representative and a person drawn from the local community. The intention is that the selection of the local director would be based on criteria such as experience, technical competence and considerations of ethnic and political balance.</P>
    <P>In addition to the transitional council an independent media board has been set up and preparations are under way for a Kosovo television station. Political support centres have also been set up with a view to offering practical support for all political groupings engaging in political activities, and committed to democracy, regardless of party affiliation. and a legal centre to support the administration in the drafting of legislation.</P>
    <P>Much, however, remains to be done. The Deputy will no doubt be aware of reports of attacks on ethnic minorities, particularly Serbs and Roma, carried out by Kosovo Albanians. The security situation in Kosovo remains a cause for concern and although it has improved in recent weeks with a decline in the number of reported attacks, this may reflect the fact that ethnic Serbs and Roma have either left Kosovo or moved into ethnic strongholds. The Government and its EU partners are committed to the existence of a multi-ethnic pluralist society in Kosovo and will support all efforts to bring this about. Clearly the security situation does not make it any easier to inspire confidence among members of minority population groups still in Kosovo that they have a future in the province, or to persuade those that have left to return.</P>
    <P>The Government attaches great importance to the success of the demilitarisation of the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA). Including the agreement last week between the outgoing KFOR Commander, Lieutenant General Sir Michael Jackson, and the KLA by which the latter ceased officially to exist at midnight on Tuesday, 21 September. However, to be effective, arrangements for demilitarisation must provide a future for former combatants. At the very least, unemployed and resentful former fighters are a source of instability as the international community attempts to build a stable political system in Kosovo. I welcome also, therefore, the agreement to establish a Kosovo Protection Corps.</P>
    <P>The steps being taken to establish a multi-ethnic civilian police force are also encouraging. The <Col N="164" /> OSCE police training school received its first 200 recruits for the new Kosovo police service in early September. Until the Kosovo police service becomes operational, however, the UN International Police Force will fulfill police duties in Kosovo in co-operation with KFOR. I acknowledge that the build up of the UN International Police Force has been slower than intended. However, it has recently expanded its presence and will be at full strength in the near future. One of its main tasks will be to provide practical training for the recruits of the Kosovo Police training school from mid-October.</P>

      <P>The Government has expressed its total opposition to the use of the death penalty on a number of occasions over the past number of years. With regard to the use of capital punishment in the United States in particular, I would refer the Deputy to the statement made by me in the Seanad on 17 February last in which I expressed regret at the executions which continued to take place there.</P>
      <P>On that occasion, I noted the commitment of the Irish Government to avail of every suitable opportunity to press for the abolition of capital punishment. I also stated the Government's view that the abolition of the death penalty contributes to the enhancement of human dignity and the progressive development of human rights.</P>
      <P>In June, 1998, common guidelines for EU initiatives on the issue of the death penalty were agreed and adopted by EU Foreign Ministers. These guidelines state that, where the death penalty still exists, the EU will continue to press for its use to be progressively restricted and for moratoria to be introduced. In addition to interventions on the use of the death penalty in principle, it has also been agreed that, where individual cases violate basic minimum standards, the Union will consider making a specific intervention. It is our strongly held belief that an EU intervention carries greater force than individual bilateral approaches by national Governments.</P>
      <P>Following the adoption of these guidelines, the Union's collective efforts have continued to focus on promoting universal abolition of the death penalty. We have pressed for abolition and have issued demarches on the use of the death penalty in a number of countries, including the United States.</P>
      <P>For the past three years, a resolution on the question of the death penalty has been adopted by the UN Commission on Human Rights with a growing number of co-sponsors. Ireland has been to the fore in building support for this resolution and we strongly supported the decision of the European Union to take the lead in tabling this resolution at this year's session of the Commission.</P>
      <P>In order to take this policy on the abolition of the death penalty a step further, to consolidate the achievements at the Commission on Human Rights and to establish the issue of the death penalty on the agenda of the United Nations General Assembly, we have decided, in conjunction with our European partners, to introduce a resolution on this question in the Third Committee during the forthcoming session of the General Assembly. Ireland will work to ensure maximum support and co-sponsorship for this resolution.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 111 and 116 together.</P>
      <P>Since my appointment as Minister for Foreign Affairs I have implemented a significant strengthening of the Irish diplomatic presence abroad. An embassy has been opened in Ankara and Consulates General have been opened in Edinburgh and Cardiff. Within the next week the Irish Embassy in Mexico will be opened. In addition the four Consulates General in the United States have been upgraded. The period ahead will see the establishment of an embassy in Singapore, Consulates General in Sydney and Shanghai, a Representative Office to the Palestinian Authority in Ramallah and the strengthening of our embassies in Beijing and Tokyo.</P>
      <P>I am nonetheless conscious that Ireland's diplomatic representation overseas remains small relative to our increasing engagement in many parts of the world and relative to our partners and our competitors. There is an obvious need for a corresponding increase in the number of our resident missions. Existing missions also need to be consolidated and strengthened. This will be done when the necessary financial resources are available.</P>
      <P>I am fully aware of the political and economic significance of Brazil and of the growing Irish contacts with that country. The Government is engaged in a review of our strategy towards Latin America and resident diplomatic representation in Brazil is under consideration within that framework.</P>

      <Quest>the Government's response to the speech to the European Parliament in September 1999 by the President-designate of the Commission, Mr. Romano Prodi, in which he set out his views on the future direction of the EU; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[17945/99]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews):</NameTxt>
      <P>The speech which Mr. Romano Prodi, then President designate of the European Commission, delivered to the European Parliament on 14 September, was an important indication of his thinking on the future development of the European Union. Of particular interest were his comments on EU enlargement and its effects on relations with neighbouring countries, as well as on the reform of EU institutions.</P>
      <P>I would agree with the new President of the Commission when he says that enlarging the European Union is a tremendous challenge. Ireland has at all times taken a very positive position towards enlargement which we feel is one of the great challenges facing the European Union. The criteria by which countries are judged suitable for membership of the European Union were agreed in Copenhagen and it is my firm belief that countries which can fully subscribe to these criteria should be eligible for membership of the Union.</P>
      <P>At present the European Union is engaged in negotiations with Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic, Slovenia, Estonia and Cyprus and decisions will be made later this year in Helsinki regarding the group of countries currently known as the &ldquo;pre-ins&rdquo;. These are Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania and Malta.</P>
      <P>I also agree with Commission President Prodi that enlargement will happen in stages and that we will need a strategy to meet the specific needs of those countries which face a longer wait for membership. I look forward to the new Commission's proposals in this area.</P>
      <P>Our decisions later this year in Helsinki will be guided by the Commission's regular reports on the countries under review. We expect that these reports should be available in mid-October.</P>
      <P>President Prodi, in his speech to the European Parliament refers to the need for a clear and comprehensive approach towards our new neighbours whose contribution to the peace and stability of the wider Europe is vital.</P>
      <P>Through the partnership and co-operation agreements and Common Strategies the European Union is both developing and enhancing its relation with Russia and the Ukraine. At the same time the Union is, through new agreements, building firm foundations with the newly independent states. Once again let me say that I look forward to further proposals from the new Commission in these areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his speech, Mr Prodi also referred to the forthcoming intergovernmental conference. Implying that the agenda already identified for that intergovernmental conference might be <Col N="168" /> insufficient, he called for what he described as a &ldquo;genuinely ambitious reform&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Cologne European Council in June stipulated that the intergovernmental conference, which is due to take place next year, would cover the size and composition of the Commission, the weighting of votes in the Council, and the possible extension of qualified majority voting in the Council. However, the conclusions added that other necessary amendments to the treaties arising as regards the European institutions in connection with the above issues and in implementing the Treaty of Amsterdam, could also be discussed. It is not possible at this stage to predict with certainty the eventual agenda of the intergovernmental conference.</P>
    <P>The Government's view is that the setting of the level of ambition for the intergovernmental conference should take account of the very recent entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam which reflected, in many areas, the level of agreement which it was possible to reach at the present stage of the Union's development. In that regard, we share the view of most member states, as reflected in the Cologne conclusions, that next year's intergovernmental conference should focus on the limited number of institutional issues which it was not possible to settle in the Treaty of Amsterdam.</P>
    <P>We fully share the view expressed by Mr. Prodi that the prospect of a series of intergovernmental conferences is unappealing. Accordingly, we believe like others that the changes to be made at the forthcoming intergovernmental conference should be such that it will not be necessary to come back to the same issues before each enlargement.</P>
    <P>Ireland has a significant interest in the effective functioning of the EU and of its institutions. We will examine in a constructive way any reasonable proposals which can improve that functioning provided, of course, that the essential balances between the institutions and the member states are preserved.</P>
    <P>I might add that a number of institutional improvements do not require treaty change and we welcome and support the determination of Mr. Prodi, which he reaffirmed in his speech, to reform the Commission to make it more modern, efficient and transparent.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would also welcome the importance which the President of the Commission attached to the European Union's strategic relationship with the United States. I agree with his view that the opportunity which the forthcoming World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference, to be held in Seattle from 30 November-3 December, 1999, offers to both the EU and the US to build a reinforced transatlantic partnership, capable of showing real joint leadership, should be fully seized.</P>
    <P>I will circulate a copy of Mr. Prodi's speech for the convenience of Members.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 114 and 132 together.</P>
      <P>Resolution 1264 of the United Nations Security Council has authorised the establishment of the multinational force for East Timor &ndash; INTERFET &ndash; under Australian command. Deployment of the force has already started and is still continuing. I understand that the proposed final strength of the force is between 7,500 and 8,000 troops, and that this total was agreed after detailed discussions between the Security Council and Australia, including 40 members of the permanent Defence Forces.</P>
      <P>While the Security Council retains political control of the force, operational matters are the responsibility of the commander of the force. I am not aware that the commander has given any indication that the current plans need to be revised and, in these circumstances, I believe that such matters should be left to his judgment.</P>
      <P>Should the commander decide that the strength of the force needs to be increased, I am confident that he will follow the most appropriate course, which would be to bring any such concerns to the attention of the Security Council.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of Resolution 1264, deployment of the INTERFET force will only take place in East Timor. Security in West Timor &ndash; which is an integral part of Indonesia &ndash; remains the responsibility of that government, and it is incumbent on it to provide protection for all persons within their jurisdiction irrespective of their national origin. This remains a particular responsibility for them now in view of the large number of East Timorese who have either fled or been forcibly removed to West Timor, or to other locations in Indonesia.</P>
      <P>According to the reports which I have received, the number of such persons could be as high as 200,000. All of these must be given the opportunity to make known their position freely, and be allowed to return to East Timor if they so wish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of reports on the unsatisfactory conditions of the camps where such persons are now living, and that such places are under the <Col N="170" /> control of the militias. In addition to the general obligation of the Indonesian authorities to provide protection for these displaced persons and refugees, they have the further specific obligation, under the provisions of Resolution 1264, to grant access to international humanitarian and aid agencies.</P>
    <P>The Government expects that Resolution 1264 will be fully implemented in all its aspects by the Indonesian authorities. The Security Council, which is monitoring implementation, will need to address any failure to comply with its decisions. In conjunction with EU partners, Ireland will be monitoring implementation and will ensure that any concerns in this regard are brought to the attention of the Security Council.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government, along with most other donors, is committed to reaching the UN target for aid of 0.7 per cent of GNP. Successive Governments since 1992 have played their part in pursuing this goal. Our ODA in that period has increased every year from £40 million in 1992 to an expected £178 million this year, over a four-fold increase. The progression of ODA as a percentage of GNP in the same period has been from 0.16 per cent to 0.35 per cent.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Government is committed to making definite progress to the UN goal and has pledged itself to move to an interim target of 0.45 per cent in its lifetime. Since taking office there have been significant cash increases in ODA each year which should reach an expected all time high mark in 1999 of £178 million. However, it has to be said that the extraordinary growth in GNP in recent years has complicated planning to reach the interim target.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding this complication, the Government will continue to increase ODA in the coming years and unusually has already agreed certain increased levels for that part of the overall ODA controlled through Vote 39 by my Department. Thus, in addition to increasing funding and moving to the UN target, the Government, by creating the security necessary for long-term financial planning and aid commitment, is dedicated to maintaining the quality of our aid programme, something recently attested to in an OECD report.</P>

      <P>The situation in Algeria, although still difficult, is showing some signs of improvement.</P>
      <P>On 6 June, the Islamic Salvation Army (AIS) confirmed that its campaign of violence had ended. This was endorsed three days later by the outlawed Islamic Salvation Front.</P>
      <P>Legislation has been introduced which offers an amnesty to the AIS rebels and their supporters. On the thirty-seventh anniversary of Algerian independence on 5 July, the amnesty was put into effect and is expected to lead to the release of 5,000 detainees. More recently, a referendum held on 16 September to approve President Bouteflika's moves to achieve peace and civil concord was approved by an overwhelming majority.</P>
      <P>I sincerely hope that these positive steps will make possible a process of national reconciliation and reconstruction, bringing to an end the suffering of the Algerian people. Ireland, together with our EU partners, has welcomed the outcome of the referendum which expressed the support of the Algerian people for President Bouteflika's mission of national reconciliation and peace. The European Union has confirmed its readiness to support and encourage the reform process in Algeria, particularly through Euro-Mediterranean co-operation, including the speedy resumption of negotiations on the conclusion of a Euro-Mediterranean association agreement.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government wishes to see an end to the US embargo imposed against Cuba. We are working to that end in concert with our European Union partners and have consistently supported resolutions in the UN General Assembly calling for an end to the embargo.</P>
      <P>There has been some progress. Following a visit to Cuba by two US Senators during which they held talks with President Castro, on 4 August the Senate voted by 70 to 28 in favour of exempting food and medicine from the embargo. I understand this will be the subject of consultations with the House of Representatives and the White House. Earlier this year restrictions were eased on the delivery of food and medicine to non-governmental organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In accordance with the EU common position <Col N="172" /> on Cuba, adopted in December 1996, our aim is to encourage a process of change, not to precipitate a collapse of authority which could bring about conflict in Cuba or mass emigration from there. But the common position also makes clear that wholehearted co-operation with Cuba is unavoidably inhibited by the persistent absence of fundamental human and political rights in that country.</P>
    <P>After the Pope's visit to Cuba in January 1998 there had been a certain easing of repressive measures against political dissidents and a reduction in the number of political prisoners. However, subsequently the situation deteriorated again. In January 1999 the criminal law was amended to introduce new and even harsher legislation aimed at curbing dissidence.</P>
    <P>In March 1999, four members of the Internal Dissidence Group were sentenced to terms of imprisonment. In a statement issued on 17 March, the EU expressed its deep regret at the sentences passed. It pointed out that the people convicted had exercised a freedom of expression which is recognised universally as a human right and that the EU could not accept that citizens exercising such a right should be criminalised by state authorities. The EU also rejected judicial proceedings of a political nature and expressed deep concern about the amendments to the criminal law further curtailing the exercise of the rights of citizens.</P>
    <P>At the same time, the EU reiterated its continuing objective of encouraging a peaceful transition to pluralist democracy, with respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, as set out in the common position.</P>
    <P>Ireland has supported a number of resolutions on human rights in Cuba at the UN Commission on Human Rights, including at this year's session. With all of our EU partners, we once again called on Cuba to co-operate with all human rights mechanisms of the UN.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is actively pursuing its human rights objectives in a wide range of international fora, both on a national basis and also in conjunction with our EU partners. In its capacity this year as chair of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in Geneva, Ireland has sought to promote discussion of human rights issues throughout the world. At the regional level, <Col N="173" /> Ireland will avail of the opportunity provided by its forthcoming chairmanship of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe to focus attention on the human rights role of that institution.</P>
      <P>However, despite the efforts of the international community in international and regional fora such as those I have mentioned, there is a growing realisation &ndash; among governments and other international actors &ndash; that the systems in place for the protection of vulnerable people in situations of conflict are not providing an adequate level of protection. Reasons for this range from the failure of states to ratify relevant international instruments &ndash; the human rights and humanitarian law treaties which aim to provide protection for non-combatants &ndash; to the lack of resources and even political will to focus on these problems.</P>
      <P>Consequently, and as I have already indicated in response to questions on reform of the United Nations, there is a developing debate on how the international community can most effectively react to crisis situations and humanitarian disasters, such as those now being witnessed in East Timor and in Kosovo earlier this year. This debate is focusing on the need for clarification of the principles and the establishment of agreed criteria for external intervention. In this regard, there is an evident need to reconcile the requirements of international human rights provisions with other principles such as national sovereignty or non-intervention as established by the UN charter. Ireland is actively involved in this debate and is currently engaged in discussions with like-minded countries, notably in a group known as the Human Security Network.</P>
      <P>This initiative of the Canadian and Norwegian Governments is aimed at establishing the concept of human security as a central element in the international community's approach to situations of conflict. Meetings have been held in New York in September 1998, Bergen in May 1999 and, most recently, in New York on 24 September last, in the margins of the United Nations General Assembly. The Minister for Foreign Affairs took part in that meeting of 24 September with the foreign ministers of the other parties to this initiative. They discussed possible ways of advancing the concept of human security and preparations will now be made for an in-depth and action oriented meeting in Lucerne in the spring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On another front, the United Nations Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, recently sent a report to the UN Security Council, in which he set out a series of recommendations to address the various shortcomings in the provision of protection to civilians in situations of armed conflict. His principal recommendations to the Security Council include the following: to take steps to strengthen the UN's capacity to plan and deploy rapidly; to give consideration to the imposition of arms embargoes in situations where civilians/humanitarian workers are targeted by parties to the conflict; to make greater use of tar<Col N="174" /> geted sanctions to deter and contain those who commit egregious violations of international humanitarian and human rights law; to deploy international military observers to monitor the situation in camps for internally displaced persons and refugees when the presence of armed elements is suspected; and if necessary, deploy international military forces that are prepared to take effective measures to compel disarmament of those armed elements; in the face of massive and ongoing abuses, consider the imposition of appropriate enforcement action.</P>
    <P>These recommendations are being carefully studied by the Government and we will be making our views known to the Security Council through EU and UN channels.</P>
    <P>Given the many areas of instability in the world today, these various efforts to ensure an adequate level of protection for non-combatants are a priority objective for us.</P>

      <Quest>further to Parliamentary Question No. 40 of 11 May 1999, the reason his Department and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform did not undertake the necessary legal study of the war crimes court statute at the time it was being negotiated in order that Ireland could ratify this statute quickly; and if the various legal issues were considered properly before Ireland signed this convention.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 123 and 195 together.</P>
      <P>The statute of the International Criminal Court was concluded at Rome on 17 July 1998 and was signed, subject to ratification, by Ireland on 7 October 1998. It will enter into force approximately two months after 60 states have become party to it. My information is that to date 84 states have signed the statute and, of these, four have ratified the statute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The establishment of a permanent international criminal court has been supported by Ireland for many years. Accordingly, considerable resources were made available to ensure that Ireland was represented at and participated in the preparatory committee set up to consider the issues involved in setting up such a court. There was also a team, made up of officials of the Departments of Foreign Affairs, Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Defence and the Offices of the Attorney General and Director of Public Prosecutions, at the diplomatic conference in <Col N="175" /> Rome which led to the adoption of the statute. Ireland continues to be represented at the preparatory commission set up after the Rome conference to deal with matters necessary for the effective operation of the court when the statute enters into force. I can assure the House that the legal issues involved were given careful consideration by the Irish team during the course of the negotiations leading up to the adoption of the statute.</P>
    <P>Ireland was anxious to sign the statute at an early date to signal our strong political support for the court, as were our EU partners and our partners in the 66 member like-minded group which was set up to advance the conclusion of the statute and its timely entry into force.</P>
    <P>A time lapse is normal between signature and ratification. The purpose of this time lapse is to allow each signatory state to consider what measures require to be taken in their domestic legal systems prior to ratification. The measures required prior to ratification and the time frame involved will vary from state to state.</P>
    <P>With regard to ratification by Ireland, I should point out that the statute is a long and complex document which includes 13 parts and 128 articles. A careful and detailed examination of the statute by my Department, together with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Office of the Attorney General and other appropriate bodies, is necessary in order to determine the precise nature and scope of the legal and administrative measures which may need to be adopted in order for Ireland to be in a position to meet its obligations under the statute.</P>
    <P>At the international level, this matter is also being discussed by delegations at the preparatory commission with the aim of ensuring that the necessary domestic measures are taken by states not only in a timely fashion, but also in a comprehensive and consistent manner.</P>
    <P>Ireland may proceed to ratify the statute only when all the necessary legal and administrative measures have been put in place. I am not in a position at this point to state definitively how long this process might take, but I can assure the Deputy that the timely ratification and entry into force of the statute will continue to be given a high priority by my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government remains deeply concerned at the delays in the implementation of the ceasefire agreement which was signed in Lusaka on 10 July <Col N="176" /> by the governments of the six countries involved in the conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo &ndash; Angola, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Namibia, Rwanda, Uganda and Zimbabwe. The MLC &ndash; Movement for the Liberation of Congo &ndash; signed the ceasefire agreement on 1 August while a dispute within the RCD &ndash; Congolese Rally for Democracy &ndash; delayed its signature until 31 August.</P>
      <P>The essential requirements for implementation of the agreement have not been fulfilled. For example, the selection of the representatives for the joint military commission has not been completed and the facilitator for the national dialogue has not been agreed upon by all the parties. With our EU partners we have urged all parties to fully abide by the contents and timetable of the agreement and we continue to encourage the UN and the OAU to make all necessary efforts to support the implementation of the agreement.</P>
      <P>Ireland, with its EU partners, considers the Lusaka agreement crucial for the restoration of peace and stability in the Democratic Republic of Congo and the entire central African region. We have pledged our support to its implementation; to national reconciliation, rehabilitation and democratisation in the Democratic Republic of Congo; and to the process of reintegration of displaced people in the Great Lakes region into their countries of origin. We have also underlined our readiness to support the UN and the OAU in the implementation of the peace agreement.</P>
      <P>We will continue to support the work of the EU special envoy to the Great Lakes region, Mr. Aldo Ajello, who is actively pursuing the Union's objectives through his direct contacts with the UN, the Organisation of African Unity, regional leaders and other key figures. The EU continues to support the holding, at an appropriate time, of an international conference on peace, security and development in the Great Lakes region as a means of ensuring lasting stability.</P>

      <P>The European Council at Cologne in June confirmed its intention to convene an intergovernmental conference early in the year 2000. We understand that Portugal, which will hold the EU Presidency in the first half of next year, intends to launch the conference at the European Council in Lisbon on 23/24 March.</P>
      <P>The Cologne European Council confirmed that the purpose of the intergovernmental conference would be to resolve the institutional issues left open in Amsterdam that need to be settled before enlargement. It stipulated accordingly that the conference would cover the following topics: size and composition of the Commission; weighting of votes in the Council &ndash; reweighting, introduction of a dual majority and threshold for qualified majority decision-making; and possible extension of qualified majority voting in the Council.</P>
      <P>The Cologne conclusions added, however, that other necessary amendments to the treaties arising as regards the European institutions in connection with the above issues and in implementing the Treaty of Amsterdam could also be discussed. The precise scope of the conference remains to be determined, with some pressing for a more extensive agenda.</P>
      <P>The Finnish Presidency was invited to draw up, on its own responsibility, for the European Council meeting in Helsinki in December this year, a comprehensive report explaining and taking stock of options for resolving the issues to be settled.</P>
      <P>A preparatory process, involving a technical examination of the specific issues identified in the Cologne conclusions, is currently taking place at the level of permanent representatives in Brussels.</P>
      <P>It has been agreed that the conference should be completed at the end of the year 2000, in other words at the end of the French Presidency.</P>

      <P>The Government remains extremely concerned at the failure to resolve the ongoing conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea and at the continued delay in implementation of the OAU <Col N="178" /> framework agreement, approved by the OAU summit in Algiers in July.</P>
      <P>The Government has previously conveyed its concerns about the need for an immediate cessation of hostilities under OAU mediation directly to both the Ethiopian and Eritrean authorities. With our EU partners, we have urged Ethiopia and Eritrea to end all hostilities, proceed to the signature of a ceasefire agreement, and to subscribe immediately to the modalities and to fully implement the OAU framework agreement.</P>
      <P>We will continue to support all international efforts, notably those of the OAU and UN, to vigorously pursue the peace process and to achieve a comprehensive settlement to this futile conflict, the political and economic costs of which neither country can afford. The current situation is destabilising for both countries and for the wider region of East Africa and is having an unacceptable impact on civilian populations in human rights, humanitarian and social terms.</P>

The major driving force for finding new ways of working on a cross-functional basis are the strategic results areas reflected in Government policy. These are issues of a cross-cutting nature such as crime, drugs and children's needs, which require a co-ordinated response both at policy and implementation levels across a range of Government Departments, agencies and voluntary groups. They must also take effect at both central and local level.</P>
      <P>Work is ongoing on developing new approaches to effectively address issues which cross a number of Departments and agencies.

      <P>The Christian celebration of the 2000th anniversary of the birth of Christ is one of the key themes adopted by the national millennium committee.</P>
      <P>In this regard, there is regular contact with the members of the special religious liaison group which represents the main churches and religious denominations. In addition, I have had meetings with senior church figures representing the main Christian churches to discuss their plans for celebrating the millennium and to seek their views on the most appropriate way that the millennium committee might be of assistance.</P>
      <P>In response the churches have identified a number of projects for which they have sought the support of the millennium committee. The committee has recently considered these projects and will be making recommendations to the Government on them in due course.</P>
      <P>The matter of the petition proposing that there should be a statute to commemorate the 2000th anniversary of the birth of Christ has been raised in the context of ongoing contacts with the main churches and I expect to have further discussions on the matter.</P>

      <P>Satellite accounts are a mechanism whereby the core national accounts are supplemented by additional accounts which do not disrupt the central system. The satellite accounts dealing with the environment are at an early stage of development and have not yet been formalised into an official system like &ldquo;The European System of Accounts 1995&rdquo;. The aim of these satellite accounts is to show how economic developments by industry impact on the environment and on the economy as a whole in an objective, comprehensive and systematic way. In simplistic terms the idea is to place the amount of &ldquo;badness&rdquo; produced by industry and households in quantifiable physical terms alongside the amount of beneficial effects produced by these sectors in terms of employment given and value added created. The presentation of the environmental accounts in this way forms part of a system known internationally as NAMEA&ndash;National Accounting Matrix including Environmental Accounts.</P>
      <P>A first set of satellite environmental accounts for Ireland has been compiled by the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, on behalf of the Central Statistics Office, CSO. The research was funded by EUROSTAT, the statistical office of the European Union. The CSO plans to update these accounts on a regular basis.</P>

Accordingly, account was taken of these advances in the drafting of inspection requirements in the European Communities (Non-Automatic Weighing Instruments) Regulations, 1992. These regulations prescribe that non-automatic weighing instruments should be inspected at least once every two years. Mart weighbridges fall within this category.</P>
      <P>The National Standards Authority of Ireland has advised me that at least one inspection has been carried out on 148 weighbridges in 65 marts by the legal metrology service in the past twelve months. There are approximately 230 weighbridges in use in the 119 livestock marts operating throughout the country.</P>
      <P>The assessment of weighbridges is carried out in the following manner: an evaluation of conformity of the instrument under test to an approved design is undertaken. This is followed by metrological tests using reference standards of mass to establish accuracy within legally defined tolerances. Upon successful completion of the examination and tests, official marks are applied to the instrument signifying conformity.</P>

    <P>I have been informed that the legal metrology service has ten vans intended for the conveyance of standards and equipment from the regional centres to the various sites where verification and inspection work is performed. Two of the vans are in full-time use in Sligo and Dublin but their use in the other centres has been the subject of a long standing dispute. However, I understand that discussions with the unions representing inspectors are continuing with a view to resolving this issue as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I have also been informed by the National Standards Authority of Ireland that it is currently devising a three year strategy to underpin the future development of the legal metrology service. The overall staffing requirements &ndash; including the Athlone office where there is no staff at present &ndash; and resource issues are currently under review in the context of finalising this development plan.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for filling job vacancies is primarily a matter for employers. It is up to individual employers to determine their own recruitment processes, whether they are seeking to recruit workers in Ireland or from abroad.</P>
      <P>FÁS provides employers with the facility to notify its employment service offices throughout the country of vacancies which they are seeking to fill. The employment service offices make the details of these vacancies available to job seekers and FÁS also attempts to match job seekers to the vacancies.</P>
      <P>As part of a response to addressing the skill needs of the economy, FÁS has, for a number of years, provided Irish emigrants abroad with information on job opportunities available in sectors of the economy which are experiencing the most acute skills shortages. This year, FÁS's overseas information campaign will be conducted in the UK, France, Germany, the Benelux countries, the USA and Canada. It is primarily targeted at people seeking to work in the teleservices, electronics, computer and construction sectors. FÁS's aim is to build up a database of over 10,000 suitably qualified Irish nationals and other EU citizens who wish to take up employment in Ireland. FÁS will facilitate the matching of these job seekers with Irish based firms seeking to carry out recruitment.</P>
      <P>With regard to the specific industries which the Deputy refers to, the construction industry is among the sectors of the economy which is experiencing skills shortages at present. FÁS has assisted the Construction Industry Federation in attracting Irish emigrants living in the UK back to Ireland to take up jobs in the construction industry. There has also been an unprecedented increase in apprenticeship numbers in the construction craft trades in the last two years and this, together with FÁS's overseas information campaign, should help to alleviate the problem in the sector. Responsibility for the human resources needs of the tourism industry rests with my colleague, the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the next few months, FÁS will host a series of five seminars entitled &ldquo;Working and Living in Ireland&rdquo;, which will be attended by officials from the public employment services of all member states of the European economic area. These delegates will be addressed by speakers from the Construction Industry Federation and the Irish Hotels Federation, as well as by representatives of other sectors with skills shortages. These seminars will distribute details on job opportunities in Ireland. FÁS has also launched a dedicated Jobs <Col N="187" /> Ireland website as part of its overseas awareness campaign.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt):</NameTxt>
      <P>The issues raised by the Deputy extend in some instances beyond Ireland to the eurozone generally. It may, therefore, be helpful for me to address them by distinguishing between the regulatory framework in relation to introduction of the euro and bank charges which exists at both EU and national level.</P>
      <P>At EU level, the European Commission issued a recommendation 98/286/EC in April 1998 on banking charges for conversion to the euro. The financial institutions in Ireland adopted this recommendation through a standard of good practice which their representative organisations agreed in late 1998 and which was incorporated into the third edition of the national changeover plan. At end 1998, the Commission made public an initial evaluation of the response of the European banking associations to its recommendation. The report gives a summary of the situation in each EU member state participating in the euro &ndash; which is one of the issues of interest to the Deputy &ndash; as well as an overall picture for each of the four Europe wide associations who were asked to provide information. The report may be downloaded from the EU website, the address of which is: europa.eu.int.</P>
      <P>On 5 February 1999, the Commission issued a statement calling on banks and other financial institutions in the eurozone to further increase transparency by making publicly available information showing changes in the total level of charges, before and after introduction of the euro, for exchanging eurozone banknotes and crossborder cheques, transfers and card payments. Banks were requested to report the state of play to the Commission through their European associations. The Commission called as well on customers of financial services to report details of any cases of banks' failure to respect the legal framework for the euro or the Commission recommendation, through the following contact points:</P>
      <P>Fax:+32/2/295.07.50 (DG XV)</P>
      <P>+ 32/2/296.56.08 (DG XXIV)</P>

      <P>eurosignal@dg24.cec.be</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="189" /> The Commission has also created the Quest database to serve as the reference document for answering questions from EU citizens on the euro. They are encouraged to send questions via the euro Internet site at: http://europa.eu.int/euro/</P>
    <P>Within the past few months, the Commission has launched investigations into possible infringements of EU competition rules as regards charges by banks in certain participating member states. On the question of credit transfers, the Commission recognises that there are still substantial differences in the level of charges for crossborder transactions within the eurozone as compared to domestic ones, due to weaknesses in crossborder payments infrastructure and the need to remove other structural obstacles to crossborder competition. It is in this context that the Commission is preparing a communication to the member states on payment systems in the Single Market. Action in this area is essential to enable the single currency to achieve its full potential.</P>
    <P>At national level, under the Consumer Credit Act 1995, the Director of Consumer Affairs has statutory responsibility for the regulation of charges proposed by banks and other financial institutions. These institutions were obliged to follow the notification procedure to the director, as laid down in the Act, for euro-specific charges envisaged, prior to introduction of the euro for non-cash transactions as from 1 January 1999. The director, in turn, issued separate directions under the Act with regard to the commission which the financial institutions could charge for transactions in eurozone currencies. The director made a presentation in this connection to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on European Affairs on 16 February 1999 and, as I understand it, informed the European Commission as well.</P>
    <P>Summarising the information made available by the director, by reference to the issues raised by the Deputy, the director's directions to each of the financial institutions concerned:specified maximum charges which the financial institutions could apply &ndash; they are obviously free to charge less; did not set a standard charge, mindful of the need to encourage competition &ndash; and I am advised that a number of charges have been reduced by certain financial institutions since the directions were issued;have meant savings on average of between 20 per cent and 30 per cent on the cost to customers transacting in eurozone currencies as compared with the cost of such transactions prior to introduction of the euro, through insisting that the benefits of elimination of exchange rate risks be passed on to customers; required the financial institutions to inform customers by advertising their eurozone transaction charges in the national newspapers both prior to and immediately after introduction of the euro, producing information leaflets, to be available in branches to customers, detailing the euro specific charges, and giving representative examples of the charges for different transaction values and displaying the euro rates of exchange &ndash; as agreed <Col N="190" /> by ECOFIN on 31 December 1998 &ndash; in the premises.</P>
    <P>I am assured by the Director of Consumer Affairs that she is monitoring compliance with her directions by the financial institutions.</P>
    <P>On the question of commission, introduction of the euro and the fixing of exchange rates have made the situation much more transparent &ndash; and transparency intensifies competition. Prior to 1 January 1999, financial institutions applied two charges to customers, the commission charge and the spread, i.e the difference between the buying and selling rate for the currency. The spread charge was essentially hidden, as the rate quoted to a customer included a margin in favour of the institution. Since 1 January 1999, financial institutions are no longer able to calculate their charges within an exchange rate spread for transactions involving the currency units of participating member states &ndash; they may now apply a single commission charge only for eurozone transactions.</P>
    <P>Finally, when the euro replaces the national currencies of participating member states in 2002, notes and coins in the eurozone will represent one and the same currency &ndash; the euro. They will thus be valid throughout the eurozone in shops, hotels, etc. Irish consumers travelling within the eurozone will not have to change currency, as they do at present, so the question of commission charges will not apply.</P>

      <P>The standards-based apprenticeship system, which is currently in place, comprises seven training modules over a minimum period of four years. Four on-the-job modules take place with the employer and three modules of formal technical training take place <Col N="192" /> either in a FÁS training centre or an institute of technology. Phases 1, 3, 5, and 7 of the apprenticeship are carried out with the employer. Phase 2 is delivered in FÁS training centres and phases 4 and 6 are carried out in Department of Education and Science colleges or institutes of technology.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for the recruitment of apprentices rests with employers. Employers register their apprentices with FÁS.</P>
      <P>The standards-based apprenticeship system was introduced in 1993, following extensive consultation between the social partners and other interested parties. It replaced the old time served model and is based on the attainment by apprentices of industry agreed standards. The standards based system covers 26 designated trades.</P>
      <P>There are currently 18,885 apprentices registered with FÁS under the standards-based system. A total of 1,214 apprentices have completed their training under the system since it was introduced in 1993. Up to 2,762 more apprentices can be expected to complete their training in 1999.</P>
      <P>There has been an unprecedented increase in the number of apprentices registered with FÁS in recent years. At the end of 1997, 11,371 apprentices were registered with FÁS under the standards-based system. The current register of 18,885 apprentices represents a 66 per cent increase in less than two years. The level of the increase is attributable to the demand among employers for skilled craftspeople in the current economic climate.</P>
      <P>The exceptional level of recruitment of apprentices by employers has placed strenuous demands on off-the-job training facilities in FÁS and the institutes of technology throughout the country. This has resulted in delays in apprentices being offered off-the-job training places under phases 2, 4 and 6 of their apprenticeships.</P>
      <P>FÁS has responded to the additional demand by increasing by 50 per cent the number of places available in its training centres for off-the-job apprenticeship training. The Department of Education and Science has responded by increasing the number of places available in institutes of technology by 25 per cent. I understand that Dublin Institute of Technology will also provide an additional four courses for apprentices in the 1999-2000 academic year.</P>
      <P>FÁS and the Department of Education and Science are involved in ongoing discussions on the provision of further additional capacity to meet the increased demand.</P>

      <P>I have received a submission from the Westmeath Employment Network for a local employment service, LES, in the region. The LES is currently established in 25 areas throughout the country. The Government decided in March of this year to bring the LES under the auspices of FÁS in order to improve the coherence and complementarity of the LES and FÁS employment service function. The question of further development of employment services will be addressed in the context of the new framework which is being put in place to give effect to that decision.</P>

    <P>As illustrated in the table an average of 2 per cent of the jobs supported by IDA Ireland nationally were created in the north west region while an average of 5.5 per cent of jobs supported by Enterprise Ireland were created in the region.</P>
    <P>I am conscious of the difficulties being encountered in the north west region in relation to increasing employment levels in the area. These difficulties have been recognised by the EU Commission in that this region forms part of the Objective One region and will thereby benefit from a greater level of State aid under the next round of Structural Funds.</P>
    <P>IDA Ireland, as part of its new strategy, has as its aim to increase the Objective One region's share of new jobs in greenfield projects from 25 per cent at present to 50 per cent. To achieve this objective, the agency has undertaken a number of initiatives such as: it has restructured its organisation to place increased emphasis on regional development and particularly on the Objective One region &ndash; two area directors have been appointed with responsibility for this region, one of these has responsibility for the Border region which includes the north west; as a result of the Donegal Enterprise Initiative, two new posts have been created in the Donegal regional office to work exclusively on promoting Donegal; IDA Ireland is implementing a policy of providing attractive financial packages in the Objective One region; through its network of overseas offices, the agency is actively promoting the north west region as a location for inward investment.</P>
    <P>In conjunction with the above efforts, facilities are being developed in order to attract inward investment to the region. The Finisklin Business Park in Sligo has been extended and two new advance buildings are under construction there at present. A new business park is also being developed by IDA Ireland in Letterkenny. Already one new advance factory has been provided on this park and a second advance factory is under construction. An advance office building is also under construction on a new office park in the area. IDA Ireland is vigorously promoting these buildings as well as the buildings vacated by Fruit of the Loom in Raphoe, Milford and Malin.</P>
    <P>Since the establishment of the Donegal Enterprise Initiative, 226 replacement jobs have been announced for the county as a result of projects supported by both IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland.</P>
    <P>Enterprise Ireland, through its north west regional office in Sligo, is also committed to assisting industrial development in the region. In addition to working with its core client base, the agency, because of its involvement in all aspects of business development &ndash; finance, technology, human resources etc. &ndash; works closely with all development organisations in the region as well as the third level educational institutions, local development bodies and other industry to pro-actively facilitate an integrated approach to development in the region. The office will identify and support high potential start-up enterprises and work in close harmony with the county enterprise boards. These boards have added to employment generation in the north west region by between 200-300 over the last few years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="195" /> I am confident that the co-ordinated efforts being made by the development agencies will advance the further economic development of the region.</P>

      <P>The 35 city and county enterprise boards, which were established in 1993, support the development of small enterprises &ndash; ten employees or less &ndash; through a range of measures, including direct and indirect enterprise supports.</P>
      <P>Direct financial assistance is provided by way of: capital grants to a maximum of 50 per cent of the cost of eligible fixed assets, or £50,000, whichever is the lesser; employment grants of up to £5,000 in respect of each new full-time job created in an eligible enterprise, subject to a limit of ten jobs; feasibility study grant where a maximum of 75 per cent of the cost of preparing a feasibility study and business plan may be provided, subject to an overall limit of £5,000; as an alternative to direct capital or employment grants, the enterprise boards may take equity in a project subject to an overall maximum financial intervention of £50,000. The boards also provide business information/advice, counselling and mentoring and support for the development of management skills.</P>
      <P>I am informed that the person referred to by the Deputy has received capital grant assistance of £3,000 from the Sligo County Enterprise Board in recent years. Although the promoter has recently been in touch with the Sligo board, no further request for grant assistance has yet been made.</P>

This directive must be implemented in all member states by January 2000.</P>

    <P>The recruitment of staff to the authority, and the designation of duties to those staff, is also a day-to-day matter for the authority and I have no function in this regard. However, I have asked the authority to carry out an in-depth review of all its present and projected staffing needs in the context of its statutory remit and responsibilities. This review will form the basis for detailed discussions with relevant Government colleagues on the question of additional resources for the authority. The Health and Safety Authority has a sanctioned staff complement of 132, 13 of which were sanctioned late last year. The authority undertook an extensive recruitment campaign earlier this year to fill all sanctioned posts. Offers of employment have now been made in respect of all of the advertised posts.</P>
    <P>The Health and Safety Authority is also, at my request, currently undertaking a review of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, and associated legislation, and I expect to receive proposals from the authority before the end of the year on any improvements in the legislation that may be considered necessary, including the provisions relating to safety consultation/safety representation and enforcement. The latter issue is also being examined by the Health and Safety Authority through its advisory committee on construction safety, on which both sides of employment and other interests in the sector are represented and I expect the committee's findings and recommendations to be considered in the context of the overall review of the legislation.</P>
    <P>I have recently met with representatives of both sides of industry and in the course of discussions have emphasised the need for a joint approach towards developing an appropriate and workable system of worker safety representation within the construction sector. I am firmly of the belief that one of the key means of promoting <Col N="198" /> greater awareness of health and safety in the sector, and in improving standards, is that of ensuring that effective dialogue and co-operation takes place between all the relevant parties on site. Discussions involving both sides, facilitated by the Health and Safety Authority, are currently on-going with a view to reaching agreement on a site safety project.</P>

      <P>I can assure the Deputy that my Department will ensure that full payment of the correct statutory lump sum is made to the person concerned, provided that the prescribed criteria are met, for example, two years minimum service, the employee having been insurably employed and being aged between 16 and 66 at the date of termination of employment due to redundancy etc.</P>
      <P>Redundancy payments over and above the statutory entitlements provided for under the Redundancy Payments Acts, being <i>ex-gratia</i> agreements, are a matter for negotiation and agreement between employers and employees or a trade union acting on their behalf.</P>
      <P>Disputes about the level of extra-statutory redundancy payments, which cannot be resolved through local negotiations, may be referred to the Labour Relations Commission, the Labour Court or the Rights Commissioner Service.</P>
      <P>I would also draw the Deputy's attention to the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Acts, 1973 to 1991 which provide that an employer shall, in order to terminate an employee's contract of employment, give a minimum period of notice of between one and eight weeks depending on the employee's length of service. Alternatively, employees can be paid in lieu of notice. Disputes about the right to notice may be referred to the Employment Appeals Tribunal.</P>
      <P>Finally, the Organisation of Working Time Act, 1997 sets out statutory rights for employees in respect of rest, maximum working time and holidays. If the employer refuses to grant the employees their holiday entitlement, it would be open to them to obtain redress in this matter by referring a case to a Rights Commissioner under the Act.</P>

      <P>A restructuring of the community employment programme was approved by Government on 21 July 1999. As part of the restructuring process widows and widowers were given access to community employment in their own right. This change has been implemented with effect from 15 September 1999.</P>

    <P>The Vantastic project was started by the Centre for Independent Living in 1994 and provides an accessible taxi service for people with impaired mobility. FÁS assisted the Centre for Independent Living in 1998-99 through community employment support with funding in excess of £177,000 and the centre has received additional funds from the lottery to cover <Col N="200" /> insurance/maintenance etc. The Vantastic project currently has 28 participants and is due to finish on 7 January 2000. Renewal of the project will be considered at the next monitoring committee meeting in November.</P>
    <P>The primary purpose of CE, an active labour market programme, is to act as a stepping stone in the reintegration of long-term unemployed persons into the open labour market. The programme will continue to be a very substantial active labour market programme and will continue to support the community and statutory sectors, if at a reduced level over time. Consultations on the ongoing funding of essential services, such as services for persons with disabilities, will take place in the central committee on Partnership 2000.</P>

      <P>It is expected that the third ministerial meeting of the World Trade Organisation, scheduled to be held in Seattle from 30 November to 3 December 1999, will take the necessary decisions to launch a millennium round of trade negotiations in the WTO in 2000.</P>
      <P>The European Union has been, and is, engaged in the detailed work, within the WTO, preparing for these negotiations. Ireland has participated fully in the preparation of EU positions. The EU is firmly convinced that a comprehensive trade round, involving a broad range of issues is the best way to address the challenges resulting from rapid and far-reaching economic changes, to manage properly and effectively the globalisation process, to promote equitable growth and development and to respond in a balanced manner to the interests of all WTO members, in particular the developing countries.</P>
      <P>Eight rounds of trade liberalisation and strengthening of multilateral trade rules have made a major contribution to global prosperity, development and rising living standards. Since 1951, global trade has grown seventeen fold, world production has more than quadrupled, and world <i>per capita</i> income has doubled. The multilateral system has helped a large number of developing countries to successfully integrate into the international economy and developing countries' share of world export trade has increased by nearly 50 per cent over the past three years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The WTO, since the conclusion of the Uruguay Round, has brought about major improvements <Col N="201" /> in market access and more predictable rules that have benefited the membership as a whole, in particular smaller countries. Over the period 1995-97, the volume of global trade increased by almost 8 per cent annually, far outpacing the growth in G.N.P. WTO and OECD studies on the impact of the Uruguay Round have confirmed the positive impact on the world economy as its results are taking effect.</P>
    <P>In addition to a decision to launch a new round of trade negotiations, I would hope that the Seattle Ministerial will take decisions that will strengthen the WTO as an institution. These could include improvements to the Dispute Settlement Understanding, the creation of an institutional basis to better address development concerns, the improvement of co-operation between the WTO and other major international institutions and improved procedures to create greater transparency and public awareness of the WTO.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt):</NameTxt>
      <P>The general rule under copyright law, both in Ireland and internationally, is that where a copyright work is made by an employee in the course of his or her employment, the first owner of the <Col N="202" /> copyright in such a work is deemed to be the employer rather than the employee. Section 10 of the Copyright Act, 1963, provides for a single exception, whereby journalists who are employees of a newspaper, magazine or similar periodical, retain copyright in works prepared by them in the course of their employment with the journal concerned, except in relation to acts undertaken in connection with the publication of such works in the journal concerned. It is important to understand that this exception applies to print journalists only; employee journalists in non-print media are not included.</P>
      <P>In reviewing this provision in the context of the preparation of the Copyright and Related Rights Bill, 1999, I came to the conclusion that the exception in favour of employee journalists in the print media was seriously anomalous in relation to the treatment of employee copyright both in non-print journalism, and in relation to works created by employees in the course of their employment generally. On this basis, I could find no justification for its continuation in the legislation designed to replace section 10 of the Copyright Act, 1963. However, I was anxious to ensure that the new legislation would include some recognition of the fact that employee journalists in the print media had for many years enjoyed qualified ownership of the copyright in their works, however anomalous that situation might have been. Accordingly, while section 23 of the Copyright and Related Rights Bill, 1999 does not contain the existing section 10 exception, it does provide employee journalists with a right to use works prepared by them in the course of their employment for any purpose other than for the purposes of making available those works to newspapers or periodicals, without infringing copyright in those works. I believe that this provision strikes a fair balance between the legitimate interests of employee journalists and their employers in this matter.</P>
      <P>On the question of libel, the Deputy will appreciate that I am not in a position to comment on this matter in detail. In any event, questions of civil law and its reform, including defamation, are unrelated to copyright, and fall within the area of responsibility of my colleague, Deputy John O'Donoghue, Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. I understand, however, that the law regarding the repeated expression of a libel, together with the doctrine of the vicarious liability of employers for civil wrongs committed by their employees in the course of their employment, would in practice mean that a newspaper will be held to share responsibility for any libels which it may print with the responsible journalist, whether that journalist is an employee of that newspaper or not.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>I would prefer if shipments of this nature did not take place. The question of a ban, however, on the passage of ships carrying nuclear materials is fraught with difficulties, given the right of innocent passage enshrined in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea &ndash; UNCLOS.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The concerns of the Irish Government and public about the use of the Irish Sea generally for the transport of the materials in question have been made known on many occasions to the UK authorities and I have their assurance that in any event the vessels involved will not at any stage pass through waters under our jurisdiction. The <Col N="204" /> UK authorities have also stressed that voyages by such vessels through waters solely under UK jurisdiction are kept to a minimum and are already limited to one or two per year.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances, I have given particular attention to ensuring that the voyages that take place are carried out having regard to the highest possible level of safety both in terms of the vessels employed and the operational requirements applied to them. In this connection the IMO Assembly, which I addressed in November, 1997, agreed that the INF Code which governs the transport by sea of the materials concerned should be made mandatory. Work on implementing that decision is proceeding apace.</P>
    <P>In the meantime as I have previously informed the House, the European Union has adopted a directive requiring all vessels carrying such materials bound for or leaving a Community port to comply with strict notification procedures and controls. I signed the regulations transposing the directive in question into Irish law on 21 April 1999 as required under the terms of the directive even though such vessels do not use Irish ports or transit Irish waters. The EU controls in question now apply to all vessels en route to Sellafield.</P>
    <P>As I have said, I would prefer that these shipments were not happening at all. Nevertheless, as the Minister responsible for the marine environment and safety at sea, I am conscious of the fact that they are for the present a reality.</P>
    <P>In light of this fact, I have made arrangements with both the UK and France &ndash; bilateral agreements &ndash; that Ireland will be notified in advance of shipment dates, the nature of cargoes and all other relevant details. This information is always available to the Irish Marine Emergency Service of my Department.</P>
    <P>As Minister I have to accept that the vessels transporting these materials may be involved in an accident arising from the hazards of navigation or from occurrences such as workplace accidents which will require assistance from Ireland's emergency services.</P>
    <P>In this connection the Irish Marine Emergency Service, in consultation with the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, will shortly engage in a communications exercise involving an injured crewman on board one of these vessels.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, all persons on board seagoing vessels are equally entitled to emergency response to save life and limbs. I, as Minister, would be less than responsible if I did not envisage such a situation arising with one of these vessels or consider the implications for both the people of Ireland and those men and women who crew our rescue services. We would all prefer to exercise that scenario now rather than wait for a real emergency.</P>

      <P>Where objections are received, the prospective developer is given an opportunity to comment upon them. Where appropriate the views of the various experts available to me are also sought.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 177 and 179 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the Deputy is referring to the snap net fisheries on the Waterford Estuary. The snap net fisheries in question enjoyed the longest commercial salmon fishing season in the country this year. The open season for this fishery extended from 12 May to 14 August. Fishing was <Col N="207" /> permitted on a four day week, 24 hour basis from 12 May to 11 June and a five day week, 24 hour day basis for the rest of the season. The drift net season generally ran from 1 June to 31 July, on a four day week basis during the hours of daylight only. The draft net season generally ran from 12 May to 31 July on a four day week basis.</P>
    <P>The salmon conservation measures now in place, including the restrictions on the commercial fishing season and limitations on the use of monofilament nets, are based on the recommendations of the Salmon Management Task Force. At the heart of these measures is the need to ensure that sufficient numbers of fish return to our rivers each year to spawn in the interest of the long-term sustainability of the fisheries.</P>
    <P>Salmon populations remain very vulnerable and therefore it is imperative that the commitment to protection, conservation and management of our salmon fisheries is sustained by everybody involved, be they commercial or angling interests. The advice available to me does not suggest that conservation measures, including season lengths and in relation to monofilament netting, in place this year should be relaxed for 2000.</P>

      <P>As part of the statutory consul<Col N="208" /> tation process, the aquaculture licence applications to which the Deputy refers were sent to Dúchas &ndash; the National Parks and Wildlife Service &ndash; for their observations.</P>
      <P>In their response, Dúchas expressed concerns over the possible impact which the proposed aquaculture might have on an area in Mweeloon Bay which was known to be used by migratory birds. Following detailed consideration of the matter, the Department agreed to defer licensing decisions until additional information on bird usage of these sites had been compiled by Dúchas.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, Dúchas commissioned a field survey which was undertaken over the period November 1998 to April 1999. The results of that survey required some supplementary work to be undertaken which has delayed the submission of a definitive report in the matter. However, I expect to receive the final report this week which should enable decisions on the applications to be taken shortly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware from my reply to parliamentary Question No. 44 of 2 June 1999 and from my replies to parliamentary Questions Nos. 20 and 42 of 23 June 1999 of the action which has been taken to date by my Department's Marine Safety Working Group, the Marine Institute and a number of local authorities to address the widespread concerns being expressed by many people about the safe use of small powered recreational craft, including jet skis, for personal purposes.</P>
      <P>However, because of the growing public concern over the use of jet skis and fast power craft and, especially in the light of a number of very serious accidents involving personal recreational craft in recent months, I have now taken the initiative to pull these various strands of action together by establishing an action group to look at the whole area in a comprehensive and cohesive review of the safe use of personal recreational water craft, including jet skis.</P>
      <P>The action group, which held its first meeting on 16 September last, is being chaired by Mr. Clayton Love, Jnr., an accomplished mariner, who has given over 30 years distinguished service to the Royal National Lifeboat Institution in Ireland having only recently retired from the position of Deputy Chairman of the RNLI overall and from the chairmanship of the Irish member's committee of that very fine organisation. The group includes representatives of the RNLI, the Irish Sailing Association, the Irish Marine Federation, the National Safety Council and the Garda Síochána, as well as a number of relevant Government Departments and State agencies. I am arranging to send a copy of the group's terms of reference and a list of its membership to the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have asked the action group to consider measures which will be effective, sensible and enforceable and will be instrumental in introducing a shift in the culture towards safety as the overriding consideration. The group, in its deliberations, will have particular regard to the Marine Institute's work on safety policy in the marine leisure sector, the good work on zoning undertaken by a number of coastal local authorities and best practice and ideas in place and being developed internationally to ensure that all water users can enjoy their sports and activities in safety. In this regard, I understand that a seminar has been arranged by the Marine Institute to take place in Athlone on 18 October next which will provide <Col N="210" /> the opportunity for interested bodies and organisations to have an input towards the consultation process associated with the institute's study.</P>
    <P>The setting up of this action group is an expression of the importance which we attach to tackling this issue. My central aim is to put in place policies and practical measures to protect the safety of all water users in the context of a comprehensive safety regime for recreational craft generally. My basic aim in relation to fast water craft and jet skis is to stop irresponsible behaviour by a small number of users, to protect the safety of other water users and to end the severe nuisance and distress being caused in certain locations and in traditional bathing, boating and angling areas.</P>
    <P>In view of the importance I attach to this subject, I have asked the chairman that the action group submit an interim report to me by mid-November 1999 and a final report by no later than the end of February next year. I assure the Deputy that I will act quickly on the recommendations of the action group and bring forward any legislation which may be required as a matter of urgency.</P>

The southern board's request arises from concerns about the level of smolt mortality in the weirs during the migration period.</P>
      <P>My attention has been drawn to the proceedings in Waterford District Court on 15 January 1999 in relation to the operation of spray weirs and I am also aware of the views of the Suir Fishermen's Federation.</P>
      <P>My decision in relation to the by-law will be informed, <i>inter alia</i>, by submissions received following the publication of the by-law application by the Southern Regional Fisheries Board and the legal and scientific advice available to my Department and in consultation with all relevant interests.</P>

      <P>Under the coast protection programme for 1999, I announced that a total of 29 projects are being carried out in conjunction with local authorities at a total cost of some £5 million. This represents a five-fold increase on the annual funding available in previous years and underlines my commitment and that of the Government to tackling the threat of coastal erosion.</P>
      <P>The projects are at locations in Counties Louth, Dublin, Wicklow, Wexford, Cork, Kerry, Clare, Galway, Mayo, Sligo and Donegal and will receive financial assistance from my Department of up to 75 per cent of the total costs. Phase 1 of the Bray coast protection scheme and protection works of Quilty, County Clare, are being undertaken with EU funding support under the coast protection measure of the Operational Programme for Environmental Services, 1994-99, which provided for total expenditure of some £5 million on coast protection works over the five year period. The additional Exchequer funding which I secured for this year is supporting the other projects being undertaken.</P>
      <P>I have also committed funding in the current year for development of a geographical information system and for coastal and aerial survey work. The data generated from this essential survey work will critically inform future coastal protection programmes. In that context I am committed to a comprehensive national strategy for tackling coastal erosion based on systematic identification and prioritisation of projects and appropriate response strategies. I am seeking, in the context of the National Development Plan, a level of funding for coast protection commensurate with the very serious problems which need to be tackled.</P>

      <P>Visits by foreign naval vessels can arise either at the request of the state in question or at the invitation of the Irish authorities, for example, in the case of festivals or commemorative events.

      <P>A number of areas of responsibility of the Department of Foreign Affairs touch on the work of other Departments.

      <P>To date, it has proved possible to work closely and effectively with the Departments concerned on a practical, concerted basis. I am, however, open to utilising the provisions in section 12 of the Act in consultation with my Government colleagues should those provisions offer a more effective means of advancing any particular issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews):</NameTxt>
      <P>Enlargement of the Council of Europe based on democratic institutions and human rights is an essential element in the reconstruction of Europe. In April this year Georgia was admitted as the 41st member state. Ireland would welcome the further enlargement of the council in order to achieve the goal of an inclusive democratic Europe. While enlargement should be inclusive, it should not be unconditional. Ireland hopes that the remaining applicant countries will bring their institutions and legislation into line with the requirements of the Council of Europe and resolve any conflicts between them so that they may be able to join at the earliest opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The procedure for accession of new members to the Council of Europe involves the transmission of applications by the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe to the parliamentary assembly for an opinion. That procedure has been completed in the cases of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Armenia, Azerbaijan and Monaco and special rapporteurs have been appointed by the assembly in each case. With the exception of Monaco, these states have requested and been granted special guest status with the parliamentary assembly which is an initial step towards <Col N="218" /> accession. The assembly will in due course bring forward a recommendation to the committee of Ministers on the accession of each, including any specific measures to be taken by the state concerned to bring its institutions and practice into conformity with Council of Europe standards. At that point, a decision will be taken by the committee of Ministers.</P>
    <P>During Ireland's forthcoming Presidency of the Council of Europe from November this year, we will be seeking to advance this process. In light of the particular circumstances which prevail in Bosnia and Herzegovina, we will encourage the Council of Europe to step up its support in the form of co-operation and assistance programmes. In the case of Armenia and Azerbaijan, the Council of Europe must also continue to assist the development and consolidation of democratic institutions in both countries. However, progress is clearly required by both these states in resolving outstanding issues between them, particularly the question of Nagorno Karabakh. The assembly recently commenced work on the application by Monaco and we are following that closely.</P>

      <P>Two persons concerned are being held in Frankland and Whitemoor prisons respectively, where they were transferred from Belmarsh during the summer. Both are security category A prisoners and are being held in normal conditions for their category. The Embassy in London has not received any complaints regarding their conditions of detention. Further consular visits to both prisoners will take place in the period ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Both have applied for transfer under the European Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons to serve the balances of their sentences in this jurisdiction. The Government strongly sup<Col N="219" /> ports the principle that, wherever possible, prisoners should be permitted to serve their sentences close to their families. Responsibility for the operation of this convention lies with my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Following representations made by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and by the Embassy in London, the British authorities have advised that they are in the process of collating the necessary documentation and reports required for the advancement of this process.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews):</NameTxt>
      <P>Human rights concerns play an important role in our relations with China. Ireland, together with our partners in the European Union, continues to press strongly and actively for substantial improvements in the human rights situation there, including in those areas specified by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>There is an ongoing dialogue between the Union and China on human rights issues. Last week, for example, the EU ministerial troika met with the Chinese delegation in New York and human rights issues, such as the treatment of Chinese political dissidents and the situation in Tibet, were addressed. Earlier this month, Ireland was represented at an EU-China Human Rights Seminar organised by the Finnish Presidency, which was attended by NGO representatives, academics and Government officials from China and the 15 member states. Discussions focused on concerns such as the death penalty, protection of minorities, judicial and prison systems and women's human rights. During these informal talks, the question of China's &ldquo;one child policy&rdquo; and associated issues were raised by the Irish representatives. Preparations are now being made for the next formal round of the human rights dialogue which will take place in Beijing on 19 October. It is intended that this round will focus on the need to secure concrete and visible improvements in the human rights situation in China.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Chinese authorities have taken some positive steps over the past two years which have given rise to hopes of a tangible improvement in the human rights situation there. These have included China's increased co-operation with the UN human rights system, for example, the signing of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, as well as <Col N="220" /> the visits by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention. The Chinese authorities also agreed to report on Hong Kong under the two international covenants, while the EU Troika ambassadors were allowed to visit Tibet in May 1998. Through the human rights dialogue, China now regularly discusses issues of serious human rights concern, including individual cases, the death penalty, conditions of detention and Tibet.</P>
    <P>However, these steps have not been sufficiently matched by improvements on the ground. The recent severe sentences against members of the China Democratic Party are one example of this. We continue to be concerned about the lack of tangible results coming from the human rights dialogue. The dialogue is not, and cannot be allowed to become, an end in itself but must give rise to real improvements in China.</P>
    <P>The Government has, therefore, continued to express publicly Ireland's ongoing concerns about the human rights situation in China at the UN and other relevant human rights fora. We have also supported the expression of common EU concerns. At the 55th session of the UN Commission on Human Rights, held in Geneva earlier this year, the EU Presidency &ndash; speaking on behalf of EU member states, regretted that the general human rights situation in China was still far from meeting internationally accepted standards. With regard to the rule of law, the continuing and widespread practice of administrative detention and the excessive use of the death penalty remained matters of particular concern to the EU. In particular, restrictions on religious freedom, the lack of the right to free speech, the situation in Tibet and particularly harsh sentences in Xinjiang were matters for concern.</P>
    <P>The human rights situation in China will be raised by Ireland and its EU partners in the context of discussions at the forthcoming session of the Third Committee of the United Nations General Assembly, which deals with social and human rights issues.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the situation in relation to the 11th Panchen Lama, who was arrested in May 1995 and is now being detained at an unknown location in China. This is a matter of grave concern. The issue has been raised on several occasions with the Chinese authorities, and we will continue to do so until there is a satisfactory outcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, there is also an ongoing human rights dialogue between the European Union and China. Matters dealt with cover a broad spectrum of human rights issues, including the continued detention of political <Col N="221" /> prisoners. The case of the 11th Panchen Lama constitutes an important part of this dialogue, and I would expect that it will be pursued there in similar fashion.</P>
    <P>In relation to the second element of the question, the Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate, nor is it the practice, to comment on statements made outside this House by private individuals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Ms O'Donnell):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 205 and 206 together.</P>
      <P>With regard to the situation in East Timor I refer the Deputy to the reply which I gave to Priority Questions on the subject today.</P>
      <P>With regard to the specific role and involvement of the UN, under the terms of the agreement of 5 May between Indonesia, Portugal and the UN, which provided the basis for the popular consultation in East Timor to be organised and to actually take place on 30 August, responsibility for providing security in East Timor lay fully with the Indonesian Government. Indonesia would not accept the presence of an international armed peacekeeping force as part of this process, and insistence by the international community on this point would have meant that the process would not have taken place. The Indonesian Government must now explain its failure to fulfill this responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The UN established its mission for East Timor <Col N="222" />&ndash; UNAMET &ndash; to administer the election. The Minister for Foreign Affairs paid tribute to their work when he addressed the UN General Assembly last week. As a result of their work the people of East Timor were able to express themselves democratically for the first time in their history. The Government, together with our EU partners, is now fully committed to seeing that the people of East Timor enjoy the independence which they have freely and overwhelmingly chosen.</P>
    <P>The violence which was unleashed, with the complicity of the Indonesian Government, on the people of East Timor after the announcement of the result was addressed by the UN Security Council following expressions of grave concern by a number of governments, including that of Ireland. I have already described in reply to another question the terms of Resolution 1264 of 15 September. While welcoming the fact that this resolution is now in place, I regret that it was not adopted sooner.</P>
    <P>In the course of his address to the UN General Assembly last week, the Minister for Foreign Affairs noted that questions about the effectiveness and credibility of the United Nations had been raised and urged that, learning from the crisis in East Timor, steps be taken to ensure that principles of the UN Charter be more effectively upheld.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 215, 223 and 233 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The concerns of the road transport industry in relation to the proposed Working Time Directive have been conveyed to me by the various industry associations, particularly the Irish Road Haulage Association, IBEC and the Irish Concrete Feder<Col N="225" /> ation. The issues raised include concerns about possible increased costs, the need for additional vehicles and drivers and the inclusion of self employed drivers within the scope of the directive. These are being taken into account in determining Ireland's negotiating position.</P>
    <P>The position is that there are already rules about working time for most workers under Directive 93/104/EC of 23 November 1993. The aim of that directive was &ldquo;to guarantee the protection of workers against the adverse effects on their health and safety arising from excessive working time, insufficient rest or irregular work patterns&rdquo;. However the directive did not cover sailors, junior doctors or employees in any form of transport. They were left out because it was felt at the time that different rules would be needed for them because of the complexities attached to each occupation.</P>
    <P>The Social Affairs Council has now reached political agreement on rules for sailors, junior doctors and transport workers other than those engaged in road transport.</P>
    <P>In October 1997, the social partners in the road transport sector established a joint committee at Community level to explore how the Working Time Directive could best be adapted taking account of the particular circumstances of their sector.</P>
    <P>On 31 March 1998, the Commission issued a consultation document to the social partners. While sufficient points of convergence were reached by the social partners to draw up the text of a draft joint agreement, they failed to reach agreement by 30 September 1998. The Commission had informed the social partners that, in the absence of agreement by that date, the Commission would come forward with proposals for the sector. This is what it has done.</P>
    <P>This Commission proposal has been debated at length at the transport questions working group. Many member states have had difficulty with these initial proposals and political agreement has not yet been reached. The Finnish Presidency is continuing the discussion of the Commission proposal with the objective of achieving an acceptable compromise package. Ireland's objective in this regard is to negotiate a package which provides flexibility for the industry while protecting the health and safety of workers.</P>
    <P>The driving hours of mobile workers in transport are currently regulated by the tachograph legislation but other activities such as loading and unloading, cleaning the vehicle, performing safety checks on the vehicle and paperwork are not included in the calculation of driving time. In fact, time which may appear to be a break on a tachograph chart could in fact be occupied with other strenuous activity. Although road transport workers are only permitted to drive for 45 hours a week, they may in fact work in excess of this. The health and welfare of these workers is as important as for workers in any other industry.</P>
    <P>It is recognised that the proposed Working Time Directive may have an impact on the indus<Col N="226" /> try. However, this has to be balanced with the protection of health and safety of the workforce on which the industry depends.</P>
    <P>I and my Department will remain in regular contact with the various representative associations to ensure that Ireland's negotiating position is informed by their concerns. However, whatever provisions are finally adopted will have to take account of the differing views of member states and the position of the European Parliament.  </P>

    <P>Improved visibility aids were installed when Cork Airport was upgraded to category II operations in 1989. Since that date the diversion rate of planned arrivals has been consistently below 1 <Col N="227" /> per cent. Prior to 1989, the diversion rate at Cork airport was up to 3.6 per cent.</P>

      <Quest>the plans, if any, she has to make a special allocation to Bus Éireann's operation in Cork, pro rata to the £20 million given to upgrade public transport in the Dublin area, in view of the crisis in Cork arising from a situation where only six new buses were allocated in 1998 and 1999 to replace six obsolete buses, in contrast to Dublin where 150 additional new buses are being provided for Dublin city in 1999 due to the special allocation.</Quest>

    <P>The investment needs review for the greater <Col N="228" /> Cork area, submitted to me in June 1998 by CIÉ, formed the basis for the development of my Department's proposals for significant investment in public transport in the Cork area. These proposals are now being considered in the context of the formulation of the National Development Plan 2000-06. The details of the plan will be finalised by Government in the coming weeks and I expect that it will include a significant provision for the upgrading of public transport in Cork.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is aware that the provision of broadband infrastructure is primarily a matter for operators in the newly liberalised telecommunications market. Recognising that in certain regions of the country, competition alone will not provide the required broadband telecommunications infrastructural investment, I engaged a consortium of consultants led by Norcontel (Ireland) Ltd. to manage three calls for projects supporting the development of advanced communications networks and services which might be co-funded by INTERREG and European Regional Development Fund European Union funding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The successful projects from the first and second calls were announced on 5 July 1999, with 23 million euros of EU moneys leveraging a further 32 million euros of private sector investment. This investment will result in the provision of approximately 1,000 kilometres of information <Col N="229" /> age infrastructure to over 120 towns around the country.</P>
    <P>A third call for 1.143 million euros of EU co-funding closed on 16 August 1999 and is currently being evaluated. It is intended to announce the result of this call in early October 1999. All of these projects are required to be completed by 31 December 2000.</P>
    <P>Following on from these initiatives my Department in association with Forfás is currently preparing telecommunications investment proposals for the next National Development Plan. The needs of all regions of the country will be considered in this review.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke):</NameTxt>
      <P>The total cost of the privatisation process of Telecom Éireann has not been finalised as some invoices have not been received <Col N="230" /> and some consultancy work is ongoing. The total cost incurred by my Department to date in connection with the initial public offering is approximately £73 million, including VAT.</P>
      <P>The amounts paid to date, excluding VAT, to each consultant, adviser and other together with the services rendered by them are set out in the following table. The table does not include departmental costs such as salaries, incidental expenses, office equipment and machinery, <i>et cetera, </i>which are included in the total figure above.</P>
      <P>The amount raised for the Exchequer from the initial public offering was approximately £3.3 billion. Therefore, the expenditure to date as a percentage of the proceeds is approximately 2.2 per cent which compares favourably to international precedent.</P>
      <P>It should be noted that I am limited in making public announcements in relation to the share offer for 90 days after the IPO date. However, the decision on the setting of the share price was made by the Cabinet sub-committee dealing with the IPO based on the advice of the joint global co-ordinators and others. The movements in the share price since the IPO date are a matter for the international financial markets.</P>
      <P>As stated in the programme for Government, An Action Programme for the Millennium, the Government will take a practical rather than an ideological approach to the future of the State companies, working in the spirit of social partnership and consensus. In this light we will examine the requirements of each of the State companies on a case by case basis, including their needs for external capital by means of share flotations or strategic alliances.</P>

      <P>Dublin Bus has now taken delivery of this vehicle, which is currently undergoing pre-servicing and re-fitting, and staff are receiving the necessary training.

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke):</NameTxt>
      <P>Increases in postal rates for newspapers do not require my approval, as they come within the ambit of a general approval given to An Post by the Government in 1991 to fix its own charges for services outside the monopoly area <Col N="233" /> reserved to the company under the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983.</P>
      <P>Recent legislation at European Union level obliges national postal operators to charge cost-reflecting tariffs for services provided in the non-reserved area. Accordingly, An Post could not continue to earn less from its customers using these services than it was being charged for delivery by the national postal operator in the country of destination.</P>
      <P>Regarding the notice, prior consultation and scheduling of newspaper postal tariffs, An Post have apologised to me for the lack of notice which arose in the context of their announcement of proposed tariff changes for this category of service last July.</P>
      <P>The company has assured me that in future years they will implement such changes in January, following a period of consultation with customers commencing in the previous October. Given that cross-Border prices charged by other postal operators to An Post will change each year on foot of EU postal legislation, tariffs introduced by the company in January of any year will need to reflect the impact of such changes.</P>
      <P>I understand that the increases in postal tariff charged by An Post for newspapers, which were announced by the company in July 1999, will come into effect in January 2000 and will require further adjustment to allow for the impact of any increases to cross-Border prices as of the latter date. An Post will work with individual customers in this category where necessary to assist them in making the transition to the new tariffs regime.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke):</NameTxt>
      <P>Existing boilers in ESB power plants are not suitable for the combustion of waste paper. Oil and gas fired plant burn liquid and gaseous fuel respectively and cannot accommodate solid fuel. Coal or milled peat plant would require extensive modification and major investment to accommodate burning paper. The ESB has informed me that studies carried out by it indicate that the value of waste paper as a fuel would not justify the investment required for plant modifications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I refer the Deputy to the Green Paper on Sustainable Energy published by my Department last week. Paragraph 9.2 of chapter 9 states that &ldquo;the use of wastes for the purposes of power generation must be considered in the context of a waste management strategy, which favours prevention, minimisation, recycling and re-use over energy <Col N="234" /> recovery&rdquo;. As the Deputy is aware, waste policy, in the first instance, is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, to whom I believe the Deputy has addressed a similar question.</P>
    <P>In view of the steady destruction of large areas of forest around the world, the recycling of waste paper may be a more sensible solution than disposal by way of burning in power plants.</P>

      <P>At Dublin Airport the viewing facility within the terminal building on the mezzanine floor has been removed from public use to accommodate building work associated with the integration of the new terminal extension and the main terminal building. Space constraints at Dublin Airport have not allowed for the provision of an alternate viewing balcony at this time. Planning is ongoing for the inclusion of public viewing facilities after the enlargement of the terminal building at Dublin Airport, subject to operational, commercial and security requirements.</P>
      <P>A dedicated plane-spotter facility is available, at the touchdown point on runway 28 on the old Collinstown Lane and a more informal site is located off runway 23 beside the Forrest Little Golf Course. These are used extensively.</P>
      <P>At Shannon Airport a new observation balcony is included in the new terminal development at Shannon and will be user friendly for plane spotters as it is being constructed on top of the terminal building overlooking the entire airfield. The facility will be available early in the New Year. There are many areas around the airport perimeter fence available to aviation enthusiasts to view aircraft movements, as both runway ends are adjacent to public roads.</P>
      <P>At Cork Airport there is a large glass indoor balcony overlooking the airside, which is known as the Liberty Stream Balcony. This gives an extensive view of the apron, runway and the entire airside area. There are also many public viewing areas available along the public road.</P>

      <P>The future development of the military aerodrome at Baldonnel is primarily a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Defence, in the first instance. Both the Minister for Defence and I have received several proposals in relation to limited development of civil aviation at Baldonnel. Any use of Baldonnel for civil aviation purposes is a matter which falls to be considered by me, in consultation with the Minister for Defence, in the context of overall airports policy. In that regard, advisers have been appointed jointly by the Minister for Finance and me to assist in the examination of Aer Rianta's report on its future strategic direction. The advisers' report, which will be completed in the near future, will assist me to assess the position of Baldonnel against that wider policy backdrop and to discuss these matters with the Minister for Defence and my other Cabinet colleagues.</P>

      <P>There have been recent reports in the media regarding the falsification of quality control checks on mixed oxide fuel, being manufactured at the BNFL plant in Sellafield. These reports described the discovery, by BNFL, of the falsification of quality control check data for 22 batches of pellets.</P>

The NII informed the RPII that it is carrying out a thorough investigation of the incident and has undertaken to inform the RPII of its findings.</P>
      <P>The RPII has advised me that the incident has no implications for safety at the Sellafield plant but they will, however, continue to monitor developments in the investigation.

      <P>The Government earlier this year agreed to detailed costing and feasibility studies being carried out on a longer term suburban rail development programme for the greater Dublin area. CIE has now commissioned a consultancy firm to carry out these studies and I expect them to be completed by end year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The options being considered for the future development of the suburban rail network include the possible provision of rail links to Dublin Airport and also to Navan, which has been identified as a primary development centre in the strategic planning guidelines for the greater Dublin area. I expect that the national development plan will make appropriate provision to <Col N="242" /> implement the recommendations of the current studies.</P>

      <Quest>the progress to date in implementing the rail safety programme of investment; and if there have been any rail accidents in 1999 due to outdated track or signalling.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Railway Safety Programme 1999 &ndash; 2003, prepared by Iarnród Éireann following the submission of the IRMS Review of Railway Safety in Ireland, provides for expenditure of £430.6 million for the first phase of the implementation of the recommendations of the consultants. I am informed by the company that the main thrust of the programme is being achieved both in terms of the physical works programmes and in terms of the establishment of training and cultural change programmes and the development of corporate safety standards. By the end of this year it is expected that some £80 million will have been invested in rail safety by Iarnród Éireann. <Col N="243" /> Up to the end of the first week in September, 65 miles of the planned 85 miles of track renewals for 1999 had been completed, major repairs and renewals had been completed on 25 of the planned 45 bridges and, in regard to fencing, 14 of the 18 urban locations which need improvements had been put out to contract, and 26 miles of the planned 34 miles of rural fencing have been put out to contract.</P>
      <P>Overall, IE is confident of completing all planned works by year's end, but points out that there are other parties involved in the repair of the bridges, most particularly the relevant local authorities. I am also advised by the company that there have been no rail accidents in 1999 which were attributable to outdated track or signalling.</P>
      <P>A key recommendation of the 1998 IRMS review was that external audits should be carried out on the progress made in implementing the recommendations contained in the report. IRMS hope to commence the first such audit in the near future. The consultants have recently submitted a pre-audit report of progress to date, which they prepared at my request, prior to carrying out the first formal audit.</P>

      <P>The incident to which the Deputy referred to was, in fact, an accident as defined in the Air Navigation (Notification and Investigation of Accidents and Incidents) Regulations, 1997, SI NO. 205 of 1997. The accident occurred to a US registered World Airways MD-11 aircraft, operating on behalf of Aer Lingus, at 0625 hours local time on Saturday, 18 September, 1999, at Shannon Airport. The aircraft, while landing in poor weather conditions, overran the end of the runway by approximately 200 feet. There were no injuries to the crew or passengers and the aircraft was evacuated through the normal entry doors. The accident was notified to the air accident investigation unit of this Department shortly after it occurred by the air traffic control authorities at Shannon Airport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two air accident investigation unit inspectors immediately travelled to Shannon Airport where the formal investigation into the accident commenced with the aircraft still in situ in the grassy overrun area adjacent to runway 06. Initial investigation of the accident indicated that no immediate safety recommendations would be required to be issued to either the operator, the manufacturer <Col N="244" /> or the regulatory authorities. The aircraft was returned to service on the night of 18 September, following a technical inspection. A report will be published under SI 205 of 1997 as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>Following a review by the Director of Telecommunications Regulation of the responses to the consultation paper on deflector licensing which she issued in May 1999, the director has concluded that there should be a short-term licensing scheme for deflectors. Such a scheme will require enabling regulations to be made by the director with my consent. I have not yet received any proposals from the director in relation to such regulations. However, by virtue of High Court judgments in 1995 and 1998, the director is obliged to reconsider the application from Southcoast Community Television. The director has decided to license southcoast on a short-term basis and has submitted enabling draft regulations to me for my consent. Those draft regulations are currently under examination within my Department and I will respond to the director as soon as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 244 and 252 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The inclusion of military service allowance &ndash; MSA &ndash; in the calculation of superannuation benefits for military personnel arose from a recommendation made in 1990 by the Commission on Remuneration and Conditions of Service in the Defence Forces &ndash; the Gleeson Commission. The agreed arrangements for the implementation of the recommendation provide, subject to certain conditions, for increases in pensions and gratuities to take account of MSA in the case of personnel retiring on or after 1 August 1990, namely, the day following publication of the commission's report. MSA has been reckoned in <Col N="245" /> the calculation of the pensions of all qualified persons who retired since that date.</P>
    <P>The various arguments in support of the view that MSA should be reflected in the pensions of personnel who retired before 1 August 1990 were fully considered in the context of the detailed and lengthy discussions with the military representative associations which preceded the implementation of the recommendation of the Gleeson commission. However, having regard to the practice followed in other areas of the public service and the considerable cost involved, which is not confined to my Department alone, it has not been possible to extend the scope of the commission's recommendation to those who retired before 1 August 1990.</P>
    <P>It is a core element of public service pensions parity policy that, when an allowance is being made pensionable for serving personnel, the benefit does not apply to existing pensioners. Accordingly, the stance adopted on the pensionability of MSA is consistent with settled pensions policy in the public service generally.</P>
    <P>Subsequent to my coming into office, I met in November 1997 with representatives of the Association for Retired Commissioned Officers &ndash; ARCO. I listened carefully and sympathetically to their views on this issue and I undertook to have the matter re-examined. I was very conscious, however, that the situation regarding pre-August 1990 Defence Forces' pensioners involved fundamental issues of policy and cost, which are not confined to my Department alone. While my Department initiated this re-examination, it became clear that it would be inappropriate to proceed any further pending the publication of the final report of the Commission on Public Service Pensions.</P>
    <P>The Commission on Public Service Pensions was established by Government in February 1996 against a background of growing concern generally about the emerging cost of existing public service pensions. The commission has very broad terms of reference to examine and report on the occupational pension arrangements of public servants, including claims for improvements in existing superannuation benefits. It was open to individuals and groups to make submissions to the commission and I understand that ARCO, together with the organisation of National Ex-Servicemen and women and the Irish UN Veterans Association, were among various pensioners' groups to do so.</P>
    <P>The commission is an independent body and is scheduled to make its final report to Government in the near future. In its interim report &ndash; published in November 1997 &ndash; the commission lists the pensionability of allowances generally as one of the main issues raised by various interested parties who made submissions. The Government will consider any recommendations the commission may make in this regard. The position of pre-August 1990 Defence Forces' pensioners in the MSA context, will be further considered in <Col N="246" /> the light of the final report of the commission and of any relevant Government decisions thereon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 245, 250, 251 and 262 together.</P>
      <P>In recent times a number of approaches have been made by private concerns regarding the possible use of facilities at Baldonnel Aerodrome. My main concern, in examining these proposals, would be to protect the military aviation interests at the aerodrome. The question of extending usage of these facilities for hire or reward requires careful consideration as it may have implications regarding licensing of the facility for commercial use. However, the greater utilisation of this underused resource could have benefits for both military and civil aviation in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other implications of the greater use of Baldonnel by private companies are appropriate for consideration by the Minister for Public Enterprise in the context of overall airports policy generally. In that regard I am aware that advisers have been appointed jointly by the Minister for Public Enterprise and the Minister for Finance to assist in the examination of Aer Rianta's report on its future strategic direction. This report will help in assessing the position of Baldonnel against that wider policy backdrop. I understand that the advisers will complete their work in the near future. Following consideration of the report it is intended that the Minister for Public Enterprise and myself will report to Government with specific proposals in respect of Baldonnel. Since no decision has yet been taken <Col N="247" /> in the matter, no studies of the type mentioned by Deputy Mitchell have been undertaken.</P>

      <P>The individual in question applied to be discharged from the Permanent Defence Force under the provision of paragraph 58 (s) of Defence Force Regulation A. 10, which provides for a discharge &ldquo;Determination of Service by the Minister&rdquo;. A discharge under this heading is effectively a &ldquo;free&rdquo; discharge from the Defence Forces before a member's service engagement has expired. Having considered the application, the Adjutant-General directed that such a cause of discharge was not appropriate in this case and that the appropriate discharge under Defence Force Regulations was a discharge &ldquo;By Purchase&rdquo; under the provisions of paragraph 58 (h) of Defence Force Regulation A. 10. The individual in question was accordingly discharged &ldquo;By Purchase&rdquo; having paid the prescribed discharge fee. I am satisfied that the case was dealt with in an appropriate manner by the military authorities.</P>

      <P>Certain areas of the work of my Department touch on the work of other Departments, for example, in the internal and international security area, in the area of fishery protection and surveillance, and in the area of search and rescue. Cross-departmental arrangements are in place, in some cases for many years, in relation to all of these work areas to ensure proper planning and coordination and efficient and effective operations. I believe these arrangements are working well so I have not seen a need to date to use the section 12 provisions referred to by the Deputy.</P>

      <Quest>if, further to Parliamentary Question No. 243 of 25 February 1999, his attention has been drawn to the fact that, following Switzerland's ban of battery cages for laying hens in 1992, the sale of home produced eggs increased from 62 per cent in 1981 to 72 per cent in 1997; his view on whether a phase out of battery cages in the EU will not necessarily lead to a mass importation of cheap battery produced eggs; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh):</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland's stance has always been to be supportive of enhanced welfare for laying hens whilst at the same time seeking to ensure a correct balance between welfare and the need to protect the interests of the Irish and EU producer. I am therefore fully supportive of new EU rules in the form of Council Directive 1999/74/EC which prohibits conventional battery cages from the year 2012 and the following associated declaration adopted when the directive was introduced: &ldquo;The Council and the Commission, stressing the need to ensure equal conditions of competition between European Union and third-country producers, considered that international acknowledgement of animal welfare rules must be one of the key points of the negotiating brief for the WTO Millennium Round.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It is premature to speculate as to whether the phase-out of conventional battery cages within the EU will lead to mass importations from third countries. Recent data for Switzerland would indicate a downward trend in imports and an increase in the production of eggs in shell in that country. I would draw attention to Council Directive 98/58/EC on the protection of animals kept for farming purposes, which requires the EU Commission to submit a report to Council on the following: the comparison between animal welfare provisions in the Community and in non-member countries which supply the Community, the scope for obtaining wider international acceptance of the welfare principles laid down in this directive, and the extent to which Community objectives in relation to animal welfare may be liable to be undermined as a result of competition from non-member countries which do not apply equivalent standards.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <Quest>if he has used section 12 of the Public Service Management Act, 1997, which allows for appropriate action to be taken on cross departmental issues in a structured way; and the areas of work of his Department which are touching on the work of other Departments in respect of which cross departmental arrangements might be appropriate.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh):</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 12 of the Public Service Management Act, 1997, has not yet been used in relation to issues which are the responsibility of the Department of Agriculture and Food. Initiatives have, however, been taken in a number of areas which are of cross-departmental interest.</P>
      <P>In relation to rural development, the White Paper, Ensuring the Future, recently published by my Department, following lengthy dialogue with all relevant Departments and agencies as well as organisations representative of rural communities, emphasises the multi-faceted character of the rural development agenda. The institutional arrangements set out in the White Paper include a Cabinet sub-committee chaired by the Taoiseach and the interdepartmental policy committee to ensure a co-ordinated approach to policy development at central level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another major area of cross-departmental concern is food safety. Extensive arrangements have already been made in this area under the Food <Col N="255" /> Safety Authority of Ireland Act, 1998. Under this legislation all relevant Departments and agencies enter into service agreements with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland in order to conduct the appropriate functions on an integrated basis with a view to consolidating and enhancing the food safety status of Irish produce and the hygiene status of food-related facilities. My Department and the Food Safety Authority of Ireland have already signed a service contract to this effect.</P>
    <P>I will keep under review the possibility of invoking S.12 where this would help to achieve improved co-ordination of policy or operations between any area of my Department and relevant areas of other Departments.</P>
    <P>12.&ndash;(1) A Minister of the Government having charge of an office (being a Department or a Scheduled Office) may jointly with a Minister of the Government having charge of another such office or other such offices after consultation with the Secretary General or Head of each Department or, as the case may be, Scheduled Office concerned, by order assign to one or more civil servants responsibility for the performance of functions in relation to matters that pertain to the offices aforesaid concerned as may be specified in the order or in any order made by those Ministers of the Government in substitution therefor.</P>
    <P>(2) A function of the Minister of the Government under this section may be delegated to a Minister of State under section 2 of the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment)(No. 2) Act, 1977, only as respects other functions of that Minister of the Government standing delegated to that Minister of State under the said section 2.</P>
    <P>(3) An assignment by Ministers of the Government under <i>subsection (1)</i> of responsibilities for the performance of functions shall be construed as reserving to those Ministers of the Government the right to perform those functions concurrently with the assignees.</P>
    <P>(4) An order under <i>subsection (1)</i> shall specify the manner in which the civil servants to which the order relates shall be accountable for the carrying out of the responsibilities concerned and, where the Minister for Finance has agreed (which he or she is hereby authorised to do) that those responsibilities are to include functions pertaining to the utilisation of financial resources related to the carrying out of those responsibilities, the Minister for Finance may specify the manner in which the civil servants concerned shall be accountable for such utilisation.</P>
    <P>(5) An order made by Ministers of the Government under <i>subsection (1)</i> shall specify the date when the assignment made thereby shall cease and may be amended or revoked by <Col N="256" /> the Ministers of the Government before that date.  </P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that as part of the agreement on CAP reform under Agenda 2000 additional milk quota was agreed for both parts of the island. That was a welcome development. The amount of quota allocated to Ireland and its timing are very favourable when compared with the situation of most member states. In these circumstances it would be unrealistic to expect any further quota allocation to Ireland in the short to medium term.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 273, 274 and 312 together.</P>
      <P>The Millennium Round of trade negotiations, scheduled to be launched at the World Trade Organisation's ministerial meeting in Seattle in November, will aim to liberalise trade, reduce tariffs, remove trade barriers and promote trade as a vehicle for sustainable economic growth. It will have as a particular focus regard for environmental protection and the needs of developing countries.</P>
      <P>The rules-based international trading system has been gradually extended to include agricultural activities. The WTO also recognises the non-trade aspects of agriculture and the EU intends to raise during the round a range of &lsquo;multifunctional' concerns including animal welfare.</P>
      <P>The EU has issued a draft communication for Seattle intended as a concise statement of the broad objectives to be achieved in the new round. The communication has of necessity to treat with a wide range of subjects, recognising that during the three year time-frame envisaged for negotiations much greater detail on particular areas will emerge.</P>
      <P>As the negotiations progress I intend to work closely with my ministerial colleagues at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, who will be representing Ireland at the impending ministerial meeting on the round.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of the concerns of Compassion in World Farming. The position is that the Council of Ministers for Agriculture recently resolved as follows: &ldquo;that the Council and the Commission, stressing the need to ensure equal conditions of competition between European Union and third-country producers, considered that international acknowledgement of animal welfare rules must be one of the key points of the negotiating brief for the WTO Millennium Round.&rdquo;  This is a significant development and I fully support it. The EU Commission is the appropriate agency to promote recognition of animal welfare as a trading issue at the WTO level. It is in the best interests of the animal, the producer and indeed the consumer that there be a harmonised, worldwide <Col N="258" /> standard of animal welfare. It should be mentioned in this context that Council Directive 98/58/EC dealing with the protection of animals kept for farming purposes requires the Commission to submit a report on the following matters: the comparison between animal welfare provisions in the Community and in non-member countries which supply the Community; the scope for obtaining wider international acceptance of the welfare principles laid down in this directive, and the extent to which Community objectives in relation to animal welfare may be liable to be undermined as a result of competition from non-member countries which do not apply equivalent standards.</P>

      <P>On his 1999 area aid application, the above-named claimed a total area of 15.68 hectares. However, the sum of the individual land parcels claimed amounted to 15.42 hectares. This has been treated as an obvious error and accordingly, his total claim has been adjusted downwards to 15.42 hectares. A penalty was not imposed in these circumstances. However, the above-named submitted his area aid application after the 23 April 1999 closing date. The application was received on the 11 May 1999. Under EU regulations, penalties apply to late applications. The penalty applicable in this case is 11 per cent reduction on any aid payable.</P>

It is however a matter for the applicants themselves to ensure that their area aid applications are submitted in time to meet the closing date.

      <P>No application is required for extensification premium but if the stocking density on the holding is less than 1.4 livestock units (Lus) per hectare (Ha) extensification premium is automatically paid on animals paid under the suckler cow and special beef premium applications.</P>
      <P>The person named applied for, and was paid 1998 special beef premium on one animal underthe ten month scheme, that is, 0.6LU, and 19 animals under the 22 month scheme. Some 18 of these were over two years and one was under two years, that is, 18.6 Lus. He also applied for and was paid on 40 ewes under the 1998 ewe premium scheme each equivalent to 15LU, that is, 6 Lus. No application was received for 1998 suckler cow premium. He also declared an area of 17.56 hectares on his 1998 area aid application. Extensification premium is calculated by dividing the total livestock units, that is, 25.2, by the hectares declared on the area aid application &ndash; 17.56.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions No. 301 and 305 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of DSPCA concerns in relation to penalties under the Protection of Animals Acts, 1991 and 1965. These are the principal statutes governing cruelty to all animals, domestic or wild, in this country, and they are enforced by the Garda Síochána. If any person has reason to believe that there has been an act of cruelty against any animal, the matter should be reported to the gardaí for any action which they consider appropriate. In the context of the Control of Horses Act, 1996, the penalties for cruelty under the 1911 Act were increased significantly. The penalties now are: a fine of up to £1,500 and-or six months imprisonment on summary conviction; and a fine of up to £10,000 and/or two years imprisonment on conviction on indictment. This represents a major recasting of the penalties in that there had previously been no provision for conviction on indictment. In addition to the imposition of a fine and/or a term of imprisonment, the court is empowered to deprive an owner who has been convicted of cruelty of any animal in relation to which the offence was committed.</P>
      <P>The protection afforded by the above-mentioned legislation applies to the welfare of all animals. An inter-departmental group, including my Department, is examining the keeping of dangerous or exotic animals in this country. EU Council Directive (1999/22/EC) relating to the keeping of wild animals in zoos, and which falls within the remit of the Department of the Environment and Local Government, was adopted in March of this year.</P>

      <P>Applications under REPS are submitted to the Department's local farm development service, FDS, office and if everything is in order following an office check the FDS district superintendent recommends payment following which 50 per cent of the first year payment is made up front to the applicant. Five per cent of applications are subjected to a detailed prepayment check including on-farm inspection. For second and subsequent years applicants are issued with an application form for payment. Payment is processed following the receipt of this application from the participant. However, 55 per cent of participants are subject to an on-farm check prior to the issue of second or subsequent payments.</P>
      <P>The target time to process a REPS applicant for payment, as set out in the Department's Customer Service Action Plan 1998-2000 is two months. The average time to process an application for first payment is less than four weeks; the processing of the 5 per cent selected for a prepayment check, naturally, takes longer. Following the receipt of applications from participants for second and subsequent payments 45 per cent are recommended for payment by the district superintendent generally within a few weeks. The remaining 55 per cent are subjected to on-farm checks which are taking an average eight weeks to do prior to going for payment.</P>
      <P>In the case of non-compliant participants there are, of course, further delays in processing.</P>
      <P>It should be acknowledged that the workload on REPS has increased significantly since its introduction in 1994, summarised as follows:</P>

      <P>Extensification premium is paid on all animals paid under the suckler cow and special beef premium schemes if the stocking density on the holding is less than 1.4 livestock units per hectare. As the person named had no entitlement to payment under the suckler cow or special beef premium scheme he has therefore no entitlement to 1998 extensification premium payments.</P>

      <P>Under the relevant EU legislation, only those veterinary medicines containing approved active substances may be administered to food-producing animals with effect from 1 January 2000. This legislation applies not just to horses, but to all animal species defined as food producing under EU legislation. There is concern both in Ireland and in other EU member states about the absence of a full range of treatments arising from the application of this legislation.</P>
      <P>Ireland has been actively seeking a solution to this problem at EU level and in the absence earlier this year of a proposal from the European Commission, my Department formulated a specific solution aimed at horses. This proposal was designed to ensure that the most up to date approved treatments would continue to be available for horses through the application, where necessary, of a lengthy period of exclusion from the food chain to safeguard human health. Despite the fact that our specific proposal was not adopted, the European Commission has now formally committed itself to bring forward proposals to address this difficulty. I have been in touch with the relevant Commissioners to impress on them the urgency of bringing forward such proposals and the importance to the horse industry in Ireland, as indeed elsewhere in the EU, of continuing to have access to a full range of treatments, with, of course, due regard to the need to protect consumers of horsemeat. My Department will continue to press the Commission to expedite this matter in order to avoid the potential specific difficulties from 1 January next referred to by the Deputy. As of now, there are some grounds for hoping that the Commission's proposals will emerge in the near future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh):</NameTxt>
      <P>A range of controls is in place across the food chain in order to ensure the safety of food products. The importation of meat products is governed by the European Union harmonised rules. The main conditions for imports are: advance notification to this Department of each consignment; the goods must be accompanied by a veterinary certificate or, in certain cases, a commercial document; the goods must come from an approved establishment, for example, a slaughterhouse, cutting plant or cool-store which has been approved by the EU Commission; and the goods are subject to inspection by officials of this Department. In addition, imported meat products and products processed in Ireland are selected for sampling on a regular basis to monitor the health status of the product. Goods detected as not being in compliance with the veterinary control checks may be detained for further examination and if necessary destroyed.</P>
      <P>Over recent years, a range of initiatives have been taken at EU and national levels to underpin food safety and to address problems that may arise from time to time. At EU level, the Commission reorganised and expanded its control and inspection services in the food, veterinary and plant health sectors. These functions are discharged by the Food and Veterinary Office which is located in Ireland. The Commission has also established various scientific and advisory committees to assist in the formulation of policies to be pursued at EU level. In addition a rapid food alert system has been put in place to provide early warning of food safety alerts to wholesalers and retailers.</P>
      <P>The Government has established the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) which has been given overall responsibility for the enforcement of legislative provisions in the area of food safety and hygiene and for the promotion of standards of good practice throughout all stages of food production, distribution and sale. Arrangements for the discharge of functions by the various agencies under contract to the authority have recently been concluded. Other initiatives, such as the introduction of the National Beef Assurance Scheme Bill, is further evidence of the Government's commitment to apply the highest food safety standards. Notwithstanding the various safeguards in place, problems of the type recently experienced with some Belgian products can arise from time to time, and it is important that there are adequate and rapid response systems in place to meet such situations.</P>
      <P>My Department maintains close liaison with the EU Commission and with other Departments and agencies, in particular the Department of Health and Children and the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, to monitor and control imports of food products.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 327 and 328 together.</P>
      <P>Poultry products are imported from other member states of the European Union and from third countries. Subject to the exporters preferred transport system, product may be exported direct to Ireland or through another member state. In any event the importation of meat products is governed by the European Union harmonised rules.</P>
      <P>The main conditions for imports are: advance notification to this Department of each consignment; the goods must be accompanied by a veterinary certificate or, in certain cases, a commercial document; the goods must come from an approved establishment, for example, a slaughterhouse, cutting plant or cold-store which has been approved by the EU Commission; and the goods are subject to inspection by officials of this Department. While imports of meat products are selected for sampling on a regular basis to monitor the health status of the product, particular imports cannot be specifically targeted for monitoring as Ireland, being a member of the European Union, is obliged under EU legislation not to disrupt the free circulation of goods within the EU. Goods detected as not being in compliance with the veterinary control checks may be detained for further examination and if necessary destroyed.</P>

However, if the holding of the person in question continues to be restricted on or after 1 November 1999 and provided, first, he makes an application under the 1999/2000 hardship scheme, and second, he meets all the eligibility criteria for the 1999/2000 hardship scheme, he may qualify for a grant payment under the arrangements for that hardship scheme.</P>

      <P>For the purposes of the additional payment for pedigree female animals under the TB and brucellosis eradication schemes grant arrangements, the animal itself must be entered into the main section of the herd book but its dam can be entered in a supplementary or grading up section of the herd book. The sire of the animal and all its male ancestry must be entered in the main section of the herd book. This requirement has applied since 1 November 1994 to the application of additional pedigree payments under the TB and brucellosis eradication scheme grant arrangements.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the poor prices paid for heifers in September 1999 and to complaints regarding the grading of heifers at some of the factories during September 1999 (details supplied); if he has satisfied himself that the seller of this animal did not receive payment until some eight days after the date of slaughter, which prevented the vendor exercising his right of appeal; if the mechanical grading sys tem will be introduced as a matter of urgency; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>While cattle prices are supported through the EU beef regime, they are ultimately determined by market forces. As far as heifers are concerned, factory prices are currently slightly higher than at this time last year.</P>
      <P>With regard to the case referred to by the Deputy, the animal in question was correctly classified as a heifer. However, it was also certified as a reactor by the veterinary inspectorate at the plant. The animal was slaughtered on 6 September and the owner was paid the price quoted by the meat plant for reactor heifers for that week. I understand that, in the case of this plant, payment is made directly to the producer where the producer is present on the day of slaughter or visits the plant subsequently. Otherwise, payment is issued through the post one week after slaughter.</P>
      <P>As far as the introduction of mechanical classification is concerned, I would like this technology be introduced into the Irish beef industry as soon as possible. However, there is no such system available at this stage which has the approval of the European Commission. In order to secure progress on this front, my Department, in conjunction with Teagasc, has recently supervised a large scale trial of three objective classification systems in Dawn Meats, Midleton. I am looking forward to the results of this trial, which should be available in January 2000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh):</NameTxt>
      <P>The general market weakness in the pigmeat sector in the EU and in Ireland last year was exacerbated in the Border regions by a reduction in slaughter capacity due to a fire at a pigmeat plant in Northern Ireland. The reopening of a plant in County Cavan in October last, together with EU export status being awarded to two slaughtering plants in County Meath and in County Westmeath along with overtime and weekend slaughtering at the plants helped alleviate the situation in relation to slaughtering capacity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The wider market weakness was addressed at EU level by means of increased export refunds, an EU funded private storage scheme and a substantial food aid package for Russia which <Col N="286" /> included 100,000 tonnes of EU pigmeat. Pigmeat prices have increased by over 23 per cent since the beginning of the year. The indications are that producer prices should continue to increase as supplies are expected to tighten in the final quarter of the year.</P>
    <P>The case for financial aid to producers, as referred to by the Deputy, has been examined and cannot be justified in the present circumstances.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is taking an active leadership role in managing the Year 2000 problem. Through directives to the civil and public service and a major business awareness campaign for the private sector, the Government has ensured that the Year 2000 problem is being treated with top priority and the utmost urgency. In the public sector, it has adopted a three-stranded approach to the Year 2000 problem, i.e., remedy the problem in computer systems, infrastructures, equipment, plant and information exchanges; prepare business continuity and contingency plans for all business-critical operations; and co-ordinate emergency management arrangements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Civil Service has been working on the Year 2000 problem since 1996. Each Department and office has a comprehensive Year 2000 compliance programme in place which is overseen by a monitoring committee chaired by a senior manager. These committees, in turn, report to the interdepartmental Year 2000 monitoring committee, which was established by the Government in 1997 to oversee the achievement of Year 2000 compliance in IT systems and other office equipment and plant in the Civil Service. This committee is chaired by my Department and comprises both civil servants and non civil servants. The committee levies status updates on each Department/office; seeks self-assessments of Year 2000 programmes from accounting officers and chairpersons of departmental Y2K monitoring committees; and interviews Y2K programme managers on their work programmes. Based on <Col N="287" /> this process, the committee reports every two months to me and the Government on the progress being achieved &ndash; these reports will be monthly from now until the end of the year. The committee has reported on ten occasions to date. At this stage 27 of the 33 Departments and offices have completed all business-critical projects.</P>
    <P>Departments and offices are individually responsible for ensuring that public bodies operating under their aegis achieve Year 2000 compliance in good time and, on the instructions of the Government, each has set up a monitoring committee &ndash; again chaired by a senior manager &ndash; to oversee the implementation of Year 2000 compliance programmes in these bodies. These committees report to their senior management and Minister regularly on the progress being made by the public bodies. Five Departments (Education and Science; Environment and Local Government; Health and Children; Justice, Equality and Law Reform; and Public Enterprise) have been reporting, through their Minister, on progress in these sectors to Government every two months since mid-1998. Quite a number of public bodies have completed their Year 2000 compliance programmes. All others are satisfied that they will achieve full compliance in good time.</P>
    <P>In addition to normal IT budgets, the Government made provision for the expenditure of an extra IR£12.8 million in central departments and offices over 1998 and 1999 to address the problem. In some cases, planned IT projects were deferred and the staffing resources and administrative budgets established for these projects were diverted to facilitate Year 2000 remedial work. I also announced in last year's budget a IR£40 million contingency fund to deal with problems that may arise with embedded technologies in systems and equipment in the public sector.</P>
    <P>With the agreement of the unions, the Government introduced once-off, exceptional measures to help retain skilled IT staff on Year 2000 work until it is completed.</P>
    <P>On the instructions of Government, all Departments, offices and public sector bodies are completing Year 2000 business contingency and staff cover plans to deal with any contingencies which may arise before, during, or after the millennium changeover period. These plans are being subjected to independent audit. In the remaining time, Departments, offices, and public bodies will concentrate on training and familiarising staff, completing preparations, and testing/rehearsing/ refining their contingency plans.</P>
    <P>The Government has made it clear that private sector companies are also individually responsible for ensuring that they achieve compliance in good time. To this end, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, on the approval of Government, conducted a comprehensive business awareness campaign to raise awareness of the problem and provide guidance on solving it to the private sector. In that regard it established <Col N="288" /> a Year 2000 campaign committee, chaired by Deputy Noel Treacy, Minister of State with responsibility for Science, Technology and Commerce and enlisted representatives from a wide range of businesses and business development agencies. To date, this committee has produced a comprehensive guidance brochure (covering planning, remedial work, testing, contingency, director liability, insurance exclusion clauses, audit disclosure requirements and credit requirements) which was issued to approximately 150,000 businesses through various channels; held regional information seminars and a national conference addressed by Year 2000 experts; sponsored an ongoing data gathering project conducted by the Irish Computer Society on the state of readiness of Irish business for the Year 2000; and instructed the national enterprise development agencies &ndash; Forbairt/Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, Shannon Development, Údarás na Gaeltachta &ndash; to ensure that all their clients, both indigenous and international, are Year 2000 compliant. In addition, Enterprise Ireland has established a Y2K information service, comprising a helpline, information packs, an Internet website, and training workshops, and has launched advertising campaigns on radio and television.</P>
    <P>The Government has established the national Year 2000 emergencies co-ordination committee to oversee and co-ordinate the Year 2000 contingency preparations and emergency management arrangements of the key national utility, infrastructure, health, security, financial and business sectors so as to mitigate potential disruptions to the economy and society in the event of problems arising from Year 2000 computer-related incidents and millennium celebrations. This committee, which I chair, includes representatives from the business and financial sectors and Government Departments including those with responsibility for key utilities, transport, health and security. It will liaise with similar committees/forums in other countries and with the interdepartmental advisory committee on major emergencies.</P>
    <P>The Government is keen to ensure that international and cross-Border issues are dealt with. In this regard, various Departments have participated fully in international surveys conducted, for example, by the United Nations, European Union, OECD, and Global 2000 Co-ordinating Group. In addition, Government officials attend meetings and seminars organised by these bodies.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied with the progress achieved and, as a result of the efforts set out above and the work completed to date, Ireland is rated at the best state of readiness by, among others, the LTN, EU, OECD, and Global 2000 Co-ordinating Group.</P>
    <P>The Government maintains a Year 2000 Intemet website at www.irlgov.ie.ly2k which provides details on the programmes in place in the civil and public service and on the initiatives undertaken for the private sector.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 364 and 408 together.</P>
      <P>I would point out that as regards PRSI charges on pensions, the Deputy's question appears to refer to the health levy, as occupational pensions are not liable to PRSI. The health levy is charged at a rate of 2 per cent on a person's total income from all sources with only a few exceptions, e.g, social welfare payments. However, the 1994 budget introduced a low income exemption threshold for the levies of £173 per week or £9,000 per annum which means that where a person's reckonable income is lower than the threshold they are not liable to the levies. However, when a person's income rises above the threshold the levies are payable on the person's total income. Following this year's budget the threshold is now £940 per month or £11,250 per annum. The current threshold ensures that most pensioners on low incomes are exempt from the levies.</P>
      <P>In the 1999 budget I introduced significant restructuring of the levy system. The employment and training levy was abolished and the health levy was increased to 2 per cent which resulted in a reduction of 0.25 per cent in the combined levy charge from the previous tax year. These changes took effect on 6 April this year. The current arrangements in respect of the health levy are more favourable to many pensioners than most taxpayers because the levy is not applicable to their social welfare pension. The total income of medical card holders and recipients of social welfare survivor's and widow's pensions, lone parent's allowance and deserted wife's benefit/ allowance are exempt from the levies.</P>
      <P>After a pension increase, the monthly income of the pensioner referred to by the Deputy increased to a level above the threshold whereby she became liable to pay the health levy. However, if her annual income remains below the threshold of £11,250 for the current tax year, she may be liable for a refund of any levies paid throughout the tax year. If this is the case she should then forward a copy of her P60 to the Collector-General's Office, PRG Section, Floor 5, Sarsfield House, Francis Street, Limerick.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The levies threshold was introduced in order to focus assistance towards those on low incomes. The Government was aware of the &ldquo;step&rdquo; that exists at the levies threshold when the threshold was introduced, however, it is considered that <Col N="291" /> having a marginal relief system would introduce an unacceptable level of additional complexity into the levies/PRSI system. It is sometimes also proposed that the levies should apply only to that portion of a person's income over the £948 per month &ndash; £11,250 per annum &ndash; threshold. Such a measure would be costly to implement as it would benefit everyone.</P>
    <P>While there are no proposals to abolish the levy, I can confirm that the position generally, including the level of the threshold, will continue to be reviewed, as are all other taxes or levies in the context of the annual budget.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the Deputy is referring to the employment status of building and construction workers who are self-employed under the C45 system but who wish to pay tax and PRSI as employees.</P>
      <P>Persons employed in the construction industry are classified for tax purposes as employees or as sub-contractors and tax is deducted from each group on a different basis. Sub-contracting itself is, of course, an integral part of the construction industry. Payments to sub-contractors come within the relevant contracts tax (RCT) system &ndash; commonly referred to as the C2 or C45 system. Under this system, where a principal contractor makes a payment to an unregistered contractor, he or she is required to deduct relevant contracts tax from those payments at the rate of 35 per cent. RCT was introduced in the 1970s to counter the growing incidence of black economy activity in the construction industry. Workers operating under the system known as &ldquo;the lump&rdquo; were being paid without tax being deducted. The Revenue Commissioners have confirmed that RCT continues to play a vital role in combating tax evasion in the construction industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The employment status of building and construction workers is primarily a matter of fact and law for the individuals involved. Following a comprehensive review in 1995-96, Revenue issued guidelines to the industry setting out the criteria under which a person may be regarded as an employee as distinct from a sub-contractor. Principal contractors and sub-contractors creating self-employment contractual arrangements must sign a declaration to the effect that these guidelines have been considered by them and they are both satisfied that the contract created is a contract of self-employment. The joint declaration was introduced in line with a recommendation of a sub-committee of the black economy monitoring group which looked at the construction indus<Col N="292" /> try. Its members are drawn from the CIF and ICTU as well as the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. Both parties to the declaration certify that they have considered the guidelines issued by the Revenue Commissioners as to the difference between contracts of service (employment contracts) and contracts for services (self-employment) and are satisfied that the contract which they are about to enter is a contract for services.</P>
    <P>Any member of the construction industry subgroup of the black economy monitoring group who feels that there are black economy issues relating to the industry which need to be brought to the attention of Revenue and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs is free to call for a meeting of this sub-group. It almost goes without saying that in its ongoing drive to identify the correct basis of deduction of tax in respect of each individual, Revenue is happy to receive information from other organisations or individuals. In this context, for example, facilities have been made available to trade unions representatives to report any cases where they consider that PAYE should have applied instead of RCT.</P>
    <P>In October 1997, a project commenced to check whether persons who were registered as self-employed sub-contractors were in fact correctly registered or whether, instead, they should pay tax and PRSI through the PAYE/PRSI system. In total 6,420 visits were carried out, 6,040 of which were in 1998. The tax registration status of over 63,000 sub-contractors was reviewed and it was found that about 12,000 should have been treated as employees rather than self employed sub-contractors. Corrective measures were taken as necessary and these taxpayers will continue to be monitored in future years as part of the normal audit programme.</P>

      <P>Firstly, I would point out that in the 1999 budget announced last December I announced a significant restructuring of the levies. The employment and training levy of 1 per cent was abolished and the health contribution levy was increased from 1.25 per cent to 2 per cent which resulted in a reduction from 2.25 per cent to 2 per cent in the combined levy charge. The threshold under which there is no liability to pay the levy was also increased from £10,750 to £11,250. These changes took effect from 6 April this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The health levy is charged at a rate of 2 per <Col N="293" /> cent on a person's total income from all sources with only a few exceptions, e.g. social welfare payments. However, the 1994 budget introduced a low income exemption threshold for the levies of £173 per week or £9,000 per annum which means that where a person's reckonable income is lower than the threshold they are not liable to the levies. However, when a person's income rises above the threshold the levies are payable on the person's total income. Following this year's budget the threshold is now £940 per month or £11,250 per annum. The current threshold ensures that most pensioners on low incomes are exempt from the levies.</P>

      <P>However, I would like to refer Deputies to the brief debate on these appointments which took place on foot of my reply to a question from Deputy Séan Ryan on 24 June 1999.</P>
      <P>In reply to a supplementary question from Deputy Derek McDowell, I may have given the impression that lead brokers had not been appointed. The position is that lead brokerage services are to be provided by financial advisers whom I have appointed, but that the underwriting contract has not been agreed with them and will only be concluded closer to the date of flotation.</P>
      <P>Deputies may wish to note that I wrote to Deputy McDowell on 29 June 1999 advising him of the position.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the inspector of taxes has examined the taxpayer's application for a C2 certificate. The application was refused because the taxpayer does not satisfy all the conditions specified in section 531(11) of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, which governs the issue of C2 certificates.</P>
      <P>The legislation specifies, among other things, that the applicant must satisfy the Revenue Commissioners that his/her &ldquo;..businesses is or will be carried on from a fixed place of business established in a permanent building and has or will have such equipment, stock and other facilities as in the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners are required for the purpose of the business..&rdquo;. The taxpayer has been requested to provide documentation in support of his claim that he meets this requirement. The documentation which he has provided to date has not satisfied the inspector that the taxpayer has a fixed place of business as required by section 531(11).</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that it is open to the taxpayer to appeal the decision to refuse his application for a C2 certificate to the Appeal Commissioners.</P>

The group's report was finalised on 19 May 1999 and submitted to myself and the Tánaiste on the following day. The report, which contains a considerable number of recommendations, was published on 23 June 1999 at which time I asked that interested parties make their views known so that as much public debate as possible on this issue can take place. I can assure the Deputy that I will bear in mind all the points raised during this process in my deliberations on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is conscious of the difficulties which can arise for cohabiting couples in certain circumstances and, because of this, an interdepartmental working group was set up under the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs to examine the treatment of married, cohabiting and one-parent households under the tax and social welfare codes. This group has recently published its report and was, as a whole, sympathetic in principle, to changes in tax legislation to address certain issues relating to cohabiting couples. In this regard the report of the group outlines a number of options relating to cohabiting couples for the Government to consider in the context of the forthcoming budget 2000 deliberations.</P>
      <P>On the specific issue of the treatment of cohabiting couples within the capital acquisitions tax code, I indicated to the Dáil, earlier in the year in the course of the Finance Bill debate, that I appreciate the concerns which have been raised. I am aware of the tax burden facing certain individuals, particularly on the inheritance of the family home. At that stage, I undertook in the Dáil that prior to the next budget, I would examine the capital acquisitions tax code in some detail. This examination is currently taking place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The forecasted yield for 1999 from inheritance <Col N="296" /> tax alone is about £83 million. This revenue greatly assists the Government's programme and helps achieve the ongoing goal of reducing the tax take on employment incomes. For this reason, any significant changes to the tax must be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 375, 381, 396 and 398 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the major problems faced by the most heavily indebted poor countries and of the extent to which their indebtedness has inhibited their growth and the development of their social sectors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am also aware that, important as it is, debt <Col N="298" /> relief is one element in the overall strategy required to help these countries break out of their current condition. Irrespective of the degree of debt relief, donor countries must be prevailed on to continue to provide assistance and the multilateral agencies will need to co-ordinate with donors, governments and wider civic society in ensuring that development strategies are geared toward social development and poverty reduction as well as economic growth.</P>
    <P>As far as the debt is concerned, Deputies will be aware of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative &ndash; HIPC &ndash; in which the lead is being taken by the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. The aim of this initiative is to give the HIPC countries the possibility to exit from the burden of their current unpayable debt. Ireland has been a consistent supporter of this initiative, and the passage of the Bretton Woods (Amendment) Act earlier this year provided for a contribution by Ireland of £15 million to the World Bank and IMF's HIPC trust funds.</P>
    <P>Deputies will also be aware of the criticisms levelled at the HIPC Initiative by those who believe that it offers too little relief, to too few countries and with excessively restrictive conditions.</P>
    <P>I share some of these reservations, and the Irish Government has been to the fore in urging the deepening and widening of HIPC, and for the alteration of its provisions so that greater debt relief is made available much more rapidly to the most heavily indebted poor countries. Ireland is also in favour of taking human development indicators into account in establishing eligibility for relief.</P>
    <P>Following the recent review of the HIPC Initiative by the World Bank &ndash; to which my Department made submissions &ndash; the terms of the initiative are to be considerably enhanced.</P>
    <P>While it still falls short of what we would like, I think it is important, at this stage, to ensure it is adequately financed so that it can be implemented.</P>
    <P>At the annual meetings of the IMF and World Bank, I shall be urging further extension of the terms of the initiative, as well as increased attention to the connection between the debt relief process and poverty alleviation.</P>
    <P>My principal concern, at this point, however, will be to urge the contributor nations &ndash; and the Bank and Fund themselves &ndash;  to take the necessary steps to ensure that the enhanced HIPC Initiative receives the funding necessary to allow the promised level of debt relief to be realised.</P>

    <P>1.Prior to the introduction of VAT on 1 November 1972 tobacco was subject to turnover tax and this is reflected in the total tax figures shown in the table for 1969.</P>
    <P>2.The old pre-decimal currency which applied in 1969 has been converted in these figures so as to facilitate direct comparison with the later years.</P>
    <P>3.In 1969 the excise duty charged on cigarettes was based on the actual tobacco content. The duty chargeable at that time on plain and tipped cigarettes reflected their varying tobacco content. For the later years, duty is comprised of a specific amount per thousand cigarettes together with a percentage of the retail price. This price is based on the &ldquo;Most Popular Price Category&rdquo; i.e. the price at which the highest number of standard sized tipped cigarettes are sold in any year.</P>
    <P>The total tax shown for the later years of course also includes VAT.</P>

      <P>Plans for the new offices for the European Union Food and Veterinary Office at Grange, County Meath were first sent to the European Commission in June 1996. Following reconsideration of the organisational structure of the proposed office by the Commission, the scheme was amended, at the Commission's request, to incorporate a significant extension and, at the conclusion of this process, revised plans were forwarded to the Commission in July 1998 for approval. A further extended process to finalise the complex legal documentation in response to the Commission's contractual <Col N="301" /> requirements culminated in the legal documentation being forwarded by the Chief State Solicitor to the solicitors for the Commission on 8 July 1999 for execution. Due to the complicated nature of the transaction, the legal documents have continued to be the subject of many technical legal queries from the Commission.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that prior to the Finance No. 2 Act, 1998, the data was not broken down so as to distinguish between sales of residential property and sales of other property. However, data on the amount of stamp duty collected in respect of transfers and leases of all property is available.</P>
      <P>The yield from stamp duty for the transfer and lease of all property is as follows: 1996, £194.3 million; 1987, £254.3 million; and 1998, £304.9 million.</P>
      <P>In the past, Revenue have tentatively estimated that of the order of 60 per cent of this yield came from transfers and leases of residential property. However, since the changes in the stamp duty code in April 1998, in response to the recommendations of the first Bacon report, it will, in the future, be possible to identify what amount of total yield derives from the transfer and lease of residential property.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>In the balance sheet of the Central Bank of Ireland, the bank's total assets have a counterpart in liabilities. The liabilities side includes deposits, by credit institutions and Government, legal tender notes and the bank's capital. However, it also includes the bank's accounting reserves, which have been accumulated by the bank over the years from income earned from its operations. As of the end of July, the latest date for which published figures are available, the accounting reserves stood at EUR1,999 million.</P>
      <P>The value of these accounting reserves may fluctuate, depending on changes in the value of the reserve assets held by the Central Bank of Ireland. The bank's accounting reserves consist of the superannuation, currency and general reserves. The appropriate level of the accounting reserves is a prudential matter. The accumulated accounting reserves of a central bank contribute to its credibility. For example, adverse exchange rate movements could, in the absence of a sufficient level of accounting reserves to absorb such movements, have negative consequences for the net asset position of the Central Bank of Ireland.</P>
      <P>My Department has sought the advice of the Office of the Attorney General as to the legal position of the accounting reserves of the Central Bank of Ireland. In summary, the advice is that any transfer of the accounting reserves should take place only with the agreement of the Central Bank of Ireland and, as appropriate, the European Central Bank. The Central Bank of Ireland and the ECB are the appropriate bodies to determine the level of the accounting reserves which are required for the purposes of the monetary policy of the euro-area and in order to achieve price stability. It is not my intention to act in a fashion which could undermine either the credibility of independence of the Central Bank of Ireland, and indirectly the European System of Central Banks or the credibility of the Irish Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In any case, the Central Bank's assets are in the main matched by counterpart liabilities, which as noted above include deposits by credit institutions and Government and legal tender notes. The contribution which any perceived surplus assets of the Central Bank of Ireland would make to the Exchequer should not be exaggerated. Assets of the bank earn a return which is reflected in the bank's surplus income; the Exchequer is the ultimate beneficiary of the bank's surplus. If the assets, corresponding to the accounting reserves, were used by the Exchequer for other purposes, we would be losing the bene<Col N="303" /> fit of that income. To the extent that the Central Bank of Ireland's accounting reserves would be used to reduce the national debt, the annual benefit to the Exchequer would be the difference between the cost of servicing the repaid debt and the return on the assets in the accounting reserves, i.e. in effect the margin between the interest rates for borrowing and lending.</P>
    <P>Corresponding to the bank's total liabilities are its total assts. Until January 1999 these were categorised in terms of foreign currency and Irish pound assets, with the former constituting the official external reserves. As of end-1998, the official external reserve assets held by the Central Bank of Ireland totalled £6,448 million, but from the adoption of the euro, about one-third of these assets were redenominated into euro. I understand from the Central Bank that at 31 July 1999 non-euro reserve assets amounted to EUR5,173 million, while euro reserve assets, i.e. excluding advances, were in the region of EUR2,000 million.</P>
    <P>All central banks hold external reserve assets for two principal purposes &ndash; to assist in protecting the currency and to ensure that the country does not lack the foreign currency needed to pay for essential imports. With the establishment of the European Central Bank and the adoption of the single currency, it is the euro-area as a whole rather than individual participating member states, such as Ireland, which need such external reserve assets. This derives from the Statute of the European System of Central Banks which states that one of the basic tasks of the system is to hold and manage the official reserves of member states. The ECB is empowered under its Statute to call up, from participating national central banks, up to EUR50,000 million in external reserve assets &ndash; that is, assets in currencies other than the euro. In addition, under the EU Treaty further calls of external assets may be effected by the ECB. Each national central bank's contribution is in proportion to its shareholding in the ECB which, in turn, is in proportion to each member state's shares of the euro-area's GDP and population.</P>
    <P>On 4 January 1999, the Central Bank of Ireland transferred EUR425 million &ndash; £334.7 million &ndash; to the external reserve assets of the ECB, which is Ireland's share of the ECB's pooled external reserve assets, in return for a claim on the ECB. This contribution represented about 1 per cent of total ECB external reserve assets. These assets continue to be managed by the Central Bank of Ireland on behalf of the ECB. The amount transferred represented about 5 per cent of the Central Bank's total external reserve assets at end-December 1998. The Central Bank of Ireland also subscribed EUR41.92 million, or £33 million, to the share capital of the ECB in accordance with the Statute of the ESCB. It should be noted that both the claim on the ECB and the capital shareholding will earn income for the Central Bank of Ireland and thus indirectly for the Exchequer, as <Col N="304" /> the participating national central banks will share the profits of the ECB among themselves.</P>
    <P>It cannot yet be assessed with certainty what will happen to the balance sheet of the Central Bank of Ireland at this early stage of the single currency. The Central Bank of Ireland will continue to need its own external reserve assets, as well as those provided to the ECB, in order to play its part as a member of the ESCB. The aggregate of the national central banks' non-euro reserve assets plus the pooled assets transferred to the ECB comprises the external reserve assets of the ESCB. The remaining external reserve assets on the Central Bank of Ireland's balance sheet continue as heretofore to be managed by the Central Bank of Ireland in accordance with risk parameters and benchmarks set by the Board of the Central Bank of Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 385 and 403 together.</P>
      <P>A flood relief plan for Kilkenny city has been developed by the Office of Public Works. All such plans are guided by the wishes of the local authority and affected landowners. A plan meeting the wishes of those interested parties was completed in Office of Public Works and put on public exhibition on 30 June to 30 July 1999 in accordance with the arterial drainage Acts 1945 and 1995. As a result of this exhibition a number of matters remain to be clarified and this process is in hand. I hope to have the scheme confirmed by the end of this year.</P>
      <P>Before the scheme can reach works stage it will be necessary to design in detail the precise works to be carried out so that suitable contractors may be appointed to execute the scheme. This will involve the commissioning of consulting engineers to complete the detail design and the Office of Public Works has placed advertisements in the national newspapers and the EU Journal for this purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not practicable at this stage to segregate individual areas for priority treatment. However, <Col N="305" /> depending on the final design details, areas such as John's Quay could be identified for priority consideration at the works stage if such a phased implementation is acceptable to Kilkenny Corporation and Kilkenny County Council and does not adversely affect other areas of the city on the implementation of other parts of the works.</P>
    <P>As the proposed Kilkenny city scheme will not affect the river flow regime for Thomastown, any questions of relating the flooding problems in that area to the Kilkenny city scheme would not be warranted. The flooding problems there fall to be investigated as a separate localised flood relief scheme. In view of the existing commitments, the Office of Public Works has no proposals to consider the flooding problems at Thomastown.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that a certificate of tax-free allowances in respect of the current tax year, 1999/2000, issued to the taxpayer on 22 February 1999. After that certificate issued, the inspector of taxes became aware that the taxpayer has been in receipt of a lone parent's allowance from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. The lone parent's allowance is taxable but, as the inspector had not been informed that the taxpayer was receiving the allowance, no adjustment had been made to her tax-free allowances and underpayments have arisen as a consequence. A revised certificate of tax-free allowances issued, on a week-one basis to minimise hardship, on 16 June 1999. The allowances on the revised certificate have been reduced so as to collect the amount of income tax <Col N="306" /> due on the taxpayer's lone parent's allowance in the current tax year.</P>
      <P>A review of the taxpayer's returns of income for 1995-6, 1997-8 and 1998-9 show underpayments amounting to £1,890.20. This amount is to be collected by reducing the taxpayer's tax-free allowances over a three year period commencing on 5 April 2000.</P>
      <P>In a letter dated 15 September 1999, the inspector requested the taxpayer to furnish documentation in respect of the years 1994-5 and 1996-7. When the requested documentation is received, the inspector will finalise his review of the taxpayer's income tax liability for those years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is referring to the special capital allowances scheme for hotels in the seven counties of the north and north-west of the country. The scheme operates by enabling passive individual investors in hotels of three star standard and upward to fully offset capital allowances on these hotels against all income i.e. non-rental income as well as rental income. There is no annual ceiling of £25,000 for non-rental income for the capital allowances for such purposes, i.e. the full amount of the capital allowances in question is offsettable in each year against non-rental income in the case of passive individual investors in these hotels. A £25,000 annual ceiling for capital allowance purposes against non-rental income applies in the case of passive individual investors in other buildings. However, in the case of hotel investment by passive individual investors in other parts of the country, the capital allowances are totally ringfenced, i.e. available for offset against rental income only.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this scheme is to promote investment in the provision of quality hotel accommodation in the north and north-west. Accordingly, the scheme does not apply to holiday cottages and I have no plans to extend the scheme to such developments.</P>
      <P>Capital allowances are available for investment in Bord Fáilte registered holiday cottages in all areas of the country, but these allowances are totally ringfenced to rental income in all cases. As far as non-registered holiday cottages are concerned, capital allowances are available only within areas designated under the seaside resort scheme and again such allowances are totally ringfenced to rental income.</P>

      <P>The Government recently received the report of the interdepartmental committee on child care. The issues involved are very complex and are being studied. Proposals in this major area are being examined in the context of the forthcoming budget.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the tax burden facing certain individuals, particularly on the inheritance of the family home where they have been residing. I would remind the Deputy of what I said in this House earlier this year during this year's Finance Bill debate. At that stage, I undertook that prior to the next budget, I would examine the capital acquisitions tax code in some detail. This examination is currently taking place.</P>
      <P>The forecasted yield for 1999 from inheritance tax alone is about £83 million. This revenue greatly assists the Government's programme and helps achieve the ongoing goal of reducing the tax take on employment incomes. For this reason, any significant changes to the tax must be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that this question arises from the importation of two Mercedes vehicles by the husband of the person (details supplied) in 1990. Relief from Motor Vehicle Excise Duty, which was payable at that time, and Value Added Tax was sought under the transfer of residence provisions. This relief was refused in respect of one of the vehicles because certain fundamental requirements for the relief were not shown to be met.</P>
      <P>This refusal was reviewed in full in the course of the preparation of a report on the case to the Ombudsman in 1991. The case was subsequently reviewed in 1995 following representations on behalf of the person. It was also discussed with the person on a number of occasions at that time. The case was again the subject of prolonged and detailed consideration at the highest level by the Revenue Commissioners in 1997, in response to further representations in the matter.</P>
      <P>In the course of the various examinations of this case that have been carried out over the years, no evidence has been discovered and no new evidence has been provided to show that the initial refusal of the application was incorrect.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Revenue Commissioners have again re-examined the papers in this case and remain satisfied that the initial refusal of the relief sought was correct.</P>

      <P>The person named was in receipt of a pension from the Office of the Paymaster General.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Paymaster General's office becomes aware of the death of a pensioner, it is the practice to cancel any payable orders to that pensioner that have not been cashed because, first, only the payee is entitled to cash a payable order and, second, the right to the pension ceases on the person's death. The pension balance is payable to the legal personal representative of the deceased on production of probate-grant of administration. Where probate-grant is not being extracted the balance may be finalised by statu<Col N="311" /> tory declaration under section 8 of the Superannuation Act, 1887.</P>
    <P>In the particular case in question, the pensioner died on 22 May 1999. The pension payable order for 27 May was cancelled. Pensions are paid fortnightly in arrears, so that payable order related to the period 14 to 27 May. The pension balance for 14 to 22 May is accordingly due to the estate. A letter and application form for the balance of pension issued to the pensioner's son. The returned form indicated that his late mother made a will and probate was being extracted.</P>
    <P>As soon as the grant of probate is received in the Office of the Paymaster General the balance of pension will be paid.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>The stamp duty yield statistics available do not distinguish between first time buyers and other buyers. There is no stamp duty on the sale of new houses to owner occupiers except where the house is over 125 square metres. In the case of the latter category, the stamp duty is payable only on the site cost or a quarter of the value of the house, whichever is the greater. In the case of secondhand houses, the Revenue Commissioners have estimated that the cost to the Exchequer of eliminating stamp duty for first time buyers of secondhand houses would be of the order of £50 million or more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Stamp duty rates for residential property were reduced significantly by the Government as part of the package of taxation measures in the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1998, arising out of the Bacon <Col N="312" /> report on house prices. This reduction in stamp duty rates has been of benefit to all house purchasers, including first time buyers of secondhand houses.</P>
    <P>The Bacon report considered that reductions in stamp duty on all residential property would lead to additional turnover in the secondhand house market thus increasing the range of housing available to first-time buyers. Reducing stamp duty on residential property in this way has made the secondhand house market more accessible for first-time purchasers. At that time the introduction of a specific exemption or relief for first-time buyers was considered. However, given the significant estimated costs involved, any specific exemption for first-time buyers would have prevented a reduction in the rates for residential property generally.</P>
    <P>For these reasons the Government considered that reductions in the stamp duty rates applicable to all residential property, as recommended in the Bacon report, would be more beneficial to first-time buyers and the housing market in general than a specific total exemption aimed at first-time buyers only.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have said before, there are a number of criteria for the selection of potential PPP projects, including: the economic case for the project; the impact, if any, on the general Government balance; the cost effectiveness of any private funding; efficiency gains which private sector involvement could secure; the potential to generate revenue; legal and regulatory aspects and possible supply constraints in the economy.</P>
      <P>The key criteria are that any PPP project be a national priority and that it show value for money over the lifetime of the project. In relation to the first criterion, whether any particular proposal for investment in infrastructure is a national priority will depend on how that proposal advances national policy in the sector in question. The question of priority will also depend on other issues such as the economic case for the project. Essentially, the first key criterion is whether a project is worth pursuing in itself, irrespective of the route adopted &ndash; particularly if public money will be required for the project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Moving onto the second key criterion, the question is essentially whether the PPP route is the appropriate one to take &ndash; whether a PPP <Col N="313" /> approach can deliver value for money for the public sector over the lifetime of the project. An assessment of the cost effectiveness and value for money over the lifetime of the project, which would facilitate comparison with other mechanisms, including conventional capital expenditure, is an important part of the evaluation process for PPP projects.</P>
    <P>Ensuring as competitive a procurement process as possible is central to delivering the objective of value for money. In terms of the procurement process, all public projects, including PPP projects, are in any case subject to EU public pro<Col N="314" /> curement rules and the general requirements fairness, competition and transparency.</P>

      <P>The areas identified in the flood study report for south Galway for further investigation have now been examined in detail. However, as there are no cost beneficial solutions to the problems in those areas, no works can be proposed. In accordance with the further recommendations of the report, the Office of Public Works has set up a post-study monitoring programme to examine the water levels at various locations in the area and this study will be done over a three year period. The local authority will be kept informed of any results from this process, as many of the long-terms solutions to the flooding problems may well be within their remit.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 410, 412, 415, 417, 418 and 419 together.</P>
      <P>Officials of my Department have been in consultation with the Department of Finance and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment on future funding arrangements for rehabilitative, i.e. non-vocational, and vocational training for people with a disability.</P>
      <P>Discussions on the next operational programme and its measures are ongoing between relevant Government Departments and the European Commission. Similarly, negotiations on the national development plan &ndash; NDP &ndash; have yet to be completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="317" /> The backdrop to the interdepartmental discussions related to the disability sector is the planned change in institutional responsibilities for services for people with a disability set out in the report 'Building a Future Together'. The relevant recommendation which is being acted upon is that responsibility for vocational training for people with a disability will be mainstreamed at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. That Department is also the lead Department for the current human resources development operational programme and is spearheading the discussions on the next operational programme and the national action plan, NAP, for employment.</P>
    <P>Officials of my Department and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment have been anxious to ensure that the NDP and the NAP satisfactorily provide the emphasis necessary to maintain, at a minimum, the current level of vocational training for people with a disability and that, where possible, additional supports will be made available for the years 2000 to 2006. This is against a background where reduced funding will be available from EU sources and priorities for expenditure will be solidly linked to the objectives of the NAP. Future details of vocational training supports for people with a disability in the next operational programme, when they become clear, should be available from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the valued work carried out by the National Training and Development Institute and by the other organisations in the Not for Profit Business Association which provide services for people with a disability. The establishment of new responsibilities and arrangements for vocational training will have regard to the expertise of such organisations.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 411, 461, 474 and 478 together.</P>
      <P>The Health Research Board &ndash; HRB &ndash; is the statutory body with responsibility for health research in Ireland.  Its functions are to promote, assist, commission or conduct medical, health and health services research and such epidemiological research as may appropriately be carried out at national level, to assist and support other health agencies in promoting or conducting epidemiological research and to liaise and co-operate with other research bodies in Ireland or elsewhere in promoting, commissioning or conducting relevant research.</P>
      <P>The HRB currently funds one large project in this area to the value of £375,000 over five years. This funding supports research at TCD, UCD and UCC. Funding commenced in October 1996. Project schemes for funding are advertised widely by the HRB. Following peer review, research project funding is granted to the projects of highest scientific merit.</P>
      <P>The research has been supported by both national and international funding agencies operating in the scientific research field and it is understood that substantial investment has been made from these sources over the last decade.</P>

      <P>This funding has been provided to develop the child care services and includes developments such as the establishment earlier this year of the social services inspectorate, whose initial function is the inspection of health board children's residential homes to ensure that the physical, emotional and psychological needs of children within these homes are being met.</P>
      <P>The publication on 21 September 1999 of &ldquo;Children First&rdquo;, the national guidelines for the protection and welfare of children and their implementation will also provide mechanisms to ensure that children within residential centres are protected from abuse.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, in accordance with a recent Government decision, my Department has commenced work on legislation that will enable the office of an ombudsman for children to be established next year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 427 and 477 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Adoption services in the South-Eastern Health Board area are provided by &ldquo;SEEK Regional <Col N="322" /> Adoption Services&rdquo; which forms part of the board's community care programme. There are 38 applicants currently on the waiting list for adoption assessment in the South-Eastern Health Board area and the waiting period varies from approximately one year in the south Tipperary area, where there are five applicants on the waiting list, to three years in the Carlow/Kilkenny area where there are 15 applicants on the waiting list. The particular case is a matter for the South-Eastern Health Board and I have referred it to the chief executive officer of the board for direct reply to Deputy McGuinness. The board gives priority to its child protection and foster care services in appointing additional social workers.</P>
    <P>The issues raised by the Deputies are common to a number of health boards. I have received a large number of representations concerning both delays in commencing assessments and perceived differences between health boards in the assessment process itself. Last November I commissioned an independent consultancy to review the foreign adoption assessment procedures in the eight health boards with the aim of ensuring that an efficient and standardised assessment procedure, which accords with best practice in the field, operates across the country while, at the same time having regard to the priority that must be attached to other areas of the child care services. The aim of the consultancy was to make recommendations on a streamlined, standardised framework for assessment, according with best practice in the field. A number of recommendations deal specifically with the structural issues which Deputy McGuinness has raised.</P>
    <P>The Government approved the publication of the report &ldquo;Towards a Standardised Framework for Intercountry Adoption Assessment Procedures&rdquo;; the appointment of an implementation group to prioritise, plan and cost the phased implementation of the report's recommendations and provided for additional funding of £500,000 in 1999 to enable work to commence on implementation. The report was published in July and circulated to all relevant personnel within the health board areas. The additional funding has been allocated to health boards on the basis of the waiting list for intercountry adoption assessment in December 1998. Funding provided to the boards has been specifically earmarked for the improvement of the assessment process and in the south-eastern region will allow for the appointment of an additional social worker in the area of inter-country adoption. The implementation group has been established and has begun its work in prioritising and costing the recommendations and developing time frames for the implementation of the report. The first priority identified by the group is the promulgation of the &ldquo;Standardised Framework&rdquo; as recommended in the report which will help to achieve a consistent and equitable service countrywide.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>I should explain at the outset that there is a range of schemes designed to help people with the cost of drugs and medicines. Where an individual or family has a significant level of ongoing expenditure on medical expenses due to a long-term medical condition, these expenses may be reckoned in determining eligibility for a medical card. In some cases a medical card may issue to a family member on a personal basis. Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board to decide. The long-term illness scheme entitles patients to free drugs and medicines which are prescribed in respect of a specific schedule of illnesses. This scheme has not been extended since the 1970s and there are no plans to expand the number of illnesses or conditions covered by the scheme, having regard to the fact that the needs of individuals with significant or ongoing medical expenses are met by other community drugs schemes. In this regard, the most recent community drugs scheme is the new drug payment scheme which replaced the drug refund scheme and the drug cost subsidisation scheme from 1 July. Under this scheme, individuals or families need pay no more than £42 per month on approved prescribed drugs and medicines, regardless of the total cost of these medicines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cost of drugs for any illness or condition is <Col N="324" /> dependent upon the price of the drugs prescribed for the individual patient and the volume of drugs prescribed. Long-term illnesses can also pose difficulties in definition. For example, some patients might have chronic chest complaints but would only require medication at certain times of the year.  Other patients may require medication to treat a condition for some time and then go on to make a full recovery. Conditions such as heart disease can affect a considerable number of patients, who would have varying treatment requirements. In addition, the figures available under the drug cost subsidisation scheme, which catered for patients with ongoing medical conditions, are inclusive of all drugs prescribed for the patient and contain the cost of drugs unrelated to the primary condition. The figures available under the drug refund scheme relate to reimbursement of family expenditure on drugs. It is not possible, therefore, to specify the long-term illnesses which have the highest drug costs or to properly compare drug costs with drug costs of conditions included in the long-term illness scheme.</P>
    <P>Under the long-term illness scheme, the conditions which had the highest average drug costs per patient in 1998 were as follows:</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 430, 489 and 499 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The drug cost subsidisation and drug refund schemes were merged into one new drug payment <Col N="325" /> scheme with a threshold of £42 per month per individual or family unit on 1st July. A common list of reimbursable medicines was introduced for the GMS scheme and the drug payment scheme. Previously, medicines which were not available to medical card holders under the general medical services scheme were reimbursed under the community drugs schemes. In general, these were over the counter items and vitamins and cough bottles such as those referred to by the Deputies. The introduction of the common medicines list ensures equity between the general medical services and the drug payment schemes in relation to the range of medicines paid for by the State under both schemes.</P>
    <P>In order for any item to be included in the common medicines list it must comply with a published list of criteria. These range from criteria on the uses for and licensing of medicines to the pricing of products. One of the criteria also stipulates that the products should not be advertised or promoted to the public. In addition, over the counter &ndash; OTC &ndash; products in general are not available under the schemes.  With regard to quinine, I should also say quinine sulphate is authorised for use in this country for the treatment of malaria and for no other indication.</P>
    <P>The list of drugs, medicines and appliances <Col N="326" /> available to GMS patients, as specified in the current GMS code book &ndash; including all updates &ndash; and with some additions, forms the common list of items for both the GMS and the new drug payment scheme. I am satisfied that the common list provides a comprehensive range of the most modern therapies. This common list of items is of course subject to ongoing review and is amended on a monthly basis as new items are added to the list.</P>

    <P>In the case of environmental health, I will be publishing a proposal for a national environmental health action plan &ndash; NEHAP &ndash; which will focus on the strategic development of inter governmental agency actions on a partnership basis.</P>
    <P>Arising from a Government decision in July, 1999 a structured arrangement has been put in place to ensure a co-ordinated cross Departmental approach to the development of a national children's strategy. A high level interdepartmental group has been established and a principal officer has been specifically assigned to lead a cross departmental team which will do the drafting work.</P>
    <P>In relation to community health, a principal officer of the Department chairs the national drugs strategy team comprising members of other Departments, health boards, voluntary organis<Col N="327" /> ations and community groups whose main responsibility is the monitoring and support of local drugs forces which have been established in areas where the drug problem is most acute.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the Dublin City coroner revealed in 1998 that abuse of benzodiazepines is now a major cause of death; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[18509/99]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the report to which the Deputy refers. The research, which was carried out in March 1999, involved the examination of the outcome of the total of 520 inquests which were held during 1998. These inquests related to deaths which occurred between November 1992 and July 1998. The research took account of the coroner's verdicts, toxicology reports and depositional evidence, together with anonymised biographical details.</P>
      <P>Of the total number of inquests 108 &ndash; 20.76 per cent &ndash; were identified as having drugs or alcohol implicated in the death. Twenty eight cases were deemed to have been predominantly alcohol related and were eliminated. A further ten cases were eliminated as suicides or possible suicides. Of the remaining 70 cases benzodiazepines were implicated in 68.5 per cent  &ndash; 48 &ndash; of cases. In a number of cases there was evidence of polydrug use, most commonly a cocktail of heroin and or methadone, benzodiazepines, alcohol and/or cannabis.</P>
      <P>The report shows that drug misusers will turn to a range of drugs to feed their habit and that the treatment of such patients needs to be carried out carefully, with appropriate training and with the support of consultants in drug misuse or doctors who have expertise in this area.</P>
      <P>Benzodiazepines are controlled drugs which are only available on prescription from medical practitioners. In common with a number of other countries the use of prescription medicines has increased over the years in Ireland. In some cases this is due to the introduction of new medicines which have proven effective in the treatment of severe pain and other ailments. I am aware, however, of concern about over-prescribing of certain controlled drugs. Under the Misuse of Drugs Acts, 1977 and 1984, I have the authority to curtail or prohibit the prescribing or supply of controlled drugs by medical practitioners or pharmacists, where a need for such curtailment or prohibition is indicated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department's officials have written to all general practitioners on a number of occasions concerning the need for general practitioners to exercise caution when prescribing controlled drugs. In the most recent letter &ndash; 30 August, 1999 &ndash;  from my Department's chief medical <Col N="328" /> officer to all general practitioners, he points out that a small number of doctors continue to prescribe controlled drugs in an inappropriate fashion to opiate misusers. The letter goes on to advise doctors on best clinical practice in relation to treatment of opiate misusers, giving contact names and phone numbers where assistance can be obtained.</P>
    <P>Following the issue of this letter my Department will be closely monitoring the prescribing of controlled drugs, including benzodiazepines, to ensure that the provisions of the Misuse of Drugs Acts and regulations made thereunder are observed.</P>

      <P>The information sought by the Deputy in relation to the number of speech and language therapists required to meet the needs of children in mainstream and special schools and those with an intellectual disability is not available to my Department.</P>
      <P>Decisions regarding the recruitment of additional multi-disciplinary support staff, including speech and language therapists, for services to persons' with disabilities are a matter for the health boards in consultation with the regional intellectual disability co-ordinating committees and the regional physical and sensory disability co-ordinating committees in line with the priorities for service developments which have been identified for their regions by these committees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report of the Review Group on Health and Personal Social Services for People with Physical and Sensory Disabilities, &ldquo;Towards an Indepen<Col N="330" /> dent Future&rdquo;, published in December 1996, sets out the requirements for the development of these services, including speech and language therapy services. The report recommended that 150 new speech and language therapy posts be put in place over the following years. Additional speech and language therapy posts have been put in place in recent years in both the intellectual disability and physical and sensory disability services as a result of additional funding allocated to these services.</P>
    <P>I should point out that the recruitment of paramedical staff generally is presenting problems throughout the health board regions. Labour Court Recommendation No. 15515 recommended, <i>inter alia,</i> that an expert group should be set up to examine and report on the changes that have taken place in a number of professions, collectively known as the paramedic or allied healthcare professionals group, which group included speech and language therapists. The terms of reference included changes that have taken place in the relevant professions, career structures, problems in relation to recruitment and retention, the role of each profession, training and education, management structure and development within each profession, interaction with other disciplines and development plans for delivery of services. The expert group has largely completed its investigations, which consisted of assessing submissions from each profession and site visits both in Ireland and abroad to assess working methods, standards, best practice, etc. It is expected that the expert group will issue its report before the end of the year.</P>

      <P>The provision of a community hospital for older people in Tralee is a matter in the first instance for the Southern Health Board. I understand that the Southern Health Board has prepared a strategy for services for older people which will be discussed at the October meeting of the board. I understand that this document emphasises the need for maintaining older people at home and in this regard proposes the development of community nursing units which would operate in association with the board's general hospitals including the department of medicine of older people at Tralee General Hospital. The board has put in place, or is in the course of planning, a <Col N="331" /> range of facilities in County Kerry including assessment and rehabilitation units at Tralee General Hospital; community support services such as physiotherapy and occupational therapy; a day hospital at Tralee General Hospital and the provision of a replacement community hospital at Dingle. The need for a community hospital for older people in Tralee is recognised by the Southern Health Board and it has included the development of such a facility in its development plan for community hospitals. It is my intention to continue with the financial assistance already made available to the Southern Health Board in the development of services for older people in its area subject, of course, to the availability of resources. In this regard, it is a matter for the board to determine its priorities for the development of this service in County Kerry prior to the submission of proposals to my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Eastern Health Board is responsible for the delivery of health services, including mental health services in its catchment area. In June, 1998, the board adopted the report &ldquo;Proposals for the Future of St. Ita's Hospital, Portrane&rdquo; which outlines refurbishment and development plans for the hospital.</P>
      <P>Towards the end of 1998, I announced a development plan for the intellectual disability services in St. Ita's Hospital. The plan is jointly funded by the Eastern Health Board and my Department at a cost of £13 million. The board has appointed a project manager to co-ordinate and plan all new developments. A detailed audit of the existing buildings is being carried out at present together with an assessment of the future needs of the mental health services on this campus.</P>
      <P>The development plan provides for the transfer of clients to a number of new residential complexes off the St. Ita's campus and the development of new day and residential facilities on the campus, together with the refurbishment of existing facilities for the clients remaining. Building work in relation to the new residential and day complex in Oldtown, County Dublin will be completed towards the end of 1999. A design team has now been appointed for the development of residential and day services on the St. Ita's campus and £500,000 has been allocated towards the costs associated with this development in 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as the mental health component of St. Ita's service is concerned, I provided a capital <Col N="332" /> grant of £550,000 to enable a major refurbishment of the acute admission units at the hospital to be undertaken. This work is scheduled for completion at the end of October 1999. It is intended that the admission facilities at St. Ita's will be replaced by an acute psychiatric unit &ndash; 60 beds &ndash; at Beaumont Hospital which is currently being planned. The upgraded units at St. Ita's will then be used to meet other service needs.</P>
    <P>Significant resources have been made available over the past number of years by way of capital funding to upgrade and equip facilities on the hospital campus. In allocating these resources priority has been given to direct patient care areas, i.e., residential accommodation and day service facilities.</P>

There is however partial funding by means of tax relief on medical expenses and assistance with the cost of drugs under the drugs payment scheme.</P>
      <P>Proposals relating to assisted reproduction raise a wide number of issues. I am currently considering how best these issues might be addressed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 447 and 504 together.</P>
      <P>Details of the number of bed closures and resulting bed days lost are set out on the following table.</P>
      <P>In considering the delivery of service in the acute hospital sector, it is appropriate to examine the overall level of service provided in the sector rather than to simply focus on the number of beds available at any given time. This reflects major changes that have been taking place in medical practice, resulting in reduced average in-patient lengths of stay, a continuing shift in the delivery of care from an in-patient to day case basis and the increasing provision of treatment at outpatient level.  </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In developing and delivering service plans, the implementation of an appropriate mix between in-patient, day case and outpatient care is a major consideration for local management in seeking to <Col N="336" /> maximise overall activity. As part of this process, activity in the acute hospital sector is planned over a 12 month period having regard to anticipated levels of emergency admissions and the overall resources available. In achieving the activity targets set out in the annual service plan, temporary bed closures would form a part of the normal bed management function performed by local management as part of their efforts to optimise the overall activity delivered within the resources available. They also, of course, facilitate staff annual leave, refurbishment works and the scaling down of elective activity at times of low demand such as the high summer period and at Christmas.</P>
    <P>The total discharges, both in-patient and day case, in the acute hospital system for the period January to December 1998 was 809,099. At outpatient level, the figures show that 1,960,126 attendances were recorded in that period. This huge volume of overall activity represented an increase of 3 per cent over 1997 levels. In particular, the level of hospital care being provided on a day case basis showed a very significant increase, up over 8 per cent in 1998 over 1997 levels. The increasing delivery of care at this level reflects trends in modern medical practice and is indicative of a service that is increasingly focusing resources in a manner that is best suited to the needs of the public.</P>
    <P>This upward trend in overall activity is continuing in the first six months of 1999. Overall discharges, in-patient and day case, are up over 3.6 per cent over the same period in 1998. Against this background, the average monthly temporary bed closures in the year to end August have amounted to just 2.7 per cent of total bed numbers.</P>

      <P>The information requested by the Deputy is set out on the following tables, in the format collected by my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the waiting list figures at the end of June 1999 show a reduction of 1,072 on the March figures. This means that waiting lists have fallen by almost 3,000, some 8 per cent, since the beginning of this year. The reductions in March and June 1999 are the first since December 1996, and it is the first <Col N="340" /> time in which waiting lists have fallen in two successive quarters since then.</P>
    <P>Since coming into office, I have taken an integrated approach to the problem of waiting lists. As the Deputy will be aware, I commissioned a review of the waiting list initiative. I am now implementing a series of measures aimed at tackling the root causes of waiting lists. I allocated £20 million this year to agencies specifically to undertake waiting list work, with £3 million of this funding being allocated to the agencies who achieved the greatest improvements in their waiting lists in the first quarter of the year. This was in line with the recommendations of the review group report.</P>
    <P>I also allocated £9 million to services to older people and £2 million to accident and emergency services, with the aim of freeing acute hospital beds by ensuring the streamlining of emergency services and providing additional step-down and rehabilitation facilities for older people.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the measures I have taken in tackling waiting lists represents the best way of addressing the underlying causes of waiting lists and long waiting times.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>Claims for reimbursement were made in respect of a number of nicotine replacement products under the drug cost subsidisation and drug refund schemes. From 1 July 1999, these two schemes were merged into one new drug payment scheme and a common list of reimbursable medicines was introduced for the GMS scheme and the new <Col N="364" /> drug payment scheme to ensure equity in relation to the range of medicines paid for by the State under both schemes. In order for a product to be included in the common list of reimbursable items, it must satisfy a number of criteria, including that it is ordinarily supplied to the public only on foot of a medical prescription and that the product should not be advertised or promoted to the public.</P>
      <P>Nicotine replacement therapies belong to a category of products that do not satisfy these criteria, in that they are generally available over the counter, and may be advertised directly to the public. Accordingly, they are not included in the list of items reimbursable under the common list. The Deputy will wish to know, however, that I am asking the advisory forum to the heart health task force to bring forward proposals in regard to nicotine replacement therapy and the less well off sectors of the community.</P>
      <P>I would also point out that Department's health promotion unit conducts national multi-media anti-smoking campaigns to encourage smokers to give up and non-smokers to refrain from taking up the habit. The most recent anti-smoking campaign &ldquo;Break the Habit for Good&rdquo; was launched in December 1998 and this campaign takes a slightly different approach to previous campaigns. It emphasises the positive effects which quitting smoking can have on the individual and offers support in the form of an &ldquo;advice kit&rdquo; which, in turn, offers the support of the Irish Cancer Society's helpline. The campaign continues, by a series of national and local initiatives, to offer help and support for those people wishing to give up smoking.</P>

      <P>The replacement of the occupational therapy unit in Cork University Hospital was listed in the Southern Health Board's priority capital programme requirements for 1999 at a cost of £250,000. The development of the old age psychiatry unit was also included at a cost of £500,000. The board proposes that a combined occupational therapy-old age psychiatric unit be built on the site of the existing occupational therapy unit. The proposal is under consideration in the light of the availability of capital resources.</P>

      <P>The provision of occupational therapists in the psychiatric unit at Cork University Hospital is a matter for the Southern Health Board in the first instance. At present there is one senior and one basic grade occupational therapist in the Cork South Lee mental health service.</P>
      <P>The basic grade occupational therapist based in unit GF, Cork University Hospital, resigned from the service on 31 March 1999 and the workload was covered in so far as possible by the senior occupational therapist, until the position was filled on 7 September 1999. The difficulty in recruiting qualified occupational therapists and the non-availability of temporary occupational therapists led to a the delay in filling the post.</P>
      <P>The board proposes to sectorise the Cork South Lee mental health service and the need for additional occupational therapists will be addressed as part of this process.</P>

      <P>Lead is a toxic air pollutant which can have adverse health effects. Ingestion of lead is shown to retard mental and physical development, particularly in the case of children.</P>
      <P>Ireland is required to phase out use of unleaded petrol by the year 2000 on environmental and public health grounds under the EU auto oil programme agreed by the European Council of Ministers and the European Parliament in 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="366" /> While use of unleaded fuels removes a major toxic pollutant from vehicle emissions the burning of diesel and unleaded petrol would still involve the release of some gaseous and particulate pollutants into the atmosphere as well as carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons.</P>
    <P>Regulations make in 1998 to transpose European directives in this area require stricter emission standards from diesel engines in lorries, trucks and buses and from passenger cars and light commercial vehicles.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>Several national multi-media anti-smoking campaigns have been initiated over the last number of years designed to increase the levels of knowledge and awareness of the risk factors associated with smoking. The details of these campaigns are as follows: </P>
      <P>In 1989, the &ldquo;Smoking is Dangerous and Disgusting &ndash; Stop it Now&rdquo; campaign was launched and continued until 1992 with a total expenditure of £587,000.</P>
      <P>During the period 1993-5 the &ldquo;I'm One Less&rdquo; anti-smoking campaign was initiated. This was a multi-media campaign aimed largely at young people. It was directed at encouraging the friends, relatives and peers of smokers to adopt a positive and supportive role in helping smokers to quit. The total expenditure over the course of this campaign was over £600,000.</P>
      <P>During the period 1995-7, the &ldquo;Say What You Like &ndash; Smoking Kills&rdquo; campaign was launched and the overall expenditure was in excess of £700,000 during this period. The campaign used television, radio, outdoor and print advertising in an effort to raise awareness of the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most recent anti-smoking campaign &ldquo;Break the Habit for Good&rdquo; was launched in December 1998 in association with the Irish Cancer Society. This campaign takes a slightly different approach to previous campaigns and emphasises the positive effects which quitting smoking can have on the individual. The campaign involves national and local initiatives, which offers support for those people wishing to give up smoking. The budget involved was in the order of £500,000 over the period 1998-9. I have also allocated a sum of £180,000 to the health boards in 1999 to foster integration of smoke free policies into health board service plans and to improve compliance with tobacco laws. I have supported the establishment of a tobacco information resource and research centre and have allocated a sum of £50,000 to ASH Ireland to initiate the project in 1999. Also as part of a smoke free initiative, a diploma course in tobacco <Col N="367" /> and health studies is being developed. A grant of £20,000 is being made to the department of community health and medicine at Trinity College, Dublin to initiate the diploma course in the academic year 1999-2000.</P>
    <P>The voluntary code on smoking in the workplace was developed by the health promotion unit of my Department with the support of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the Irish Business and Employers' Federation, the Irish Cancer Society, the Irish Heart Foundation and the Health and Safe Authority. The code is included in a booklet titled <i>Working Together for Cleaner Air</i> and was distributed to over 5,000 companies, including other Departments, in late 1994. This code encourages a consensual approach to smoking control policies through a consultation process between staff and management interests.</P>
    <P>The health promotion unit of my Department also co-ordinated two schools programmes which seek to prevent young people taking up smoking in the first instance. The smoking reduction action programme, SCRAP, is a peer-led anti-smoking programme for schools which was developed by my Department in conjunction with the Irish Cancer Society, the National Youth Federation and with support from the Department of Education and Science. The cost involved in the development of this programme was in the region of £45,000. The smokebusters project, which is aimed at primary school children &ndash; 7-11 years &ndash; in an urban environment, was developed by the Irish Cancer Society, the Department of Health and Children, the Department of Education and Science and the Eastern Health Board. The cost involved in the development of this programme was in the region of £70,000.</P>
    <P>The health promotion unit, in association with voluntary agencies active in this area, also continues to produce a range of materials including leaflets and posters containing information on smoking and encouraging smokers to quit. Action against smoking also continues at health board level. However, the extent of such action is a matter for the chief executive officer of each board. I am, therefore, sending a copy of the Deputy's question to each of the chief executive officer's with a request that they respond directly to the Deputy. I wish to assure the Deputy that action on smoking continues to be one of my top priorities as Minister for Health and Children.</P>

      <P>The most recent anti-smoking campaign &ldquo;Break the Habit for Good&rdquo; was launched in December <Col N="368" /> 1998 and this campaign takes a slightly different approach than previous campaigns. It emphasises the positive effects which quitting smoking can have on the individual and offers support in the form of an &ldquo;advice kit&rdquo; which, in turn, offers the support of the Irish Cancer Society's helpline. The campaign continues, by means of a series of national and local initiatives, to offer help and support for people wishing to quit smoking. The estimated budget involved will be of the order of £500,000 over 1998-99.</P>
      <P>The overall sum allocated from my Department's budget to health promotion activities in 1999 is £3,052,225, of which £250,000 is set aside for the 1999 period of the anti-smoking campaign.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the Child Care (Pre-School Services) Regulations, 1996, is to build on the existing good standards in our pre-school services and gradually improve standards throughout the sector to secure the health, safety and welfare of pre-school children and to promote the development of children attending pre-school services.</P>
      <P>Under the regulations, pre-school providers are obliged to notify their local health board that they are carrying on, or proposing to carry on, a pre-school service. On receipt of notification the health board will provide relevant information to the applicant and arrange for an inspection to be carried out by an authorised person. The other main provisions of the regulations relate to adult-child ratios; number of children who may be catered for; the structure, fixtures and fittings, ventilation and sanitary accommodation of the premises; food preparation, storage and hygiene facilities; safety measures; facilities for rest and play and insurance.</P>
      <P>Health boards provide a range of advice and assistance to pre-school providers. On the introduction of the regulations, the health boards held public information meetings and carried out information campaigns to ensure that providers were made fully aware of the inspection process and the requirement to notify the boards. At the pre-notification stage, and on receipt of a notification, health board pre-school services officers provide advice, guidance and support to the provider as necessary. This may involve a number of advisory visits and telephone contacts and also includes the provision of information literature. Information sessions and training on relevant topics are provided on an ongoing basis. Many of the boards also maintain close liaison with the national voluntary child care agencies and other relevant local agencies who are involved in providing advice and assistance to pre-school providers. Where deficiencies are identified during inspections, the health board and the providers work in a co-operative manner to make specific improvements in a planned way provided that any delay would not adversely affect the welfare of children. The timescale for making improvements varies from a requirement for immediate action to a phased implementation which may extend to six months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Health boards can bring breaches of the regulations to the attention of the District Court under Part VII of the Child Care Act, 1991. The <Col N="372" /> Southern Health board brought a prosecution against one provider who was obliged by the court to cease operating her service for a period of 60 days. All health boards report that they are aware that a number of pre-school service providers have closed their service voluntarily either before or after inspection as they are aware that they fall short of the standards required by the Child Care (Pre-School Services) Regulations 1996. The Deputy will appreciate that, having regard to my responsibilities the health, safety and welfare of children must be my primary consideration.</P>

      <P>The development of services for people suffering from chronic pain at St. Vincent's Hospital, Elm Park, is a matter, in the first instance, for the hospital, having regard to overall service priorities and in the context of the general delivery of anaesthetic services within their designated catchment area of south east Dublin and east Wicklow.</P>
      <P>The joint south east Dublin department of anaesthesia is the co-ordinating body for the planning and development of anaesthetic services in the region, including pain management programmes. It is comprised of clinicians and management from the acute general hospitals in the region, including St. Vincent's Hospital. The joint department has developed an integrated plan for the delivery of pain management services across the region. The plan divides pain services into various sub-divisions from the initial consultation contact with the patient at out-patient or in-patient level, to the more sophisticated spinal implantation procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the service provided by St. Vincent's Hospital, Elm Park, I was pleased to allocate additional funding of £1.4 million to the hospital in 1999 to meet additional costs arising from continued developments of which £80,000 was allocated by the hospital to pain management services. The hospital has agreed to fund 30 procedures involving insertion of nerve stimulators. I have been informed by the hospital that there are approximately 100 patients awaiting admission for this procedure. The average waiting time in this regard is approximately one year. The consultant concerned has access to one and five day <Col N="373" /> beds for other procedures and one protected designated bed for patients undergoing this procedure. To date no operations have been cancelled in 1999.</P>
    <P>The hospital has informed me that the pain management service at St. Vincent's Hospital receives a significant number of referrals which are coming from outside the hospital catchment area. In this regard, I feel that it may be appropriate for each health board to consider the provision of this service in the overall context of developing services on a regional basis.</P>

      <P>The report of the review group on the waiting list initiative recommended that a portion of the funding available for waiting list procedures should be retained for distribution to the hospitals which achieved the greatest improvement in waiting times and waiting lists. I accepted this recommendation.</P>
      <P>I retained £3 million of the £20 million set aside this year for waiting list procedures and allocated it to the hospitals that achieved the best reductions in waiting lists and waiting times in the first quarter of this year. The criteria used for allocation of this funding were: the extent of reduction in waiting times in target specialties in the quarter ending 31 March 1999; the extent of reduction in waiting lists over the same period; the proposals for waiting list activity as set out in agencies' service agreements; and my Department's assessment of agencies' proposals, including the costed case mix analysis to which each service agreement has been subject.</P>

    <P>My Department then invited formal proposals from the best-performing hospitals in the first quarter of the year for carrying out additional waiting list work during the remainder of 1999. Hospitals were asked to specify such factors as their capacity for additional waiting list work; the <Col N="374" /> specialties that would be targeted for additional work; the number of extra procedures that they could carry out; the total cost and marginal cost involved; and the scope for contracting out to other hospitals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt):</NameTxt>
      <P>The payment of subvention is governed by the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, which came into effect on 1 September 1993 together with regulations made under the Act. It must be stressed that a nursing home subvention is aimed at providing assistance towards the cost of private nursing home fees and is not intended to meet the full cost of nursing home care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are three levels of subvention payable &ndash; £70, £95, £120 &ndash; in accordance with the three levels of dependency &ndash; medium, high, maximum &ndash; which are eligible for subvention. While the rates of subvention have not been increased since the introduction of the scheme substantial additional funding has had to be provided to meet the rising costs of the scheme. The additional expenditure is due to a number of factors such as the increase in the number of people in receipt of subventions, their higher levels of dependency, resulting in more people receiving the higher rates of subvention, and the change in the regulations whereby the ability of adult sons and-or daughters over 21 years of age to contribute is no longer taken into account. The amount made available for the scheme this year is £33 million. <Col N="375" /> Any possible increase in the subvention rate next year will depend on the availability of resources and competing priorities at the time including the need for other improvements in services for older people.</P>
    <P>The placement of a resident in a private nursing home and the fees charged is a private arrangement between the nursing home and the individual resident and information regarding rates of fees charged is not available in my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 472 and 485 together.</P>
      <P>The new drug payment scheme replaced the drug cost subsidisation scheme &ndash; DCSS &ndash; and the drug refund scheme &ndash; DRS &ndash; with effect from 1 July 1999 and merges the best elements of the two previous schemes. For example, the drug payment scheme is more user friendly than the DRS and is designed to improve the cash flow situation of families and individuals. Unlike the DCSS, there are no qualifying criteria for inclusion in the new scheme.  Payment thresholds under the DRS and the DCSS were £90 per quarter and £32 per month respectively. The threshold for the new scheme is £42 per month per family unit. With regard to the increase, I would point out that there had been no increase in the thresholds for the DRS or the DCSS since 1991.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A common list of reimbursable items was introduced for the general medical services scheme and the drug payment scheme to ensure equity in relation to the products reimbursed by the State under both schemes. The list of reimbursable food items to which persons registered under the drugs payment scheme are entitled is therefore in line with those items available to medical card holders and includes breads, bread mixes, flours, and pizza bases. It is considered that the range of such items available under State reimbursement schemes provides a reasonable choice and persons requiring items which are not reimbursable <Col N="376" /> would be expected to meet the full cost of such items.</P>
    <P>In 1998, the total cost of claims reimbursed in respect of coeliac foods under the DCSS was £192,563, of which £102,588 was in respect of foods which are on the common list of reimbursable items. Of the £89,975 reimbursed for coeliac foods which are now no longer reimbursable, over £42,500 was in respect of cakes and biscuits.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>The traditional apprenticeship model of nursing training was evaluated by An Bord Altranais in 1993-94 and a number of weaknesses were identified which militated against a beneficial experience for the student nurse. These included a lack of preparation for certain duties, insufficient clinical teaching, an emphasis on work rather than learning and an involvement in non-nursing duties. In the light of this evaluation, the apprenticeship model was replaced by a new registration-diploma programme in general, psychiatric and mental handicap nursing. The diploma based pre-registration education programme is offered by schools of nursing in association with the third level institutions. The objective of the transition to the new programme was to enhance nurse education and training. This was in line with key recommendations contained in the report, The Future of Nurse Education and Training in Ireland, published by An Bord Altranais in 1994.</P>
      <P>The first nursing registration-diploma programme commenced on a pilot basis in University College Hospital, Galway, in association with the National University of Ireland, Galway, in October 1994. By 1998 all schools of general, psychiatric and mental handicap nursing had completed the transition to the revised model of training and education. The total annual additional cost of the diploma programme currently stands at £32 million.</P>
      <P>The introduction of the registration-diploma programme was widely welcomed as offering new educational opportunities for the nursing profession. The registration-diploma programme was seen as possibly leading to a more broadly educated, more analytical and self-confident profession while retaining the core value of caring for patients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="377" /> I acknowledge that there are problems with the new registration-diploma programme and, in particular, the curriculum which places a heavy burden on the students in terms of the time commitment required of them over the three-year duration of the programme. Last year, I requested An Bord Altranais to examine possible ways in which these problems might be resolved. I am pleased to say that the board recently published a document entitled Requirements and Standards for Nurse Registration Education Programmes, which provides guidance for the development of flexible, innovative, practice-oriented registration programmes to third level institutes and health care institutions involved in the education and training of nurses. This document incorporates the findings of the comprehensive independent external evaluation of the first registration-diploma programme introduced in 1994 which was undertaken by Professor Helen Simons of the University of Southampton, and the relevant recommendations of the report of the commission on nursing.</P>
    <P>The commission on nursing recommended that the current diploma model should be replaced by a four-year degree programme, incorporating one year of employment with structured clinical placements in the health services and that such a programme should be fully integrated into third level education. The commission also recommended that I establish a representative forum, involving the third level institutions, schools of nursing, health service providers and An Bord Altranais with the objective of agreeing a strategy for the implementation of degree level education in time for the intake of nursing students in the year 2002. The forum held its first meeting on 10 February and is proceeding with its work.</P>
    <P>Around 200 of those that entered training in 1994 and 1995 have now qualified under the programme. The 1996 cohort of students numbering some 530 will not sit their registration exams until November 1999.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to provide the Deputy with statistics on the number of nurses, who having completed the diploma-registration programme, have taken up positions as nurses, taken career breaks or leave of absence as this information is not available in my Department. There are currently some 536 nursing posts vacant in Dublin hospitals.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>Health boards have statutory responsibility for the provision of orthodontic services in their areas and the waiting lists for treatment are maintained by the boards. Because of the high cost of orthodontic therapy, health boards can only provide this treatment where a child has a handicapping orthodontic condition. Children are assessed therefore in accordance with guidelines drawn up by my Department to ensure that resources are used to best advantage and for those most affected or handicapped.</P>
      <P>The orthodontic services in the Eastern Health Board, in common with other health boards, are being developed in accordance with the dental health action plan. The action plan provides for the development of a consultant led orthodontic service. A consultant led orthodontic service ensures a service of high quality and high service levels.</P>
      <P>I understand from the Eastern Health Board that since the introduction of consultant led orthodontic services in the board in September 1996 significant inroads have been made into orthodontic assessment waiting lists.</P>
      <P>In 1996 there were 681 patients listed in category 1 and 10,676 in category 2. The average waiting time for assessment was five years and ten months. In the intervening three years the Category 1 list has been reduced to 83 patients and the Category 2 list to 7736. In this same period the average waiting time for assessment has been reduced by two years to three years and ten months. Treatment commences soon after assessment. A target objective for the orthodontic services is that no child should be more than two years on a waiting list for treatment. A number of health boards are close to achieving this target objective.</P>
      <P>My Department is currently considering proposals from the board for the development of two further regional orthodontic units, one in north Dublin and another in Dublin south east.</P>
      <P>It is not necessary for all work to be carried out by consultant orthodontists. Dental surgeons, some with the M. Orth qualification, treat patients under the direction and supervision of a consultant orthodontist.</P>
      <P>The board has confirmed that the person to whom the Deputy is referring is on the board's Category 2 waiting list for assessment to determine her eligibility for orthodontic treatment through the public health service. The board has not been able to give an exact appointment date, but she can expect to be seen in the very near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A group set up by the chief executive officers of the health boards to review the orthodontic services has made its report to the chief executive officers. The recommendations in the report are <Col N="379" /> currently under consideration by the chief executive officers in consultation with my Department.</P>

      <P>Persons aged 16 to 25, including students, who are dependants of a person who is not a medical card holder, are not normally entitled to a medical card. Students who are financially independent are entitled to apply for a medical card in their own right and are assessed on the same income criteria as all other applicants. The decision on whether a person is regarded as a dependant or as being financially independent is made by the chief executive officer of the health board on the basis of the circumstances in each individual case. Persons pursuing apprenticeship courses with FÁS are assessed, based on their income, in the same way as other applicants.</P>

    <P>The Government announced in the 1996 budget that &ldquo;persons who have been unemployed for at least one year shall retain their medical cards after entering employment.&rdquo;  Persons who are on the live register for at least one year and who take up paid insurable employment were <Col N="380" /> deemed to meet the criteria for retaining their medical cards for three years. The purpose of the budget provision was to remove disincentives to labour force participation by long-term unemployed persons.</P>
    <P>The provision also covers participants on approved schemes applicable to the long-term unemployed, including back to work allowance &ndash; BTWA &ndash; community employment, jobstart, job initiative, partnership and community group initiative and development courses such as workplace and vocational training opportunities scheme &ndash; VTOS.

      <P>I understand from returns received from the North-Western Health Board that there are currently 1,843 persons on the board's waiting list for orthodontic treatment. Dentists with postgraduate qualifications in orthodontics are employed by health boards as senior clinical dental surgeon which is a recognised grade in the health board dental service. However, I understand that in the Eastern Health Board a special arrangement exists with regard to a number of dentists with the M. Orth qualification employed by the board. These dentists, five in number, were employed by the board on a sessional basis some years ago. In the past, the board has sought to integrate them with the board's consultant led service. This involved negotiations with those dentists with regard to their contractual time commitment and the agreement of an appropriate salary. All five are now employed on a full time basis with the board on an interim salary personal to the individuals involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Eastern Health Board states that these arrangements are an interim measure pending the <Col N="382" /> outcome of proposals for the establishment of specialist posts in orthodontists at a national level, when the salary scales approved for these specialist posts will be applied. I understand the position in the Midland Health Board is that in the absence of a consultant led orthodontic service the board has arrangements with orthodontists in private practice who provide services on a fee per item basis.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Health and Children</askee>
      <Quest>the reason there are long delays to determine eligibility for orthodontic treatment through the public health service; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the average waiting time for assessment is three years and 10 months in the Eastern Health Board area; if children often pass the most appropriate age to commence treatment while on the waiting list; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of orthodontic services to eligible persons is the statutory responsibility of the health boards. Health boards continue to develop their orthodontic services in accordance with the Dental Health Action Plan. Waiting times for assessment-treatment can vary between boards. Since the development of a consultant led orthodontic service in the Eastern Health Board in 1996 there has been significant improvements in the level of service being provided. In September 1996 the average waiting time for orthodontic assessment-treatment was five years and ten months. The average waiting time has now been reduced to three years and ten months. A desirable target objective for the orthodontic service would be that no child should be on a treatment waiting list for longer than two years. A number of health boards are close to this target objective.</P>
      <P>Ideally orthodontic treatment should be carried out in early adolescence. However, the technology is now so advanced, that most orthodontic treatment can be carried out in adulthood.</P>

      <P>The Tobacco Products (Control of Advertising, Sponsorship and Sales Promotion) Regulations, 1991, and the amendments of 1996 restricted the events or activity that could be sponsored by tobacco companies to those events and activities that were being sponsored by companies prior to 1 May 1986. A list of the events and activities, which were sponsored prior to 1 May 1986, is listed below. Since then companies have withdrawn from sponsoring a number of major events. These include Carrolls withdrawing from the Irish Open Golf Championship and the G.A.A. All-Stars Scheme. Players have withdrawn from sponsorship of the Tops of the Town Variety Competition. Approval for expenditure by tobacco companies on sponsorship is not given on an event by event basis but as an overall figure each year.</P>
      <P>With regard to reductions in expenditure on sponsorship since 1996 it is policy to cut the approved sponsorship budgets for tobacco companies by a figure of 5 per cent each year with an allowance for inflation. The approved expenditure on sponsorship for 1999 is as follows:</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had inquiries made of the Children's Hospital, Temple Street, regarding this matter. The hospital have confirmed there are two consultant opthalmologists working in the hospital. They are supported by two orthoptists and two specialist ophthalmic nurses, who also organise clinics and assist in theatre. The hospital has recently submitted an application to my Department structure a third consultant ophthalmologist post.</P>
      <P>Since coming into office, I am acutely aware of the importance of reducing waiting lists and waiting times, particularly for children. To this end my Department has allocated £150,000 in 1999 to Temple Street Hospital under the waiting list initiative for the provision of treatment to children on waiting lists. The current waiting period for an outpatient appointment is 13 months. There are currently a total of 72 children on the daycare waiting list and 56 on the inpatient waiting list at Temple Street. Patients are chosen for treatment under the waiting list initiative based on clinical priority.</P>

      <P>The provision of health centres in the Cootehill area is the statutory responsibility of the North-Eastern Health Board. Financial support, from my Department for such projects, is given on the basis of the available resources the competing demands on those resources and the priority the relevant health board attaches to the project in question.</P>
      <P>In 1998 I made £65,000 available to the North-Eastern Health Board for the health centre at Cootehill which was used to purchase a suitable site for the new health centre. The board has also prepared a brief, employed an architect, completed tender documents, advertised for tenders and has prepared a short-list of contractors for the project. The board is now in a position to proceed with project once funding has been secured. I recently made a total of £424,000 available to the North-Eastern Health Board for the top two priorities on its health centre development plan. Unfortunately, Cootehill was not high enough on the priority list to be considered this year. The Cootehill project is next on the board's priority list and providing that the board's priorities do not change in the meantime, the provision of financial support will be considered next year in light of available funding.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>An unprecedented level of investment is now taking place in acute hospital facilities under the current capital programme. In line with my strategy for the development of acute hospital services on a regionally self-sufficient basis, this process of investment is aimed at developing a strong network of regional and local general hospitals. In 1999, a total of £155 million has been provided for capital investment in the health services, a significant proportion of which has been directed into the acute hospital area.</P>
      <P>Significant progress has also been made on the phased commissioning of new units completed under the capital programme. In 1999, a total of £11.5 million has been provided to meet the revenue costs associated with doing this. This is enabling major new facilities such as those completed under phase 1 at University College Hospital, Galway and phase 1 at the Mercy Hospital, Cork to be fully staffed and brought into service this year and has allowed significant progress to be made on the phased completion of commissioning the major developments at Limerick Regional Hospital.</P>
      <P>The following is a list of uncommissioned newly constructed hospital units:</P>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick Regional Hospital</i>

      <P>
        <i>Phase 1 developments</i>

      <P>
        <i>
        </i>Two main operating theatres (out of a total of seven).</P>
      <P>One day theatre (out of two).</P>
      <P>One ICU bed (out of a unit of seven).</P>
      <P>Two renal dialysis stations (out of eight).</P>
      <P>These units have been available for occupation since August 1998.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Phase 2 developments</i>
      </P>
      <P>
        <i>
        </i>Two radiology rooms (out of ten).</P>
      <P>These rooms have been available since December 1998.</P>
      <P>The new accident and emergency and paediatric departments are at present being fitted out and equipped and are not yet ready for occupation. The accident and emergency department is presently temporarily located in what will become a new medical day unit.</P>
      <P>
        <i>University College Hospital Galway</i>
      </P>
      <P>
        <i>
        </i>Two operating theatres (out of a total of nine, available since October 1998).</P>
      <P>One 26 bed ward (available since March 1999).</P>
      <P>Ten observation beds in accident and emergency (available since June 1999).</P>
      <P>Two X-ray rooms (out of a total of seven, available since May 1999).</P>
      <P>As I mentioned, I have provided funding in 1999 to enable the Western Health Board to commission fully these facilities by the end of the year.</P>

      <i>The Adelaide and Meath Hospital Incorporating The National Childrens Hospital Tallaght</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>Four theatres out of development of 12 remain uncommissioned since the opening of the hospital in June 1998. The present commissioned level of theatre capacity at the hospital represents the full requirement for transferring services from the base hospitals. The further commissioning of the theatre capacity there will be kept under review in the context of overall developments.</P>
    <P>The construction and equipping costs of these uncommissioned units would not be readily available as they would be reflected in the total project costs for the major developments of which they formed component parts.</P>
    <P>In general terms, I am satisfied that the hospital system is delivering a satisfactory level of activity.  In the first six months of 1999 overall discharges, in-patient and day case, are up over 3.6 per cent over the same period in 1998. Within this overall increase, day case work has increased by almost 12 per cent.  This comes on top of an overall activity increase of 3 per cent in 1998 over <Col N="396" /> 1997 levels. Allied with the reduction of 3,000 or some 8 per cent achieved on in-patient waiting list numbers in the target specialities over the first six months of this year, I am satisfied that effective use of available resources, including theatre capacity, is being made in the delivery of hospital services.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, last year my Department had no choice but to shelve plans for an intake of psychiatric nursing students to a number of schools of psychiatric nursing, including the South-Eastern Health Board, due to the fact that an insufficient number of applicants were successful. Only 92 of the 201 training places available nationally last year on the psychiatric <Col N="399" /> nursing registration-diploma programme were filled.</P>
      <P>In the light of the disappointing outcome to last year's competitions, a concerted marketing campaign at local level was undertaken by all of the schools of psychiatric nursing to raise the profile of psychiatric nursing. I provided substantial funding to each of the schools concerned for the campaign as well as to the Nursing Careers Centre for the development of promotional materials. I am delighted to be in a position to inform the Deputy that this campaign has been highly successful and has resulted in a record 242 training places being filled to date on this year's psychiatric nursing diploma programme. The Deputy will be particularly interested to learn that the intake of students to the South-Eastern Health Board school of psychiatric nursing currently stands at 36 with a possibility of it being increased to 40 by the weekend. The school's intake this year was originally intended to be 25 students. Additional funding is being made available to the health board to cover the cost of the extra students.</P>
      <P>In view of the unqualified success of this year's competitions, I do not see the need for a post-graduate psychiatric nursing course. It is important to bear in mind that such a course is primarily designed to cater for practising registered general and mental handicap nurses and, as such, would have the effect of withdrawing nurses from the existing workforce. The Deputy will be aware of the difficulties some general hospitals and mental handicap agencies are experiencing in recruiting nurses. I understand the proposed diploma course referred to by the Deputy has not been formally approved by An Bord Altranais to date.</P>

My policy is to develop the range of services as a whole, having regard to available resources, in accordance with the recommendations of the report of the review group on health and personal social services for people with physical and sensory disabilities, Towards an Independent Future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Out of a total of £13.4 million provided this year, £3 million revenue, equalling £6 million on a full year cost basis in the year 2000, is for the development of services. From this, the South-Eastern Health Board was allocated £300,000, ris<Col N="400" /> ing to £600,000 in the year 2000, for the development of services in its functional area.</P>
    <P>Priorities for the allocation of development funding are decided by each health board in consultation its regional co-ordinating committee for physical and sensory disability services. Voluntary sector service providers and services users are represented on these committees. From the funding available to them this year, the South-Eastern Health Board and its co-ordinating committee have agreed to allocate grants totalling £65,000 to a number of agencies for the provision of home support-personal assistance services.</P>

      <P>The paediatric dermatology service at Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin, includes the provision of care for children affected by epidermylosis bullosa, EB. The hospital has identified a need for the further development of its dermatology service which includes the provision of continued support services for children affected by epidermylosis bullosa with particular emphasis on the role of the EB nurse specialist, and has submitted a proposal to my Department in this regard. The proposal is under consideration by my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This proposal is linked to a similar proposal from St. James's Hospital for the development of its dermatology service in terms of joint consultant appointments. The continuation of the EB nurse specialist role, in particular, and the further development of the dermatology service, in general, at Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children will be the subject of discussions with the hospital in the context of its priority funding requirements for next year. However, while the Estimates pro<Col N="401" /> cess is still ongoing I hope funding for the specialist nurse will be available next year provided the authorities at Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children consider it a service development priority in 2000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Health (In-Patient Charges) Regulations, 1987, as amended by the Health (In-Patient Charges) (Amendment) Regulations, 1997, a person is liable for a statutory charge unless otherwise exempt, in respect of in-patient public hospital services provided for patients who are treated in a designated public or private bed. This charge is currently set at £25 per night, subject to a maximum of £250 in any 12 month period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Persons who attend the accident and emergency department directly without having a referral note from their general practitioner are liable for a charge of £20 which applies only to the first visit of any episode of care. There are a <Col N="402" /> number of exemptions to the accident and emergency charges and the in-patient charge, including medical card holders, women receiving services in respect of motherhood and children up to six weeks old.</P>
    <P>In addition to these charges, which relate to short-term care, long-stay charges can be made under two sets of regulations. Charges can be made under the Institutional Assistance Regulations, 1965, where the patient receives &ldquo;shelter and maintenance&rdquo; rather than treatment. These charges apply from the date of admission and are payable by all patients who are in receipt of incomes, including medical card holders and persons with dependants.</P>
    <P>Charges can also be made under the Health (Charges for In-Patient Services) Regulations, 1976, as amended by the Health (Charges for In-Patient Services) (Amendment) Regulations, 1987. These regulations enable charges to be made towards the cost of providing hospital in-patient services for persons with income who have been in receipt of such services for more than 30 days or for periods totalling more than 30 days within the previous 12 months. In practice, persons in long-stay care do not usually hold medical cards as the hospital takes responsibility for all of the person's health needs. Persons with dependants are also exempt.</P>
    <P>The over-riding consideration in applying long-stay charges is that persons with means who are in receipt of long-term care should make a contribution towards the cost of their maintenance. In deciding the amount to be contributed health boards have regard to the person's individual circumstances. Allowance is made for any financial commitments the person may have and a reasonable amount is left to meet the person's personal needs. Charges may be waived if, in the opinion of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board, payment would cause undue hardship.</P>

    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, in November 1997, I approved phase 1 of a major redevelopment programme for the Mater Hospital campus, <Col N="404" /> to include the accident and emergency; out-patient department; hospital sterile services department and operating theatres, at a cost limit of £25 million. In May 1998, I approved the appointment of the design team for the development and the planning is now under way.</P>
    <P>With regard to problems in accident and emergency departments generally, the levels of attendance at accident and emergency departments are complex and difficult to predict and in this regard all accident and emergency departments experience periods of exceptional demand which can result in delays for patients. However, it is important to note that appropriate medical treatment is provided at all times and that waiting periods are kept to an absolute minimum.</P>
    <P>In 1998, I made an additional £2.3 million available for the development of accident and emergency services. This additional funding was used primarily for the launch by the Eastern Health Board of a national public education campaign aimed at persuading people with minor ailments to attend their family doctor rather than a hospital accident and emergency department, and also the development of a range of initiatives in major accident and emergency departments. Within this funding, the Mater Hospital received an allocation of £200,000, this funding was deployed for the provision of additional accident and emergency staff in order to alleviate pressures in the accident and emergency department.</P>
    <P>This year I provided further funding of £2 million to enable major acute hospitals to implement various initiatives aimed at addressing some of the difficulties being experienced in our accident and emergency departments particularly during periods of peak demand. These initiatives will include measures to free up beds for emergency admissions through the provision of alternative step down facilities for patients occupying beds in acute hospitals for lengthy periods. They will allow for the provision of enhanced staffing levels, the development of rapid diagnostic systems for common emergency presentations, continued development of treatment-observation areas in accident and emergency departments and an improved access for general practitioners to urgent specialist opinion.</P>
    <P>As part of this overall funding, a sum of £210,000 was allocated to the Mater Hospital for accident and emergency improvements. The hospital has undertaken a number of measures to improve systems for dealing with patients attending the accident and emergency department and I hope they will provide a more acceptable environment for patients and alleviate some of the current problems.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that I have also published the report of the review group on the waiting list initiative and I am committed to ensuring its recommended approach is implemented. The report is one of a number of measures which I have taken to address the question of long waiting lists and waiting times. I have provided a total of £20 million for waiting list activity in 1999. This <Col N="405" /> is a 66 per cent increase over the amount provided in 1998 and is two and a half times higher than the sum of £8 million provided by the previous Government in 1997. The report recommended the implementation of a range of steps to free up acute hospital facilities for more elective work. It pointed out that a significant proportion of acute hospital beds were being inappropriately used by patients who did not need, or who no longer needed, acute hospital care. This problem arises due to a shortage of places in the areas of &ldquo;step-down&rdquo; or convalescent care, rehabilitation facilities and community based services which reduce the need to use acute hospital care.</P>
    <P>In an effort to address these problems, I have provided extra funding in 1999 of £9 million for services for older people. This funding will help to free up acute hospital beds which are currently occupied by patients who could be accommodated in more appropriate convalescent or extended care facilities or discharged home if adequate community supports were available. It will be used, <i>inter alia,</i> to improve the home help service, increase the number of nursing and paramedical staff in the community, provide support for carers, enable a number of new health board convalescent or extended care facilities to open and increase the number of private nursing home places either subvented or contracted by health boards. There are also a number of chronic sick in acute hospitals who have completed the acute phase of their illness and who are awaiting placement at a level of care more appropriate to their needs. The task of securing appropriate alternative care facilities for them is under way and this also will have a significant impact on freeing up acute beds in general hospitals over the coming months. I am confident that the measures I have outlined will contribute to improvements in availability of beds in the acute sector and ease pressures in accident and emergency departments in Dublin.</P>

      <P>The arrangements for the provision of influenza vaccination to at-risk persons in the general medical service are a matter for the health boards in the first instance. Influenza vaccination has been administered by general practitioners free of charge to general medical services patients for many years. This year the Irish Medical Organisation has sought that general practitioners be paid for administering this vaccine to GMS patients.  I understand that this matter is the subject of discussions between the health boards and the Irish Medical Organisation under the auspices of the Health Service Employers' Agency.</P>

It would appear practical to await the proposals from the Commission, which will give guidance on how such therapies should be regulated.</P>
      <P>It is acknowledged that it is desirable to afford some protection to members of the public who wish to avail of such therapies. It is my Department's policy to encourage the various therapies to establish their own regulatory structures and to develop mechanisms to inform the public about the availability of services from reputable practitioners.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of medical services to eligible persons at Waterford Regional Hospital is a matter for the South-Eastern Health Board in the first instance. The board received funding of £697,000 under the waiting list initiative in 1998 which represented an increase of 44 per cent on the funding approved by the previous Government in 1997. In 1999 I provided a total of £1,351,000 to the South-Eastern Health Board under the waiting list initiative. This has enabled the board to target an additional 192 ENT procedures at Waterford Regional Hospital during this year. The board's waiting list returns for the quarter ended 30 June 1999 indicate that a reduction of 63 or 19 per cent has already been achieved in the numbers waiting for ENT surgery since the start of the year. This represents an overall reduction of 47 per cent in the numbers waiting for ENT surgery since end of December 1997.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that nationally the waiting list figures at the end of June 1999 show a reduction of 1,072 on the March figures. This means that waiting lists have fallen by almost 3,000, some 8 per cent since the beginning of this year. The reductions in March and June 1999 are the first since December 1996. The results are the first time in which waiting lists have fallen in two successive quarters.</P>
      <P>Since coming into office I have taken an integrated approach to the problem of waiting lists. As the Deputy will be aware, I commissioned a review of the waiting list initiative. I am now implementing a series of measures aimed at tackling the root causes of waiting lists. I allocated £20 million this year to agencies specifically to undertake waiting list work, with £3 million of this funding being allocated to the agencies who achieved the greatest improvements in their waiting lists in the first quarter of the year. This was in line with the recommendations of the review group report.</P>
      <P>I also allocated £9 million to services to older people and £2 million to accident and emergency services with the aim of freeing acute hospital beds by ensuring the streamlining of emergency services and providing additional step-down and rehabilitation facilities for older people.</P>
      <P>I am confident the measures I have taken in tackling waiting lists represents the best way of addressing the underlying causes of waiting lists and long waiting times.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 544 and 565 together.</P>
      <P>Under article 30 of the Road Traffic (Construction, Equipment and Use) Regulations 1963  &ndash; SI No. 190 of 1963, made under the Road Traffic Act, 1961 &ndash; vehicles are required to be so constructed so as to prevent the emission of air pollutants to the extent reasonably possible. Progressively more stringent vehicle emission control standards have been incorporated into Irish legislation by way of the European Communities (Mechanically Propelled Vehicles Emission Control) Regulations, 1992 to 1998 (SI Nos. 363 of 1992, 363 of 1993, 194 of 1994, 192 of 1995, 318 of 1996, 382 of 1996, 518 of 1997, 211 of 1998, 356 of 1998), made under the European Communities Act, 1972 (No. 27 of 1972).</P>
      <P>The Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992 (Control of Volatile Organic Compound Emissions Resulting from Petrol Storage and Distribution) Regulations, 1997 (SI No. 374 of 1997) and the Air Pollution Act, 1987 (Petroleum Vapour Emissions) Regulations, 1997 (SI No. 375 of 1997) transpose Council Directive 94/63/EC to introduce controls on volatile organic compound emissions resulting from petrol storage and distribution at terminals and from the storage and distribution of petrol which is intended for use as a fuel for motor vehicles, respectively.</P>
      <P>My Department is currently drafting regulations to transpose Council Directives 98/69/EC amending Directive 70/220/EEC relating to measures to be taken against air pollution by emissions from motor vehicles, and 98/70/EC amending Directive 93/12/EEC relating to the quality of petrol and diesel fuels, into national legislation. These regulations will strengthen current vehicle emission standards for passenger cars and light commercial vehicles and the environmental specifications for petrol and diesel fuels respectively.</P>
      <P>In relation to the phasing out of the marketing of leaded petrol by 1 January 2000, my Department has written to all owners of pre-1986 petrol engined vehicles to inform them of the alternative options once leaded petrol is no longer available on the market. I have also launched a poster campaign in partnership with the Irish Petroleum Industry Association to alert the public to these options.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Roadworthiness testing of light and heavy goods vehicles and buses has been carried out since 1982. In accordance with the European Communities (Vehicle Testing) Regulations 1991, as amended, (SI No. 356 of 1991), a vehicle which does not meet the prescribed emission standards is not issued with a test certificate; it is an offence to use a goods vehicle in a public place unless a valid test certificate is in force for the vehicle. <Col N="416" /> Motor tax offices do not issue a tax disc for a liable vehicle unless a valid test certificate is in force for the vehicle.</P>
    <P>On 4 January 2000 mandatory road worthiness testing of passenger cars, in accordance with the Road Traffic (Car Testing) Regulations 1998 (SI No. 481 of 1998), will commence on a phased basis relating to the age of the vehicles; older vehicles will be tested first. The test parameters include age-related emission standards for air pollutants. The regulations include a requirement on motor tax offices not to issue a tax disc for a liable vehicle in the absence of a valid test certificate. Enforcement of the regulations will be a matter for the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that type approval requirements for the manufacture of vehicles, the specification of standards for petrol and diesel fuels, the controls on VOC emissions at fuel terminals and service stations, and the operational testing of vehicles provide a sufficient basis for controlling emissions and are adequately provided for under the current regulatory framework. I have no plans to introduce new requirements in this regard under the Air Pollution Act, 1987.</P>

      <P>Local authorities have powers under the Local Government Act, 1994, to make by-laws regulating use of facilities they provide, including public parks, and these by-laws generally specify offences and penalties. The presence of local authority parks staff acts as a deterrent to breaches of the by-laws and they can also take enforcement action. However, in cases of public order infringements to which I suspect the Deputy is referring, the more appropriate enforcement agency is the Garda; the 1994 Act specifically provides for Garda enforcement. <Col N="417" /> The Deputy will be aware that public parks are a local authority responsibility and specific problems associated with them requiring Garda attention would be a matter for liaison between the local authority concerned and the Garda.</P>
      <P>I should add that I intend to introduce a community warden service in local authorities, initially on a pilot basis. Preliminary discussions have taken place with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform on the role of these wardens and on the design of the new service.</P>

      <P>Individual road authorities are directly responsible for the provision, maintenance and funding of signposting and roadway markings on non-national roads, either through their own resources and/or through discretionary grants made available by my Department. Approximately £23 million has been allocated to county councils in discretionary grants this year, while the discretionary block grant allocation to urban authorities is £13.9 million, including £4.2 million for a programme of footpath and carriageway repairs. Overall this represents an increase of 23 per cent over 1998 in the level of discretionary finance for non-national roads being made available to local authorities. In addition, local authority own resource provision for non-national roads in 1999 is estimated at almost £84 million.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the circular letter which issued to all road authorities in August 1998 was to remind them of the importance of providing and maintaining a high standard of road signage in the interests of road safety and to ensure that road users receive necessary information clearly and in good time. Accordingly, road authorities were requested to carry out a detailed review of signage in their functional areas and to put in place plans to bring signage up to the standards set out in the traffic signs manual as soon as possible. It was not intended that my Department should exercise supervision of this process, but that it should be taken forward through the ongoing and expanding operation of the non-national roads programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The National Roads Authority is responsible for the funding of signposting on the national roads network and in 1995 the NRA embarked on a major programme of improvement to directional signing and lining throughout the network <Col N="419" /> of national primary roads. Expenditure on the programme up to the end of 1998 is almost £10 million and a further £4 million is being provided this year. At this stage the improvement programme for national primary routes has been completed and work has commenced on national secondary roads with a view to completion by end 2002.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey):</NameTxt>
      <P>Following publication of the 1997 EPA report on drinking water quality, my Department wrote to sanitary authorities in April this year in relation to a number of policy issues arising from the report. Sanitary authorities were reminded, <i>inter alia</i>, of the critical importance of optimising the operation of water treatment plants and were asked to examine all aspects of the operation of treatment plants in the light of the recommendations set out in the report. Responsibility for the provision of drinking water supplies and for compliance with prescribed quality standards rests with local authorities, under the general supervision of the Environmental Protection Agency. Generally, my Department does not ask sanitary authorities to report on the operation of treatment plants.</P>
      <P>Due to relatively high levels of exceedances of the microbiological parameters in certain areas, my Department requested 11 sanitary authorities to report on their proposals to remedy deficiencies identified in the EPA report. Reports have been received from eight of these authorities indicating that, where needed, appropriate remedial action is being taken.</P>
      <P>My Department, through the water services national training group in association with FÁS, is actively promoting best practice in the operation and management of water supply infrastructure by local authorities and provides training and certification for operatives, technicians and managers with responsibility for water treatment and distribution systems.</P>
      <P>In addition, my Department is supporting a number of technical assistance measures to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of water services infrastructure management. These include the creation of a computerised complete information system which will provide an integrated database to facilitate the presentation and assessment of data on individual schemes in report and graphical format for local management. A national water study is also under way to examine the estimated 120 public supplies serving population equivalents of more than 5,000. The aim of the study is to create a detailed inventory of major water schemes and,<i> inter alia,</i> to identify the quality of the infrastructure, the existing demand-supply situation and the most appropriate way of undertaking necessary improvements. The study is due to be completed early in 2000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy):</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of new houses financed without a mortgage in 1998 is likely to have been considerably less than 14,994. Returns from mortgage lending institutions show that 27,355 mortgage loans were advanced for new houses during 1998. Of the total of 42,349 new houses completed in 1998, 3,263 were provided for renting by local authorities and voluntary housing bodies. Moreover, mortgages for some houses completed in 1998 would not have been advanced within the year.</P>
      <P>The number of houses financed without a mortgage is not a valid indication of investor activity. A significant proportion of investment purchases are funded by mortgage. Equally, many houses are purchased or built for owner occupation without a mortgage, for example, through use of equity realised from sale of a more expensive house, own resources, inheritances, or non-mortgage borrowing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is widely acknowledged that withdrawal of <Col N="423" /> certain fiscal incentives to investment in residential property in the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1998, has removed investor-based overheating in the housing market. Continued investment to provide housing for rent is both desirable and consistent with the Government's decision that provision of over-generous fiscal incentives was no longer warranted. However, investors are no longer competing with first-time buyers in the starter home market with the aid of tax incentives.</P>

      <P>Draft guidelines for planning authorities on residential density were published in March this year for public consultation and local authorities were asked to take them on board. A wide range of interested bodies, including local and other statutory authorities and non-governmental organisations, availed of the opportunity to comment on the guidelines. <Col N="424" /> The overall thrust of the guidelines received general support. All comments received were considered in preparing the final guidelines and it was possible to take on board many of the issues raised. The final version of the guidelines was published yesterday and copies are available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>The guidelines are intended to assist planning authorities, An Bord Pleanála, developers and the general public by providing guidance on the benefits of higher residential density in appropriate locations and on the safeguards required in promoting greater residential density generally.</P>
      <P>The guidelines are one element of the Government's continuing response to the issue of house prices and housing supply and give effect to Government policy of encouraging more sustainable urban development through the avoidance of excessive suburbanisation and the promotion of higher residential densities in appropriate locations, especially in conjunction with improved public transport systems. The application of appropriate densities in accordance with the guidelines will help to achieve optimal use of available land particularly in locations such as Dublin where land supply is limited and demand for housing is very high.</P>
      <P>In relation to implementation, it is through the development plan and the exercise of their development control functions that planning authorities can take effective action to achieve higher levels of residential density. It is too early yet to get a full picture of the impact of the draft guidelines in the six months since their issue. However, in issuing the final guidelines, I have asked planning authorities to review and vary their development plans to give full effect to the recommendations and policies contained in the guidelines, where they have not already done so. The local authorities and An Bord Pleanála have been told that the guidelines are policies to which planning authorities under section 7(1) of the Local Government Act, 1991, and An Bord Pleanála under section 5 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1976, are obliged to have regard. I have asked planning authorities to forward to my Department by the end of 1999, details of their proposals to ensure implementation of the guidelines.</P>

There is strong evidence that the range of measures being taken by the Government to remove overheating <Col N="425" /> in the housing market and accelerate housing supply are bringing about significant moderation in house price increases.</P>
      <P>House price statistics for the June quarter, 1999 contained in the housing statistics bulletin published by my Department show that new house prices increased by only 1 per cent nationally and 2.6 per cent in Dublin in the June quarter.

The annual rate of increase in new house prices in Dublin was lower than at any period since the last quarter of 1996 and contrasts with a peak rate just prior to the publication of the first Bacon report and the Government's <i>Action on House Prices,</i> of more than 37 per cent in the first quarter of 1998 compared with the first quarter of 1997. The annual rates of increase in second-hand house prices &ndash; 18.9 per cent in Dublin and 22.3 per cent nationally &ndash; are also moderating and are well below the peak annual rates of 42 per cent in Dublin and 37 per cent nationally in 1998.</P>

Key public service interrelationships are set out in my Department's statement of strategy and a variety of structures are availed of, including participation in committees, liaison and inter-departmental networks, to ensure effective, co-ordinated and linked responses to issues impacting on its work. I am satisfied these arrangements provide an adequate mechanism for the co-ordination of work with other Departments and I will keep the position under ongoing review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy):</NameTxt>
      <P>I introduced significant improvements to the terms and conditions of the disabled persons grants scheme in December last. Under the terms of the scheme, grants are payable by local authorities in the first instance with subsequent recoupment by my Department. My Department makes an annual allocation to each housing authority based on estimates of demand for the scheme provided by the authorities. It is open to housing authorities to seek a higher allocation in the event of increased demand under the scheme.</P>
      <P>The effective maximum grant payable under the scheme was increased by 50 per cent from £8,000 to £12,000 in the case of works commenced on or after 2 December 1998. In addition, the maximum grant payable in respect of private houses was increased to three-quarters of the approved cost of the works compared to two-thirds previously. The maximum recoupment payable by my Department to local authorities in respect of each grant was also increased to two-thirds or £8,000 compared to a maximum recoupment of 50 per cent or £4,000 previously. This increase in the recoupment rate allows local authorities to pay the higher grants now available at no increased cost to the authority.</P>

      <P>The Government strategy for road safety 1998-2002 indicated that changes to speed limit regimes, which were comprehensively reviewed some years ago, were not proposed in the immediate term: the priority must instead be to secure a much higher level of compliance with existing speed limits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="428" /> However, the option of revising speed limits downwards is not ruled out if enforcement of existing limits does not show good progress towards the strategy goal of reducing present excessive levels of speeding by 50 per cent. Such downward revisions could address lower speed limits, such as 30 kilometres per hour, in built up areas.</P>

    <P>In all, 99 schemes are scheduled to commence construction in 1999 which will produce in the region of 60,000 additional sites. A further 43 schemes, representing a further 35,000 sites, will commence next year. In general, once schemes are in progress work on construction of the houses which they will service can also start and run in parallel. To date, £1.1 million has been paid on foot of claims received from local authorities under the initiative.</P>
    <P>Any additional proposals brought forward by the local authorities will be considered in the light of ongoing demand and progress with other approved projects.</P>

      <P>A septic tank installed in accordance with Part H of the second schedule to the building regulations and the related technical guidance document H (drainage and waste water disposal) would comply with the building code. Compliance with the building code is primarily the responsibility of the designers, builders and owners of the houses involved. The regulations apply to septic tanks installed on or after 1 June 1992.</P>
      <P>The enforcement of the building regulations is a matter for the local building control authorities.</P>

      <P>The scheme for the sale of low cost housing sites is designed to assist people in need of housing to obtain sites from their local authority at low cost and to provide for their housing needs, either individually or through co-operative or voluntary housing bodies. The administration of this scheme is devolved to the local authorities and it is a matter for individual local authorities to fully assess applicants to ensure that the sites in question are being disposed of to eligible persons or bodies under the scheme.</P>
      <P>I believe the case referred to by the Deputy to be an exceptional one. However, I would be concerned where in any individual case an apparently excessive profit was made on the early resale of a house provided on a low cost site. I understand that the local authority involved in this particular case has made arrangements that in all new disposals of low cost sites, there is a clause allowing for a tapered repayment of the subsidy similar to that under the affordable housing scheme. I will be requesting all local authorities to provide for a similar form of &ldquo;clawback&rdquo; arrangement under the low cost housing site scheme.</P>

      <P>I welcome the publication of the report that was commissioned by the Combat Poverty Agency and the Katharine Howard Foundation with some financial support from my Department. The main aim of the study was to investigate the living conditions and quality of life in local authority housing estates and to identify the implications for housing policy and practice with particular reference to the residents' perspective. The research is based on the experiences of local residents in seven estates, along with the views of key external agencies, including local authorities. The report contains detailed recommendations for the reform of housing policy and practice; work related to some of these recommendations was already in progress prior to the publication of the report. The study underlines the fundamental contribution that local authority housing has made to Irish society over the years and recognises the considerable progress that has been made by many authorities in the management of their housing estates. It finds a considerable diversity in living conditions between and within the estates studied. The report notes that this is attributable more to social factors, notably social order issues, than to housing quality or the physical environment. While problems undoubtedly exist in certain areas, the report acknowledges <Col N="437" /> that many local authorities have improved the management of their housing service and that efforts to manage problems in the local authority housing sector in a positive manner have begun to emerge in recent years.</P>
      <P>A copy of the report has been sent to each county and city manager for consideration. Also, I have approved funding to support a conference being organised by the Combat Poverty Agency and the Katharine Howard Foundation in Dublin on 28 October 1999, to consider the issues raised by the report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy):</NameTxt>
      <P>Local authorities undertook an assessment of housing needs at 31 March 1999 and the results will be published shortly. The Government has, however, already responded to increased social housing needs by increasing the level of the local authority programme from 3,900 housing starts-acquisition in 1998 to 4,500 in the current year. A new multi-annual programme will commence next year which will be resourced to deliver 22,000 local authority dwellings over the period 2000-2003. I intend to notify local authorities shortly of their housing starts allocations under this programme.</P>
      <P>The Government is also committed to increasing output from the voluntary housing sector to 4,000-5,000 dwellings annually over the coming years. Overall, I expect that the local authority housing programme, together with output from the complementary social housing measures and vacancies occurring in the existing housing stock, will enable the housing needs of more than 10,300 households to be catered for in 1999 and that the increased social housing output over the next four years will meet the needs of over 60,000 households.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 591 and 616 together.</P>
      <P>It is a matter for the relevant planning authority, and An Bord Pleanála on appeal, to assess whether or not a particular site is suitable for on-site disposal of effluent, and if necessary to attach the appropriate conditions in any planning permission granted. In the case of septic tanks, the Standard Recommendation for Septic Tank Systems, S.R.6: 1991, drawn up by the National Standards Authority of Ireland, was brought to the attention of local authorities by way of my Department's circular letter PD1/92 of 8 January 1992. Local authorities were requested, <i>inter alia</i>, to ensure that septic tank and percolation systems were properly installed in accordance with the planning permission granted and the standard recommendation.</P>
      <P>The standard recommendation provides guidance for the proper maintenance of septic tanks by way of regular desludging and the proper disposal of the sludge. Primary responsibility for ensuring proper maintenance of septic tanks and compliance with any relevant planning conditions rests with the owners of the septic tanks. In circular letter PD 1/92, local authorities were requested to consider appropriate educational, publicity and advisory measures on proper maintenance and desludging regimes for septic tanks. My Department's circular letter PD 3/94 advised planning authorities on dealing with the alternative proprietary waste water treatment systems which in certain circumstances can offer equal or better protection to groundwater than a septic tank and percolation area.</P>
      <P>Local authorities, as statutory pollution control authorities, have a full range of powers and remedies available under the Water Pollution Acts, 1977 to 1990, to deal with any pollution or potential pollution from septic tanks.</P>
      <P>In relation to the building regulations, I refer to my reply to Question No. 581 on today's Order Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The publication Groundwater Protection Schemes, launched in May 1999, provides guidance for local authorities on the preparation of groundwater protection schemes. The publication was developed jointly by the Geological Survey <Col N="439" /> of Ireland, the Environmental Protection Agency and my Department. Groundwater protection schemes are intended to provide practical guidance to assist planning and licensing authorities in their decision-making in relation to the location, nature and control of developments and activities which have potential to pollute groundwater. The schemes are used to develop land-use zoning maps, which indicate, on a prioritised basis, areas in which additional investigations or groundwater protection measures are, or may be, required, that is  precautionary conditions and prohibition of specified activities-developments. Two supplementary publications, Groundwater Protection Responses for Landfills and Groundwater Protection Responses to the Landspreading of Organic Wastes were also published in May. A similar &ldquo;responses&rdquo; publication is being prepared in relation to threats to groundwaters from single house systems, which would include septic tanks.</P>

      <P>I have no proposals to allow splitting of the grant where one of two joint purchasers qualifies and the other does not.</P>
      <P>Persons who were previously married may, in certain circumstances, qualify for the grant. Section 5(4) of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1979 &ndash; as inserted by section 25 of the Housing Act, 1988 &ndash; enables the payment of a £3,000 new house grant to a person who, or whose spouse, had previously purchased or built a house and whose marriage has subsequently been dissolved or annulled by order of a court or who has separated under an order of court or by deed of separation, where the Minister is satisfied as to the person's need for housing and that refusal to pay a grant would cause undue hardship.</P>

      <P>A grant provision of £1.093 million, funded from the national lottery, in respect of the provision of communal facilities in existing or new housing projects provided by voluntary groups is available in 1999. The maximum grant available is £3,500 per unit of accommodation provided and a list of the projects and the amounts approved in respect of 22 projects so far approved this year is set out in the following table.</P>
      <P>Local authorities have recently been advised in new social housing design guidelines issued by the Department that they should consider ways to facilitate and encourage the provision of services and amenities including community buildings, either within or adjacent to the site of proposed schemes. The type of building to be provided should be based on needs identified in consultation with the residents. They were advised that funding from scheme budgets is limited and relates to the size and nature of individual schemes and that additional sources of funding and the possibility of shared use of facilities with residents of adjacent developments should be investigated so as to ensure that the best and most appropriate provision is made. The provision of community facilities in new local authority housing schemes is a matter for individual local authorities in the first instance and any proposals which may be put to my Department will be considered an a scheme by scheme basis.</P>

      <P>The 1998 policy statement, Changing our Ways, emphasises the need to move rapidly from reliance on a large number of often problematic landfill facilities to an integrated network of waste management facilities, employing environmentally beneficial technologies, and incorporating a small number of state of the art landfills for residual wastes. There is considerable scope for the provision and operation of the requisite infrastructure by means of public private partnership arrangements, involving capital investment by the private sector.</P>
      <P>Where local authorities are required in the short-term to upgrade existing facilities, in order to meet the high environmental standards being applied by the EPA in licensing waste disposal facilities, it is open to those authorities to utilise own resources to ensure full recoupment of the costs involved.</P>

      <P>A detailed examination of the issues that arise in relation to the sale of local authority flats concluded that no practical arrangement could be made which would be satisfactory to tenant purchasers or local authorities or even to other tenants in a flat complex who would not wish to purchase. The three main reasons why local authority flats would be a bad buy for tenants relate to:</P>
      <P>&ndash;the level of service charges that would be necessary;</P>
      <P>&ndash;public liability insurance; and</P>
      <P>&ndash;the future saleability of purchased flats.</P>
      <P>These matters were outlined in detail in the 1996 policy document &ldquo;Social Housing &ndash; The Way Ahead&rdquo;, copies of which are available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>Local authorities were, therefore, advised that flats should not be offered for sale under the current tenant purchase scheme, but that authorities should give consideration to the sale of maisonettes, particularly those which do not have common areas, where satisfactory arrangements, not involving the difficulties that arise in the case of flats, could be devised.</P>
      <P>The difficulties and disadvantages for tenants of purchasing local authority flats which have been clearly identified still apply and, consequently, there are no proposals to amend the scheme in this respect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey):</NameTxt>
      <P>The question appears to be based on a misunderstanding of the Kenny report recommendations. The majority Kenny report recommended that development land which had been serviced or was due to be serviced by the local authority would be designated by the High Court and that the cost of the acquisition of such land by a local authority would be determined by reference to its existing use value plus 25 per cent. The majority Kenny report recommendations were put forward in different circumstances to those which exist today and it should not be assumed that the Kenny Committee would recommend the same approach in today's circumstances. The Kenny Committee's principal concerns related to the large increase in land value due to the servicing of the land by the local authorities at the expense of the community. Today, developers pay a much greater part of the cost of the infrastructure required to facilitate development through development levies for water, roads, sewerage, etc.</P>
      <P>The constitutionality of the Kenny report recommendations was questioned in a minority report and a joint Oireachtas committee in 1985, which received cross-party support, decided that the issue was best dealt with by other means.</P>
      <P>Part V of the Planning and Development Bill, 1999, aims to achieve a better balance between supply and demand for houses by ensuring an adequate supply of building land to meet the housing needs of the area. Local authorities will be required to prepare housing strategies to provide for all the housing requirements in the area. The housing strategy will include a specific policy that a specified percentage, which cannot exceed 20 per cent, of residentially zoned land will be reserved for the provision of social and affordable housing. A condition of the grant of planning permission for the development of land with such an objective will be the transfer to the local authority of the specified percentage of land at its existing use value rather than a value based on residential zoning. Where such land was purchased before the publication of the Bill, the compensation will be based on the actual price paid. I believe that the approach in Part V is a balanced, equitable and proportionate response to today's housing needs.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="446" /> The effective maximum grant payable under the scheme was increased by 50 per cent from £8,000 to £12,000 in the case of works commenced on or after 2 December 1998. In addition, the maximum grant payable in respect of private houses was increased to three-quarters of the approved cost of the works compared to two-thirds previously, subject to the overall maximum grant of £12,000. In the case of local authority rented houses the maximum grant payable covers the full cost of the approved works.</P>
    <P>In cases where an applicant faces a difficulty in meeting their portion of the total cost of the works involved, local authorities may assist through the provision of a house improvement loan. If the applicant cannot afford to avail of the loan scheme due to the cost of servicing a loan, it would be open to the authority to provide the full cost of the works under the scheme of improvement works in lieu of local authority housing, subject to the applicant being approved for local authority housing.</P>

    <P>County councils have been asked to prepare and submit plans on this basis.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="451" /> Cork County Council with 25 eligible towns is the only county with more than 20 eligible towns and is, therefore, the only one with an entitlement to submit seven plans. In determining the number of towns per county for which plans were to be prepared every effort was made to strike a balance between keeping the TRP process manageable, while, at the same time, allowing councils to submit a reasonable number of plans for the first phase of the scheme. The first phase will run for three years and consideration will be given to extending it to other towns after that.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, I do not propose to alter the limits in the guidelines.</P>

      <P>A preliminary report for the Skibbereen sewerage treatment works has been submitted to my Department. The report will be considered in the context of Cork County Council's review of sludge strategy for the county which is due to be completed shortly, and which may have implications for the design of the Skibbereen scheme.</P>
      <P>In addition, as the scheme is not included in the 1999 water and sewerage services investment programme it comes within the terms of my Department's circular letter L9/98 of 22 October 1998. This circular asked each local authority to undertake a fresh assessment of the needs for capital works in its area and to prepare a prioritised list of projects based on the assessment. The priority lists will be taken into consideration by my Department in framing future water and sewerage services investment programmes under the next national development plan 2000-06.</P>

      <P>It is the responsibility of each local authority to ensure that they have adequate staffing resources to discharge their statutory planning functions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most recent survey of local authority plan<Col N="452" /> ning departments, carried out by my Department, showed that overall staffing levels, both administrative and professional, in the larger local authorities, that is, county councils and county borough corporations, had increased to 753 in May 1999 from 660.5 in June 1998. Three hundred and ten of the 753 were professional planners and the following table gives a breakdown as between authorities and the corresponding population figures. However, the information requested on the grades of professional planners in the individual planning authorities is not available in my Department. Generally, the planning functions of the smaller authorities are carried out by the staff of the mainline authorities. Population would not be regarded as a critical criterion for comparing staffing levels between authorities.</P>
    <P>In April 1998, my Department wrote to planning authorities asking that they avail of the opportunity presented by planning fee increases, which were effected by new regulations at that time, to consider the possibility of employing more professional planners. My Department again wrote to local authority managers in July 1998 asking that they consider the adequacy of their professional/technical and administrative/ clerical staffing in order to ensure that the planning system does not cause bottlenecks in meeting demand and delivers the best possible service to the customer. The Department has approved all requests for additional professional planners.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 630 and 673 together.</P>
      <P>On 26 July 1999 the Government decided that asylum seekers who have been in this country more than 12 months while awaiting a final determination on their application for refugee status, and who have been complying with their obligations as asylum seekers, are now permitted to work. In addition, this new arrangement will apply to those who have sought asylum here up to 26 July 1999 as soon as they cross the 12 month threshold.</P>
      <P>Prior to this decision, asylum seekers claimed supplementary welfare allowance, SWA, which is administered on my behalf by the health boards. Asylum seekers who are now permitted to work are entitled to claim unemployment assistance, UA. The rate of payment is the same for both schemes at £72 weekly for a single adult. While seeking employment and claiming UA, asylum seekers may continue to claim rent supplement from their local health centre.</P>
      <P>Arrangements are currently being put in place by the Department to ensure the smooth transfer of claims from the health boards to the Department's local offices. The operation will commence in mid-October. To date, SWA payments have ceased in six cases where work permits have already issued. There are some 2,500 cases scheduled to be transferred between mid-October and</P>
      <P>mid-December 1999 and it is estimated that a further 1,500 cases may be transferred by 26 July 2000. The final numbers transferred will depend on the progress made in finalising asylum claims in the meantime.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the SWA scheme is to provide a basic weekly allowance to people who have little or no income. Where an application for asylum has been refused SWA payments, including rent supplement, cease once the person concerned is no longer resident in the State.</P>
      <P>Procedures have been put in place to ensure that the health boards are kept informed as asylum applications are finalised. I am satisfied that these procedures are operating satisfactorily.</P>

      <P>The question of accommodating joint custody arrangements within the social welfare system is a difficult and complex issue and any solution proposed must strike a reasonable balance between acknowledging the caring role of the parents involved, maintaining the integrity of existing social welfare schemes and avoiding excessive additional expenditure or administrative overheads. The Department is conscious of the need to develop a policy in this area as joint custody arrangements will become increasingly common with the growing emphasis on mediated settlements between separating couples.</P>
      <P>A departmental working group was established to examine all of the issues relating to joint custody and the social welfare system together with the possible options of accommodating such arrangements within the system. The findings of this group will now be examined as part of a review of the one-parent family payment which is being undertaken under the Department's expenditure review programme. This review has recently started and it is hoped to have it completed early next year.</P>

      <P>In July this year I brought proposals to Government for the setting up of a national framework for the development of integrated public service delivery systems. The Government, on foot of these proposals, has given approval to the establishment of an initiative, known as REACH, which will be progressed by a cross-departmental unit. The REACH unit is being established under the provisions of section 12 of the Public Service Management Act, 1997.</P>
      <P>The main objectives of the REACH initiative are: to progress take up of a common identifier &ndash; the personal public service number &ndash; by providers of State services; to co-ordinate the integration of services between Departments and agencies; to develop a public services card for access to State services; to integrate the processes for registration of births with the issue of new personal public services numbers; and to develop a database for means information that will be shared by relevant departments and agencies for specified purposes.</P>
      <P>I will be responsible to Government for progressing the REACH initiative, which is being established initially for a three year period to end 2002.</P>

      <Quest>the reason actual value of a house and not the rental income is taken into account when a house is taken as means for social welfare purposes.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>Social welfare payments can be broadly divided into two main areas &ndash; social insurance and social assistance schemes. Entitlement to social insurance payments is determined by reference to the level of PRSI contributions paid and is not affected by the claimant's means. However, where a person has not paid PRSI contributions or has insufficient PRSI contributions to qualify for a social insurance payment, he-she may apply for a means tested social assistance payment.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the means test is to ensure that the limited resources available are directed at those most in need. Therefore, in assessing means, account is taken of any cash income the person may have, for example, earnings from employment or self-employment, together with the value of any capital or property owned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, it is important to note that, unlike the situation which applies in some other countries, the means test does not take any account of the person's home. In addition, for old age pension purposes, where a pensioner sells his or her principal residence and buys or rents more suitable accommodation or moves into a private nursing home, the balance of the proceeds after buying new accommodation will be exempted up to a limit of £75,000. Therefore, it is only where a <Col N="464" /> person has other property, apart from the family home, that the value of that additional property is assessed.</P>
    <P>As there are substantial numbers of people in receipt of weekly social assistance payments, it would not be practical to assess means from capital or property on the basis of actual returns from these investments. This would necessitate frequent reviews of the entitlements of a very significant number of recipients whenever interest rates fluctuated or whenever rents were increased. For this reason a notional value is ascribed to the capital or property owned.</P>
    <P>Under the current arrangements for assessing capital and property the first £2,000 is disregarded, the next £20,000 is assessed at 7.5 per cent and the balance is assessed at 15 per cent. These arrangements, which were provided for by my predecessor, have applied to non-contributory pensions since October 1997.</P>
    <P>While the formula for the notional assessment of capital and property includes rates of 7.5 per cent and 15 per cent, the actual effective assessment rates are much lower. For example, a single pensioner can have capital of up to £6,160 and a couple can have capital of up to £12,320 and still qualify for the maximum rate of old age non-contributory pension. In addition, a couple with capital of £20,000 would only be assessed with means of £600, giving an effective assessment rate of just 3 per cent. As a little over 4 per cent of pensioners have capital in excess of £20,000, this means that the effective assessment rates for the vast majority of pensioners are very much lower than the 7.5 per cent and 15 per cent rates which are used in the notional assessment formula.</P>
    <P>In addition to the objectives set out above, the current formula used in determining the value of capital or property is also designed to disregard a certain amount of capital from the assessment in</P>
    <P>recognition of sudden and unforeseen needs which may arise; attribute a value to the potential investment income which the capital or property is capable of generating; and recognise that, in addition to the value of the income which the capital or property is capable of generating, there is a further benefit to the claimant through the possession of that capital or property.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, the current system is designed to ensure that those with modest amounts of capital receive the greater share of available support, while the small proportion of people with large amounts of capital or property should avail of it to contribute, at least partially, towards meeting their needs.</P>
    <P>The effect of current investment returns on social assistance payments has already been brought to my attention by a number of Deputies. In this regard, my Department is examining the arrangements for assessing the value of capital and property owned. I should point out, however, that any relaxation of the current rules would have financial implications and could only be considered in the context of the budget.</P>

      <P>A special half-rate old age contributory pension is being introduced this year for self-employed persons who were aged 56 or over on 6 April 1988 &ndash; when PRSI contributions for the self-employed were first introduced &ndash; and who have at least five years', 260, contributions paid since then.</P>
      <P>The records of my Department show that the person concerned has a total of four years', 208, PRSI contributions recorded since April 1992, when he first started paying PRSI. These are paid for the tax years 1992-93, 1993-94, 1994-95 and 1995-96. As he reached age 66 in the 1996-97 tax year, there would not have been a PRSI charge for that year or any future years. On this basis, he does not qualify for the new pension.</P>
      <P>Persons who paid social insurance contributions while self-employed and who do not qualify for old age contributory pension or old age non-contributory pension &ndash; a means tested payment &ndash; are entitled to a refund of the pension element of these contributions. If the person concerned wishes to claim such a refund, he should contact my Department.</P>

      <P>In the context of his application for farm assist, it emerged that his circumstances had changed and that he had married on 22 May 1999. His means were re-assessed at £58 per week to take account of the benefit he is deriving from his wife's income from insurable employment. The new assessment had the effect of reducing his unemployment assistance rate to £15.50 per week. He appealed the decision to the independent social welfare appeals office. Following consideration of his appeal, the appeals officer considers that means have been properly and correctly assessed and he has disallowed the appeal.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 663 and 671 together.</P>
      <P>One of the conditions for receipt of unemployment benefit requires that the claimant must have sustained a substantial loss of employment and income in the weeks in which he/she claims benefit.</P>
      <P>The person concerned has worked intermittently and on a part-time basis since 1996. In considering her claims to benefit since November 1997, deciding officers have taken the view that she has not sustained a substantial loss of employment or income based on her previous employment history. Her claims were disallowed on that basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The person concerned appealed one of these <Col N="472" /> decisions to the independent appeals office. However, the deciding officer's decision was upheld.</P>
    <P>It is open to the person concerned to make an application for unemployment assistance, which is subject to a means test, for the days of the week on which she is not employed.</P>
    <P>For the week commencing 6 July 1997, the person concerned was paid unemployment benefit at the rate of £80.70. As she had been in employment for three days during that week, the appropriate rate of payment was half that amount and consequently an overpayment of £40.35 arose. The amount of overpayment currently outstanding is £20.</P>
    <P>The person concerned is not currently in receipt of a payment from the Department.</P>

    <P>This year a review of widow(er) non-contributory pensioners who are also in receipt of other pensions is being conducted. Approximately 850 pensioners who are also in receipt of a British <Col N="475" /> widows or British retirement pension will have their entitlement reviewed. To date the reviews have been completed in respect of 560 pensioners with 530 cases resulting in a reduction in pension entitlement.</P>
    <P>These figures indicate that 94 per cent of pensioners failed to notify my Department of increased means arising from increases in their British pensions as they are required to do. Other reasons for reduction in or revocation of pension payment arising from this review, include remarriage, commencing work or leaving the State.</P>
    <P>A further 284 general means review of widow(er) non-contributory pensioners has also been undertaken in 1999. Up to the end of August 1999, 114 pensioners have had their social welfare pension reduced as a result.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 675, 676, 694, and 695 together.</P>
      <P>The farm assist scheme, which introduced special arrangements for farmers on low incomes, was provided for in the Social Welfare Act, 1999, and is effective from 7 April 1999.</P>
      <P>To date 9,028 applications have been received for farm assist. These include 2,323 new applications and 6,705 claimants formerly in receipt of smallholders unemployment assistance, widows non-contributory pension, pre-retirement or disability allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of claims determined to date is 6,975, of which 6,346 have been awarded and 629 disallowed. During the period April to August 1999 another 715 smallholder and farm assist <Col N="476" /> claimants ceased to claim payment. There are currently 171 cases under appeal.</P>
    <P>By the beginning of September there were approximately 7,500 farmers receiving payment under the farm assist or smallholders schemes.</P>
    <P>The average payment to some 4,800 claimants formerly in receipt of smallholders unemployment assistance who have so far been transferred to farm assist, is £81 per week. This compares with an average weekly payment of £74.60, to some 7,000 smallholders in 1998. The average weekly farm assist payment for those who were not previously in receipt of a social welfare payment is £53.</P>
    <P>In the case of many former smallholders, their circumstances had changed since their last assessment which in some cases had taken place a number of years previously. The precise number of claimants who have had a reduction in their payment is not available at present but will be supplied to the Deputy. The number of former smallholders who have, to date, been disallowed payment because their means exceed the statutory limit or for other reasons is 81.</P>

      <P>Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme a weekly supplement may be paid in respect of rent to any person in receipt of a social welfare or health board payment whose means are insufficient to meet their needs.</P>
      <P>Entitlement to a rent supplement is determined by the health boards and supplements are normally calculated to ensure that the person, after payment of rent, has an income equal to the rate of SWA appropriate to the family circumstances, less £6. This £6 represents the minimum contribution which clients are required to pay from their own resources.</P>
      <P>In addition to the minimum contribution, all applicants, including pensioners, are required to contribute any assessable means in excess of the appropriate basic SWA rate towards their rent.</P>
      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme will be reviewed as part of the Department's series of programme evaluations. In addition, the operation of the rent supplement scheme is also being examined in the context of the Government's commitment under Partnership 2000 to consider a tapering arrangement for SWA housing supplements, in consultation with the social partners.</P>
      <P>Any proposals for changes in this area will have to be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>The carer's allowance is a means tested payment for carers on low income who look after people in need of full-time care and attention.</P>
      <P>Following a detailed examination of the review of the carer's allowance, which was published in October 1998, a range of measures was introduced in the 1999 budget at an additional annual cost of over £18 million, to improve and develop the position of carers. The estimated expenditure on carer's allowance in 1999 is almost £60 million.</P>
      <P>The review considered that a needs assessment encompassing both the needs of the care recipient and the carer should be introduced. This would separate care needs from income support needs and could be used by all State organisations which provide reliefs or grants to those in need of care. A working group, which is chaired by Deputy Moffatt, Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, and also comprising membership from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and the health boards, has been set up to advance this proposal.</P>
      <P>The review also considered the introduction of a new non-means tested payment for carers. This &ldquo;continual care&rdquo; payment would be related to the level of care being provided and would formally recognise those providing the highest levels of care in the community. The question of introducing a &ldquo;continual care&rdquo; payment will be considered when work on the needs assessment is completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The measures introduced in the 1999 budget clearly indicate my personal commitment and that <Col N="478" /> of the Government to carers and the appreciation we must all have for the value of their role in our society. In addition, my colleagues the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Health and Children and the Minister for Environment and Local Government have also brought forward proposals of assistance to carers. The Government is conscious that such a cross-cutting approach is required and needs to be developed further.</P>
    <P>As the rate of carer's allowance is higher than that of pre-retirement allowance, it may be more beneficial to a recipient of pre-retirement allowance to transfer to carer's allowance. A carer in receipt of a carer's allowance will also receive an annual respite care grant of £200 as well as a free travel pass and a free telephone rental allowance. If the Deputy has a particular case in mind, I would be glad to have their entitlement to a carer's allowance checked.</P>

      <P>The aim of the national fuel scheme is to assist householders who are on long-term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs.

      <P>The one-parent family payment, OFP, is a social assistance scheme which is designed to provide financial support for lone parents who are bringing up children on their own. In common with other social assistance schemes the OFP features a means test which is intended to ensure that available resources are targeted at those who are most in need.</P>
      <P>In addition to the normal allowances made for capital etc., the means test associated with the OFP allows a recipient to earn up to £115.38 per week without any loss of payment, with the balance of earnings up to £230.76 counted at 50 per cent. There is also a disregard of £75 per week allowed on maintenance received from the second parent towards the cost of rent or mortgage. When compared to other schemes this means test is favourable and, in the circumstances, it is felt that its abolition would not be appropriate.</P>

      <P>Child benefit is a universal payment which is payable in respect of all children up to the age of 16 years and continues to be paid in respect of children up to age 19 who are in full-time education, or who have a physical or mental disability.</P>
      <P>The policy direction over the past number of years has been to concentrate resources on improving child benefit for all families. Since I came into office I have increased the lower rate of child benefit from £30 to £34.50 per month, and the higher rate from £39 to £46 per month. The higher increase in the higher rate which is paid in respect of the third and subsequent children, recognises that research has shown that larger families face greatest risk of poverty.</P>
      <P>Any proposals to extend entitlement to all children in full-time education would be costly and would have to be considered in the light of available resources and overall budgetary priorities.</P>

      <P>Child dependant allowances are payable to recipients of social welfare payments in respect of all children up to the age of 18 years. Where a claimant is in receipt of a long-term social welfare payment, child dependant allowances are payable where children are in full-time education up to the age of 22 years, or up to the end of the academic year after the 22nd birthday. However, those receiving short-term unemployment assistance, unemployment benefit or other short-term payments do not receive child dependant allowance for children over 18 years. This differentiation is in recognition of the fact that families with children on long-term payments face a higher risk of poverty.</P>
      <P>Extending the age limit for child dependant allowances for short-term payments would have cost implications and therefore could only be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>An amount of £42 million is provided in my Department's 1999 Estimates to provide for payment of a Christmas bonus for approximately 715,000 recipients of long-term social welfare payments.</P>
      <P>This estimate is based on the payment of a bonus similar to the bonus paid in 1998 and earlier years, that is 70 per cent of the person's normal weekly payment subject to a minimum payment of £20.</P>
      <P>The bonus is paid to recipients of the following payments, namely, disablement pension, death benefit, by way of pension, old age contributory and non-contributory pension, retirement pension, invalidity pension, widow's and widower's non-contributory pension, orphan's contributory and non-contributory pension, pre-retirement allowance, blind pension, carer's allowance, one parent family payment, unemployment assistance at the long-term rate, disability allowance, payments to people formerly in receipt of deserted wife's benefit and allowance and prisoner's wife's allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People in receipt of short-term payments such as unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance at the short-term rate are not eligible for the bonus payment. I have no plans at the present time to extend payment to additional categories this year. Any change in the amount of <Col N="484" /> the bonus or in the categories of persons to whom it is paid would have substantial cost implications and would have to be considered in the context of other priorities and commitments.</P>

      <P>In relation to the person concerned, she qualified for an old age contributory pension at the weekly rate of £83.70, the rate appropriate to a yearly average of 31. As the Deputy will be aware, a yearly average of 48 or over is required to qualify for a maximum rate pension. There are no social insurance contributions recorded on her behalf from 1956 to 1971 which is the reason for her reduced yearly average and rate of pension. However, she is already in receipt of a widow's contributory pension at the maximum weekly rate of £82.10 and, when combined with her derived entitlement to a free fuel allowance of £8 per week, it is more beneficial to her to remain in receipt of this payment.</P>
      <P>The review referred to by the Deputy is now nearing completion. As I have previously stated on many occasions, this is a general review of the qualifying conditions for the old age contributory and retirement pensions which is in line with this Government's commitment to address the issue of people who fail marginally to qualify for an old age contributory pension. The review is, therefore, paying particular attention to the operation of the yearly average qualifying condition. Clearly, any changes to the fundamental basis of a scheme involve a cost factor and, as with all improvements to social welfare schemes, these will have to be considered in a budgetary context and in the light of available resources.</P>

      <P>In November 1997 I introduced regulations which allow for the tapered withdrawal of the qualified adult allowance for people getting unemployment benefit, unemployment assistance, disability benefit, disability allowance, pre-retirement allowance, injury benefit and unemployability supplement whose spouse is earning between £60 and £90 per week. Last week, in line with a decision announced in the last budget, I signed the regulations extending these <Col N="485" /> arrangements to cover spouses' incomes of up to £105, with effect from early October 1999.</P>
      <P>I will continue to seek to improve these arrangements as resources permit. The question of extending the arrangements to include other schemes, including invalidity pension, will be considered in that context.</P>

      <P>The church and castle site at Cross East, Cross, Claremorris, County Mayo, are recorded monuments offering them protection under the National Monuments (Amendment) Act, 1994. The monuments are not in State care and, therefore, Dúchas would not normally expend moneys on their upkeep.</P>
      <P>However, the Deputy will be aware that the Heritage Council has powers to provide advice and assistance, including financial assistance, in relation to the protection, preservation and promotion of the built heritage. I would point out, however, that, while I provide operational funding to the Heritage Council under my Department's Vote, I have no function in relation to the council's decisions on the disbursement of funds.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will also be aware that last year I and the Minister for the Environment and Local government, announced a package of measures for the protection of the architectural heritage. Among these measures is the establishment of a new grant-aid scheme for approved conservation works to listed buildings, which will commence in January next. The new grants scheme will be administered by the local authorities. It will have funding of £4 million per annum and will be operated in accordance with national criteria and standards drawn up by an advisory group made up of our two Departments and the Heritage Council.</P>

      <P>Completion of the restoration of the Royal Canal is one of the projects I hope can be included in the national development plan. However, as the plan has not yet been finalised, I am not in a position to give a commitment in relation to the project in question or any other project at this time.</P>
      <P>The preliminary estimate of the cost of completion of restoration of the Royal Canal is of the order of £10 million and £12 million and the timescale involved would be four to five years.</P>

That decision was made by me on 30 August 1999 as Minister of State with responsibility for the offshore islands on the recommendation of my officials.

      <P>The monastic settlement cathedral at Clonfert, County Galway, is included in the record of monuments and places for County Galway established under section 12 of the National Monuments (Amendment) Act, 1994.

      <P>The Cathedral remains in use as a place of worship and is owned by the Church of Ireland authorities. It would not be appropriate therefore, for my Department to expend moneys on its upkeep or repair, since the cathedral is in private ownership and the National Monuments Act, 1930, provides that the definition of a monument &ldquo;does not include any building which is for the time being habitually used for ecclesiastical purposes&rdquo;. However, I understand that the Heritage Council has been examining ways of protecting the monument and in particular, the doorway, the most important feature of the cathedral, being the finest surviving example of Irish Romanesque decoration. Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department will of course, be pleased to offer any relevant advice in this regard.</P>

      <P>I wish to inform the Deputy of replies that the Chief Herald made to inquiries on this matter on the advice of the Attorney General's office in which he stated that: <Col N="494" /> the 1992 decision to grant courtesy recognition to Mr. Terence McCarthy as MacCarthy Mór is to be regarded as null and void; the decision in 1979 to ratify and confirm arms to Mr. McCarthy must be regarded as invalid; and the pedigree registered for Mr. McCarthy in 1980 is without genealogical integrity. The foregoing decisions were notified to Mr. McCarthy's solicitor and the records of the Genealogical Office have been amended accordingly.</P>
      <P>I understand that the claim of Mr. Barry Trant McCarthy for recognition as MacCarthy Mór is still under consideration. I am arranging to have a statement which the Chief Herald issued in August of this year forwarded to the Deputy as soon as possible. In the light of this case it is clear that the process by which recognition was granted was flawed, and there has to be a possibility that other &ldquo;recognitions&rdquo; granted in the 1980s and early 1990s may also be flawed.</P>
      <P>In view of the foregoing I agree with the view of the Chief Herald that there should now be a comprehensive review of the procedure introduced in the 1940s, whereby courtesy recognition of chiefs of the name is granted by the Genealogical Office. I am considering how best to proceed with structuring such a review given my other plans to advance as soon as possible the National Library's transition to autonomous status under the provisions of the National Cultural Institutions Act, 1997.</P>
      <P>In regard to the courtesy title of Maguire of Fermanagh, I understand the allegations about the validity of his recognition have been widely circulated via the Internet and otherwise. I also understand that the Chief Herald has advised the holder of that courtesy title that he is having these allegations reviewed with a view to deciding what action, if any, should be taken.</P>

I confirm, that having reviewed all the circumstances relating to the incident, the refusal of access to Dúchas staff by the club must be considered a fundamental breach of the practices and procedures in place to monitor the licences issued to the Irish Coursing Club under the Wildlife Act, 1976.

      <Quest>his views on the proposal by the IPPA, the early childhood organisation, for a resource centre to accommodate four major child care organisations; the communication, if any, he has had with the Department of Finance regarding a once-off special project grant to reflect the Government's commitment to the child care sector.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department has been approached by the IPPA, the Early Childhood Organisation, for assistance in relation to the capital cost of the refurbishment of premises for use as a resource centre and headquarters. The current estimate for this project is in excess of £1 million and the proposal includes a commitment to provide within these premises facilities for the National Children's Nurseries Association, National Childminding Association of Ireland and Children in Hospital (Ireland).</P>
      <P>My Department provides funding for the development of child care services under the equal opportunities child care programme. The programme is part EU and Exchequer funded and secured a budget in excess of £6 million for the two year period 1998 and 1999, £3.4 million of which was allocated for capital purposes. This capital budget was linked to programme objectives of supporting the development of child care facilities in disadvantaged communities and of encouraging employer involvement in child care provision. All capital funding has been allocated for the development of 106 community based child care services and eight employer led consortia to develop child care services for their employees . In no case did capital grants provided under the programme meet the full capital costs of project proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The initial budget for the equal opportunities child care programme was recently increased by a further £5 million to support training of child care workers and the organisational development of community and private child care providers. This funding arose from re-allocated European <Col N="497" /> Social Funds. As this funding is linked to human resources development it could not be used for capital purposes. On 21 July 1999, I announced the allocation of approximately £1 million of this new allocation to national child care organisations including the IPPA, the National Childminding Association of Ireland and the National Children's Nurseries Association to fund specific proposals.</P>
    <P>The matter of capital funding for a new resource centre and headquarters has been noted by my Department for further consideration in the event that additional capital funding is made available to the current equal opportunities child care programme. My Department has had no communication with the Department of Finance specifically regarding this project. However, the next phase of the equal opportunities child care programme will commence next year and the matter can be considered, together with proposals for other capital projects, in the context of the budget for that phase.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</askee>
      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the problem of anti-social activity and underage drinking in public parks; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[17260/99]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act, 1994, deals with situations where public drinking leads to disorderly behaviour. Under that Act, it is an offence for any person, regardless of age, to be present in a public place while intoxicated to such an extent as would give rise to a reasonable apprehension that he or she might be a danger either to himself or herself or to any other person in the vicinity. A person found guilty of such an offence is liable to be fined up to £100. In addition, the Act gives power to a Garda to confiscate alcohol where he or she suspects with reasonable cause that a disorderly conduct offence is being committed and also empowers a Garda to &ldquo;move on&rdquo; persons who are intoxicated in a public place. I understand that it is also open to local authorities to use their by-law making powers under the Local Government Act, 1994, to control the consumption of alcohol in public places.</P>
      <P>A wide range of controls designed to tackle the problem of underage drinking is included in the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1988. The primary purpose of those statutory controls is to make it as difficult as possible for persons under 18 years of age to lawfully purchase alcohol, or to be in possession of it or to consume it other than in a private residence.</P>
      <P>I also made arrangements, earlier this year, to introduce a voluntary, national age card scheme which will greatly strengthen the existing measures aimed at curbing the sale of alcohol to persons under 18 years of age. Any person who has attained 18 years of age is entitled to apply for an age card at his or her local Garda station. The introduction of the scheme will make a significant contribution to the continuing fight against underage drinking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course measures aimed at curbing the supply of alcohol to young people cannot, on their own, be expected to solve the underage drinking problem. Measures are also required which deal with the demand for alcohol among under 18s. <Col N="499" /> The Garda play a prominent role in this regard in participating in school programmes which deal with the abuse of alcohol by young persons. The Departments of Education and Science and Health and Children are also very much involved in measures that address the demand side of the problem. I have been assured by the Garda authorities that both the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act, 1994, and the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1988, are enforced countrywide by the Garda in a uniform manner.</P>

Following representations made by my Department, the UK authorities advised that they are in <Col N="503" /> the process of collating the necessary documentation and reports required and when that has been completed they expect to be in a position to forward his application for my consideration.</P>
    <P>I should point out that the Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons requires that extensive documentation be exchanged between both jurisdictions in order to allow an application to be fully considered. A three-way consent is also required to enable any transfer to take place i.e. from the authorities of both jurisdictions and from the person concerned. On receipt of those consents, assuming they will be forthcoming, an application must then be made to the High Court for a warrant authorising the transfer of the person concerned and his/her continued detention here.</P>
    <P>These procedures are so required under the convention and must be adhered to in considering any application. Unfortunately, it is not possible to say now long it will take for this application to be considered. However, I can assure you that every effort will be made to complete this process as quickly as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government's An Action Programme for the Millennium contains a commitment to introduce a register of sex offenders. In February last I sought and obtained Cabinet approval for the preparation of heads of a sex offenders Bill to provide for the establishment of such a register, the principal focus of which is to be offences against children. On 1 June, following consideration by the Cabinet of the heads, I received approval for the drafting of the Bill.</P>
      <P>In addition to the register, the Bill will deal with post-release supervision of sex offenders by the Probation and Welfare Service, and separate legal representation in certain circumstances for complainants of rape and serious sexual assault. It will also include provision for a new civil court order against a sex offender whose behaviour in the community gives the Garda reasonable cause for concern that the order is necessary to protect the public from serious harm. In addition, it will create an offence for a convicted child sex offender to seek or accept employment involving unsupervised access to children without informing the employer of the conviction.</P>
      <P>These measures arise, in the main, from the discussion paper on the law on sexual offences which I published in May of last year and are in line with the responses received to that paper. Preparation of this legislation is being given a high priority within my Department and I expect to be in a position to publish the Bill during the current Dáil session.</P>

      <P>Following are tables containing statistics on divorce applications in the Circuit Court for the legal years ending 31 July 1997 and 31 July 1998, and for the period 1 August 1998 to 31 March 1999. This is the latest date for which figures are available. The numbers of applications for divorce received, and divorces granted during each period, are shown on the relevant table. Statistics for divorce applications refused are not available for the legal year ending 31 July 1997, but are included for later periods. The statistics are not broken down between contested and uncontested divorces.</P>

    <P>While statistics on the number of divorce applications currently awaiting hearing are not at present available, a table showing the provisional number of divorce applications on hands in most Circuit Court offices as at 31 July 1998 follows. Circuit Court statistics for the legal year ending <Col N="505" /> 31 July 1999 are not yet available. When the relevant statistics have been compiled, I will arrange for a copy of the statistics on divorce applications, including the number of applications on hands as at 31 July 1999, to be forwarded to the Deputy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 750 to 753, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I have been advised by the Garda authorities that isolated incidents involving the unauthorised taking and driving of vehicles have, in recent weeks, occurred with a bit more regularity in the postal district area of Dublin 17, but are not of a continuous nature as implied. I have also been advised by the Garda authorities that the policing needs of the areas mentioned are being addressed by local Garda management and that where the problem of joyriding exists a number of measures are being taken to tackle it, for example; a policing strategy is in place from both the prevention and enforcement aspects and this has yielded results; ongoing liaison with residents' association and the business community is maintained by both the district officer and the local community policing unit; through Garda intervention the local authority has made some physical modifications to the affected area, which are of assistance; operation &ldquo;Steering Wheel&rdquo; has been devised and put in place to counter these incidents and involves targeted patrolling by a dedicated unit in the affected areas; these patrols are augmented by resources from Garda headquarters and the garda dog unit; all Garda vehicles in the district are equipped with &ldquo;Stinger&rdquo; vehicle stopping devices. However, the use of these devices is restricted and overall public safety is the prime consideration in each specific incident; all vehicles recovered are subjected to thorough technical examination to ensure that all available evidence is captured; and intelligence gathering is also a feature of the operation.</P>
      <P>These measures are under constant review by local Garda management and responses or strategies will continue to be put in place, as appropriate.</P>
      <P>I understand from the Garda authorities that six local youths are currently before the courts in relation to incidents of unauthorised takings and road traffic offences in the Coolock sub-district.</P>
      <P>The policing situation throughout Coolock sub-district is monitored on an ongoing basis with a view to ensuring that an adequate policing service is maintained. However, when additional gardaí next become available, the needs of DMA North Division will be fully considered in conjunction with the needs of other divisions throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also relevant to point out that since coming into office, I have given a high priority to the diversion of young people who are at risk of becoming involved in crimes such as joyriding. In that time, I have increased the number of Garda special projects from 12 to 29 and there are a number of proposals for other projects before my <Col N="511" /> Department. The projects are tangible crime prevention measures and are run in conjunction with youth organisations. One such project is operating in the Dublin 17 area.</P>
    <P>I am fully aware of the damage, both mental and physical, that joyriding inflicts on community life. However, I have complete confidence in the capacity of the Garda Síochána to combat the problem and to discharge its role in maintaining law and order. I am assured the Garda will be in attendance at the next meeting of the local task force which is due to take place next week, and will provide my Department with a report on the matter.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 754 and 755 together.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Registrar of Titles that it is the policy of the Land Registry to accord priority to dealings where registration is only effected on completion of the dealing. Property, the subject of Land Commission schedules, is deemed to be registered as of the date of vesting by the Land Commission. Accordingly, registration in the Land Registry of Land Commission schedules is afforded a lower priority than the registration of dealings. Moreover, transactions can proceed by reference to the schedule number.</P>
      <P>Where a specific need arises which requires that registration of the dealing associated with the schedule be effected, the Land Registry will expedite the registration of the dealing at the request of the applicant.</P>
      <P>There are two staff members assigned to dealing with Land Commission schedules at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the buoyancy in the economy and the current high level of activity in the housing market the number of dealings being lodged with, and the level of business being transacted by, the Land Registry has been increasing steadily for some years now and has been subject to unprecedented increases in recent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="512" /> In this light I am pleased to note that significant efficiencies have been generated by the registries. For example, overall output of applications for registration has increased from 94,295 in 1993 to 113,108 in 1998 by 20 per cent.</P>
    <P>In view of the current workload situation my Department has written to the Department of Finance making a strong case for the allocation of additional staff to deal with the increase in the level of business in the Land Registry.

      <P>The person referred to in the question is currently detained in a mental institution in Scotland and has indicated his interest in a transfer to Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To date, all transfers under the provisions of the Transfer of Sentenced Persons Act, 1995, have involved sentenced persons only i.e. prisoners. The Attorney General was therefore asked to advise on the applicability of the Act to mentally ill persons. He has since advised that it should be possible to transfer persons detained in mental hospitals subject, however, to a number of qualifications. These include, for example, forthcoming legislation in both the civil and criminal aspects of mental illness which might apply in the <Col N="516" /> near future, the appropriateness of transferring certain persons in the light of medical reports, and the availability of secure accommodation in this jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>It is understood that the relevant United Kingdom authorities may also have similar concerns particularly with regard to the procedures to be used to effect this type of transfer. Their consent will also be required to effect any transfer. A three-way consent is required from the authorities of both states and the person concerned.</P>
    <P>My Department is currently in discussions with the Department of Health and Children and the Central Mental Hospital authorities with a view to overcoming a number of difficulties. These include the availability of adequate accommodation in the Central Mental Hospital in addition to clarifying the transfer procedures to be used. It is likely that the Central Mental Hospital will also be required to assess the appropriateness of transfer for such persons from a medical or psychiatric viewpoint. When these issues have been resolved, I would hope, in conjunction with all relevant parties, to be in a position to commence processing applications of this nature.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that statistics in respect of the number of summary proceedings commenced under the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act, 1994, have been published in the annual reports of the Garda Síochána since 1995. The statistics in respect of the Dublin region are shown on page 91 of the 1998 report, copies of which are available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>I understand that statistics for the first six months of 1999 are compiled at the end of the year and consequently are not available yet. I am informed by the Garda authorities that they could only be obtained by the expenditure of a disproportionate amount of staff time and resources.</P>

      <P>There are 15 staff currently employed in the office of wards of court.</P>
      <P>The Government is fully aware of its responsibility to ensure that the office of wards of court is fully resourced and earlier this year I secured sanction for five new posts to assist in addressing the current backlog. Four of these posts have been filled and the filling of the fifth post and a number of existing vacancies which have arisen in the normal course are currently being processed.</P>
      <P>I am also pleased to report that following an intensive training programme for the new staff assigned, the registrar for the office of wards of court recommenced the processing of applications for dismissal from wardship in July last. To date 42 outstanding dismissal cases have been disposed of.</P>
      <P>I am informed that there are no delays in dealing with applications and correspondence in the office of wards of court in relation to wards who are living. As regards the applications for dismissal from wardship in respect of deceased wards which are waiting to be processed, it is important to be aware that the time taken to deal with any given case depends on the issues involved, the nature of the assets and liabilities of the deceased and whether the affairs of the deceased were in order at the date of death.</P>
      <P>While it is not possible at this stage to indicate a precise timescale for the elimination of arrears, I am satisfied that significant progress has been made and that the resources are in place to complete this work.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that this matter will become the responsibility of the Courts Service Board on establishment day which is scheduled for 9 November next. I will encourage the courts service to keep the matter under regular review.</P>

      <P>Finglas is one of six locations that have been prioritised for the installation of Garda CCTV systems as an aid to policing by the CCTV advisory committee. The list of locations in alphabetical order is as follows: Bray, Cork, Dublin (South Central), Dundalk, Finglas and Limerick.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Currently the Cork city and Dublin (South <Col N="519" /> Central) Garda CCTV projects are being processed.</P>
    <P>The Garda telecommunications section is responsible for the planning and implementation of town centre Garda CCTV schemes. Before contractors can be engaged to work on such schemes, there is a significant amount of planning and specification tender work to be carried out.</P>
    <P>A shortage of technicians in the telecommunications section of the Garda Síochána has impacted on the progress in implementing a CCTV system in Finglas. New technicians have been recruited and are now coming on stream but given training needs and so forth, it will, realistically, be some months before the new technicians will be available to commence work on new projects in the telecommunications area, including CCTV.</P>
    <P>Private contractors are currently used at the installation phase of Garda CCTV systems. However, the input of the Garda telecommunications section is required at the design, evaluation of tenders and commissioning stages of a CCTV project to ensure, <i>inter alia</i>, that the CCTV systems are of maximum benefit to local policing operations. A review of Garda CCTV systems is also under way at this time and consideration is being given to the feasibility of employing private contractors at other stages in the planning and installation of Garda CCTV systems.</P>
    <P>It is intended to commence the planning and implementation of Garda CCTV systems in each of the prioritised locations, including Finglas, as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 777 and 780 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware both the Director of Public Prosecutions and the courts are independent in the exercise of their respective functions and, as such, it would not be appropriate for me to comment on the issue he has raised. Furthermore, I do not consider it appropriate for me to comment on any Garda investigation into a criminal complaint.</P>
      <P>Should the individual referred to in the Deputy's question wish to make a complaint against the Garda, he can have recourse to the Garda Síochána complaints board which has been established as an independent statutory body to investigate complaints by members of the public against the Garda. A complaint can be made by writing to them or calling to their offices. A complaint can also be made at any Garda station and it will be forwarded to the board for attention unless the person indicates in writing that he or she wishes it to be dealt with by the Garda Síochána itself. The Complaints Act also provides that a complaint can be made to a member of the force above the rank of chief superintendent at a place other than a Garda station by, for example, writing to the commissioner.</P>
      <P>In relation to the issue of compensation I can only suggest that the individual concerned seeks independent legal advice on the matter.</P>

    <P>There are 1,561 persons who have been refused refugee status and are no longer in the asylum process. It should also be noted that a person in this situation has an opportunity to make submissions as to why he or she should not be removed and to advance any other grounds they may have for remaining in the State, such as marriage to the Irish national.</P>
    <P>At present there are 17 asylum related cases awaiting judicial review hearing of which seven cases have been refused refugee status and have sought a review; ten whose asylum applications were deemed to be the responsibility of other EU member states under the first safe country rule for cases prior to 1 September 1997 or the Dublin Convention since then.</P>
    <P>There is ongoing liaison between my Department, the Eastern Health Board and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs with regard to asylum and related matters to ensure that the relevant authorities are appropriately notified of all refusals.</P>
    <P>In relation to the fact that there have been no deportations to date in 1999, I should point out that the power to deport under Article 13 of the Aliens Order, 1946, was struck down as unconstitutional by the High Court on 22 January 1999. The power has since been restored by the Immigration Act and I will shortly make regulations necessary to allow deporations to resume in accordance with the procedure set out in that Act.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Garda authorities that a working group has been set up to review existing procedures for the processing of public service vehicle applications. The review will deal with the issues raised by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>I have been assured that any change in existing procedures considered necessary will be put in place as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 789 and 790 together.</P>
      <P>Twenty seven local authority swimming pools received approval for total grant aid in excess of £13 million towards refurbishment works carried out over the 11 year period from 1988 to date. Details of this expenditure is set out in the following tabular statement.</P>
      <P>I recently announced that I have secured £45 million for the swimming pool programme over the next three years, commencing in 2000, of which a minimum of £30 million has been earmarked for expenditure on refurbishment of existing local authority pools. This represents an increase of five times the current level of funding, from the current level of £3 million per annum to £15 million per annum over that three year period.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Mr. Flood):</NameTxt>
      <P>Following an independent evaluation and review of the operation of the local drugs task forces, the Cabi<Col N="527" /> net Committee on Social Inclusion and Drugs has approved the continuation of the task forces for a further two year period. An additional allocation of £15 million has been made over the period 2000-2001 to enable the task forces to update their existing action plans, as well as to address issues which need to be tackled on a cross-task force basis.</P>
      <P> A sum of £10 million was made available to support the implementation of the existing plans, on foot of which over 200 community-based initiatives received funding to respond to the drug problem in their areas, under the themes of education, prevention, treatment, after care, rehabilitation and reducing supply. These initiatives were designed to complement and add value to the existing drug programmes and services of the State agencies.</P>
      <P>The task forces will prepare their updated plans in accordance with guidelines which were prepared by the national drugs strategy team and approved by the Cabinet committee. The plans are expected to profile the nature and extent of the drug problem in the task force areas, along with the drug programmes and services which are in place or planned to tackle that problem, and to make prioritised proposals to address any gaps identified in current or planned service provision.</P>
      <P>The guidelines point out the importance of affording local communities an opportunity of inputting into the planning and development of the proposals which will be funded through the new plans, so that they can take ownership of the various initiatives once they commence. In view of this, the task forces have been requested to engage in a widespread process of public consultation in preparing their new plans. This process will involve inviting proposals from local groups and organisations, under the themes outlined above.</P>
      <P>It will be a matter for the local drugs task forces to determine the proposals for inclusion in their updated plans, based on their assessment of the needs of their areas and the guidelines issued by the national drugs strategy team. The plans will be assessed by the team against the criteria set out in the guidelines, following which it will make recommendations to the Cabinet committee regarding the level of funding to be allocated to each task force to implement its plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The criteria against which the plans will be assessed are: the extent to which the plan is area-based, integrated and maximises the use of existing resources; whether the measures proposed in the plan are additional and complementary to existing or planned programmes and services &ndash; statutory, voluntary and community &ndash; in the area; whether the proposed measures link effectively with complementary initiatives, existing or planned, including the young people's facilities and services fund and the area action plan of the local partnership; whether the task force has clearly demonstrated a partnership approach to filling gaps in service provision and eliminating <Col N="528" /> duplication or overlap; whether it has been clearly demonstrated that the proposed programmes and services meet the identified needs of the area, having regard to the extent and nature of the local drug problem, the diverse needs of the target group and the current and planned level of service provision; whether the proposed measures accord with the aims, objectives and targets of the drugs initiative; the extent to which the proposed initiatives/projects have the potential to be successfully &ldquo;mainstreamed&rdquo;, following full piloting and evaluation; whether the promoters have demonstrated the capacity to deliver the proposed projects; whether the proposed initiatives/projects are viable and sustainable; whether the plan incorporates new, innovative approaches in responding to the drug problem, which are capable of being replicated elsewhere; whether the proposed initiatives/projects have been fully costed and prioritised; whether the proposed initiatives/projects set out clear aims, objectives and targets, in terms of inputs and expected measurable outputs, outcomes and impacts; whether the task force has demonstrated a wide consultation process in the development of the plan; and the mechanisms proposed to ensure the effective implementation and monitoring of the approved proposals.</P>
    <P>The contact person at local level is the co-ordinator of the relevant local drugs task force. In the case of the Dublin North East drugs task force, the co-ordinator can be contacted at Coolock Development Centre, Coolock, Dublin 17 (tel. 8479788).</P>

      <P>The Operational Programme for <Col N="529" /> Tourism, 1994-99, includes provision for 33 million ecu, approximately £26 million, in European Regional Development Fund grant aid for the construction of a conference centre in Dublin capable of handling up to 2,000 delegates.</P>
      <P>Following the failure of processes in 1995 and 1996 to secure an appropriate proposal, a new tender procedure, organised by Bord Fáilte, under the direction of the independent management board for product development, and conducted in accordance with EU Council Directive 93/37/EEC, was launched in September 1997. This process culminated in June 1998 in the selection of the proposal submitted by Spencer Dock International Convention Centre Ltd., SDICC, to develop the conference centre at a site in Dublin's docklands.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the operational programme, the agreement of the Government and the European Commission, on foot of a cost benefit analysis, is required in respect of applications for amounts at or above 15 million ecu. A cost benefit analysis, undertaken by independent consultants, was favourable towards the project and in September 1998, the Government agreed to the making of a submission to the European Commission recommending formal approval for a 33 million ecu European Regional Development Fund grant towards the cost of developing the project. The Commission's approval in principle, for the grant was received in April 1999.</P>
      <P>Since then, and following consultations between the developer and Bord Fáilte, I have been in correspondence with the Commission about how the construction schedule for the project can be accommodated within the various operational programme and CSF deadlines. Clarification by the Commission is now pending submission of final contractual details by the developers.</P>

      <P>Under the new national lottery funded sports capital programme, which was advertised at the end of 1998 following a review of the existing programme, funding is allocated on the basis of individual applications received.</P>
      <P>While all applications are treated on their merits, special priority is given to proposals for facilities in disadvantaged areas, in line with Government policy aimed at increasing participation in sport and recreation in these areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Applicants are also now required to consult other clubs and community groups, including schools, with sport and recreational facilities in their areas, and the local authority before making <Col N="530" /> an application for funding and to show the outcome of such consultations. The purpose of this is to ensure that regard is had to identified needs of the area and that the proposed development does not result in overlap with and/or duplication of existing facilities. Sports clubs developing projects at national and regional levels are also required to ensure that their proposals are consistent with the priorities of their national governing bodies.</P>
    <P>In addition, my Department may consult as appropriate, when assessing applications, with other relevant Departments and agencies, including the Irish Sports Council, with a view to ensuring co-ordination in the provision of sport and recreational facilities at local level.</P>
    <P>Following an application process earlier this year, allocations totalling some £16 million have been made in 1999 to almost 400 local community based projects and to national and regional projects throughout the country under the new sport capital programme.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>An Exchequer contribution of £34.775 million over three years has been set aside for this fund and the funds have been allocated as follows: £7.2 million for the implementation of the children at risk programme of the Department of Health and Children: £24.8 million to the local drug task forces, 12 in Dublin and one in Cork: £1.8 million to the four major urban areas of Galway, Cork city south, Limerick and Waterford: £0.5 million to <Col N="531" /> support strategies and proposals in Bray and Carlow: £0.5 million to voluntary organisations with a national or regional remit which have the capacity to deliver targeted education and prevention initiatives on a global basis or to communities of interest.</P>
    <P>Excluding the Department of Health and Children projects, the Vocational Education Committees and the local authorities are the channels of funding for the services &ndash; current &ndash; and for the capital projects respectively and the funds are in the vote of my Department.

      <P>In the past year, two secondary schools, one in each of the above areas, indicated to my Department their intention to close. This is because the future viability of these schools could not be sustained due to declining enrolments.</P>
      <P>The planning section of my Department reviewed available second-level accommodation in the general area at that time and concluded that there were sufficient places available to cater for pupils affected by the closure and for future enrolment needs.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, I have no plans at present to provide additional post-primary school accommodation in the Dublin 4 and 6 areas. However, if any school is experiencing accommodation difficulties, my Department would be prepared to examine the circumstances of the case.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the concerns of parents regarding the safe transportation of pupils to and from school. The position is, however, that school transport in the Dublin area is generally operated within the network of public scheduled services under the remit of Dublin Bus, which has responsibility for all aspects of the service, including safety.</P>

      <P>In 1996, the student support schemes were extended to provide maintenance grants to undergraduate students pursuing approved third level courses in other EU member states. Prior to this, grants were only payable to students pursuing approved courses in the Republic and in Northern Ireland. In this context and following discussions with the local authorities regarding the necessary administrative arrangements, it was agreed that students pursuing approved courses in other EU member states &ndash; including Northern Ireland &ndash; would be paid the value of the grant in the currency of the country in which they were studying and that the value of the maintenance grant to be paid in all circumstances would be the Irish value converted to the currency of the country in which the student is pursuing his or her course.</P>

      <P>My Department provides a grant to cover the full cost of the salary of the secretary who is currently shared between St. Patrick's primary and secondary schools, Gardiner's Hill, Cork. Earlier this year, sanction was received from the Department of Finance to improve the position of primary and secondary schools that are currently involved in a sharing arrangement.

It is of course open to either or both of the schools to refuse to enter into the new arrangement which would mean that the current sharing arrangement would continue as heretofore.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While my officials are in ongoing correspondence with both schools, I would have to point out that it will not be possible to allocate a full-time secretarial post to the primary school. Should the primary school agree to terminate the current sharing arrangement, my Department will provide a grant of £15 per pupil per annum to the school towards secretarial services. In the current school year this would amount to £3,870 (based on the schools enrolment of 258 pupils in September 1998). You will appreciate that this figure <Col N="536" /> would represent an overall increase in funding to the two schools of £3,870 in respect of secretarial services.</P>
    <P>I regret that it is not possible to make any new full-time appointments but as I have pointed out, it is open to the primary school to either continue as heretofore in the sharing arrangement or move to the 1992 scheme of additional capitation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 814 and 953 together.</P>
      <P>The higher education grant schemes operate under the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992. These Acts define a mature student to mean a person &ldquo;of not less than 23 years of age, or such other age as may stand specified for the time being in regulations made by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance, who have secured places in approved institutions and have reached that age on l January, or such other date as may be prescribed from time to time by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance, in the year of entry to such institutions&rdquo;. The Acts further provide, <i>inter alia</i>, for the making of grants to mature students whose means and those of their parents, where the mature students are dependent on their parents, and the means of their spouses, if any, do not exceed prescribed limits.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the higher education grants schemes, mature students are categorised as either independent mature students or mature students dependent on parents. An independent mature student is defined to mean a mature student who was not ordinarily resident at home with his or her parents from the October preceding their entry to an approved course. Independent mature students are deemed to be self-supporting and are assessed without reference to either their parents' income or address.</P>
      <P>When assessing the means of students other that mature students, the Acts specify that the students' means and those of their parents or guardians must be below a prescribed limit. This provision requires that parental income be taken into account irrespective of the individual circumstances in any case where the student is not a mature student. The other student support schemes have similar provisions in relation to the means assessment of students.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the difficulties that these provisions can give rise to in individual cases and I have asked my Department to examine the issues concerned.</P>

    <P>Since coming into office, I have been concerned at the large number of untrained personnel working within the primary school system. While I acknowledge that many of these persons have made a contribution to the primary educational system, there is a need to ensure that as far as possible only qualified personnel are employed to perform substitute or temporary teaching.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="541" /> For these reasons, I have introduced a range of measures which are designed to boost substantially the supply of trained teachers. Specifically, I have ensured that there are over 1,000 places available in the colleges of education. This includes 730 students who will pursue the three year B.Ed degree programme while 280 degree holders have been admitted to an 18 month full time post graduate course.</P>
    <P>Additionally, B.Ed graduates of St. Mary's College, Belfast who have studied Irish to honours level as an academic subject as part of their teaching qualification will be recognised as fully trained.</P>
    <P>In addition, from 1 September 1998 all primary degree holders who also hold the Higher Diploma in Education are recognised as fully trained for the purposes of providing substitution service. Secondly, Montessori trained teachers who successfully completed the course of three years duration at St. Nicholas, Dun Laoghaire, and which is recognised by the National Council for Educational Awards, can from 1 September, 1998, be granted recognition as fully trained substitutes provided that they have Irish to grade C at higher level leaving certificate or its equivalent.</P>
    <P>With effect from 1 September 1999, all primary degree holders who also hold the higher diploma in education are be recognised as fully trained for the purposes of providing temporary service provided that they hold Irish to grade C at higher level leaving certificate or its equivalent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>As you are aware, I have been concerned for some time about the number of large classes in the primary system, and have been examining ways to target additional teaching resources to those schools with the greatest need in this area. The new staffing schedule which issued in April last has been structured to ensure that all primary schools will operate to a maximum class size of 30 pupils.</P>
      <P>However, as you know, the staffing schedule has traditionally been applied on the basis of the previous year's enrolment figures, and this continues to be the case. Initially, the schools which will benefit from the new schedule are those whose enrolment in September 1998 qualifies them for an additional post in the 1999/2000 school year. Such schools will, therefore, be in a position to organise classes in such a way as to ensure that there are no longer any very large classes. The Deputy will appreciate that this represents a major advance on previous policy.</P>
      <P>As a result of the favourable change in the staffing schedule, Scoil Aine's staffing has increased from a principal and 11 mainstream class teachers for the 1998-99 school year to a principal and 12 mainstream class teachers based on an enrolment of 348 pupils on 30 September 1998. This gives an average class size of 29 pupils which is within the maximum class size of 30 pupils. The allocation of students to classes is a matter for the principal concerned.</P>
      <P>In addition, the school has the services of a remedial teacher.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>In designating schools as disadvantaged, regard was made to a range of criteria agreed between representatives of management, teacher unions, parents and my Department.</P>
      <P>In the current school year, of the 762 schools at second level, 190 schools have been allocated disadvantaged posts and qualify for disadvantaged status on that basis.</P>
      <P>A study of educational disadvantage conducted by the Combat Poverty Agency and the Education Research Centre in 1996 concluded that disadvantage status should be confined to 16 per cent of the school-going population. The study noted that such status had already been granted to 17 per cent of pupils. As an alternative to extending the disadvantaged area scheme to additional schools, the study recommended that available resources be targeted on the most disadvantaged schools.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that I recently announced a £4.5 million initiative aimed at keeping pupils in school up to the end of the leaving certificate. Marking a significant departure from traditional policy, the funding will be granted to schools on the basis of plans which they will be helped to design themselves. At the core of the initiative will be a multi-annual written retention plan or agreement drawn up between the school and the Department. This will provide for a range of targeted measures directed at the particular needs of the school together with clear projected outcomes in terms of increased retention. A key requirement of the individual retention plans will be that the school, as the driver of the initiative, operates on a multi-agency basis and establishes appropriate cross community links in delivering on its commitments. Implementation of this initiative will commence shortly.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that, following consideration of a request from the authorities of St. John of God secondary school, my Department approved the allocation of additional teaching resources to the school for the 1999/00 school year.</P>

      <Quest>the reason it is necessary for primary school teachers trained abroad to have Irish to enable them to be considered fully qualified and eligible for full-time posts; and if this barrier will be removed for resource or other primary teachers in view of the fact it has already been removed in other categories of teaching.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>Irish primary school teachers are class teachers as distinct from individual subject teachers and must, therefore, be qualified to teach all aspects of the curriculum. For this reason, all teachers seeking recognition must achieve a standard of competence in the Irish language. This competence can be achieved by undergoing and passing the Irish qualifications examination, an scrúdú le haghaidh cáilíochta sa Ghaeilge both written and oral, or its equivalent.</P>
      <P>My Department currently operates a scheme of provisional recognition at primary level whereby individuals who are recognised as fully qualified primary teachers in the United Kingdom or other EU member states may be appointed to a post in a primary school for a period of three years in advance of acquiring the Irish language qualification. On attainment of the Irish language qualification, such teachers are then recognised as fully qualified primary teachers in the State.</P>
      <P>In addition, qualified primary teachers who trained outside the State, including, teachers who trained outside the EU, but who do not possess the required Irish language qualification, will be granted restricted recognition by my Department to teach in certain special schools and classes where Irish is not a curricular requirement. My Department is currently preparing a circular that will outline in detail the various types of recognition that teachers trained abroad may be eligible for and the procedures by which they can apply for same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not however proposed to remove the requirement that teachers who wish to take up posts as remedial or resource teachers be fully qualified primary teachers. Such teachers may, as part of their work, be required to teach Irish to the pupils to whom they are assigned and it is <Col N="545" /> therefore necessary that they be competent to teach the Irish language. In addition remedial or resource teachers may be redeployed to positions in mainstream classes where Irish continues to form a core part of the curriculum.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department has an important supporting role in the area of substance misuse prevention and has introduced major programme initiatives in schools. These include a focus on alcohol and tobacco as well as on other legal and illegal drugs.</P>
      <P>The Department operates the &lsquo;Walk Tall' programme at primary level and the &lsquo;On My Own Two Feet' programme at post-primary level which started in 1995. These programmes combine the provision of materials with in-career development for teachers. The aim of the programmes is the development of the skills of students in saying no to the misuse of substances both legal and illegal. The approach advocated seeks to enable students to develop their abilities to take charge of their own health and welfare and to make conscious and informed decisions about the use of all forms of drugs, including tobacco, in their lives.</P>
      <P>Under the &lsquo;Walk Tall' programme at primary level, 569 teachers have completed a 30 hours training programme and 214 teachers have completed a week-long summer course. Planned expenditure over the two years 1999 and 2000 is £1 million after which the position will be reviewed. Expenditure on the Substance Misuse Prevention programme, from which the &lsquo;Walk Tall' programme evolved in 1999, was over £450,000 for the three years 1996-98.</P>
      <P>Under the &lsquo;On my Own Two Feet' programme, training for post-primary teachers lasts 50 hours.</P>
      <P>The programme has been introduced to over 70 per cent of post-primary schools and over 1600 teachers have attended the courses to date. Expenditure for 1999 is expected to be over £50,000. Expenditure in the years 1996 to 1998 was £272,000.</P>
      <P>The programme was developed in cooperation with the Department of Health and Children and the Mater Dei Counselling Centre. The use of the programme materials in schools was evaluated independently during the development phase and showed that students participating in the programme were influenced in having more moderate and balanced outlooks on the role of drugs in their lives when compared with a matched group of students not participating in the programme. With the publication of the social personal and health education syllabus for Junior Cycle by the NCCA, changes will be considered for updating the materials for the programme.</P>
      <P>In addition to the above, 40 schools are participants in the European Network of health promoting schools initiative. This initiative focuses on the development of supportive school climates, curriculum models of health promotion and the active involvement of teachers and parents in promoting a whole-school approach. The expenditure for the years 1996 to 1998 was £88,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="553" /> Teachers and schools at both primary and post-primary levels have been very positive in their response to the above mentioned programmes and many schools have also involved themselves in health board initiatives and activities and in the introduction of relevant programmes sponsored by voluntary agencies.</P>
    <P>Also, the national youth health programme provides support training and materials for all youth service organisations in the area of health promotion and awareness for young people. This programme is a partnership between this Department, the Department of Health and Children and the National Youth Council of Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The teacher in question paid contributions towards retirement benefits but did not pay contributions for purposes of a widows' and childrens' pension.</P>
      <P>The position is that the teachers' pension schemes made no provision for pensions in the case of spouses of members or of their children until 1969. In 1969 a contributory widows' and childrens' pension scheme, which provided benefits for the survivors of deceased male national schoolteachers, came into operation. The scheme was later extended to female teachers. All male national schoolteachers who were in pensionable service between 23 July 1968 and 30 June 1969 were given the option of joining the scheme or opting out of it. Teachers were made fully aware that a spouse's pension would not be payable by my Department on the death of any teacher who had opted out of the scheme.</P>
      <P>The teacher in question was a serving teacher during the option period and chose not to become a member of the widows' and childrens' pension scheme. Membership would have required him to pay an ongoing contribution at the rate of 1.5 per cent of pay until retirement and, at retirement, a contribution of 1 per cent of retiring pay in respect of each year of pensionable service given prior to 1 July 1969. He paid no contributions towards the scheme either by way of deduction from his salary or from the retirement gratuity which he received when he retired in 1985.</P>
      <P>As the teacher was not a member of the scheme, the position is that his widow is not eligible for a pension from my Department. The superannuation provisions are of general application and it is not open to me to depart from them in individual cases.</P>

      <P>It is not the case that any special arrangements have been withdrawn in respect of dyslexic students. The range of special arrangements granted to candidates with specific learning difficulties are for the purpose of ensuring as far as is practicable that a student with a specific learning difficulty is given every chance to demonstrate his or her ability at the examination. These arrangements are granted on a case by case basis depending on the evidence provided in support of the application and include the use of taperecorders, readers and scribes.</P>
      <P>In addition, all examiners who have a difficulty in assessing the material presented by a candidate are under instruction to refer the script to their supervising examiner.

      <P>The standards-bases apprenticeship system, which is currently in place, comprises seven training modules over a minimum period of four years. Four on-the-job modules take place with the employer and three modules of formal technical training take place either in a FÁS training centre or an institute of technology. Phases 1, 3, 5 and 7 of the apprenticeship are carried out with the employer. Phase 2 is delivered in FÁS training centres and phases 4 and 6 are carried out, in the main in institutes of technology.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for the recruitment of apprentices rests with employers. Employers register their apprentices with FÁS.</P>
      <P>The standards-based apprenticeship system was introduced in 1993, following extensive consultation between the social partners and other interested parties. It replaced the old time-served model and is based on the attainment by apprentices of industry-agreed standards. The standards-based system covers 26 designated trades.</P>
      <P>Information in relation to the numbers entering and completing the system is held by FÁS. There has been an unprecedented increase in the number of apprentices registered with FÁS in recent years.</P>
      <P>The exceptional level of recruitment of apprentices by employers has placed strenuous demands on off-the-job training facilities in the institutes of technology throughout the country. This has resulted in some delays in apprentices being offered off-the-job training places under phases 4 and 6 of their apprenticeships.</P>
      <P>The Department of Education and Science has responded to the increased numbers by increasing the number of places available in institutes of technology. In 1999/2000 the number of apprenticeship places in the institutes for phases 4 and 6 has been increased from 5,436 to 7,120 places. The Department is in contact with the institutes with a view to further increases in this provision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>Part VII of the Child Care Act, 1991 provides for the supervision by health boards of pre-school services. National schools, as defined in the Act, and schools providing an educational programme similar to a national school are excluded from the remit of the Act. The issue which arises in the case of schools owned by the Irish Montessori Education Board &ndash; IMEB &ndash; is not the transfer of responsibility for the schools to my Department but how, in practice, the Child Care Act provisions are to apply to them in a way which balances the welfare of children and the effective operation of the schools. My Department has informed the Department of Health and Children that IMEB operates a system of accrediting and registering schools which in my Department's view ensures that the schools operate to high standards as regards the safety, care and welfare of the pupils and that in principle my Department would favour a situation where the IMEB schools would be dealt with under child care legislation in the same way as recognised schools. The Department of Health and Children were given a list of schools concerned with a request that the health boards be informed of the schools in their functional area and of my Department's views as regards the welfare of their pupils.</P>
      <P>My Department, together with both IMEB and the Department of Health and Children is at present actively considering how in the longer term the rights of children attending IMEB registered schools can best be guaranteed and the interests of the schools themselves promoted. The Deputy will also be aware that I am currently preparing a White Paper on early childhood education. The White Paper will address all aspects of early childhood education, including inspection of providers. In addition, this House will commence its debate on the Education (Welfare) Bill, 1999 next week. This Bill, when enacted, will provide important safeguards for the education of children of compulsory school going age, whether they receive their education in recognised schools or other places.</P>

      <Quest>whether his attention has been drawn to the number of anomalies in the third level grants scheme particularly in relation to clause three of the 1999 scheme whereby a break of five years is needed between return to college while a three year break only is needed in other countries; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>Since 1994 the higher education grants scheme and vocational education committees <Col N="559" /> scholarship scheme have included a concession for 'second chance' students returning to college after a break of at least five years having previously pursued, but not completed, a third level course. This concession allows such students to be funded again for periods of study at the same level. Prior to 1994, a student did not receive financial assistance until they had completed the equivalent amount of time spent on their original course, irrespective of the length of time, which had elapsed between the two periods of college attendance. There are similar arrangements applying for 'second chance' students under the free fees initiative.</P>
      <P>Data is not readily available in relation to the arrangements for second chance students, if any, under the student support arrangements in other EU countries. I have asked my officials to review the position of this category of students having regard to the practice in other EU countries. If the Deputy has any information, which may be of relevance in this regard, I would ask that he forward it to my officials. Finally, I would remind the Deputy that any extension of the third level student support schemes can only be considered in the light of overall resource constraints and the competing demands within the education sector.</P>

      <P>The core programme offered by the National University of Maynooth in Kilkenny is the BA degree in Local and Community Studies. This part-time degree programme was approved by the Higher Education Authority in 1996 on a self-financing basis. The course is approved for the purposes of tax relief under section 475 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997.</P>
      <P>My Department has sanctioned the continuation of the outreach centres operated by the Institute of Technology, Carlow at Seville Lodge, Kilkenny and at St. Peter's, Wexford for the academic year 1999/2000.</P>
      <P>On the issue of outreach centres generally, I understand that Higher Education Authority will be submitting the review report of the technical working group on outreach centres of education to my Department shortly. The question of approving any new outreach centres and the general question of support for existing arrangements will be considered on receipt of the report and in the context of the ongoing review of third level provision nationally and the competing demands for resources.</P>

      <P>I am aware that the school in question was involved in one of the groups which applied to my Department in 1998 for inclusion in the early school leavers initiative.</P>
      <P>All such applications were examined in detail by a selection committee comprised of departmental and non-departmental personnel who have expertise in this area. A total of 14 project areas were selected for inclusion in the present phase of the initiative. Unfortunately, the group involving the school in question was not successful at that time.</P>
      <P>One of the key objectives of the present phase of the initiative, which will operate up to June, 2000 is to test models of response to the problem of early school leaving with a view to their integration after evaluation into mainstream policy and practice.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that the proposal to which he refers will be fully considered in the event of further initiatives being undertaken in the area of early school leaving.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 859 and 860 together, as both concern my Department's decision not to pay the revised scales of the principals' and deputy principals' allowances to teachers who retired prior to 1 September 1996.</P>
      <P>My Department's position in regard to the payment of these allowances is based on the advice of the Department of Finance regarding Government decisions taken over the years regarding public service pensions and on the facts regarding my Department's longstanding practice.</P>
      <P>A teacher's pay is made up of incremental salary and a range of allowances. It is my Department's longstanding practice that the benefit of an increase in incremental salary will be reflected in the pensions of all retired teachers and that the benefit of an allowance will be reflected in the pensions of retired teachers who held that allowance in pay.</P>
      <P>My Department's practice in regard to allowances goes back to at least 1970, when post of responsibility allowances were introduced in the case of vocational teachers. Following further discussions with teachers' unions and school management, they were introduced in the case of secondary teachers in 1971. Although the allowances were payable with retrospective effect, they were not payable to teachers who had retired prior to 1 July 1968, the agreed effective date of establishment of the allowances. The Department of Finance has confirmed that my Department's practice has not been affected by Government decisions made over the years, most recently in 1997, regarding the link between public service pay and pensions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was agreed under the Programme for Competitiveness and Work that the revised scales of the principals' and deputy principals' allowances would be payable to teachers with effect from 1 September 1996. In accordance with longstanding <Col N="562" /> practice, the revised scales of the allowances are not payable to teachers who retired prior to that date.</P>
    <P>I should add that the allowance in question is related to the numbers of teachers employed in the school and that the scale of the allowance held at retirement continues to be reckoned in the pension irrespective of whether the numbers fall or rise after retirement.</P>

    <P>To date, my Department has sanctioned a total of four full-time resource teaching posts which cater for 17 schools and part-time resource teaching hours in another four schools in County Kerry. A total of 23 full-time and one part-time special needs assistant posts have been sanctioned for County Kerry as of 1 September 1999.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will realise that this represents a major advance on previous provision and I can assure him that applications are being processed <Col N="565" /> as speedily as possible within available manpower resources and consistent with ensuring that each child's application receives appropriate expert attention.</P>

This requirement embodies both the written and oral element of a student's proficiency in Irish. My Department considers it to be the minimum standard in Irish necessary for students entering a teacher training course which will equip them to teach Irish to pupils at all levels of the primary school.</P>
      <P>While I have no plans to amend this requirement, requirements in this area are kept under review by my Department in consultation with the authorities of the colleges of education, and are also being considered by the working group established by me to review the full-time pre-service teacher training courses.</P>

An application was recently received for additional support to cater for an increase in the number of pupils with special needs.</P>
      <P>The caseload of the resource teacher was reviewed. My Department then sanctioned additional support in the form of part-time hours. Following an appeal by the schools, it was decided the full-time resource post would be continued to be based in the school in question, but the post would now be shared with just one other school. Part-time hours were sanctioned to cater for the needs of the other two schools.</P>

      <P>Under the terms of the ESF maintenance grant scheme, grants are not payable in respect of a repeat year of study on the same course, except at the discretion of the VEC in exceptional circumstances, such as cases of certified serious illness. Furthermore, a grant-holder may generally only receive funding for the approved duration of one ESF-aided course. However, subject to a maximum funding duration of four years, a grant may be continued for a grant-holder who, having passed, failed or not completed the first year of a course, wishes to transfer to a different course.</P>
      <P>I have been advised by County Wexford VEC that the student in question initially advised that he intended repeating first year of a certificate course in industrial services at Cork Institute of Technology. As he had previously pursued part of this course in 1997-98 he would have been ineligible for funding in respect of the repeat year. He has since advised County Wexford VEC that he now intends to pursue a course in construction studies &ndash; interior architecture technology &ndash; at Cork Institute of Technology. The VEC is currently awaiting confirmation of his registration on this course. On receipt thereof, I understand that he will be eligible for funding in respect of his attendance on the new course.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 877, 882 and 949 together.</P>
      <P>I have been concerned for some time about the number of large classes in the primary system and have been examining ways to target additional teaching resources to those schools with the greatest need in this area. The new staffing schedule which issued in April last has been structured to ensure that all primary schools will operate to a maximum class size of 30 pupils.</P>
      <P>However, the staffing schedule has traditionally been applied on the basis of the previous year's enrolment figures, and this continues to be the case. Therefore, the schools which will benefit from the new schedule are those whose enrolment in September 1998 qualifies them for an additional post in the 1999-2000 school year &ndash; as set out in Department Circulars 5/99 and 21/99. Such schools will, therefore, be in a position to organise classes in such a way as to ensure that there are no longer any very large classes.</P>
      <P>The enrolment at Kilternan Church of Ireland School on 30 September 1998 of 117 pupils warrants the staffing of a principal and three mainstream class teachers for the current school year. This gives a maximum class size of just over 29 which is within the guidelines outlined in Circulars 5/99 and 21/99. This is the same staffing which the school had for the 1998-99 school year. In addition, the school has the services of a shared remedial teacher.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Schools which experience a rapid increase in enrolment in September 1999 may qualify for the appointment of an additional teaching post immediately provided that they satisfy the requirements for developing school status as outlined in Circular 15/99 which issued last May. The <Col N="569" /> actual enrolment at Kilternan Church of Ireland School on 1 September 1999 of 134 pupils, an increase of 17 pupils on the enrolment at the school on 30 September 1998, does not meet the developing school criteria as outlined in Circular 15/99. Therefore, there is no basis for appointing an additional teacher to the school for the 1999-2000 school year.</P>

      <asker>Mr. Shatter</asker>
      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
      <Quest>when Circular No. 3/95 (details supplied) in relation to maximum class sizes was rescinded and replaced by Circular No. 21/1999.</Quest>
      <QRef>[17804/99]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">

      <P>I have been concerned for some time about the number of large classes in the primary system, and have been examining ways to target additional teaching resources to schools with the greatest need in this area. The staffing schedule which issued with Circular No. 5/99 in April last was structured to ensure that all primary schools will operate to a maximum class size of 30 pupils. In effect, therefore, the old maximum class size guidelines have been obsolete since the commencement of the current school year. However, the staffing schedule has traditionally been applied on the basis of the enrolment figures for the previous school year, and this continues to be the case. Therefore, the schools which will initially benefit from the new schedule are those who qualify for an additional post on the basis of their enrolment in September 1998. These schools will be in a position to achieve average class sizes which meet the 30 pupil objective, in accordance with the terms of Circular No. 21/99.</P>
      <P>Schools which are designated as disadvantaged will continue to operate to a maximum class size guideline of 29. Such schools which are unable to organise classes in compliance with this guideline may apply for an additional post before 1 November 1999.</P>

      <P>The school in question has sanction from my Department for a special class for pupils with a specific speech and language disorder. Such special classes operate with a pupil teacher ratio of 7:1 and have the service of a full-time speech therapist. The health authorities, through the relevant health board, provide therapy services. The employment and funding for the speech therapist in this instance is the responsibility of the Eastern Health Board.</P>

I have referred this matter to my colleague the Minister for Health and Children for his attention.</P>
    <P>I have also asked my officials to carry out a review of the general situation concerning the provision of speech therapy services in special schools and special classes, in consultation with the Department of Health and Children. My objective is to ensure that the system is in a position to respond in a positive and efficient manner to the needs which arise within the school system. The needs of the school referred to by the Deputy will be considered in the context of this review.</P>

      <P>The NUI degree of B.Sc. in physiotherapy introduced by the Royal College of Surgeons has been approved for the purposes of the higher education grants scheme. However, under the terms of the higher education grants scheme, grants are not payable to candidates who already hold an undergraduate degree and are pursuing a second undergraduate degree. I understand that the candidate in question gained admission to the second year of the course by virtue of already holding a relevant primary degree. Accordingly, she is not eligible for financial assistance in respect of her attendance on this course.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the case as outlined in the correspondence referred to and I understand that the candidate to whom the Deputy refers was awarded a grant under the terms of the European Social Fund &ndash; aided grants scheme for trainees, 1997, in respect of her attendance on the national certificate in electronics course at Letterkenny Institute of Technology. Under the terms of the scheme a grant is tenable for the normal duration of the approved course and is renewable annually subject to satisfactory attainment. Grants may not be paid in respect of a repeat year of study on the same course except where a vocational education committee, at its discretion, waives this provision in exceptional circumstances such as cases of certified serious illness.</P>
      <P>As the student in question failed part of her second year exams and is now due to repeat the year, she is ineligible for funding under the scheme. As the terms of the scheme are of general application, exceptions cannot be made in individual cases. Finally, I would mention that my Department operates a hardship fund which is administered locally through the third level institutions. One of the objectives of this fund is to assist students in a sensitive and compassionate manner who might otherwise because of financial reasons suffer hardship or be unable to continue their third level studies. If the student in question experiences severe financial hardship while attending college she may apply to the student welfare officer at the college she is attending for financial assistance from the hardship fund.</P>

      <P>The objective in making special arrangements at the certificate examinations for students who have either specific learning difficulties or difficulties which arise from a physical or medical condition, is to ensure as far as possible that such candidates are enabled to demonstrate at the examination their level of ability.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy will agree that, in the interests of equity and fairness across the entire body of candidates and indeed to ensure the credibility of the examination system, the work done by students must ultimately be assessed according to the same strictly objective criteria. This is achieved by having a common marking scheme apply to the work of all candidates in a subject and at the same time by ensuring that every effort is made to ensure that full credit is given in accordance with that marking scheme for the work done. In this regard all examiners who have a difficulty in accessing the information given by a candidate are instructed to refer the script to their supervising examiner. This approach is intended to ensure that, notwithstanding any presentational or readability difficulties, every effort is made by the examiner or supervising examiner to ensure that the candidate is given full credit for all work done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The leaving certificate appeals process exists to provide an aggrieved candidate with an opportunity to have his or her script fully remarked. This is done in accordance with the original marking scheme in the interests of equity and fairness to all candidates. The objective of the appeals process is to detect and correct any error in the original marking and in doing so to ensure that all the examination candidates are treated in a fair and even-handed manner. The appeals process is rigorous and has the integrity to detect and correct any error in the original marking of a can<Col N="574" /> didate's work and to ensure that a candidate is given credit for work done. This includes ensuring that the work submitted is fully assessed.</P>

      <P>The standards-based apprenticeship system was introduced in 1993, following extensive consultation between the social partners and other interested parties. It replaced the old time-served model and is based on the attainment by apprentices of industry-agreed standards. The standards-based system covers 26 designated trades.</P>
      <P>Information in relation to the numbers entering and completing the system is held by FÁS. There has been an unprecedented increase in the number of apprentices registered with FÁS in recent years.</P>
      <P>The exceptional level of recruitment of apprentices by employers has placed strenuous demands on off-the-job training facilities in the institutes of technology throughout the country. This has resulted in some delays in apprentices being offered off-the-job training places under phases 4 and 6 of their apprenticeships.</P>
      <P>The Department of Education and Science has responded to the increased numbers by increasing the number of places available in institutes of technology. In 1992-2000, the number of apprenticeship places in the institutes for phases 4 and 6 has been increased from 5,436 to 7,120 places. The Department is in contact with the institutes with a view to further increases in this provision.</P>

      <P>The assessment of means under the third level student support schemes maintenance grants scheme is based on gross income with certain deductions for specified social welfare and health board payments. Any proposal to move to a means assessment system based on net income would have significant financial implications in addition to equity issues which would have to be addressed.</P>
      <P>It has been the practice in recent years to increase the reckonable income limits in line with movements in the average industrial wage. The figures are provided by the Central Statistics Office and are computed in each case to March of the previous year. The average industrial wage increase for the period March 1997 to March 1998 was 4.6 per cent. The reckonable income limits for the 1999-2000 academic year were therefore increased by 4.6 per cent.</P>
      <P>The increase in the reckonable income limits was also applied to the allowance by which the income limits may be increased in respect of other family members pursuing a course of study. In such cases, for the 1999-2000 academic year, the reckonable income limits may be increased by £2,160 where there are two such children, £4,320 where there are three, and so on by increments of £2,160.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the terms of the student support schemes, maintenance grants are payable to eligible students at either the adjacent or the non-adjacent rate. Except in the case of mature students, the adjacent rate of maintenance grant is payable where the grant-holder's normal residence is 15 miles or less from the college being attended. The non-adjacent rate of maintenance grant is payable in all other cases. Prior to 1995, students who were residing more than 15 miles from the college and who could reasonably be expected to travel to college from each day having regard to the journey and available transport, were only entitled to the adjacent rate of maintenance grant. The schemes of third level student support, since 1995, provide that the non-adjacent rate would be payable in all circumstances where the student resides more than 15 miles from college.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any proposal to align the rates of grant payable at the non-adjacent rate of grant would have significant cost implications. I have previously indicated my intention is to first seek to deal with the more significant anomalies or disincentives in the grants scheme before dealing with the more general issues of grant levels. In this regard, I have announced that, with effect from the coming academic year, all eligible mature students will qualify for the higher non-adjacent rate of grant. I was particularly concerned about mature students <Col N="583" /> and independent mature students in particular in regard to the rate of grant payable. With effect from the current academic year all eligible mature students will qualify for the higher non-adjacent rate of grant. This improvement is estimated to cost £2.4 million over the next two years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The school transport scheme was devised to provide a basic service for all eligible pupils who might, otherwise, find it difficult to attend school regularly. It was not designed to provide a door to door service.</P>
      <P>Arrangements also exist to accommodate ineligible pupils on State services, on a fee-paying basis, where it is possible to do so without additional costs. Ineligible pupils residing in another school area must make their way to the nearest pick up point in the catchment of the school of attendance. A bus route would not be extended into an adjacent school area to collect ineligible pupils.</P>
      <P>Circumstances where parents would be prepared to pay for the cost of extending a bus service would not in itself be acceptable because there may be other parents who could not afford to do so.

      <P>The school transport scheme was designed to provide a basic level of service for children in rural areas who, if living a long distance from their nearest school, might have difficulty in attending regularly.</P>
      <P>Safety is of paramount importance to my Department and to Bus Éireann, who operate the school transport scheme on behalf of my Department. In the planning of routes, road conditions, traffic hazards and all other aspects of safety are considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a guideline, primary and post-primary school transport routes are planned so that, as far as possible, no eligible child will have more than 1.5 and 3.0 miles respectively to travel to a pick-up point. Pupils living off the main route of a service are generally expected to make their own <Col N="585" /> way, or be brought to convenient pick-up points along the main route.</P>
    <P>A door to door service was never envisaged as part of the scheme. The cost of providing this kind of facility on a nationwide basis would be prohibitive. In the circumstances my Department has no plans to provide such a service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The higher education grants scheme 1999 issued to all local authorities on the 8 July 1999. Arrangements had been made to have copies of the application forms and notes delivered by courier, to all local authority offices earlier that week. The later issue of the schemes is attributable in part to the introduction this year of a composite application form for all four student support schemes. The application form and notes were redesigned by a working group comprising representatives of various local authorities, vocational education committees and my Department's student support unit. Those LAs and vocational education committees that were not represented on the working group were also invited to make suggestions. All proposals were considered and implemented where feasible. I believe that the new application form and notes have been very well received by both the authorities involved and individual applicants.</P>
      <P>Copies of the application form and notes were supplied to the grant awarding authorities for the first time this year. Prior to this, each authority bore the responsibility of having their own application forms and notes printed. Therefore, the direct provision of the relevant forms facilitated their immediate distribution to applicants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The closing date for applications are prescribed in the scheme was 6 August 1999. The local auth<Col N="587" /> orities have discretion to accept late applications and generally do so. Indeed, it appears that up to half of all applicants only submit their applications following the release of the leaving certificate results and CAO college offers.</P>
    <P>The local authorities process their applications as speedily as possible and will issue grant payments to eligible students as early as possible in the academic year. I am not aware of any difficulties being encountered to date. I would point out to the Deputy that delays in confirming grant entitlements can arise for a variety of reasons, including incomplete application forms, queries, etc.</P>
    <P>The assessment of means under the third level student support schemes maintenance grants scheme, in the case of both the employed and self-employed is based on gross income with certain deductions for specified social welfare and health board payments. Any proposal to move to introduce a different method of means assessment system would have significant financial implications in addition to equity issues which would have to be addressed.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The leaving certificate applied has been introduced on a phased basis since September 1995 when it was introduced in 50 centres.

    <P>Each year, all second level schools are invited to apply or re-apply to provide the leaving certificate applied. Schools which express an interest in introducing the programme are provided with briefing and inservice support by the leaving certificate support service. A further 39 second level schools have provisionally indicated their intention to introduce the programme for the first time in the current (1999/00) school year.</P>
    <P>Supports for second level schools in the free education scheme which introduce the leaving supports for second level schools in the free education scheme which introduce the leaving certificate applied include: an annual resource grant calculated on the basis of £125 per leaving certificate applied pupil, and grants for the purchase of necessary equipment.</P>

      <P>Different funding arrangements are in place for VEC managed schools and voluntary secondary schools. Direct comparison between the two sectors either on a local or national basis is therefore difficult.</P>
      <P>The financial allocations for vocational schools and community colleges are made to vocational education committees as part of a block grant to cover VEC head office overheads and other activities apart from the second-level programme. The allocations take account of enrolments and a range of other local factors. Vocational education committees also receive non-teaching staffing allocations, in respect of which my Department meets the full cost in accordance with centrally agreed salary scales. Each VEC has discretion to allocate funding and staffing allocations in accordance with its own priorities. Voluntary secondary schools are funded on a <i>per capita</i> basis based upon enrolments. The standard <i>per capita</i> grant for secondary schools currently stands at £184. These schools also receive grants of £30 and £25 per pupil towards the provision of secretarial and caretaking services, respectively, subject to maxima of £10,500 and £8,750, respectively.</P>
      <P>A steering group on funding is currently examining the matter of equity of funding between the various sectors at second level.

I would point out students may have their grant aid continued for the remainder of the course, once they have successfully completed the repeat year.</P>
      <P>There is also provision in the higher education grants scheme and the VEC scholarships scheme for the payment of a grant to a student repeating the same year level of a course where the student is a second chance student, returning to study after a break of at least five years. I have no plans to alter the provisions of the student support schemes as they relate to students who must repeat a year level as a result of not being successful in their end of year examinations.</P>

      <P>The higher education grants scheme 1999 issued to all local authorities on the 8 July 1999 and arrangements had been made to have copies of the application forms and notes delivered by courier to all local authority offices earlier that week. The delay in the issue of the schemes is attributable in part to the introduction this year of a a composite application form for all four student support schemes. The application form and notes were redesigned by a working group comprising representatives of various local authorities, vocational education committees and my Department's student support unit. Those local authorities and vocational education committees that were not represented on the working group were also invited to make suggestions. All proposals were considered and implemented where feasible. I believe that the new application form and notes have been very well received by both the authorities involved and individual applicants.</P>
      <P>Copies of the application form and notes were supplied to the grant awarding authorities for the first time this year. Prior to this, each authority bore the responsibility of having their own application forms and notes printed. Therefore, the direct provision of the relevant forms facilitated their immediate distribution to applicants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to further improvements in the administration of the third level grant schemes, I reiterate my commitment to such improvements and the Deputy may be aware of the review being undertaken by my officials and officials of the <Col N="598" /> Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. I have previously indicated that no irrevocable decisions will be taken in relation to any future arrangements without appropriate consultation with all interested parties.</P>

      <P>In 1992, the school in question was allocated a resource teacher to cater for the educational needs of pupils with special needs. That post was shared with three other schools. An application was recently received for additional support to cater for an increase in the number of pupils with special needs.</P>
      <P>In December 1998, nine hours per week, one-to-one tuition was sanctioned for the pupil in question on a temporary basis, pending a review of existing resources within the school. Following this review, the resource post was reorganised by my Department. This reduced the level of support to five hours one-to-one tuition per week as the pupil is also on the caseload of the full-time resource teacher.</P>

      <P>As I explained in my reply to Parliamen<Col N="599" /> tary Question No. 267 on 29 June 1999, in order to achieve maximum co-ordination of school transport services in relation to the opening and closing of primary and post-primary schools, a calendar of school days is drawn up each year by the transport liaison officer in consultation with the schools involved. Where schools fail to agree a calendar, the transport liaison officer has instruction to draw up a calendar for the area, which ensures that there is no duplication of service. All schools are given the opportunity to submit a calendar for the year before timetables are decided. The fact that a service does not operate to the school in question on certain days is in line with the operation of a co-ordinated calendar. To sanction transport services for days outside the co-ordinated calendar would undermine the co-ordination process and would also involve significant extra costs, which would not be justified. In the circumstances I cannot give the guarantee being sought by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>The holders of qualifications, which do not have general recognition, must apply to the Registration Council on an individual basis for recognition of the particular qualifications held for the purpose of securing an incremental teaching position in a secondary school. The qualifi<Col N="600" /> cations held by the person in question do not have general recognition. An application for recognition of her qualifications was submitted on 31 March 1999. Further information was sought from the applicant and this was received on 28 July 1999. Her application is being processed in accordance with the council's normal procedures and it is expected that it will be presented to the Registration Council for consideration at its meeting on 20 October 1999. The applicant will be notified of the outcome as soon as possible thereafter.</P>

      <P>My Department is fully committed to the provision of a new school for Gaelscoil Uí Dhoghair and discussions with the board of management in the matter have been ongoing. Local developers have confirmed their agreement to allow water and sewerage connection to their facilities and this offer is currently being considered. My Department will be in contact with the solicitors acting on behalf of the committee shortly to determine the site acquisition costs. When this process has been completed, the matter of planning permission will be addressed in the first instance. It is too early at this point to say when construction will commence.</P>
