    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 9, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I visited Hungary, Slovenia and Kosovo from 2 to 5 November. My visit to Hungary and Slovenia had the objective of strengthening bilateral political and economic relations with two countries that will shortly be members of the European Union. It was highly successful in this respect.</P>
      <P>My visit commenced in Hungary where I met the Prime Minister, Mr. Viktor Orban; the President, Mr. Arpad Göncz and the Speaker of the National Assembly, Mr. Janos Ader. In Slovenia on 4 November I met the Prime Minister, Mr. Janez Drnovsek and the President, Mr. Milan Kucan. While inevitably the main focus of my discussions was bilateral issues and Hungary's and Slovenia's early accession to the Union, which I support, I also discussed a wide range of issues including the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference, the Balkan Stability Pact and the OSCE Summit in Istanbul.</P>
      <P>In Hungary, following my meeting with Prime Minister Orban, I signed an agreement on combating serious crime which provides for co-operation, information exchange and expertise sharing in this area between our two countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the political meetings I have mentioned, I hosted a working breakfast in Budapest for top Hungarian business leaders, including the Governor of the Hungarian Central Bank, to discuss Ireland's recent economic performance and the further development of trade between Hungary and Ireland. I also made an address to <Col N="1279" /> the Budapest Economics University entitled &ldquo;Ireland from the Periphery to the Centre of Europe.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The visit to Hungary and Slovenia came at an important time, given the European Commission's recent progress reports on the state of preparations of the accession countries for membership of the Union. In addition, the Helsinki European Council due to be held next month will consider the future conduct of the negotiation process. Hungary and Slovenia are among the most advanced of the EU accession candidates for membership of the Union and it is therefore important to build upon our already strong relations with them prior to their accession to the Union.</P>
    <P>On 4 November, I commenced a visit to Kosovo to meet with and express thanks to the 104 Irish Defence Forces personnel serving with KFOR and to reinforce the European Union's solidarity with the local communities. My visit included a tour of the First Irish Transport Group's area of operations. I also met the senior UN, KFOR, EU, police and OSCE representatives to learn at first hand of the situation on the ground in Kosovo. I met local Kosovar Albanian families and representatives of Irish NGOs, Concern and GOAL, operating in Kosovo. I extend my sympathies to the family of the young GOAL aid worker, Andrea Curry, who died tragically during last weekend.</P>
    <P>I held a lengthy discussion with the head of the Serbian Orthodox Church in Kosovo, Bishop Radosavljevic. In the course of the discussion, we were joined by Mr. Momcilo Trajkovic, a leading Serbian political figure who had been injured in a shooting incident some days previously. The Stability Pact for the region will be reviewed at the OSCE Summit in Istanbul this week and, given Ireland's role as chair of the Council of Ministers of the Council of Europe, my visit to Kosovo was timely.</P>
    <P>The next European Council will take place in Helsinki on 10 and 11 December but no formal agenda has been circulated for the meeting as yet. The issues and how the Presidency plans to approach them will gradually become clearer as Helsinki approaches and, in particular, after my meeting with Prime Minister Lipponen on 30 November as part of his tour of capitals. However, on the basis of preparatory work so far, I expect the issues to include enlargement and, in particular the scope, pace and nature of the negotiations, economic, employment and taxation measures, preparations for the intergovernmental conference to be launched under the Portuguese Presidency and consideration of the Trumpf-Piris Report on the operation of the Council.</P>
    <P>As regards security and defence, the European Council will consider a progress report by the Finnish Presidency on the progress made in implementing the Treaty of Amsterdam's provisions on Petersberg tasks. This will be a follow-up to the Cologne European Council conclusions <Col N="1280" /> of last June. As indicated at Cologne, the process is likely to result in final decisions by the end of next year. The Union's Millennium Declaration is also set to be discussed at Helsinki.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, a number of questions have been grouped together and, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I would like to ask questions about Hungary first and return later to the Helsinki Summit which has little or no relation to the visit to Hungary.</P>
      <P>When did the convention start that Taoisigh would wear military flak jackets abroad? Is this a new development? I thought there was a separation between the armed forces, as a professional group, and civilian politicians. What was the thinking or reason that allowed the Taoiseach to wear the flak jacket? Was it a security arrangement or is it a new type of garb we wear when we go abroad?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a separate question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>Sorry, Sir, the question arises specifically from the Taoiseach's visit to Kosovo. It is legitimate. There was a banner front page photograph. President Clinton and John Major have done this and Mrs. Thatcher would like to have done so, if she did not already do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy must put down a question specifically on that subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>The issues are related to the question. Since 1922 we have prided ourselves on the clear separation between military and civilian activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should not make a statement on it; he should ask the Taoiseach a question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>My question, Sir, which you attempted to rule out of order, was when did this new convention commence and why did the Taoiseach do so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know when the convention commenced. It was the second occasion the Army gave me a flak jacket to wear in locations I visited. I also wore one in south Lebanon last year when I toured the missions there. On this occasion, I also wore a flak jacket on our tour when the Army presented me with one, which had the Taoiseach's name on it. I did not think too much about it and did not believe it upset anybody. I was honoured to wear it, and I still am.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>It will not be long before the Taoiseach has to wear one at parliamentary party meetings.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach regard ethnic cleansing as universally reprehensible regardless of the ethnic group against whom it is committed? Is he aware of the systematic mistreatment of the Romany community by Kosovar Albanians in Kosovo and that 450 Romany have had to leave Kosovo because of the activities of the UCK and now find themselves in a refugee camp previously occupied by Kosovar Albanians outside Kosovo? What stand are the Taoiseach and the Government taking on the mistreatment of the Serb, the Romany and the Turkish minorities in Kosovo?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I condemn and deplore ethnic cleansing from whatever source. One of the things I learned in Kosovo was that the Romany community is attacked by all sides. The Kosovar Albanians and the Serbs have taken action against them in several instances. Many of them have been killed or pushed out of temporary locations and I condemn that totally. Before I went we debated the matter in the House and it was suggested that I talk to leaders of the Serbian community. I met religious and political leaders and they highlighted the position of those Serbians who have been forced out of Pristina and the surrounding countryside in great numbers, although some have returned of late. While hundreds have been killed, the religious and political leaders I met felt that KFOR was doing a useful job. They also raised the issue of violence against the Roma community with me.</P>
      <P>After I met those Serbian leaders I met the KFOR, UN and OSCE groups and I raised these issues with them as they had been presented to me. While they disputed some of the facts and would not agree with every detail, I highlighted the fact that the Roma community was having a tough time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree with the comments of the US State Department deploring the Russian bombardment of civilians in Chechnya? If the Taoiseach agrees, as I suspect he will, does he therefore agree that the same standards should be applied to the equally <Col N="1282" /> deplorable NATO bombing of Belgrade and the ongoing brutalisation of the people of Iraq through continuing bombings and sanctions, particularly now we have influence through Partnership for Peace?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government fully condemns all acts of terrorism, including all the acts perpetrated against the people of Chechnya and the bombing of Russian cities in September. We recognise the territorial integrity of the Russian Federation and the need for the federal authorities to take measures to deal with terrorism. However, it is essential that universal human rights and the principles of international humanitarian rights be upheld and respected. There can be no military solution in Chechnya. I have met Mr. Putin in the past and I hope to raise the issue of what is happening under the umbrella of the OSCE with him in the next few days. They need to find a lasting political solution and the EU has spelt out very clearly how this should be done. Ireland supports that position.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am calling Deputy Gormley. I have given the Deputy the opportunity to ask one question. If there is time I will return to him.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach did not answer the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley:</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Taoiseach left he gave a commitment to raise the issue of depleted uranium weapons. Did he raise that matter? What was the response? Is the Taoiseach aware that the UN Environment Programme's Balkans task force is now examining the terrible environmental catastrophe that has taken place in this area because of the war? Does he agree with Mr. Pekka Haavisto, the leader of that group, who says we need to change the rules of war as a consequence? Was that matter raised in any context? Did the Taoiseach get the opportunity to talk to anyone about Ireland's possible participation in PfP manoeuvres in the area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I told Deputy Gormley I would raise those issues and I did so. I raised the task of reconstruction in several meetings with UNMIK and other organisations about refugees, the health and safety of the population and landmine clearance. Most of the danger zones have been marked out by KFOR and UNMIK has been trying to deal with the depleted uranium shells.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the second question, I am aware of the health and environmental concerns raised in some quarters outside Kosovo about the use of depleted uranium shells. It is still an issue and UNMIK is putting a great deal of resources into treating them. I do not claim to be a military expert but I think it will be a long haul because <Col N="1283" /> enormous stretches of farms and other land are fenced off. A great deal of that land will be out of bounds for harvesting next year until this matter is dealt with. It seems to be a major issue. In reply to the last question, nobody raised PfP.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> Did the Taoiseach raise military matters or any aspect of military co-operation or armaments in his discussions in Hungary and Slovenia? In the context of the EU summit, did he discuss with representatives of the Russian military in Kosovo, the indiscriminate shelling of villages and residential areas in Chechnya, which is allegedly being carried out in a fight against terrorism, despite the fact that thousands of innocent civilians are being killed and injured? Does the Taoiseach regret the <i>carte blanche</i> he extended to the Russian Government in its campaign when he visited Russia, about which I previously questioned him? NATO took a stand in Kosovo, allegedly for the civil rights of the Kosovar Albanian people. What did the Taoiseach say in his discussions with KFOR about the fact that innocent Serb civilians and Roma people, to whom the leader of Fine Gael alluded, are being persecuted and their civil rights thwarted daily? Did the Taoiseach have a concrete discussion about their plight? Just as he identified with the suffering of the Kosovar Albanians and their persecution by the Serbian military, what practical steps did representatives of NATO say they were taking to protect this other group of innocent people who are now so put upon in Kosovo?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>As I already said, the Government condemns all acts of terrorism in Chechnya, including those which have taken place recently. The EU has taken a strong position on this. From our point of view, and that of the EU, it is essential that universal human rights and the principles of humanitarian and international law are respected. The EU has urged a political solution to the difficulties in Chechyna. This issue will feature largely at the OSCE in the next few days. The chairman in office of the OSCE and the head of the OSCE mission to Chechnya has made clear to the Russian authorities the readiness of OSCE to help find a political solution in Chechnya, which should be reached regardless of the acts perpetrated against certain elements. It is our view, and that of the EU, that this issue should be dealt with by the Russians with the President. Whatever difficulties he may have, he is an elected President and they should try to find a political resolution with him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I spoke at length about the difficulties with the bishop, who is the much respected leader of the Serbian Orthodox community. He is under siege and is unable to leave the monastery. He has lost 85 of his churches in the past few months and has seen 150,000 of his people flee to Serbia, although some are returning. He outlined the position as he saw it and I relayed that to the various forces as he requested me and I agreed to do. He and <Col N="1284" /> the political leader acknowledged that KFOR troops are working to the best of their abilities. They are protecting each of the churches individually, which is much appreciated by the religious leaders. There are 54,000 troops in the area, which is smaller than Munster. There is an enormous concentration of military. It almost seems as if the military are on every corner. There are heavy patrols at night in the villages, but some people are still active. It is said that some of them are from outside the area but I cannot be certain that is the case.</P>
    <P>Although it will be difficult, attempts are being made to try to settle matters between the Kosovar Albanians and remaining Serbs. There are efforts to deal with the situation on the ground but, from what I gleaned from the Serbian side, I understand the reason the number of attacks on Serbs has fallen is because there are not many Serbs left in the area. Others would say they have been enormously successful but I am trying to give a balanced report to the House and if people are gone, they cannot be attacked.</P>

      <P>When I drove through the area, there was little or no damage to most of the Serb villages. However, the Kosovar Albanian villages were gone. They were burned to the ground or wrecked; only the odd house was still standing. Most of the people were living in cowsheds or other animal sheds. Some were living in dykes while others were living in dwellings in hedges in fields. Few have homes and the Irish troops have been involved in a small humanitarian operation to try to assist them. GOAL and Concern are involved in projects such as mending tractors and helping them with basic matters. The Serbs have been driven out and I hope they will return. Kosovar Albanians have been burned out and are trying to live beside their former homes. It is a sorry position but 54,000 troops are trying to protect all sides.</P>

      <P>What does the Taoiseach consider will be the ultimate constitutional settlement in Kosovo? Is it not the case that the military and political objective of the Kosovo Liberation Army is Albanian majority rule in Kosovo of the type practised by Unionists in Northern Ireland from 1921 until 1970 which had no good consequences? There is no will among the Kosovar majority in Kosovo to share power and there is no political consensus within Kosovo underlying the objectives of KFOR. Its objectives will not be achieved because there is no underlying political consensus.</P>

      <P>From what all the groups told me, including the Irish military authorities who are doing an excellent job and who have their own assessment of the situation on the ground &ndash; they are involved in transport so they travel throughout the region &ndash; there is no common ground at this stage. This is not surprising given that most of the atrocities against the Albanian Kosovars took place in late April when there were mass executions of their people. To put it at its mildest, they are not in the frame of mind of trying to be logical about the future. UNMIK's role is to try establish a system of local government. It is trying to establish a police force and some type of administration because there was no system of administration in the region when they arrived. The Serbian leaders would like UNMIK to protect the Serbian people and allow them some autonomy within their communities in the short-term while they try to stabilise their position and entice people back. They believe that if KFOR gets on top of the situation, and if there is intense security, their people will return. In reply to Deputy Bruton, I do not see integration taking place at this stage.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that there was, and remains, a fundamental contradiction between the strategic objectives of KFOR and NATO and the military methods they used in the sense that the strategic objective was that Kosovo should remain an integral sovereign part of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia? Will he also agree that the methods used on both sides have had the effect of rendering that absolutely impossible without any semblance of consent by the people of Kosovo and that there is no hope now of achieving the NATO objective of reintegrating Kosovo into the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>A few months on, it is difficult to see this being achieved. However, the KFOR mission and the UNMIK brief is to try to establish an administration which will allow Kosovan Albanians and Serbians to live side by side in the territory where they lived quite peaceably in the past. It is horrendous that people who lived side by side in the past cannot now do so. Unfortunately, when one reaches a Serbian village, one is informed that it is 98% Serbian &ndash; non-Serbian houses can be easily identified. When one reaches the next village, one is informed that it is a Kosovan-Albanian area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of that. These issues can arise anywhere. However, communities can be easily identified in that region. When Milosevic's forces invaded, they knew exactly the areas to attack. This situation has now been reversed but it is easing substantially all the time. The <Col N="1286" /> UNMIK forces must establish a new administration and there must be intense security by KFOR forces to try to bring about peace. There are no warring groups but small gangs attack Serbian houses at night and drive people out. Unfortunately, we are not unfamiliar with issues such as this in parts of this island. If KFOR can solve this problem, perhaps people can try to rebuild the country. Confidence is now being built up with the Serbians and churches are being protected. Unfortunately, some 13th and 14th century churches were attacked. This did not reassure the Serbian people about the troop deployments but relationships now appear to be improving. While the bishop was quite critical in his remarks, he was happy to give some credit. KFOR is now listening more carefully. I endeavoured, to the best of my ability, to put the Serbian side to all the representative bodies. They did not agree with everything I said but I think what I said was of some benefit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>On a related matter, will the Taoiseach inquire about the effect NATO bombing has had on basic infrastructure for the preservation of heating, for example, and other necessities of life in Serbia proper? Is anything being done to provide humanitarian assistance in Serbia proper? In particular, is the Taoiseach aware of the exceptionally severe effect in Montenegro of sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, given that Montenegrans did not support ethnic cleansing or were not involved in the Serb military effort in Kosovo? They are suffering grievously as a result of the sanctions and the only people who can do anything for them are Mafia gangs who are able to breach sanctions. Sanctions create a criminal state in places like Montenegro because only criminal gangs have the effectiveness to feed the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately the same applies in many parts of the region where outside gangs use these circumstances for their own evil activities, to generate ill-gotten gains and to make a substantial killing with resources. Many of the attacks are from people who do not want KFOR to operate as a peacekeeping force and who are endeavouring to increase tensions.</P>
      <P>I have raised the matter of sanctions against Serbia on several occasions. As I said previously, we have attached importance to the successful implementation of the projects which have been considered. In particular, the energy for democracy programme is using heavy fuel, which originally was not being used anywhere, on a pilot basis in the cities of Nis and Pirot. On the basis of that experience, the intention is to extend it rapidly to other parts of Serbia and that is already happening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Effective sanctions should be targeted at the regime; the people of Serbia should not be punished because of these issues. We have stressed that ordinary citizens should not suffer, as is usually the case. It is on the basis of this deep con<Col N="1287" /> cern about the well-being of the citizens of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia that the EU has discussed the possibility of providing further assistance to the Serbian population. Again, that is to be discussed shortly. Some 56 million euro has been provided for the community under the European Community Humanitarian Office to provide for the kinds of issues about which Deputy Higgins asked on another occasion, to provide basic food stuffs, medicines and repairs for the most vulnerable groups of the population, the sick, the elderly and displaced people. This month plans have been made for accommodation and vaccination campaigns, to provide assistance for food and heating to social institutions and for water, sanitation and returning refugees. I am not saying these plans will solve every problem but they are ongoing and hopefully they will at least improve matters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask three separate but connected questions. Will the Taoiseach refer specifically to Chechnya at the OSCE conference which will take place later this week in Istanbul? Will he condemn what appears to be the indiscriminate bombing of civilians by the Russian authorities? On his visit to Slovenia, was the question of a residential embassy raised with the Slovenian authorities on the basis that Ireland has only three residential embassies with the five plus one applicants for EU membership? Regarding the Taoiseach's initial reply, when does he expect early membership of the EU to take effect? Is Hungary and Slovenia on a fast track ahead of the other four states, including Cyprus? On what date does he expect the decision to be made to agree that they qualify for full membership and when will they become full members following that decision, allowing for referenda and other decision making processes across the 15 member states?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I will, as I have done here, and I did so when I was there. An embassy in Slovenia is not on the list at this stage. It is purely a matter or resources. However, our interests are being well catered for by our ambassador.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the ambassador raise this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>No. The Minister for Foreign Affairs is continually seeking resources but there are priorities. The Minister established a number of embassies during the past two years, but one has yet to be established in Slovenia.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to future membership of the EU, <Col N="1288" /> I cannot be certain but I will attempt to give as comprehensive an answer as possible in terms of what I believe will happen in Helsinki. The process of moving forward will be extended not merely to the &ldquo;five plus one&rdquo; but to all aspirant countries, and it will be based on their fulfilling the criteria. When will that happen? The assessment work will proceed and the chapters are well advanced in both Hungary and Slovenia. Slovenia is in an extremely good position &ndash; based on the technical assessment it is probably best placed for accession &ndash; and it is followed by Hungary which has achieved an enormous level of compatibility with the various regulations since 1989. The Hungarians have passed and implemented an extraordinary amount of legislation and regulation in recent years. Further difficulties have arisen in respect of Poland's accession and its application has been adversely affected, which concerns people in the region.</P>
    <P>A decision on increasing the membership of the EU will be made in 2002. It is unlikely that there will be an accession before January 2003. The question is whether the EU will adhere firmly to the criteria or whether it will begin to move away from them? Difficulties will arise if the Union moves away from the criteria and, therefore, it should stick rigidly to them. However, we will have to wait to see what happens at Helsinki and during the next 12 months.</P>

      <P>I purposely posed my question in the way I did because I believe it is the acid test of the Taoiseach's claim and that of his Government that Irish neutrality continues. The Taoiseach spoke of being opposed to all acts of terrorism. Can one construe from that, that he views the bombing of the civilians of Chechnya as an act of terrorism? Whatever his answer, is he prepared to take an equally strong position in relation to the NATO bombing of Belgrade and the ongoing brutalisation of the people of Iraq, to which I referred, by the continuation of bombings and sanctions? This country has a responsibility not only to make claims to neutrality on the world stage but to actually put it into practice through the utterances and actions of its representatives and its forces.</P>

      <P>My Department has worked closely with the National Roads Authority in order to ensure a substantial input to the preparation of the national development plan in regard to national roads.</P>
      <P>Reflecting this input, the NDP provides for a total investment of £4.7 billion in national road improvement and maintenance during the period 2000-6, a threefold increase on the 1994-9 period. It also sets out a strategic framework for the development of the national roads network over the coming seven years. Within this framework the NRA will promote a more detailed programming of the work required and manage, in co-operation with local authorities, the planning, design and implementation of individual road development projects.</P>
      <P>My Department has also co-operated with the NRA by approving a range of staffing proposals, both at NRA and local authority level, designed to ensure adequate organisational capacity to deliver the greatly expanded national roads programme envisaged by the NDP.</P>

      <P>Is there any difference between the provision in the national plan, published yesterday, and the NRA's roads needs study, which was published earlier this year? If not, what has been the effect of the consultations between the Minister, his Department and the NRA? Has he left it entirely to the NRA to decide the strategy for road development?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey:</NameTxt>
      <P>Part of the NRA's remit is to draw up and advise the Government on the framework for national road development. The day to day administration and monitoring of that programme is a matter for the NRA. However, <Col N="1292" /> the Government broadly decided the key priorities of the national road investment programme in the NDP. The roads needs study in addition to that which is contained in the NDP reflects the Government's key priorities, which are the development of the main inter-urban links to motorway, dual carriageway standard; major improvements on the other national primary routes; completion of the M50 and the Dublin Port tunnel and improvement of key national secondary routes. These priorities are reflected in the NDP and the NRA must operate on that basis. However, the Government and myself do not get involved in the day to day organisation of the road projects; neither did my predecessors. That is a matter for the NRA.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes:</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer to strategy, not day to day management. Does the Minister accept that the national road element of the NDP is already in the road needs study? Does he agree that the NDP sets timescales for investment which are more or less similar to those proposed by the NRA originally? Will he be more specific about the staffing provisions for the NRA and local authorities? Is he aware that, unless the proper staffing and project monitoring structures are put in place, there is a serious risk that we will be unable to deliver on the road investment set out in the NDP? Is he further aware that already many road projects have run into difficulty because the local authorities do not have the staff to carry out the work required on behalf of the NRA?</P>

      <P>In regard to the latter point, I am not aware of any projects that were delayed or held up because local authorities did not have the staff to deal with them. Most delays in the current programme arose because of court actions or challenges to the procedures involved, which is of great concern to myself, the Government and Members opposite.</P>
      <P>The major difference between the NDP and the road needs study is the timescale involved. The NRA study covered the period 2000-19 and required £6 billion in investment while the Government will provide £4.7 billion over six years under the NDP. The money will be provided over a much shorter timescale than had been originally envisaged. There would not be any point in us asking the NRA to conduct a road needs study if we were going to ignore it completely and draw up the NDP separate to that. This is part of the consultation procedure with the NRA, local authorities and the regional assemblies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am conscious of the increased level of social housing need and considerable priority is being afforded to tackling this need. The Government had already taken action in advance of the results of the assessment of need. Increased resources were provided for the local authority housing programme with 4,500 house starts or purchases provided for in 1999. The first multi-annual local authority housing programme will commence in 2000 and provide 22,000 houses over the next four years. I am also committed to expanding voluntary housing output to deliver up to 4,000 additional units per annum over coming years.</P>
      <P>I will shortly determine and notify allocations to individual authorities for the four year multi-annual housing programme and I will take into consideration the results of the needs assessment and the capacity of local authorities to deliver effectively on housing programmes. The early notification of the multi-annual allocations will enable them to produce a streamlined delivery of housing output over the next four years and provide a better and more effective mechanism of social housing delivery. I will ask local authorities to front load their programmes as much as possible where the increased level of housing needs warrants it.</P>
      <P>I am confident that the enhanced multi-annual local authority housing programme, together with the output from complementary social housing measures and vacancies occurring in the existing housing stock, will enable the housing needs of up to 9,800 households to be catered for in 1999. The increased social housing output over the next four years, provided for in the national development plan, will meet the needs of more than 50,000 households. I expect that the needs of the weakest sector of the community will be adequately addressed through the local authority housing programme.</P>

      <P>Deputy Gilmore is well aware that the number of local authority houses to be built in any period does not reflect the overall picture in terms of the number of applicants on housing waiting lists. Many other elements of the social housing programme must be taken into account, such as the number of voluntary houses built under the capital assistance scheme and the rent subsidy scheme, the number of houses built under the affordable housing scheme and the number of vacancies occurring in local authority houses annually which, for many years, has been assessed at 3,500.</P>
      <P>When all these factors are put together, the housing needs of 90,000 households have been met during the lifetime of the national development plan, the seven year period mentioned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore:</NameTxt>
      <P>The only factor the Minister omits is the additional number of people going on to the housing list every year which is averaging 7,000. Will the Minister confirm, since the question relates specifically to local authority housing, that there are currently 40,000 applicants specifically seeking local authority housing, not other forms of social housing, and that that figure has been assessed as correct and confirmed by his Department? Will be accept that a total provision of 35,000 over seven years goes nowhere near meeting the requirements of those who are currently on the list, not to mention those families who will be added the list over that seven year period?</P>

There is no point in putting those figures on the record again but in case the Deputy has forgotten them, 39,176 households were assessed as being in need of local authority housing. I have already stated that the number of households I would expect to have their housing needs met during the life of the national development plan, which is not the ques<Col N="1295" /> tion that has been put, is about 90,000.

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey:</NameTxt>
      <P>While existing and future settlement patterns were an important factor in framing the investment programmes in the areas of roads and water infrastructure under the national development plan, the Government's policies under the plan go much further than that. It is a fundamental aim of the plan to achieve more geographically balanced economic progress and regional development, through a concerted effort to spread development more evenly throughout the regions, ease the pressure in the greater Dublin area, tackle urban and rural poverty and promote closer integration of physical and economic planning than has ever been the case previously. Investment in roads and water services projects will take full account of regional development policy as well as existing needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as major investment in roads is concerned, settlement patterns as a major determinant of traffic flows and volumes, are a significant influence on road development needs and are, accordingly, reflected in the road development strategy outlined in the plan. More specifically, <Col N="1296" /> the strategic planning guidelines for the greater Dublin area were taken into account in the preparation of the national development plan. Settlement patterns are also taken into account in the planning and design of individual road development schemes.</P>
    <P>With regard to water and waste water projects, the investment predicated in the national development plan is based on our obligations under EU Directives, assessments of needs supplied by the local authorities, discussions with the IDA, and other economic forecasts and projections. Local authority assessments, initiated in October 1998, were required to have regard to the provisions of development plans and any relevant strategic regional planning guidelines.</P>
    <P>The Government has also mandated my Department to prepare a national spatial strategy which will translate the overall approach to regional development set out in the national development plan into a more detailed blueprint for spatial development in Ireland over the period up to the year 2020.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>This strategy will take two years to prepare, will identify spatial development patterns and will set down indicative proposals for the location of industrial, commercial and residential development, rural development, tourism, culture and heritage, including the necessary infrastructure to support these proposals. Investment in infrastructure cannot await the completion of the spatial strategy. The enhanced level of investment in roads and water services provided for under the NDP will commence immediately on the basis of the priorities I have already outlined.</P>

Is the Minister aware that everything he said is turned into a nonsense given that the Government said yesterday that at the mid point of the national development plan it will have to have a spatial strategy, thereby admitting there is no spatial strategy? Will he accept that all the first part of his reply was just flannel and that all we have in the national development plan is simply a continuation of existing projects and the hope that as much money as possible will be thrown at them in the early years of the plan without any overall strategy?

There are other considerations that have to be taken into account as well, for example, in the whole area of the water services investment, we have legal obligations in relation to EU directives and so on. That had to be a consideration in the provision of water and waste water services. The document mentioned earlier, the National Roads Needs Study, was also used in forming the national development plan.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey:</NameTxt>
      <P>The tendency in recent years towards declining voter participation in the political process was further highlighted by the disappointing turnout at the recent Dublin South Central by-election. The problem of low turnouts is a complex issue that has given rise to a wide range of theories to explain it.</P>
      <P>Disillusionment with the political system, tribunal revelations, decline in party appeal, policy convergence between the political parties, the pursuit of consensus politics, days and times of polls, the holding of a number of polls on the same day, the feel good factor and the strong economy are all likely contributory factors. The National Youth Council of Ireland report, &ldquo;Voting at the Crossroads&rdquo;, which I recently launched, also highlighted a range of reasons for young people not voting, including examinations, being away during elections and not being registered to vote. It is likely to be a combination of some or all of the factors to which I have referred and probably many more. However, workable solutions tend to be more difficult to find. In this context &ldquo;Voting at the Crossroads&rdquo; is a valuable contribution to the debate. The recommendations and solutions contained in that report are varied and innovative and will be fully considered by my Department.</P>
      <P>Registration and electoral procedures are under regular review in the Department and there have been developments over the years, including the streamlining of the registration process, the introduction of supplements, the extension of postal voting and the use of photographs on ballot papers. Work is also ongoing on a number of other areas. The recommendations of the Oireachtas joint committee in the context of its examinations on the institutions of the State will provide a basis for an informed public debate on our electoral system and the scope for reform. The Government is also committed to examining the various methods of providing information at referendums, including the role of the Referendum Commission.</P>
      <P>With regard to the issue of making it easier to vote, two areas are being examined along with the regular review I referred to. First, my Department is examining the question of extending the use of photographs on ballot papers to presidential, Dáil and local elections in the light of the experience of the European elections in June. Second, a review of the possibility of introducing electronic voting and counting is under way in the Department.</P>

I welcome debate on the issue and, in particular, any recommendations and suggestions as to how we can arrest and reverse the <Col N="1299" /> decline in voter participation, which continues to be a major challenge for everyone involved in the political process, both in this country and in other western democracies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune" hpid="Ms Clune Ms Clune">
      <NameTxt>Ms Clune:</NameTxt>
      <P>The National Youth Council of Ireland report, &ldquo;Voting at the Crossroads&rdquo;, states that 73 per cent of young people who did not vote in the last European and local elections did not do so because they were unable to because of such factors as work commitments, being away or not being registered. These are positive reasons and they could be improved on. The recent by-election was held on a Wednesday, yet to hold a vote on a Wednesday between 8.00 a.m. and 9 p.m. is unrealistic in this day and age. Banks open on Saturdays, churches provide masses on Saturday evenings and supermarkets are open all day every day.</P>
      <P>Is it not time that polling booths were opened on Saturdays and Sundays? There may be an election within the next 12 months and we will be left floundering again, wondering if polling day should be at the weekend, on a Friday or a Wednesday. Will the Minister give a firm commitment to consider having polling days at weekends, both on Saturdays and Sundays? Sunday is a day of rest when people will have time to go to the polling booths. We must do everything we can to encourage democracy and to encourage people to vote, not make it difficult for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not convinced that weekend voting will make a huge difference to voter turnout. I have information before me regarding the various presidential, general, local and European elections which have been held on all days from Tuesday to Friday, inclusive. The only significant factor to emerge is not the day of the vote but the extent to which the electorate is engaged with the election or the issues involved. Turnout figures vary from 44 per cent to 73 per cent or 74 per cent for the 1987 general election. The times during which polling stations were open has also varied. Not very long ago it was suggested by all, including myself, that Friday would suit many more people on the basis that students would be home from colleges and so on. Yet, the turnout on Fridays has been no better than on Tuesdays.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to voting on Saturdays and Sundays, when the report &ldquo;Voting at the Crossroads&rdquo; was published I said we had consulted with the various Churches. All, except two very small minority Churches, said they would have strong reservations or be opposed to Sunday voting. I have sympathy with the point of view that Sunday should be a day or rest. Were an election to be held on a Sunday during the summer and the turnout was between 45 per cent and 50 per cent I would have to answer questions and be asked if I was not aware that people attend football matches, go away with their families or whatever. While Saturday voting is worth considering, Sun<Col N="1300" /> day voting would be a disaster in terms of voter turnout, apart from the religious aspect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1997, provides for a range of measures to assist local authorities in addressing problems arising on their estates from drug dealing and serious anti-social behaviour. It forms a part of a wider range of measures undertaken by the Government to deal with the issue of drugs and related crime. The 1997 Act does not provide for the repossession of local authority dwellings. The main provisions in this regard are contained in the Housing Act, 1966. However, one of the main provisions of the 1997 Act enables a local authority tenant, or the authority itself in certain circumstances, to apply for an excluding order against a person who is believed to be engaging in anti-social behaviour. The authority may seek such an order only after consultation with the tenant and the relevant health board.</P>
      <P>The effect of an excluding order, if granted, is to exclude the person to whom it relates from the local authority dwelling and, at the discretion of the court, from any other specified dwelling or housing estate. This procedure allows for a targeted response to the problem of anti-social behaviour by an individual member of a household, without the need to remove the entire household. Section 20 of the Act also enables the Garda, on notification by the housing authority, to direct people squatting in local authority accommodation and engaged in anti-social activity to leave the accommodation. This has proved to be an effective means of dealing with anti-social behaviour where squatting is involved.</P>
      <P>Information received in my Department from local authorities indicates that in the period since the coming into operation of the Act in July 1997 to the end of 1998, excluding orders were sought in nine cases, seven of which were sought by tenants and two by local authorities. In the same period, illegal occupiers were removed from local authority dwelling in 98 cases. Management of their housing estates, including dealing with anti-social behaviour is, of course, a matter for local authorities who have been encouraged by my Department to use the statutory powers available to them where appropriate.</P>

      <P>I am surprised the Minister of State is unaware of this problem. There have been high profile cases. For example, his ministerial colleague, Deputy Dan Wallace, should inform him about the Heavey case which occurred in his Cork constituency. Is the Minister of State not aware of a number of high profile cases which have come to public attention, where those served with exclusion orders have sought judicial reviews, especially with regard to section 21 of the Act dealing with the gathering of evidence? Is he prepared to consider amending legislation which will copperfasten the law and ensure we can get rid of anti-social tenants in a more speedy and effective manner?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes:</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 35 and 66 together.</P>
      <P>Infringement proceedings, by way of reasoned opinion under Article 226 of the Treaty on European Union, have been notified to Ireland by the European Commission in respect of the five following environmental directives affecting policy areas within my Department's overall remit: the non-transposition of EU legislation on pollution by asbestos (Directive 87/217); issues concerning the protection of water against pollution by dangerous substances (Directive 76/464); water quality problems associated with private group water schemes (Directive 80/778); compliance with waste legislation (Directive 75/442 and amendments); and the submission of reports on the implementation of water directives (Directive 91/692).</P>
      <P>No proposals have been notified to Ireland by the Commission to block EU funding on the basis of the infringement proceedings issued in respect of these directives. Cohesion Funds have, however, been suspended in respect of a waste management facility in the functional area of South Dublin County Council in light of the non-imposition by the local authority of charges for domestic waste services. My position on waste charges is clearly set out in the waste management policy statement &ldquo;Changing Our Ways&rdquo;, which stresses the need for generators of waste to pay the full costs of collection, treatment and disposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Proceedings have been initiated before the <Col N="1303" /> European Court of Justice on the failure to implement Directive 97/68/EC concerning emissions of pollutants from engines in non-road mobile machinery. Work on the complex regulations involved is proceeding as rapidly as possible and should be completed by the end of this year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune" hpid="Ms Clune Ms Clune">
      <NameTxt>Ms Clune:</NameTxt>
      <P>Three of the directives the Minister mentioned concern water quality and the effects of increased consumerism on water quality. Will the Minister outline what procedures he is taking to implement these directives, especially given the recent report on the environment which underlines the threat to the quality of water and highlights its deteriorating quality? The amount of heavily polluted water has not increased but moderate pollution is on the increase. It is a serious matter that Ireland is seen to have much money to invest in infrastructure, yet we do not address the quality of our water and the serious threat to our waterways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey:</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that any failure by central Government and local authorities to meet water quality directives is serious and is being treated seriously. The reasoned opinion is the first step in any legal procedures which might be adopted against Ireland. It relates to the implementation of Directive 80/778 on the quality of water intended for human consumption. This relates specifically to the contamination of group water supplies. The Commission also pointed out that Irish law in the form of the 1988 drinking water regulations does not require private group scheme supplies to meet the quality standards set out in Directive 80/778. That issue is being addressed under the comprehensive rural water programme that we have developed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not ashamed that he is being hauled before the European courts by the European institutions for his failure to protect the Irish environment? What does he intend to do about these five cases he now faces in the European courts? Does he intend to defend them or does he intend to bring our water quality up to the standard acceptable to the European Union? Most people would have believed the quality of our water is superior to that generally obtaining in Europe? What does he intend to do to bring our water quality up to European standards and to deal with the waste problems about which the European institutions are now taking him to the European courts?</P>

When the Deputy's party was in Government, it was around £7 million. We have responded to the European Commission on the points it has raised regarding the waste directive. We have responded in all cases and regulations are being put in place to ensure we are in compliance. We are 98 per cent compliant with European directives and it is my aim to be 100 per cent compliant. We have a much better record in the environmental area than any other country in Europe.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister concerned that European funding for a waste facility in south Dublin is being delayed because of the failure of the local authority to apply a refuse charge? What is he doing about this? Is he taking steps to ensure the local authority in question complies with the obligations which the Commission thinks it has? If not, does the Minister have any information as to whether the project will go ahead, even if European funding is withdrawn?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey:</NameTxt>
      <P>To my knowledge, the project is going ahead and is probably operational at this stage. I have made clear the policy position &ndash; which has been supported by all sides of the House &ndash; that the polluter pays principle must apply. It is a matter of concern if it does not. It is entirely within the remit of South Dublin County Council to decide whether it will impose a charge for domestic refuse collection. However, it will continue to suffer penalties if it does not as it will not receive European funding.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune" hpid="Ms Clune Ms Clune">
      <NameTxt>Ms Clune:</NameTxt>
      <P>On the directive to which the Minister referred, will financial investment be required in order for us to comply with European standards and, if so, are moneys provided for that in the national development plan?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey:</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, in some cases. I mentioned the provision of more than £38 million for the rural water programme this year. We have doubled the amount of funding available since 1996 for the general water services programme. In some cases, such as asbestos pollution and dangerous substances, we need to finalise the drafting of certain regulations to comply with the EU directive.</P>

      <Quest>the way in which he ensures that housing authorities adhere to the letting priorities schemes approved by his Department; and his views on whether it is appropriate that a housing authority does not allocate gross overcrowding points to a family who have to sleep on the living room floor due to the fact there is no space available in the bedrooms.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy:</NameTxt>
      <P>Each housing authority is responsible for making a scheme of letting priorities to govern the letting of tenancies in its houses. The making or amendment of a scheme is a reserved function of the elected members of the authority under section 11 of the Housing Act, 1988, and is subject to my approval to ensure the scheme is in accordance with statutory requirements and that all categories of need are covered by the scheme.</P>
      <P>My Department issued explanatory notes and guidelines to housing authorities in 1989 on the making of such schemes. These advised housing authorities that it should be the aim of a scheme to promote equality of opportunity in getting access to local authority housing based on relative housing needs. Subject to compliance with section 11 and regard being had to the guidelines, it is a matter for each housing authority to determine the detailed criteria to be included in its scheme.</P>
      <P>The determination of priority in the allocation of a local authority house is a matter for the local authority in accordance with its scheme of letting priorities and I am precluded by statute from intervening in a way that might be construed as directing the letting of a house to a particular individual.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister stand over the application of the letting priorities scheme by Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council in the following cases and, if he does not, will he take appropriate action? The first case is that of a widow who lives in a one bedroom flat with her 14 year old son and 19 year old daughter. The woman was refused points for overcrowding and did not receive any points for her daughter as the girl is over 18 years of age and is not in full-time education, whatever that has to do with overcrowding. The second case is that of a mother and her daughter, who is in her early twenties, who were evicted from a rented house because their rent was increased from £400 to £800. They fought the case in both the District and Circuit Courts. The council refused to allocate points for the daughter as she is over 18 years of age, in spite of the fact that the applicant has been on the housing list for between eight and ten years. The mother and daughter are now sleeping in a two bedroom house in which they share a bedroom with the woman's grandchild. They were refused points for gross overcrowding and only received simple overcrowding points. The third case is that of a divorced woman and her 17 year old daughter who sleep on a mattress in the sitting room of their house because the bedrooms are full. The local authority refused to grant the woman gross overcrowding points because the <Col N="1306" /> cubic capacity of the sitting room is greater than that required by the Eastern Health Board.</P>

      <P>I do not have any plans to introduce a generally available grant scheme for the refurbishment of derelict dwellings in rural areas. However, there are a number of options available which can assist in improving derelict dwellings. The Finance Act, 1998, introduced residential tax incentives for the refurbishment and construction of rented dwellings in the rural renewal tax designated areas of Longford, Leitrim and parts of Cavan, Roscommon and Sligo. The Finance Act, 1999, extended these tax incentives to owner-occupied housing. The new incentives allow 100 per cent of expenditure on the refurbishment of owner occupied housing to be offset against the owner occupier's total income over ten years. Similar relief on construction expenditure is available for owner occupiers at the rate of 5 per cent per annum for ten years. In addition, local authorities have wide powers to acquire houses generally as part of their local authority housing programmes. Authorities have been encouraged to fully exploit the range of measures available to them to meet social housing needs. Where appropriate, this could, of course, include the acquisition and refurbishment of derelict houses, either compulsorily or by agreement.</P>

    <P>Mr. Gilmore: Why does the Minister, who provides various incentives for the renewal of dwellings in urban areas, insist that the only way this can be done in rural areas is through acquisition by the local authority? Has he studied the proposal made by Mr. Jim Connolly of Rural Resettlement Ireland which includes a proposal along these lines which would have the beneficial effect of providing much needed housing, restoring buildings and the general architectural well-being of the countryside?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy:</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a range of schemes which I operate and which are directed at carrying out refurbishment work on houses. All have been improved substantially since I came into office and funding for them has also been substantially increased. These include the disabled person's grant, the essential repairs grant, the scheme of improvement works in lieu, which I mentioned, the task force on special housing for the elderly and extensions to local authority houses.</P>
      <P>The rural resettlement scheme was mentioned. It submitted a proposal in 1998 for a scheme of grant aid to farmers to bring derelict houses on their land back into use and for renting to resettled applicants. A working group representative of the Department, the Rural Resettlement Ireland and the local authorities examined the proposal but a number of issues regarding the security of tenure, leasing arrangements, etc., required further examination. In August of this year it submitted a further proposal for a scheme of grant aid to farmers to build houses on their land for long-term rent to resettled applicants. This proposal was discussed by the working group on 1 November and it was agreed that Rural Resettlement Ireland would review its proposal to provide more information and that a further meeting of the working group would be held when the revised proposal was submitted.</P>
      <P>A pilot scheme for rural resettlement is being managed by area development management, ADM, as part of the Operational Programme for Local, Urban and Rural Development. Some £300,000 has been provided for the scheme, the purpose of which is to generate a greater understanding of the issues involved in rural resettlement, in particular, employment, training and social integration, leading to the development of a strategic approach to the rural resettlement issue in Ireland.</P>

      <P>Legislation has been promised allowing for parental representation on vocational education committees, but I have a wider question on forthcoming legislation. Some time ago on the Order of Business I asked the Taoiseach if, given the large number of items on the Government's legislative programme being pushed back as timescales were not achieved, he would examine a different method of drafting legislation that would break the drafting monopoly in the parliamentary draftsman's office. At that stage he undertook to look at that proposal to see if there was a way to deliver legislation to the House in a more meaningful timeframe by changing the arrangements. Has he come to a conclusion on the suggestion I made?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill will be taken early next year, as I told the Deputy recently. Approximately 60 Bills a year are being drafted, which is probably a far higher throughput than five or ten years ago and we have debated the parliamentary draftsman system a number of times on Question Time. I hope this Bill will be brought forward early in the new session.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that while we have increased the throughput of legislation, we have also radically transformed the operation of these Houses, particularly with the committee structure? The deadlock that the Taoiseach and Deputy Higgins referred to could be reduced, if not necessarily eliminated, if committees were given more work to do in fine tuning and polishing legislation on Committee Stage &ndash; there is a precedent for this. Will the Government give consideration to this proposal, given the increasing backlog of delayed legislation about <Col N="1315" /> which the Taoiseach gave evidence in replying to an earlier question?</P>

      <P>I am not against looking at that system, though I am probably not the one who should propose it. There would be suspicion of a Taoiseach who would try to bring that in. Deputies Quinn and Bruton will know that other Parliaments view our way of working with some awe. Practically all Parliaments in Europe have a committee week in which drafting is done. We continue to work this way and I spend three and a half hours on the floor of the Parliament in this way when many of my colleagues would spend perhaps an hour in theirs. I do not care about that, but the committee week system would be a good idea. We should look at things like that, but if I proposed it there would be a difficulty.</P>

    <P Just="Right">&ndash;(Deputy Rabbitte).</P>
    <P>Mr. Rabbitte: As the Minister said, it is difficult to abstract any one of these amendments from the totality of what is before us now. The Minister has recast the entire section and in the process permitted retrospective publication, although the Minister will not concede he has done so. It is not possible to reconcile this with the previous positions of the Government, but it is welcome nonetheless. This first amendment seeks to allow the Freedom of Information Act, in certain circumstances, to override the other prescriptions and the Freedom of Information Commissioner to adjudicate in circumstances like the controversial ones we have been discussing. The Minister has given much time to this argument, which has been given an impetus because it is happening at the same time as developments with respect to Ansbacher, but he has not given much time to this matter. One cannot dismiss the information commissioner so easily. It is an independent office and he could be relied on to make a mature and reflective decision. I outlined on the previous day his views as we know them. People sought to misrepresent him and suggest that he was taking up a particular position on the Ansbacher controversy. I do not think he was doing so. He was saying what he thought was the appropriate place for his office in this matter and it is a strong argument. Nobody could question the independence of his office or the maturity of his decision making and I do not understand why the Minister would not be prepared to take the amendment on board. I am sure he is not suggesting that the commissioner would act in a mischievous or frivolous way or wantonly put into the public domain information that should not be there.</P>
    <P>In addressing this aspect, the Minister said on the previous occasion:</P>
    <P>Finally, turning to amendment No. 1 tabled by Deputy Rabbitte, I do not accept that section 21 should be amended to permit the information commissioner determine whether or not confidential company information should be publicly disclosed. I am aware from recent press reports that the commissioner has recommended that section 21 should be included in the Third Schedule to the Freedom of Information Act, 1997. The effect of such a change could enable confidential corporate information to be published by the commissioner.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1324" /> That is the critical sentence and I do not understand how the Minister can conclude that it would be likely to happen. It is technically correct that the commissioner could decide to put confidential information into the public domain; he could decide to put many things into the public domain, but I do not understand the rational argument for the conviction that he would be likely to do so in a wanton fashion or in a manner which was contrary to the interests of individuals who were entitled to their privacy or which would damage the functioning of the Act generally. I do not consider he would be likely to do so. Whatever about the merit of the Minister's argument in respect of the substantive issue, in this case we can repose confidence in the information commissioner to use that power responsibly, to take it out of the political domain and to allow him to make his decision in due course.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to repeat the arguments made previously but this issue involves the recommendation of the information commissioner that he should be listed in the Third Schedule and the Minister's refusal to do so because there must be a wide prohibition on disclosure otherwise the inspectors under section 19 would not be able to get access to company books, etc. However, the Minister's amendment completely alters the amendment he tabled on Committee Stage, which he thought would include the definitive changes to section 21. The inclusion of the words &ldquo;in the opinion of the Minister&rdquo; means the Minister will decide what body should get the information in terms of its release to all the new competent bodies, although they are not listed in the same manner as they were in the 1999 Act. It will allow the Minister to decide on the day whether the information commissioner should get the information.</P>
      <P>The amendment leaves it open to the Minister to give the panoply of bodies, organisations and Ministers a copy of the information. If she wishes, she could give it to the tax authorities, the tribunal, any Minister, the Irish Takeover Panel, the Central Bank and others. She could decide in any particular instance that all of them should get the report. However, once a report is circulated that widely, it would be almost impossible to prevent its contents becoming public.</P>
      <P>If the Minister's refusal to include the information commissioner is based on a concern that he would disseminate the details, it should be noted that it would have to be correct in the Minister's opinion to give it to the information commissioner. I welcome the inclusion of the tribunal but I do not understand why an assessment cannot be made in the same manner about whether in certain circumstances the information commissioner should receive information and whether it should become public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Committee Stage the Minister introduced a limited amendment to section 21 to widen the scope of the competent authorities. However, because of matters which are in the public arena, <Col N="1325" /> the Minister reorientated section 21(1). He said that, at all material times, it had been the intention of the Government in proposing an amendment to section 21 on Report Stage to give the terms of the amendment retrospective effect in so far as the purposes mentioned in section 21(1) or the list of competent authorities stated. However, it was not the Government's intention at all material times to do anything to section 21(1) on Committee Stage. The only amendment tabled then was to section 21(3) of the 1990 Act.</P>
    <P>It would help if the Minister explained what happened between July and 20 October when amendment No. 33, which is massive, was tabled. What went on in the Department? What type of discussion took place? What type of rationalisation occurred to bring about this belt and braces change to include the words &ldquo;in the opinion of the Minister&rdquo;? In the examination which led to this massive amendment, why did the Minister not take into consideration the opinion of the information commissioner? He is a reputable man and is an officer of the State. I considered he would be a reputable and responsible person to add to a list. If accountancy bodies, the Irish Takeover Panel and others are to be included, I would have considered that the information commissioner was also a suitable person to include. I wish I had been a fly on the wall between July and October.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State did not say on Committee Stage that he planned to change section 21(1). However, he did say he would consider the proposal in relation to the tribunal. He said, &ldquo;Two different matters are involved. I know the Tánaiste appreciates that concern. She is a young woman with much work to do and I am confident she will continue to do it. Deputy Rabbitte is aware that his amendment was only circulated today. The proposal appears to make sense.&rdquo;  This did not relate to the information commissioner but to a committee of the House. The Minister of State said he would look again at this issue. He did, but he did not bring forward any change. However, he introduced a number of other changes we neither anticipated nor requested. What was the nature of the discussion in his Department on why the Third Schedule cannot be amended to include the Freedom of Information Act, 1997? Perhaps there is a good reason for this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy:</NameTxt>
      <P>One cannot win. If one reacts to reports and debates in the House by trying to improve legislation, it appears to be wrong. Deputy Owen would be very interested if she were a fly on the wall during discussions in my Department. I have excellent officials and we have had many discussions. We have reached a clear consensus on the best legislation to bring forward in the interests of the country and good quality company law which will be effective, practical and operational.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to point out to Deputies Rabbitte and Owen that the Freedom of Information <Col N="1326" /> Act applies to Part II of the Companies Act, 1990. Deputy Rabbitte quoted from my recent long contribution on amendment No. 53. It is important to again put this on the record. I stated that I was aware from recent press reports that the commissioner, as recommended under section 21, should be included in the Third Schedule to the Freedom of Information Act, 1997. I said the effect of such a change could enable corporate information to be published by the commissioner. There is no doubt it could. As I have already indicated, our experience with the operation of section 19 examinations of company books and documents, which are protected under the secrecy provisions of section 21, is that a wide prohibition on disclosure is necessary. These examinations are intrusive to the company concerned and its officers must be assured that the information gathered will have a high degree of protection from disclosure. If that assurance cannot be offered by the Minister and his or her Department, the company concerned may decide to resist the conduct of the examination either through the courts or otherwise. Such an outcome would entirely defeat the process of preliminary investigation, which is envisaged under section 19, and would be counter-productive to the public interest of seeking to uncover corporate malpractice and of applying the rigours of the law to those found to be in breach in due course.</P>
    <P>It is already our experience that the strict prohibition on disclosure under section 21 is not enough. Two companies have already gone to great lengths to question the bona fides of the Minister and her Department in so far as is compliant with their statutory duty under the section. If a public interest test were to determine whether information would be disclosed, every company which was the subject of examination by officers from our Department would believe the publication of its corporate affairs would be the inevitable outcome of being subject to a section 19 examination.</P>
    <P>We must understand that regulatory authorities have a job to do. The system has worked well whereby people can carry out examinations and make reports. On many occasions these examinations prove positive and there is no need for further action. On other occasions, however, the authorised officer discovers serious information he brings to the attention of the Minister, and a decision is taken to seek to appoint an inspector. This has been carried out in an inexpensive manner. We have gained the trust of the companies involved over the years and we want to maintain that trust in the interests of good corporate governance and proper regulation. Lest anyone misinterpreted what I said about freedom of information, this applies to information available under Part II of the Companies Act, 1990.</P>
    <P>All the proposals have been considered. The reason I did not indicate my intentions on Committee State was that we had not had the debate on the Ansbacher account in this House. It was debated here for two days. Many Deputies indi<Col N="1327" /> cated what should be done and, as this legislation is current and being debated, we responded by including these changes. We have gone a long way and I believe we are doing the right thing because the integrity of the information is being maintained. In the final analysis, judgment on whether that information should be transferred to those named as a result of the changes to section 21 of the 1990 Act must be left to the Minister who is answerable to this House. It is reasonable that Members should be able to question the Minister on a particular aspect of any investigation and that an answer should be given in the House rather than referring it to another body for its adjudication. If it is an independent office, we do not have the right to question it and we must await the annual report. In the interests of democracy and of the veracity of the information available to Members, what is being done is in the best interests of the people, the country and corporate governance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte:</NameTxt>
      <P>On amendment No. 1 to amendment No. 33, I have not heard any argument from the Minister of State as to why this override would not be given to the information commissioner. He said confidential commercial information could be put into the public domain by the information commissioner. Obviously this is so. However, there is an array of agencies and offices under the aegis of the State that could do many things, but they do not do those things; they act responsibly given the merits of the particular case. The fact is that Mr. Kevin Murphy is the independent statutory authority. This authority rejects the arguments, in so far as the Minister of State has adduced arguments, for not reposing this power in the independent statutory authority. This is a wish to retain this power in the Minister's Department and the Minister of State has sought to explain this by saying it is the norm. This is the explicit power &ndash; to which Deputy Owen referred &ndash; in amendment No. 2 to amendment No. 33 where, for some reason the Minister of State has not explained, he has inserted the words &ldquo;in the opinion of the Minister&rdquo;. However, that is not the case. The Minister specifically says that the opening clause of replacement section 21(1) repeats the existing provision, with the addition of a specific reference to &ldquo;the opinion of the Minister&rdquo; determining if disclosure is appropriate. This has always been the practice and reality and it is now being explicitly stated in law. The Minister gives no <Col N="1328" /> argument or reason why it is being explicitly stated in law.</P>
      <P>In any event, I submit that the Minister's statement is incorrect because up to now, any agency office or person who had this information lawfully could have considered whether to publish. That is the position before the Minister comes in to recast the entire section. Therefore, the Minister is not correct in saying that this is the reality. The reality has been changed and it is a puzzle why the Minister has decided to put in &ldquo;in the opinion of the Minister&rdquo;. It is in keeping with the overall recasting of the section that, far from what was indicated by the Minister &ndash; he tabled amendments to this effect on Committee Stage where he proposed to lengthen the list of organisations or persons who could be considered competent authorities under the existing legislation &ndash; he has now governed all of those by this over-arching clause, &ldquo;in the opinion of the Minister&rdquo;. Unless it is in the opinion of the Minister, these bodies are not, to all intents and purposes, competent authorities whereas up to now, whatever the opinion of the Minister, it was not a subjective test. Objectively, they got the information if they were lawfully entitled to it and they could publish or not publish or do as they decided appropriate. Therefore, it is a change.</P>
      <P>I am not criticising the Minister for listening to the debate and changing his mind and I am especially not criticising him for doing a U-turn on the question of retrospective publication, but I criticise him for coming into the House having done that and denying the obvious. What has happened is manifest. All I am seeking to elicit from the Minister is why it was considered necessary to repose this power in the Minister explicitly in law and that each of the succeeding competent authorities will now only find themselves in possession of this information if it is the opinion of the Minister that they should have it. The House is entitled to an explanation from the Minister of why that was considered necessary. That is something we have not received.</P>
      <P>As somebody who had to operate these sections in the past, I concede there is a substantial argument in the Minister's speaking note as to why one must tread carefully in this kind of investigation and how one could do damage to the Act if sensitive, commercial or other data came into the public domain in a manner which was prejudicial to whatever inquiry was under way, etc. However, it is puzzling that the Minister cannot or will not explain to us why he went down this road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One argument for it is that his Department wants to keep a grip on this. His Department, after all, has acquired some experience of the operation of these sections of the Companies Acts. The personnel, who have been concerned with them in recent years in the Department, have merited justified plaudits from commentators and merited thanks from the public for work they have done assiduously and conscientiously. It is in the nature of bureaucracy that a <Col N="1329" /> feeling of proprietorship grows up as a result of that experience which other Departments do not have. If it has been operated successfully there are lessons drawn from each case, which has been different. It seems to me the only logical explanation I can find for this over-arching governing clause which amendment No. 2 seeks to excise, which reposes this subjective test in the Minister is that it is maintained within the Department and the Minister and her advisers determine, notwithstanding that it should go, for instance, to a colleague Minister if the Minister is of the opinion that it should not, well it seems to me, as I read that, then it will not.  Where we were on Committee Stage, it would go automatically to the tribunal of inquiry; now it does not go to the tribunal of inquiry unless the Minister is of the opinion that it ought. Like I said the last day, in the case which gave rise to much of this controversy, the Ansbacher accounts case, I would have thought that the current Minister, the Tánaiste, would be minded to make whatever pertinent information there is, available to Mr. Justice Moriarty. I would imagine, having regard to her public statements, that that would be the view but that may not be the view of a future Minister. If Deputy Treacy argues that this was always the reality, that the Minister had this power, then why not leave what was always the reality in place? Why expressly enshrine this in the legislation? We have not received an answer to that.</P>
    <P>I looked at some of what the Tánaiste said on this issue quite a while before it came into the public domain. On 16 February, for example, she said in answer to a Priority Question:</P>
    <P>the Minister is precluded from making public the results of such inquiries .. It is a defect because a Minister is acting in the public interest and when matters come to the Minister's attention it is right that they should be brought into the public arena.</P>
    <P>On 24 March, in answer to a Priority Question, she stated:</P>
    <P>The issues are so serious that they should be in the public domain and not just go to the competent authorities.</P>
    <P>That was the Tánaiste when she got off the leash of the formal reply on 24 March. Later that day she said:</P>
    <P>I accept the thrust of the Labour Party Bill and that the amendment is necessary.</P>
    <P>It is wasting time for the Minister to come in here and pretend that there has not been a <i>volte-face</i> in the Department. Clearly there has been one. That was the position of the Tánaiste then and it is changed dramatically now, some changes for the better but some not for the better because there is this governing clause.</P>
    <P>That matter is quite different from either Deputy Owen's amendment No. 4 to amendment No. 33 or my amendment No. 7 to amendment <Col N="1330" /> No. 33. That is a fundamentally different matter. I know amendments Nos. 1, 4 and 7 are grouped on the basis of our previous discussion, but amendment No. 7 to amendment No. 33, which I put forward on Committee Stage, proposes to add the term &ldquo;either House of the Oireachtas or a Committee appointed by either or both of such Houses&rdquo;. The idea here is that a report, a document, etc., could be made available to a specialist select committee of the House which might be examining this matter. The situation envisaged was where the Committee of Public Accounts, for example, might be asked by the House to examine a particular matter of public controversy which was, at the same time, also being examined by an authorised officer. In such a situation, ought not the committee be made aware of the information in the possession of that officer?</P>
    <P>I accept that the Minister of State, in respect of amendment No. 7 to amendment No. 33, has brought forward a number of weighty arguments in terms of enshrining that power in law. However, Deputy Owen may not be ready to concede the point in respect of amendment No. 4 to amendment No. 33. However, I cannot see how conceding that point, if we are amenable to doing so, in respect of a committee of the House or the House itself progresses matters. If, for example, it was placed in the possession of a committee, the Minister of State's argument presumably is that it would become common knowledge in a short period and that that might damage not only the inquiry but also this particular facility in company law.</P>
    <P>I cannot see how the Minister of State can make such an argument in respect of the independent statutory authority that is the Information Commissioner. To date, he has failed to do so. The Information Commissioner is an independent statutory authority who is unlikely to act on a whim and place something in the public domain for the sheer devilment of doing so. Therefore, it is important that the override is included in the legislation and I ask the Minister of State to reconsider his position in that regard. I also ask him to do the House the service of presenting an argument on why this power is being given to the Minister of the day by the insertion of the words &ldquo;in the opinion of the Minister&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is only fair that the Minister of State should give a straightforward and clear explanation why the term &ldquo;in the opinion of the Minister&rdquo; was included. Earlier he shed crocodile tears and said &ldquo;You cannot win if you take account of what the Opposition says&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>On Second Stage the Opposition, particularly Deputy Rabbitte, proposed that tribunals of inquiry should be added to the list of competent authorities. The Minister of State examined the position and returned with an amendment on Committee Stage. Not only were <Col N="1331" /> tribunals added to the list but clarifications about which Ministers were competent authorities, etc., were also included. If, as the Minister of State tried to argue, it was common practice that everything that was done was based on the opinion of the Minister, I contend that he did not suddenly discover that fact to which he failed to refer when introducing the amendment on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>When he referred to it earlier, the Minister of State indicated that the amendment was merely a tidying up exercise. That is the only defence he has offered. I contend that he and his officials would have spotted that when introducing the amendment on Committee Stage. He stated &ldquo;This has always been the practice in reality but it is now being explicitly stated in law&rdquo;. When did that light suddenly shine on him and his officials, given that they were already considering this section of the 1990 Act in terms of introducing an amendment on Committee Stage? If the amendment was merely a housekeeping exercise designed to tidy up the Act, why did he not introduce it at that stage?</P>
      <P>The Minister of State is continuing to argue that the Information Commissioner cannot be added to the list of competent authorities. I accept to a degree that the term &ldquo;with power to publish such a report if the committee deems it to be in the public interest&rdquo; in amendment No. 4 may cause him difficulties and he referred to the secrecy of reports in that regard. However, he is increasing the number of people who, under the purview of the Minister, can obtain these reports. It seems extraordinary that the House which is enacting the legislation should not also be given some power.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage the Minister of State did not appear to favour Deputy Rabbitte's amendment, nor did he favour allowing reports such as those under discussion be placed before a committee of the House. In the 1990 Act, there was an automatic trigger which ensured that a report would be placed before a committee considered to be a competent authority. Adding the words &ldquo;in the opinion of the Minister&rdquo;, provides a belt and braces approach to protection. Therefore, if at any time it is not considered proper to give information to a committee of the House, such consideration will be based on the Minister's opinion. Whatever argument the Minister of State put forward for not accepting the amendments on Committee Stage, there is no argument in respect of not including the two additional competent authorities to which I refer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State does not seem to have accepted the point Deputy Rabbitte and I have been stressing in respect of the amendment he introduced. Section 21(1) of the 1990 Act does not refer to the &ldquo;opinion of the Minister&rdquo;. The only opinion the Minister is allowed to have about the revelation of a report is based on section 21(3)(b), under which he or she is allowed to authorise someone to obtain a copy of such a report. It was under this provision that the Mini<Col N="1332" /> ster for Enterprise, Trade and Employment provided the Taoiseach with a copy of the Ansbacher report. As the Minister of State is aware, the Taoiseach is not listed as a competent authority. However, the Minister retained, under the 1990&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State should not misrepresent what I am saying. If he cannot understand the legalistic language I am using, he should not make frivolous interventions. We are discussing a competent authority in terms of section 21(1) of the 1990 Act. The Taoiseach is not listed in the section but reference is made to the Minister for Finance or an officer authorised by him.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment correctly and legally used her power under section 21(3)(b) of the 1990 Act to provide the Taoiseach with a copy of the report. She was asked about the matter in the House and she said that she nominated him to receive a copy of the report as &ldquo;a person authorised by the Minister&rdquo;. However, that is the only part of section 21 where the opinion of the Minister must be exercised. I wish the Minister of State would accept that.</P>
      <P>The 1990 Act clearly states that no information, book or document relating to a body which has been obtained under section 19 shall be published or disclosed, except to a competent authority, unless the publication or disclosure is required. Under the Act, the Central Bank is listed as a competent authority and it cannot disclose any information unless it decides that the publication or disclosure is required either for the purposes of criminal proceedings or another of the reasons listed under the terms of the Act. Suppose the Central Bank, which is now a competent authority and has this report, decides that it wants to proceed under section 20. Section 20 states that if there is &ldquo;on oath laid by an officer authorised by the Minister or laid under the authority of the Minister that there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that there are on any premises any books or documents..&rdquo;. If the Central Bank had information that there were more documents that had not been made known to the inspector, it would have a direct right triggered by that section. It did not have to ask the Minister for an opinion if it decided that it had information which allowed it to proceed under section 20 to go the courts, it could do so without seeking the opinion of the Minister. Now, however, there is an extension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We did not raise this issue on Committee Stage. The Minister of State said he listened to us but that he was damned if he did it and damned if he did not. We did not ask him to insert &ldquo;in the <Col N="1333" /> opinion of the Minister&rdquo; or to rework section 21. We asked him to consider widening the list of competent authorities. The Minister of State says this is predicated on the fact that the Ansbacher report was not available when the debate took place. He has not made any changes in this section arising from that debate. When the Ansbacher report came out, it was said that if some names had been leaked there was a case that all the names should be informed that they would be made public, giving them a chance to make a statement. Instead some names were leaked. There was also a call for the report to be given to a committee of the House. Neither issue is dealt with in the reworked amendment.</P>
    <P>For the Minister of State to plead that he came back with this long amendment because he listened on Committee Stage and to the debate on the Ansbacher report is poppycock. He did not listen. If he had, he would not have introduced this amendment. Instead there would be provision for a committee of the Houses and the information officer in the Bill. The Bill has been reworked but I do not know why. Does the Minister of State know why? Perhaps he did not create this amendment and therefore it is on the Tánaiste's head as to why it was turned completely around. No argument by the Minister of State will tell me otherwise.</P>
    <P>This amendment fundamentally changes the import of section 21 of the 1990 Act. Nothing the Minister of State can tell me will convince me otherwise. If the amendment was so straightforward why was it not introduced on Committee Stage? Why was it only after all the debate that the Minister of State decided to tighten up the situation and remove some of the existing powers of the competent authorities? Why, when pleading that he cannot bring in the information commissioner or have an Oireachtas committee getting its dirty hands on this, has the Minister of State added all these extra people which, clearly, makes it harder to keep something quiet? It is as if the Minister judges that some people are better at keeping confidences than others. I object to that inference being made about Members of this House and the information commissioner. I am sure he would object to the inference that these Ministers, bodies and the Central Bank are better at keeping their cards close to their chests than others.</P>
    <P>Why does the Minister of State not accept the addition to the Bill of a committee of either House of the Oireachtas? I accept that the power to publish may have been a bridge too far, but I cannot see why that should be if the committee so decided. Why will the Minister of State not accept the amendment, given that he has inserted &ldquo;in the opinion of the Minister&rdquo; so he can say on the day that he will or will not give it to a committee? The section will sit there like a dead fish until some Minister decides that the committee will get it. It is not feasible for the Minister of State to argue that he trusts some groups and not others, Members of this House included. I know <Col N="1334" /> the Minister of State would not want to cause offence and I hope he might be convinced by that argument.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy:</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Owen said that amendment No. 33 was not flagged on Committee Stage. We reviewed the section in great detail following Committee Stage and gave consideration to the involvement of a committee of the Oireachtas. There was also a debate on Ansbacher on 29 and 30 September which caused us to reflect further. Eventually, we decided that we would table amendment No. 33. It was my opinion that we were making a positive contribution.</P>
      <P>Deputy Rabbitte also referred to a committee of the House. I gave the House a five page explanation why we could not do that &ndash; pages 22 to 27 of the document I gave to the Deputies, the first Minister ever to give his documentation to the Opposition during a debate. I felt that was the proper thing to do to be of help.</P>
      <P>Deputy Rabbitte quoted statements made by the Tánaiste in answer to questions he asked but, as when he quotes me, he did not give the full quotation. I will quote from the Official Record of 4 November when he asked the Tánaiste questions about the Ansbacher report. Deputy Rabbitte asked, &ldquo;Is it the Minister's intention when the Companies Amendment (No. 2) Bill is enacted, to use the powers in it to have this matter referred to the Moriarty tribunal? Has she had any request for the information from the Moriarty Tribunal?&rdquo;. The Tánaiste's reply was:</P>
      <P>I am not aware that we have had any request from the Moriarty tribunal. The Flood tribunal has been involved with many Government Departments in getting files relating to events in the past. However, it clearly would be my intention that a report of this kind would be submitted to that type of tribunal. In my experience, most of the information which is sent to the Authorised Officer is also sent to the Moriarty tribunal in so far as it relates to Ansbacher. A year or so ago, I took the view that section 19 reports should be made public. However, the strong legal advice, both from the current Attorney General and his predecessor and from every other lawyer I have spoken to was that if we did that we would get a section 19 report, that the full rigours of the law would have to be applied and everybody would have to have their rights to legal representation and so on. That is the basis of the case being taken by Dunnes and Margaret Heffernan. The whole purpose of the report is not just to carry out an inquiry but to put the information into the public domain. They argue that cannot be done under what is a basic preliminary inquiry.</P>
      <P>That is what the Tánaiste said on 4 November 1999, confirming the legal advice, the discussions and the consideration we gave to the matter.</P>

      <P>No, I am putting the situation in context. Deputy Rabbitte put the question and received a very lucid answer from the Tánaiste as a result of discussions, the legal advice of two Attorneys General and many other lawyers. We must operate within the law. Deputies will recall that I outlined at length the nature and reasons for the amendments which I tabled in regard to sections 20 and 21 of the Companies Act, 1990, by virtue of amendment No. 33. Arising from the contributions of Deputies Owen, Rabbitte and Callely, there are a number of issues on which I wish to respond.</P>
      <P>Deputies Rabbitte and Owen have highlighted a specific difficulty with the inclusion of the phrase &ldquo;in the opinion of the Minister&rdquo;. They are former Ministers and are aware that every decision is taken by a Minister on the basis of his or her opinion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy:</NameTxt>
      <P>One forms an opinion, arrives at a conclusion and takes a decision under section 21(1) of the Companies Act, 1990, in regard to the publication or disclosure of information gathered pursuant to sections 19 and 20. In commenting on the amendment I indicated that it has always been the practice but it is being explicitly stated in law. I meant that the information, books or documents that are obtained pursuant to sections 19 and 20 by an authorised officer would more usually be set out in the form of a report from the authorised officer to the Minister. The Minister then decides whether the information, book, document or report should be transmitted onwards to a competent authority for the specific purposes set out in sections 21(1)(a) to (e). The Minister of the day always considered the information, books, documents or reports which had become available and decided to whom they should be sent. There is nothing wrong with that because there is not much point in appointing Ministers if they do not have responsibilities to discharge.</P>
      <P>We are significantly extending the list of parties that can access such information, books, documents or authorised officers' reports but the inclusion of the test &ldquo;in the opinion of the Minister&rdquo; would prevent any of these parties from asserting a right to be given such information against the Minister's wishes. This is good law and I am satisfied on the basis of the legal advice available that this is the appropriate manner in which to deal with this matter and the words should be retained as proposed by the amendment. I have not changed my mind and I am satisfied that this is the proper course of action.</P>
      <P>A number of other issues were mentioned.</P>

      <P>We are dealing with serious matters and serious issues are currently being investigated. We want to make sure that the Bill, when enacted, is absolutely watertight. Our legal advice is that this phrase should be included. I am a legislator, as are the Deputies opposite, and not a lawyer. Hopefully, together we can interpret that which is advised to us and arrive at a conclusion that will stand the test of time, therefore, ensuring that the law is operable and will allow serious decisions to be taken.</P>
      <P>In section 21(4) of the proposed amendment we are clarifying that any information available to the Minister under sections 19 and 20 of the Companies Act, 1990, whether obtained before or after the enactment of the Bill and the commencement of this section, can thereafter be passed to any of the authorities mentioned in sections 21(1) or 21(3) for use by them as is necessary. Deputy Rabbitte accepted this clarification but in his final contribution when we discussed this previously he appeared to go further and suggest that any competent authority which, under existing provisions, had obtained information lawfully could take the decision to publish. If he means to publish the information in the form as obtained from the Minister or the authorised officer, I take issue with that. However, if he means that the competent authority could use the information and in doing so some of the information that had been gathered by the authorised officer comes into the public arena during court proceedings, then I agree that is one way it could become public.</P>
      <P>I also disagree with the Deputy's assertion that if tribunals of inquiry were added to the list of designated competent authorities then the report of authorised officers would automatically go to the tribunal of inquiry. This would only happen if the Minister considered that it contained information that was of relevance to the matters under examination by the tribunal. This ties in with the Minister exercising his or her discretion as to what authority should be given the information, books or documents or report of an authorised officer gathered under sections 19 or 20.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I refer to designating either House of the Oireachtas or a Committee as a competent authority, which was raised by Deputies Owen and Rabbitte. When I moved this amendment, I set out in a reasonable degree of detail the reasons I was not prepared to designate either House of the Oireachtas or a committee of either or both Houses or a number of variations thereof as a competent authority. The record will show these reasons and it is not necessary to repeat them as <Col N="1337" /> they still hold good and I have not changed my mind.</P>
    <P>Deputy Callely referred to meetings he had and representations made to him by representatives of company formation agents. I have no difficulty confirming that any submissions made by that organisation to the company law section of my Department will be examined in the same manner as those received from any other party. If meetings are considered necessary to discuss and explore issues raised, these can be arranged at a mutually satisfactory time. I hope I have put these matters in some context. However, our message is clear. We reflected on and reconsidered the issues raised on Committee Stage and during the Ansbacher debate. Our response is contained in this final amendment.</P>

I feel the same way about that as I do about the Minister of State. He is a utility player for the Government.

That is odd because the quotes which I repeated from the Minister, Deputy Harney, were clear and pertinent and I also furnished the dates on which they were made. He asked why I did not go on to quote her in November. A good reason is that in February and March I did not know what the Minister might say in November. I am entirely puzzled as to how the Minister of State expected me to know that the Minister had changed her mind in November and that somehow around St. Patrick's Day I should have drawn the attention of the House to the fact that the Minister had done so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte:</NameTxt>
      <P>That was the Minister's position in March and the Minister of State proved that she holds a different position now. It is difficult to figure out from what the Minister of State has said why she holds a different position. It is interesting that the Minister of State keeps pointing to the fact that this was the view of two Attorneys General. It never occurred to me before to make a comparison &ndash; maybe the reason we have an entirely recast Bill is because we have a new Attorney General. All I do know is that if this was the opinion of the previous Attorney General the Minister did not betray that to us last July on Committee Stage. I am not sure what was the opinion of the then Attorney General and I do not know the opinion of the current Attorney General. I am sure if this is his considered opinion it ought to carry weight here. I am also sure if he were on the Opposition benches he would make a very powerful argument for transparency on this issue. We do not know. The Minister said we are dealing with very serious matters and we all accept that. Presumably the Tánaiste knew that in the spring, as the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, put it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My memory is that during the Christmas period the Tánaiste started the process of high profile comment on this information which was oppressing her at the time. She expressed the wish to bring it into the public domain and repeatedly confirmed her wish that it would go into the public domain. She said the law was defective and not sufficient and that whatever the law said it should only go to the competent authority and come into the public domain. That was the position and it has changed. I do not know the reason for the change. That is something that clearly the Minister of State will not tell us. Nor do I think the Minister of State has thrown a great deal of light on certain things that have been said in the course of the debate. In my own case, when he talks about my saying that formerly when we were on Committee Stage it would have gone automatically to the tribunal of inquiry, he corrects me to say, &ldquo;if relevant&rdquo;. Of course, I was speaking in that context. I was not suggesting that the proceeds of this inquiry which we have been discussing in respect of Ansbacher would go to the Flood tribunal. I was suggesting it might go to Moriarty if parts of it were relevant to Moriarty. I <Col N="1339" /> ask the Minister of State to take it that I am talking about where the tribunal is trawling the same territory as is being investigated by the authorised officer. That goes without saying. Similarly, it goes without saying, in respect of the manner in which any competent authority might put this into the public domain or might just utilise it in terms of acting on it &ndash; the DPP, the Revenue Commissioners or whatever.</P>
    <P>In the actual text, the Minister of State draws our attention to the relevant pages of his speaking note, for which I am grateful, which he gave to us on the last occasion although it is now published in the Official Report. It was helpful then and it is helpful now. The particular area to which he draws attention is: &ldquo;If authorised officers' reports were capable of being published it would irrevocably alter the entire structure of a section 19 examination&rdquo;. That is the nub of the argument as I understand it. That is the position of the Government now, notwithstanding what the Tánaiste said in the spring. That is not quite true. As the sentence is baldly recorded there, it is not quite correct. If authorised officers' reports were capable of being published it would irrevocably alter the entire structure of a section 19 examination.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">

      <P>They are capable of being published.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte:</NameTxt>
      <P>They are capable of being published in whole or in part, to reverse on the Minister of State his argument about the information commissioner when he said he could put it into the public domain. Of course he could. Similarly, one could do so in this case as well, as has happened before the courts. They are capable of being disclosed as happened to parts of the Ryan report, for example, before the courts. If resort to the court is necessary, as a result of the information discovered by the authorised officer, that information will come into the public domain as a result of being adduced in court. The argument is not by any means open and shut. The Minister goes on to say: &ldquo;This give and take between the regulator and the regulated companies would break down if there were a substantial possibility that information on the companies was readily publishable. There would likely be regular challenges involving High Court judicial reviews of ministerial decisions&rdquo;&ndash; an argument that is rejected by the information commissioner, in his remarks. The Minister of State goes on to say: &ldquo;In short, companies would see that their commercial interests would be capable of being sacrificed on the altar of political expediency&rdquo;. I suggest that is an infelicitous phrase. If that is how the Government looks at the whole question of transparency in the companies legislation we are dealing with, and sees it as a matter of political expediency, it denigrates what we are about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a couple of areas in the Minister of State's script where he trivialises this power. For <Col N="1340" /> example, when speaking about the powers we are talking about here, he said &ldquo;they are purely information gathering mechanisms&rdquo;. I take it that is a reference to sections 19 and 20 of the existing legislation. That is trivialising this power. What is a tribunal? What is a tribunal of inquiry but an information gathering mechanism that hopefully &ndash; although we know from experience it does not always &ndash; reaches certain findings of fact. That does not wash with me either. It would appear the Government has reached a position, following this period of reflection to which the Minister has referred, which is irrevocable. It is unsatisfactory that we have not managed to divine the trigger for the change of heart.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State draws my attention to section 21(4) which permits of the retrospective publication. We welcome it. We were told that could not be done during the whole Ansbacher row but, clearly, it can be done and is being done here within the rubric of subsection (4). The reorientation of the entire section is a clever way of approaching an intractable problem. I accept the difficulty that once something is put in legislation it might in certain circumstances be used in a fashion that could be injurious to the entire process. However, it is unsatisfactory that the Minister of State cannot say what the trigger was for recasting the section.</P>
    <P>With regard to Deputy Owen's point on an Oireachtas committee, I understand that approximately 60,000 documents were opened to the Committee of Public Accounts subcommittee during its inquiry on DIRT and related matters. Not one of them came into the public domain; not one was leaked. The direct imputation of the Minister of State's position is that a committee of the House is not to be trusted on the basis that if it was to be seized of information of this kind it would automatically come into the public domain. While documents produced before the DIRT inquiry became public, a great many more were made available on discovery to the six members of the subcommittee, yet not one was betrayed into the public domain.</P>
    <P>We are sometimes our own worst enemies. Deputy Owen makes a good point about the new conventional wisdom which says that information given to a committee of the House would mean the dogs in the street having it within hours. On the one hand we argue for more effective committee work on the basis that it would better deal with work elsewhere that is costing the taxpayer a great deal of money, yet we go along with the supposition, as set out in the Minister of State's speaking note, that in giving information to the Members of the House they would act in an irresponsible fashion, the consequences of which would be to damage this delicate balance and the instrument for investigation under consideration here.</P>

      <P>Ministers should reflect on this. I know the Civil Service mind is conditioned to think that way and I understand why, because Ministers are not above leaking when they think it suits their individual or collective position. However, we are in an era of freedom of information, where it will take time for the system to settle down and where access to the most private of information is possible. At some stage these inquiries will be over and we will be able to pull the shutters down and say we are finished investigating planning corruption and the fallout of a political era most of us have lived through. When that happens we must look at the instruments of inquiry, whether it be tribunals of inquiry legislation, the Companies Acts, as amended, with the provision regarding inspectors, or the parliamentary committees.</P>
      <P>We may find it necessary to review or update the law so that it is possible to more efficiently and expeditiously inquire into some of the matters under investigation. It is the view of the public that present inquiries are taking an interminably long time and are enormously expensive. Can it be done with more efficacy? If we are serious about addressing that question we cannot continue with the presumption that if Members of the House are seized of certain information they would immediately act in a partisan and irresponsible fashion and in a way that would be likely to damage the public interest. I do not accept that argument.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen:</NameTxt>
      <P>The more I read the Minister of State's speaking note on this amendment, detailing his argument against what Deputy Rabbitte and I seek to do, the more his defence collapses. He makes the case for not disclosing information or not even including certain people on a list to whom the information might, in the opinion of the Minister, be given. He says that while many persons may be named in company information, the inspector has no legal right to question them unless they are past or present officers. This means that while the inspector may compile a list of names for a report they cannot be questioned if they have left the company. The Minister of State goes on to say that while some of them may have a reasonable explanation for their association, the authorised officer may, because of his limited powers, be unaware of it when presenting the information. This means that when the report is presented to the Minster he or she must make a judgment on its content.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State refers to the statutory prohibition on publication of this information. However, he does not qualify this. While there is a statutory prohibition it is not absolute. There are times when there is no prohibition on the release of information. He should have said there is a statutory prohibition except in certain circumstances where the High Court allows for the publication of the information or where the Minister is allowed to give it to the High Court through an affidavit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1342" /> The Minister of State endorses this position because it shields potentially innocent parties from possible public opprobrium. That is a fine sentiment. Who is to say what public opprobrium the approximately half dozen names leaked in connection with the Ansbacher report were subjected to? Nobody told us what shield they had.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State proposes to retain the absolute embargo on publishing information except under the law, where the Minister can go to the High Court. One of his contentions for taking this approach is that the whole system would be thrown into chaos if the rules regarding the way the inspector has been doing his work are changed. While the Minister of State has not got rid of the prohibition on publication, amendment No. 33, subsection (4), refers to &ldquo;information, books or documents which have been obtained under section 19 or 20 of the Companies Act, 1990, whether before or after that commencement.&rdquo;  This means that the people questioned by Mr. Ryan before this legislation was introduced and before he submitted his report to the Minister were questioned under a set of circumstances provided for in section 21 of the 1990 Act, which listed the competent authorities as being the Minister, a person authorised by the Minister, an inspector appointed under the Act, the Minister for Finance, an officer authorised by the Minister for Finance, any court of competent jurisdiction, a supervisory authority within the meaning of the regulations relating to insurance made under the European Communities Act, 1992, and the Central Bank. In such circumstances, a person questioned would know the competent authorities and make statements based on a knowledge of who would receive the inspector's report. While a person questioned would not lie, he or she may decide not to be as frank with some information because the report may, for example, go to the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>Throughout this debate the Minister and the Minister of State have expressed the fear that the section 19 process governing the role of the inspector would be cast aside and be of little value if the legislation was changed to add, for example, an Oireachtas committee to the list of bodies or persons to whom a report may be submitted. What advice did the Attorney General or his predecessors give the Minister of State and his Department about the effect of changing the ground rules after Mr. Ryan or another inspector had obtained information from those from whom he was authorised to collect it? These would be people who worked in the company concerned and would have looked at its books, etc. What advice did the Minister of State receive about this retrospection? Did the Attorney General say it was acceptable for Mr. Ryan to have collected under the 1990 Act a great deal of information, given however frankly by those questioned and in the knowledge of the competent authorities to which it would be given in the end? The Minister of State has changed the list of competent auth<Col N="1343" /> orities to which the report might be given after the people concerned have finished being questioned and the law also gives him permission to extend that list.</P>
    <P>I know retrospective law cannot be enacted which criminalises someone on the basis of something they said which they would not otherwise say if the law was changed. What advice did the Minister of State receive on the fine legal point I have raised? If I were one of the people questioned, what chances would I have were I to take a case to have Mr. Ryan's or anyone else's report overturned on the basis that I was misled at the time I answered the questions, that I did not know the Minister would retrospectively change the list of competent authorities, that had I known that or that my answers might have turned up in a report to the Moriarty or any other tribunal, I might have been more circumspect in my answers? In the interests of fairness to the people questioned by Mr. Ryan, what is the situation regarding the legality of what is being done in the amendment to subsection (4)?</P>
    <P>This is another example of the Minister of State seeing the light after Committee Stage. We touched on this area, although we did not make a specific request. The intent of the debate on Committee Stage was that people would like to see tribunals included. I was of the opinion, and I would be interested to know if Deputy Rabbitte shared it, that we would be laying down the law for future inquiries so that people would know that, if a tribunal were in progress and the issue on which they were being questioned was relevant to it, the report might end up in the tribunal. That opinion was confirmed when the Minister said: &ldquo;We have added in all of these [competent authorities] thereby removing all impediments for the future&rdquo;. The clear implication was that there would be no retrospection, no changes which would affect investigations under way, that this would all be introduced on a given day and that, from then on, the new measures would prevail.</P>
    <P>I am not a lawyer, so I cannot run the rings around the Minister of State which Mr. McDowell might, but I suspect if the Attorney General were a Member of the House, he would do so regarding the Minister of State's explanation of the retrospection and the dangers it might create in future. As a result of the Ryan report going to the former justice, Mr. Costello, anyone who answered Mr. Ryan's questions could argue that they gave answers on the basis of the law as it existed when they were questioned and that the emphasis on the answers they gave is now different because there is now a different group of competent authorities. The Minister of State was quick to share with us the legal advice of two previous Attorneys General. Perhaps he could tell us what the Attorney General said about the risk of someone challenging this amendment to subsection (4) on the basis that they were not aware <Col N="1344" /> of the changed circumstances which would occur when the report was completed.</P>

      <P>I listened with great interest to what Deputies said. There is an inference that, based on my defence, I have cast a slur on the House and a committee of the House. That is certainly not the case. I am proud to be a Member of the House, have the utmost regard for those who are and believe in the democratic process. Every opportunity to make information available to Members should be taken. Deputies Rabbitte and Owen have suggested that my defence is a slur on membership of the House. I disagree and they misinterpreted what I said.</P>
      <P>The problem is simple. Companies will see disclosure to the House as tantamount to public disclosure. That is the position. This will result in non-co-operation with authorised officers' inquiries under section 19. This is the perception &ndash; even if it is not based on reality, it is what counts. We will not receive co-operation, we will go to court and it will be hammer and tongs and legal expenses to pursue section 19 reports in future if there is this disclosure. That is the perception and the position and it is not a slur on anyone.</P>

We do not want to place impediments in its way or discourage people from co-operating.</P>
      <P>Deputy Rabbitte referred to the greater public interest. The public interest in this instance is that information on corporate malpractice should be uncovered for possible criminal investigation. That is what we must achieve with this law. Once this legislation is enacted, we must ensure it gets to the root of corporate malpractice and that criminal prosecution is pursued if necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte disagreed with me about section 19 investigations and said that they would break down. I acknowledge that investigation material obtained under section 19 can be made public in the courts, but that is the only place it can happen. The point is that it will only happen under conditions of due process where the individuals involved are given the right of reply and their constitutional rights are safeguarded. That is the key. They have the same right in that court as the plaintiffs making the case against them. That is equality of opportunity in the law and we must protect it. Deputy Rabbitte also pointed out that any agency could publicly disclose section 19 information. That is not correct. Each agency has been and remains subject to section 21(2) which <Col N="1345" /> makes it a criminal offence to publicly disclose information.</P>
    <P>Deputies Rabbitte and Owen spoke about the Information Commissioner being added to the list of competent authorities in section 21(1). It would not amount to adding a new competent authority to that subsection. Rather, it would be an addition to the Third Schedule of the Freedom of Information Act. In other words, the commissioner's competence under that Act would be extended to allow him have this information. That is a different situation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Owen said it would be difficult to prevent disclosure to the public having given information to other authorities under subsection (1). Disclosure to the listed authorities is designed to assist them in carrying out their proper functions when it is in the Minister's opinion that this would be helpful to those authorities to discharge and execute those functions. Each authority is still required to keep this information under wraps. The Information Commissioner's role is to make disclosure to the public in appropriate circumstances of certain information obtained under sections 19 and 20.</P>
    <P>I identified that any possibility of disclosure will be used as an excuse to frustrate or delay section 19 investigations. We cannot create law that will frustrate section 19 investigations. We must have the right for the regulatory authority, the Minister and the Department to be able to select an officer to conduct an investigation of a company and to be certain we receive the co-operation of that company to obtain the maximum amount of information so that it can be concluded whether an inspector should be appointed or criminal proceedings are warranted. If we do not create law which will provide for that, we will not succeed in eliminating corporate malpractice. If we opt to change the goalposts, we will find ourselves in a serious litigation situation which will cost taxpayers a great deal of money. I do not think any Member of this House wants that to happen.</P>
    <P>Deputy Owen said that this amendment is legally unsound. We have taken legal advice on the matter and are satisfied that there is not a legal problem with extending the list of competent parties under the Bill. The new authorities, like the old ones, must continue to respect the confidentiality of this information. Although we have put in new authorities, the conditions of confidentiality under which they will operate have not changed.</P>

      <P>Absolutely. Discussions, consensus, advice and action are all in evidence. On the point that rules have been changed retrospectively by the inclusion of section 21(4), I explained in great detail in my speech why these changes are appropriate. I do not wish to get bogged down in an exchange of views with the Deputies on the question of retrospection. The record clearly shows that with regard to the specific issues raised in relation to the Ansbacher lists, the argument on retrospection related to the publication of information which had been gathered under conditions of secrecy. We were legally advised that we could not publish that information. On a more general point in regard to retrospection, I pointed out that the Constitution does not permit retrospection which would involve making an act which was not an offence at the time it was committed an offence some time thereafter. That has not changed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did not really respond to the nub of my question. The position of the inspector is sacrosanct in order that he or she would receive the full co-operation of a company and I wonder why that would be threatened if the Minister dared to add an Oireachtas committee to the list. What is the exact point in law in regard to the inspector approaching someone and stating that he or she was carrying out an inspection under all the rules laid down in this section and the various codicils and sections of the Companies Act, 1990, relating to inspectors' powers? One of those sections relates to destination of the report. The Minister is aware of the point I am making. How can the disclosure of information, on the basis of a report ending up on the desk of a competent authority, not pose a problem in regard to the report's credibility? Will the Minister of State explain how the inclusion of an Oireachtas committee in a list of competent authorities can, of itself, be in breach of Article 15.5 of the Constitution which provides that the Oireachtas shall not declare acts to be infringements of the law which were not so at the date of their commission? There is a risk, however small, of information being leaked by any of the competent authorities but I do not see how the fact that something is known or made public can turn it into an offence. How can something be turned into an offence through the act of publication?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1347" /> If I used to drive my car having consumed a certain amount of alcohol and the law was changed retrospectively, I would probably be prosecuted, together with everyone else in the country. If it was stated that from the year 1980, anyone found with alcohol in their blood had committed a criminal offence, in spite of the fact that there was not any limit at the time on the amount one could consume, that would be a case of retrospectively making something which was not formerly an offence into an offence. I cannot understand the Minister of State's defence. There may be practical reasons why he does not want this information to be made public but using Article 15.5 as a defence does not hold water. The publication of a report carried out by an inspector under section 19 does not mean that either the inspector or the person who disclosed information to him or her can be accused of having committed an offence. I am at a loss to know how the Minister of State can use that particular argument for not adding to the list of competent bodies.</P>
    <P>He said he tried not to give offence in the closing part of his reply on why the report should not go to the Dáil. He said that the Government had taken the view that it was not open to it to publish, in the sense of throwing information into the public domain. He went on to say that the Minister could simply sacrifice investigatory powers under the Companies Act to a &ldquo;name and shame&rdquo; agenda of individual Members of the Oireachtas who have absolute privilege. How dare he impute that the only reason we are seeking to include the Oireachtas is that we want to satisfy some prurient desire and get our names in the newspapers? Hunger for publicity is not the reason that Deputy Rabbitte or I seek the inclusion of this provision. The Minister of State used his strongest tone in his speech to defend his reasons for not including the Oireachtas committee, implying that the only reason we are in this House is to gather titbits of juicy information to use in pursuit of a &ldquo;name and shame&rdquo; agenda. He did not use the same tone or language with regard to any other group which might be included. I did not mean to intervene again but the Minister did not grasp what I said about the retrospection clause in subsection (4). Is that not as damaging to the process of the investigation, because we are bringing it in retrospectively, as any change in the terms of publication? </P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte:</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not much point prolonging the misery. We have a choice of calling a vote or of terminating the discussion now because the Minister is clearly not minded to change his view on this final section. It is an important section, although it is not the only important one. The Minister's view prevailed on a couple of matters which I believed were quite contentious. Notwithstanding this is a total recasting of the section concerned and whatever reflection went into it or whoever inspired it, the Minister is impervious to <Col N="1348" /> any arguments to change it. We have reached a stage in the debate when we have to accept that is his position.</P>
      <P>With that in mind, I would like to draw attention to a reference in the script to which I referred on the last occasion. The paragraph put in is entitled, Subsequent Publication. The Minister said: &ldquo;Before concluding, it is only fair that I say, as has been indicated previously, that I favour publication of the results of completed investigations in due course following proper conformity with constitutional procedures and due process.&rdquo;  What does the Minister mean by that?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte:</NameTxt>
      <P>Page 32 where the Minister says it is his view that there should be publication and that he favours publication of the completed investigation. Will the Minister explain to the House how he sees that functioning having regard to the section he is now about to enact? How would the normal investigation be conducted under sections 19 and 20 by an authorised officer and referred, if the Minister was so minded, to the relevant competent authority because she felt the efficacy of the investigation engaged in by that competent authority might not be done properly without access to this information? Suppose that happened, how would this completed investigation come into the public arena? </P>
      <P>I note the Minister says he favours it and, as I said the last day, I understand why he might say that. Somebody who has not laboured through the tedious detail of this Bill might say the Minister says he is in favour of publication but, of course, the Minister does not say that. It is circumscribed by due process and constitutional procedures and so on but even then I am puzzled as to how the Minister is in favour of investigation.</P>
      <P>If it goes to the Revenue Commissioners, the Central Bank, the Stock Exchange or whatever, it is not clear to me how investigation will ensue. I am afraid I do not understand that. I understand that if there is a subsequent invocation of other powers in the Bill and that if one goes before the High Court, some or all of this may come into the public domain in due course. That is a very narrow area and to use the Minister's term, this is purely an information gathering mechanism. In a situation where subsequent resort to the High Court was not had, I am not clear how that comes into the public domain.</P>

    <P>I refer briefly to my amendment No. 8 to amendment No. 33 which seeks to insert the following paragraph: &ldquo;any court of competent jurisdiction or any tribunal of inquiry to which the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Acts, 1921 to <Col N="1349" /> 1998 apply.&rdquo;  The Minister said somewhere in his riposte&mdash;</P>

The Minister said: &ldquo;in relation to Deputy Rabbitte's amendment No. 8 to new subsection (3), I would point out that the existing reference to any court of competent jurisdiction in subsection (21)(3) of the 1990 Act remains as I have just indicated, unaltered by virtue of my present amendment.&rdquo;  I am persuaded that is correct. He went on to say: &ldquo;Consequently the need for the first part of the Deputy's amendment does not arise as I have also already indicated the second part of the Deputy's amendment is catered for by new subsection (21)(1)(c) of his amendment.&rdquo;  I cannot see how that is correct because&mdash;</P>

      <P>Page 21, the last sentence of the penultimate paragraph. It is quite clear that the Minister of the day could refuse to have the report published to the tribunal of inquiry. The Minister is not even required to defend her opinion. Unless the Minister can refer me to a different section, I cannot see anything in the Bill, as I read it, where the Minister is required to have regard to any reasonable considerations. It is purely whether it is in the opinion of the Minister. It is not correct to say, as the Minister said, that the second part of my amendment is catered for. I felt after Committee Stage that it was catered for; that a tribunal of inquiry in future trawling the same territory would be entitled to the relevant information. Now it is only entitled to that information in so far as it accords with the opinion of the Minister. It is not quite as the Minister says and that part is still relevant. I acknowledge the difficulty in the Minister accepting that amendment because the entire structure of the section is different. The entire section is governed by this requirement that it should be in the Minister's opinion.</P>
      <P>I refer to my amendments to amendment No. 33. The Minister should take amendment No. 1 on board. It is, as he says, an amendment or an addition to the Third Schedule of the Freedom of Information Act. The Information Commissioner is acting, in any event, in a quasi judicial capacity and should be trusted with that information. I am adamant in respect of amendment No. 2 that the phrase should be excised. In respect of amendment No. 3, I am prepared to accept what the Minister said that the effect is the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not prepared to go to the wall for amendment No. 5. I thought that in this day and age, while we may use the term &ldquo;he or his&rdquo; in legislation generally and that in so far as it refers here to the Minister and having regard to the gender of the person who is Tánaiste, the Minister of State might be minded to take on board the words &ldquo;or her&rdquo; but clearly he is not prepared to <Col N="1350" /> do so. Amendment No. 6 would be consequential on that.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 7 relates to the debate we had about whether it would be appropriate that a committee of the House or the House should be seized of this information in certain circumstances, and I have explained my arguments in support of that amendment. I just referred to amendment No. 8 and believe the circumstances in which a tribunal of inquiry may now get this information is somewhat circumscribed by the governing clause at the beginning &ndash;&ldquo;in the opinion of the Minister&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I will try to deal with all points raised by Members. In relation to Deputy Owen's point, that information gathered under certain rules can now be disclosed to a greater number of parties, I submit that under section 21(3)(b), the Minister can authorise any party that he or she considers appropriate to get the information. A party under examination would never know what party would get that information. They would never know who would get it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Rabbitte referred to my contribution and my desire to publish information and to put it in the public domain. Section 19 or 20 investigations would eventually end up being used by the competent authority under subsection (1), as now extended, or a competent authority under subsection 21(3), and thereby could possibly come into the public domain. To clarify my position, I would be in favour of publication once different systems and structures as well as due process had taken place and once constitutional protection was given to each individual involved. At the end of the day we must protect the rights of the individual.</P>

      <P>That would be my desire. In relation to another point made by Deputy Rabbitte, that the second part of amendment No. 8 to amendment No 33 is dealt with, regarding tribunals of inquiry, I accept the Deputy's clarification. However, I am satisfied this is as far as it is appropriate to go at this time. The phrase &ldquo;opinion of the Minister&rdquo; seems to have caused a lot of difficulty and it is the case that that phrase does not govern disclosure to a competent authority under subsection (3). I am advised it would not be appropriate to do so. Under subsection <Col N="1351" /> (3), disclosure to a court of competent jurisdiction may be made. If the phrase &ldquo;in the opinion of the Minister&rdquo; were to apply to such disclosures, it would be theoretically possible for the Minister to deny disclosure to a court. This would not be a desirable state of affairs and would probably not be constitutional. It could give rise to conflict between the executive and judicial arms of the State. I am advised accordingly that disclosure to competent authorities should continue to be subject to the existing arrangements.</P>
      <P>The distinction between the two approaches can be summarised as follows. The parties specified in the now expanded subsection (1) cannot assert a right to be given information, pursuant to sections 19 or 20, against the Minister's wishes, whereas the Act is silent with regard to the competent authorities specified in subsection (3). If any of these competent authorities were to press the matter to a court adjudication, in the case of a refusal to disclose information, while the Minister would, as heretofore, have made a decision, that court could not reject the application in this instance on the grounds of the Minister's opinion, but would have to examine all the factors relevant to the specific case before deciding whether refusal was justified.</P>
      <P>I have examined this matter after our discussions. I have thought about it and teased it out. We have had consultations and legal advice. The advice available is that the present formulation is both necessary and appropriate and I accept that.</P>

      <P>We have had a pretty intensive debate on this legislation, although sadly there have only been a few of us present. However, there have been enough of us to show that the House is serious about bringing in legislation to amend company law. I hope the Minister of State recognises that my efforts to improve the legislation were motivated by the lack of implementation of or adherence to company law as it exists. We know the current Attorney General has carried out an extensive report on adherence to company law. With the passing of this legislation I <Col N="1353" /> hope that some of the concerns I and others have expressed will not occur. I am still concerned by this last section, but I am also concerned about Irish registered non-resident companies. I await with interest the Minister for Finance's considerations of the article in <i>Finance Dublin </i>which pointed out ways people are avoiding the law to set up Irish registered non-resident companies. I hope this legislation will be seen as preventing people breaking the law by setting up companies which are not bona fide and thus bringing Ireland into disrepute by the way in which non-resident companies have been used for criminal activities. I welcome the conclusion of this legislation &ndash; we will judge it by its implementation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mr. Rabbitte: I concur with Deputy Owen. This legislation does not complete the agenda of the Gallagher review group as certain matters remain to be addressed, including those which have arisen since due to various developments in this area. Bringing forward law in this area is a painfully slow process and, as Deputy Owen remarked, it does not exactly set the House alight. However, it is extremely important.</P>
    <P>The next major step facing the Government is enforcement. Whereas our law may continue to be defective in some areas &ndash; Deputy Owen referred to the phenomenon of Irish registered non-national companies &ndash; it is in relation to the area of enforcement that we are living in a simpler era. That era has well and truly passed. If legislation such as this is on the Statute Book, it must be enforced. I congratulate the Minister on bringing this legislation through the House. I hold adamantly to my view that we made an error in the area of big ticket leasing. However, numbers rule and for the moment I accept that.</P>

There has been a reduction in INRs of on average 1,000 per quarter in the first three quarters of the past year in company registrations.

      <P>I am delighted to be able to introduce Second Stage of the Stamp Duties Consolidation Bill, 1999. The Bill consolidates the statute law relating to stamp duties which is contained in the Stamp Act, 1891, the Stamp Duties Management Act, 1891, and subsequent Revenue and Finance Acts. This is the first time in the history of the State that a Bill has been introduced in the Oireachtas which has the objective of consolidating the legislation on stamp duties into one comprehensive enactment. For this reason I am particularly pleased to be associated with the introduction of this Bill.</P>
      <P>Almost two years ago to the day, on 14 October 1997, I introduced the Taxes Consolidation Bill, 1997, which consolidated the law relating to income tax, corporation tax and capital gains tax. The Taxes Consolidation Act was a milestone event; it was warmly welcomed by tax practitioners and has been of great assistance to all those who have to deal with taxation matters, particularly in the financial and legal sectors. At the time I said I was anxious that we should make progress in consolidating other areas of tax legislation. While I mentioned in particular the legislation on capital taxation I also spoke about the commitment of the Revenue Commissioners to undertake consolidation of other areas of tax law. The publication of this Bill is a tangible demonstration of the considerable work that has been done to turn into reality the undertakings given to this House. However, the work on the consolidation of our tax laws does not stop with this Bill. For example, the Finance Act, 1999, incorporated the first stage in the planned consolidation and modernisation of excise law, some of which goes back to the early part of the last century. In that Act, the law relating to the excise duties on mineral oils was completely recast. The Government's intention is that subsequent Finance Bills will consolidate a number of other aspects of excise law. These measures will deal with the general legislation in relation to excise duties and also provisions relating to the duties on alcoholic drinks.</P>

    <P>Stamp duties were first introduced into Ireland <Col N="1355" /> 225 years ago in 1774 as a temporary measure covering 47 different types of documents. However, as in many other matters of taxation temporary became permanent over the years. It is interesting that while there were 47 different types of documents liable for stamp duty in 1774 by 1891 this had increased to 95 types of documents. The House will be relieved to hear that the number is now 15, so considerable rationalisation has been achieved over the past century.</P>
    <P>From the time that they were first introduced and, indeed, until 1973, stamp duty remained a duty on written documents. In 1973, the duty was extended to cover transactions for the first time. The transactions, which then became liable to stamp duty, related to the issue of new shares by companies and the duty then introduced is more commonly referred to as companies capital duty rather than stamp duty. The next extension of the duty took place in 1981 when the Finance Act imposed a levy on credit cards and charge cards. There have been further developments so that today we have, in addition to the levies on credit cards and charge cards, levies on cash cards, non-life insurance premiums and so-called &ldquo;section 84&rdquo; loans. While the statutory background to stamp duty may have become complex it is fundamentally a form of taxation that is relatively straightforward in most respects and one that can be easily administered.</P>
    <P>Stamp duties came face to face with modem information technology for the first time in 1996 when company law was amended to enable title to shares to be transferred electronically. The Finance Act, 1996, provided for the application of stamp duty in respect of electronic messages which are sent to the registrar of a company advising the registrar to update the register to reflect the new ownership interest. The brush with modem technology is not yet over. No doubt developments in e-commerce will permit electronic conveyancing in the not too distant future. Just as electronic share dealing was accommodated within the stamp duty system so too will electronic conveyancing.</P>
    <P>Major changes are being made to the system for the administration of stamp duty in the future to introduce modem technology. The Revenue Commissioners are applying resources from their annual vote to invest heavily in the computerisation of stamp duties. A new system is nearing completion. The system will enable a comprehensive audit trail to be maintained in respect of each document presented for stamping. This will be very beneficial in improving the transparency and management of the system. A fresh modern look will be given to the new stamps, which will be impressed by new technology and will include the use of holograms. When the new system goes live, which is expected very shortly, the Revenue Commissioners will be in a position to provide its client base with a much more streamlined stamp duty service. The computerisation project and the consolidation project will together usher in a new <Col N="1356" /> stamp duty era for practitioners and the Revenue Commissioners alike and is a fitting beginning to a new millennium for a venerable form of taxation.</P>
    <P>The House will appreciate that the preparatory work for the consolidation of this legislation, a significant portion of which dates back to the 1890s, was a matter of great complexity. It required the utmost patience and persistence. The officials of the Revenue Commissioners, who were assigned the consolidation project, were fortunate to have the model of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, to follow. The same rigorous process that worked so well for that Act was applied to the stamp duty legislation. The aim at all times was to ensure the most accurate consolidation of the existing law, with nothing left out and nothing added. This is what has been achieved in this Bill. The Bill was considered by the parliamentary draftsman's office and has been duly certified as a consolidation of existing law by the Attorney General.</P>
    <P>The process for the Taxes Consolidation Act involved a comprehensive consultation arrangement with the bodies representing the practitioners who are among the major users of the legislation. This was recognised to have been of immense value and so it was decided that for the Stamp Duties Bill the same consultation process should be employed. To that end, drafts of the Bill were made available for comment at different stages to interested parties such as the Law Society of Ireland, the Institute of Taxation in Ireland and the Consultative Committee of Accountancy Bodies &ndash; Ireland. In addition, two independent expert referees were appointed to examine the accuracy and structure of the Bill. The comments received added greatly to the final product and I extend my thanks to the parties concerned.</P>
    <P>Another area of similarity is in the structure of the Bill. Like the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, generally applicable provisions, such as definitions and the charging section, have been placed first. These are followed by more specialist provisions, for example, provisions relating to particular documents, which in turn are followed by enforcement and management provisions. At the end of the Bill the commencement and transitional provisions are set out. The use of archaic language and the old-fashioned device of using provisos to change the meaning of a section have also been eliminated in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Another feature of the approach adopted for the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, was that provisions to facilitate a more orderly consolidation were enacted in advance of consolidation in the Finance Acts, 1996 and 1997. This also happened on the stamp duty side. The Finance Acts, 1996, 1998 and 1999 contained measures designed to tidy-up the stamp duty code in advance of consolidation. These measures consisted to a large extent of the repeal of provisions which had become obsolete or which were no longer required.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1357" /> To facilitate readers of the Bill, statutory derivations for the legislation provided for in the Bill, which I will refer to as the &ldquo;new legislation&rdquo;, are set out in the margin opposite each section. These entries show from where each section in the new legislation comes. In addition, the memorandum published with the Bill sets out the old legislation in chronological order and shows the reader where it is located in the new legislation. If a provision has not been enacted in the Bill, this memorandum explains why. The most common reasons for not including a provision in the Bill are that the provision in question has already been repealed or is unnecessary for some reason, for example, it might be redundant.</P>
    <P>The Bill is the culmination of many years of work. The need to consolidate stamp duties has been self-evident for some time. First, the two basic Acts, the Stamp Act, 1891, and the Stamp Duties Management Act, 1891, were enacted before the foundation of the State. In addition, the Stamp Act, 1891, has been amended almost annually since 1891. In more recent years the stamp duty code has been amended and extended not by way of amendment to the 1891 Act itself, but by way of self-contained sections in Finance Acts.</P>
    <P>Understandably, this overall fragmentation of the stamp duty law made it difficult for anyone advising in the area to know the position regarding a liability to stamp duty in a particular set of circumstances. Perhaps the greatest benefit which will result from this consolidation will be the restructuring of the stamp duty code in a clear, coherent and logical way. This will make it more accessible and user-friendly for all users, including Members of the Oireachtas, who have to cope with annual changes to stamp duty law.</P>
    <P>The consolidation of stamp duties legislation will also make it possible for future changes to stamp duties to be slotted into the Consolidation Act by way of amendment in the annual Finance Act. It is intended that this should happen and I wish to give a commitment to that effect to the House. Another benefit is the reduction in the number of stamp duty provisions which has been brought about by this Bill and the repeals effected in the Finance Acts, 1996, 1998 and 1999, to which I referred. As a consequence of these measures the size of the code has been reduced by almost two-thirds.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to go through every section of the Bill. The explanatory memorandum which was published with the Bill sets out in summary form the purpose of each section of the Bill. However, I wish to give some flavour of the overall structure of the Bill which contains 164 sections and four Schedules. It is divided into 12 Parts.</P>
    <P>Part 1 consists of definitions and rules of construction. Definitions of terms which are used throughout the Bill are now all contained in this Part. Definitions which only apply to a particular section are contained at the beginning of that <Col N="1358" /> section. This is in line with the structure adopted for the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997.</P>
    <P>Part 2 contains the charging section &ndash; section 2. As I stated, stamp duty is, in general, a duty chargeable on written documents; not all documents are liable to stamp duty. To be liable the document must be listed in Schedule 1 of the Bill and must also either be executed in the State or, if executed abroad, must relate to Irish property. Schedule 1 contains an alphabetical listing of all the documents which are potentially liable to stamp duty. Schedule 1 also contains the rate of duty which applies to each document.</P>
    <P>Part 2 also contains other general provisions relating to the payment and recovery of stamp duties on instruments. Documents which are liable to stamp duty must be presented to the Revenue Commissioners within 30 days of their execution, otherwise penalties for late payment arise. Surcharges may arise where property is undervalued for stamp duty purposes.</P>
    <P>Part 3 sets out how property is to be valued for the purposes of stamp duties. The most common area where valuation is required is where property is transferred by way of gift &ndash; basically, open market value rules apply. Where there is a doubt concerning the valuation submitted, the Revenue Commissioners use the services of the Valuation Office. A taxpayer who is dissatisfied with a valuation may appeal to the Appeals Commissioners in the case of property other than land and to the Land Values Reference Committee in the case of land.</P>
    <P>Part 4 contains provisions relating to the assessment of stamp duty and appeals against such assessments. A taxpayer has the right to appeal against a stamp duty assessment. Subject to what I said earlier in relation to appeals on valuation matters, appeals against stamp duty assessments are heard in the first instance by the Appeal Commissioners. The decision of the Appeal Commissioners is final unless the appeal is required to be reheard by the Circuit Court or is submitted to the High Court on a point of law.</P>
    <P>Part 5 consists of a number of sections which explain and/or supplement Schedule 1. This Part is arranged in the same order as Schedule 1. By far the biggest component of Part 5 is chapter 2 which relates to stamp duty on conveyances on sale. Chapter 2 has an internal logic in that it first covers documents which fall within the definition of conveyance on sale in section 1. It then covers documents which are treated for stamp duty purposes as if they were conveyances on sale, although they do not come within the definition of conveyance on sale in section 1. These are known as deemed conveyances on sale.</P>
    <P>In the main the sections which deal with deemed conveyances on sale are anti-avoidance provisions. Chapter 2 also contains provisions relating to the consideration which is chargeable to stamp duty. In stamp duty terms consideration is not only cash; it also includes shares and the assumption of debts. In addition, chapter 2 contains a number of miscellaneous provisions such <Col N="1359" /> as the exclusion of value added tax from the computation of a stamp duty liability.</P>
    <P>Part 6 imposes stamp duty on securities title to which is transferred electronically via the CREST system. The CREST system enables trades dealt on the Irish and UK stock exchanges to be settled electronically. In the absence of this charge, transfers through the system would have escaped liability to stamp duty because no documents are produced by the system.</P>
    <P>Part 7 contains exemptions and reliefs from the charge to stamp duty on instruments. In so far as it was possible to do so, the exemptions and reliefs follow the same sequence as Schedule 1. Part 8 imposes companies capital duty. This applies on foot of an EC Council directive and arises in the main where new shares are issued by a limited company. Part 9 imposes a number of levies on cash cards, credit cards, charge cards, non-life insurance premiums and section 84 loans.</P>
    <P>Part 10 sets out how the payment of stamp duties is to be enforced. As stated previously, payment of stamp duty is compulsory and late payment will give rise to penalties. In addition to this, a document which is liable to stamp duty and is not properly stamped may not be given as evidence in most court proceedings. Stamp duty is a particularly effective type of taxation because in many respects it is a self-enforcing tax.</P>
    <P>Part 11 contains those provisions previously contained in the Stamp Duties Management Act, 1891. As I said, there were two Acts in 1891, the Stamp Act, 1891, and the Stamp Duties Management Act, 1891. These two Acts have now been incorporated into one Bill. However, the integrity of the Stamp Duties Management Act, 1891, has been maintained by giving it a Part of its own in the Bill. Nothing has been added to that Act or taken from it except for the deletion of redundant provisions and the modernisation of language. This is an important point. As legislation for which other Departments are responsible relies on the provisions of the Stamp Duties Management Act, 1891, it was necessary to ensure that those provisions remained intact and this has been done.</P>
    <P>Part 12 contains provisions relating to the commencement of the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act, 1999, repeals and the Short Title of the Act. It is my intention that the Bill will be made available on CD-ROM once it is enacted. In addition, the Revenue Commissioners have prepared guidance notes on the Consolidation Act which they will publish as soon as possible after the Bill is enacted. I also understand that these notes will be made available on their website. For the information of Deputies, the guidance notes follow the format and style of the guidance notes published for the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997. Where relevant, they contain cross-references to other legislation. In addition, they refer, where appropriate, to stamp duty forms, leaflets, statements of practice and practices.</P>
    <P>With regard to the timetable for the passage of <Col N="1360" /> the Bill, it is proposed that it be referred to the Standing Joint Committee on Consolidation Bills for consideration. A number of motions will be included on the Order Papers of both Houses to comply with the various rules and procedures as set out in Standing Orders in order to achieve the timely passage of the Bill. These motions will facilitate the taking of Committee, Report and Fifth Stages and shorten the minimum time periods allowed for in Standing Orders.</P>
    <P>I wish to place on record the Government's appreciation of the amount of work which went into the preparation of this Bill. The staff of the Revenue Commissioners and the parliamentary draftsman's office are to be congratulated on a job well done. The input from the private sector was invaluable and demonstrates what can be achieved with a team approach. I commend the Bill to the House and I look forward to its co-operation in its speedy enactment.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That Dáil Éireann:</P>
      <P>&ndash;noting that there are an estimated 100,000 carers who provide the bulk of care for people with severe disabilities, those who are mentally ill, those suffering from chronic illnesses or those who are in need of care through age or infirmity, most of whom are in receipt of no financial assistance and whose role is not recognised, acknowledged or supported by the State;</P>
      <P>&ndash;conscious of the fact that an estimated 140,000 people with physical and sensory disability have yet to achieve full, social, economic and educational integration as equal, independent and participative members within the general community;</P>
      <P>&ndash;aware from Government-commissioned reports that more than 1,000 people with intellectual disability live in completely inappropriate surroundings and that thousands more are on waiting lists for essential services, such as residential and respite care;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ndash;believing that there is an urgent need to address the legitimate demands of people with a disability, their families, carers and <Col N="1361" /> advocates for a range of appropriate services and supports;</P>
    <P>&ndash;knowing that the present healthy state of the economy provides an unprecedented opportunity to vindicate the rights of and radically improve the quality of life for people with disabilities, the elderly, the chronically ill and for their carers and families; and</P>
    <P>&ndash;recognising the justifiable anger and disappointment of carers, people with disabilities, their families and advocates because of the failure of the Government to comprehensively provide for their documented needs and entitlements which has led, for the second successive year, to their public protest at the gates of Leinster House, calls on the Government to put in place a comprehensive financial package in the millennium budget to fund the necessary expansion of both community-based and residential care facilities, services and requirements and, in particular, to provide for:</P>
    <P>&ndash;full implementation, by the end of 2000, of the recommendations contained in the report &lsquo;Towards an Independent Future';</P>
    <P>&ndash;the elimination of waiting lists for respite, residential and day care and for essential aids and appliances;</P>
    <P>&ndash;the expansion of the personal assistance service to allow for a substantial increase in the number of adequately paid and trained personal assistants;</P>
    <P>&ndash;a radical overhaul of financial supports to carers and people with disabilities, including an increase in the carer's allowance to not less than £100 per week and a relaxation of the present stringent means test requirements, which addresses the need for a non-means-tested cost-of-care allowance and cost-of-disability allowance;</P>
    <P>&ndash;the extension of the incapacitated persons' tax allowance;</P>
    <P>&ndash;the payment of domiciliary care allowance from date of definite diagnosis rather than from two years of age, as at present;</P>
    <P>&ndash;the establishment of home-help services as a core health service provided as a statutory entitlement with an increased number of adequately paid and trained personnel;</P>
    <P>&ndash;a substantial increase in the number of public health nurses, occupational therapists, physiotherapists, social workers and other paramedical services,</P>
    <P>&ndash;and demands that the Government produce a fully-costed programme to <Col N="1362" /> achieve these objectives and to undertake to fulfil the recommendations of the report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities within a specified timeframe.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael motion focuses on the forgotten people of Irish life. I am unsure of exactly how many &ndash; some would say one-tenth of the entire population, which would be more than one-third of a million. Certainly, there are at least 140,000 people with physical and sensory disabilities who have yet to achieve full social, economic and educational integration as equal, independent and participative members within the general community. There are also an estimated 100,000 carers who provide the bulk of care for people with severe disabilities, for those who are mentally ill, those suffering from chronic illnesses or those who are in need of care through age or infirmity. All these people, and more, have been forgotten. I recognise the justifiable anger and disappointment of carers, people with disabilities, their families and advocates because of the failure of Government to comprehensively provide for their documented needs and entitlements. Thus, we have had for the second successive year a public protest at the gates of Leinster House.</P>
    <P>This week, we had the much-trumpeted national plan with a price tag of £40 billion. There is plenty of money for roads, railways, sewers and social housing. I looked in vain, however, for the section dealing with the forgotten people. I fear again, they have been forgotten. The reaction of the Forum for People with Disabilities says it all. This independent body said the plan, and I quote from today's edition of <i>The Irish Times,</i>&ldquo;contains no specific details as to what resources will be directed at concrete and inclusive measures for disabled people over the next 6 years&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that Fine Gael has put a special pre-budget focus on the rights and needs of carers, people with disabilities and those in need of care through age, infirmity, mental or physical illness. We are demanding a comprehensive financial package in the millennium budget to fund the expansion of community-based and residential care facilities and the elimination of waiting lists for respite, residential and day care and essential aids and appliances. We also seek the expansion of the personal assistance service and a radical overhaul of financial supports for carers and people with disabilities. We are looking for the expansion of the incapacitated persons' tax allowance and the payment of the domiciliary care allowances from the date of definitive diagnosis rather than at two years of age as at present. We want the establishment of home support services as a statutory entitlement and a substantial increase in the number of public health nurses, occupational therapists, physiotherapists, social workers and other paramedical supports.</P>
    <P>Given that the Exchequer is awash with money, there is now an unprecedented opportunity to vindicate the rights and radically improve the <Col N="1363" /> quality of life for people with disabilities, the elderly, the chronically ill and their carers and families. So much can be said about any of these issues that it is impossible to cover all the ground. I intend to focus on some of the caring aspects, while my colleague, Deputy Shatter, will speak in more detail about general disability issues. Such is the interest in and support for this motion that virtually every member of the Fine Gael parliamentary party has sought to join in the debate. However, we can only accommodate approximately 25 members because of time constraints.</P>
    <P>I want to put a major focus on carers. They do not deserve our pity, they do not need to be told how important they are. Fine Gael believes that rather than mere words, they deserve our financial support for the job they do, a job which saves the taxpayer millions of pounds. Caring is a business, not a charity. Carers must live like the rest of us. They must pay bills, mortgages and put food on the table, just like all of us. We have so surrounded the granting of financial help to carers by bureaucracy and red tape upon red tape that three out of four carers in modern Ireland, Celtic tiger Ireland, are denied the basic financial support they should receive. Instead of battling to look after the health and well being of those they nurse, by our penny-pinching cruelty we force on them a second battle, to try to make ends meet without income from the State. It is as if we are saying to them that we do not think what they are doing is important enough to warrant our support.</P>
    <P>We have a carer's allowance of sorts but instead of being designed to help those who need help, to reward those who devote their time and effort to aiding others, it seems to have been designed to penny-pinch. Forget the means test &ndash; it is just a mean test. It is a system designed not for the benefit of those it should serve, but to allow us to find every technicality we can, every loophole we can discover to say &ldquo;we know you deserve the money but we have found a way to stop you getting it&rdquo;. It is a case of scrooge-bureaucracy gone mad.</P>
    <P>The irony is that this scrooge-like mentality blindly ignores the fact that these carers save the taxpayers a fortune. Even if every single carer were paid, the taxpayer would still come out the winner. Today, 99% of all those needing care are cared for, not in hospitals, not in special care centres or residential homes, but by family carers. Imagine the cost to the taxpayer if all these people had to be accommodated in costly residential homes and hospitals. It must be obvious even to the most cynical penny-pinching bureaucrat, cynical newspaper columnist or cynical economist that by looking after these people at home, carers are saving the Exchequer a fortune. Remember also, some day in the not too distant future the proportion of elderly people who will need care will rocket. Today's numbers will look like a drop in the ocean compared to the figures to come.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1364" /> I have no doubt that somewhere there is someone who, as the saying goes, &ldquo;knows the price of everything and the value of nothing&rdquo;, and who will say that if carers are willing to care for family members for little or nothing, why bother spending money on them. I reject that argument. As far as I and my party are concerned, carers deserve more than our thanks. They deserve our financial and personal support. Even the cynics will recognise the value of ensuring that as many people as possible are looked after at home, not in costly residential care. It makes economic sense to look after people in their own homes. Morality and economics are two good reasons carers deserve proper financial support.</P>
    <P>The days when we use the means test and penny-pinching rules as a means to find some technicality to steal back from carers money to which they are entitled must end. A fairer method of assessing means should be put in place immediately to allow 10,000 further carers to qualify for direct financial support. We must also extend the incapacitated persons' tax allowance of £8,500. This currently caters only for approximately 400 taxpayers. That should be extended to all carers who do not qualify for a carer's allowance. We must also ensure that the annual £200 respite allowance is paid to all carers providing full-time care and attention to the elderly and disabled.</P>
    <P>Carers are not the only people providing valuable, vital services to those housebound due to illness, disability or old age. There are 12,000 home helps in Ireland, most of them part-time. To say that the service they provide to those who need their help is vital is an understatement. The demand on such a service will rocket in years to come. At present there are 175,000 people over the age of 75 in this country. Within the next 30 years, that figure will nearly double to 300,000. The number of people over the age of 65 will increase by 50% in the next 12 years. It makes sense, even financial sense, to ensure that old people where possible are kept in their own community, not shunted off to expensive old folks homes, unless health problems make it absolutely necessary for that old person to live in a special home.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael believes passionately that the elderly and disabled should be encouraged to remain, as far as possible, in their own communities. Ireland has always believed in the importance of community and, to my mind, we must strive to keep that community spirit alive. Central to such communities must be the elderly and disabled. To achieve that, there must be a properly funded, properly staffed home help service to provide the back-up the old and the disabled will need if they are to continue to live in their community. The home help service will need investment &ndash; we will give it. Its current budget of £25 million is ludicrously inadequate. It should be doubled immediately to £50 million, coupled with the provision of the other necessary resources. Take the position of an individual home help. Would any of us work <Col N="1365" /> for £3 per hour? The Celtic tiger values home helps less than it values a pack of cigarettes. It pays home helps per hour less than we spend on a pack of 20 cigarettes. That is slavery Celtic tiger style &ndash; the booming Irish economy that treats home helps like cheap slaves, cheaper than 20 cigarettes.</P>
    <P>It is incredible that home helps, even now, receive only £3 per hour. They should be at least paid the proposed minimum wage, perhaps with the provision of special rates for weekend visits. Fine Gael also believes that a proper system of training and recognition must be provided. We also believe that national guidelines are necessary to cover criteria for assessment of need, entitlement and level of service provision.</P>
    <P>The scrooge bureaucracy mentality has reached a low point in the treatment of babies born with intellectual or physical disability. There is absolutely no case for the current regulation which denies payment of the domiciliary care allowance before the baby reaches the age of two years. Fine Gael will change this ridiculous rule to permit payment from the date of definitive medical diagnosis.</P>
    <P>When these changes are made and the issues raised by my colleagues are dealt with, maybe we will be able to say with pride that we really do care for the old and the disabled. We will also be able to say that we value, truly value, the contribution of those Irish men and women who give so much in the service of their fellow citizens. We owe them so much for their devotion to others, to those in need and to those who in the past themselves helped to build up this nation. It is time we repaid that debt and vindicated the rights of those who are cared for and their carers. We, in Fine Gael, will do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter:</NameTxt>
      <P>Since this House last debated a motion on services to people with disabilities the country has experienced its first national nurses strike. It was a traumatic event causing chaos in the acute hospital sector which was already close to breaking point. Despite the best efforts of nurses who provided emergency cover free of charge, it caused hardship to in-hospital patients and stress and a further burden of care to the families of those who required, and will now have to wait longer for, hospital treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During this entirely preventable strike, the Government was content to see hospital waiting lists escalate. It was equally content to see people with disabilities denied access to residential, day and respite care. Those who rely on the support of specialist nurses and the public health nurse in the care of dependent relatives had to cope alone. During the nurses strike we had, through news bulletins, a brief glimpse into the often hidden world of people with disabilities, those who are chronically ill, the elderly, people with mental illness and those who care for them, often with little or no support or recognition from the State. The Government was content to let them cope alone during the nurses strike. The Government is con<Col N="1366" /> tent to produce a litany of platitudes, of promises about legislation and increased spending, whenever services to people with disabilities and their carers and advocates are discussed. The Minister invariably takes &ndash; we will probably hear it again this evening &ndash; the &ldquo;we did more than you&rdquo; route whenever these issues are discussed. That is to be regretted.</P>
    <P>It must be acknowledged that progress has been made. This House has debated and passed important equality legislation. It has, through Private Members' motions such as this, wrung a little more assistance for aids and appliances. The disabilities motions last year forced the Government to make extra financial provision it never contemplated making until the motions were tabled and debated in this House.</P>
    <P>The Government's review of its own performance and the national plan make much of what will be done in terms of capital spending. There are promises in both documents which, if fulfilled, will ease the position of many. There has been much talk of partnership, new structures and national strategies but what is the reality? How many people's lives have been transformed beyond recognition by the Government's spending and plans? Unfortunately, the answer is all too few. There are too many who are waiting still, living lives of quiet desperation, denied their opportunity to live independently because of lack of personal assistance, denied the right to mobility because they are still on a waiting list for aids or appliances, denied their right to a normal life because they are caring for a family member with dementia or mental illness who is on a seemingly endless waiting list for appropriate residential care.</P>
    <P>The need for this motion is clear. Early next month the Minister for Finance will deliver his millennium budget package. There may be something in it for everybody. We may all have reason to be pleased if we have to pay less tax and it may improve the &ldquo;feel good&rdquo; factor, but unless it makes a real difference to the lives of people with disabilities, to carers and to those in need of special care, it will not be a socially just budget.</P>
    <P>The pre-budget submissions of a great number of the voluntary agencies set out clearly the scale of the issues to be addressed. They are not an aspirational wish list but a statement of real and concrete needs which must be addressed in the budget by the Government. Those who have waited so long for recognition and for a vindication of their rights must be sorely disappointed by the Government's amendment to the motion. They are being asked again to take the Government's word, to applaud the Government's recognition of their needs as if it is doing them a favour rather than acknowledging their rights and to listen again to the fine words of the Government's policy documents.</P>
    <P>On the physical disability side, the 1,273 people who require personal assistance services, the 1,113 who need access to day resources centres and the 3,500 people who need respite care could <Col N="1367" /> have their needs met by the provision of £16 million of Revenue funding. Relatively little money could improve beyond recognition the lives of a substantial number of people. The Irish Wheelchair Association estimates that a cost of disability payment scheme could be instituted for £16 million to assist people with disabilities to meet their needs where services are not available or cannot be provided. The current situation cannot be allowed to continue. We cannot defend the indefensible where people are denied personal assistance, including care attendants and home help. We cannot justify that care attendants providing critical personal care at night, at weekends and on public holidays are paid only £3 an hour. We cannot justify payments of that level or lower to home helps. On the eve of the 21st century, we cannot justify providing 19th century services to people with disabilities and to their carers.</P>
    <P>In the absence of a national database of people with physical and sensory disabilities, the full extent of the need to be addressed is currently uncertain. The &ldquo;Not for Profit&rdquo; Business Association estimates that its client base is in the region of 135,000 people. There is a pressing need for a database of people with physical and sensory disability so that long-term planning can be undertaken using real and not estimated figures &ndash; we said the same this time last year in a similar debate. However, in the absence of a database, there is enough empirical data. There are enough real people, situations and needs to be met now.</P>
    <P>Last week in a debate on this issue in the Seanad, the Minister for Health and Children made much of the fact that co-ordination committees have been set up in each of the health boards to identify priorities for service provision and for disbursement of funds. This is a welcome development and one which should, in theory, address the regional imbalance in the provision of services. In practice, the old structures still exist. Funds which should be finely targeted to meet real needs are being disbursed on the &ldquo;one for everybody in the audience&rdquo; principle in some health boards. There is, among the voluntary agencies, serious disillusionment about the way this so-called partnership and co-ordination operates in practice. The co-ordination committees are supposed to be chaired by the programme manager in the health board. In some health boards the committees are chaired by whoever is available on the day of the meeting. This is unfair to the voluntary agencies, the health board personnel and, most especially, the people who require the service. Continuity and commitment are vital if needs are to be met.</P>
    <P>The procedures for allocation of funds need to be tightened up. Money allocated in a particular year to meet needs within a health board area should provide service benefit in the year of allocation. This is not happening in all cases. For instance, in the Mid-Western Health Board, the capital allocation for 1999 did not become available until November, one month before year end. <Col N="1368" /> Yet in the Government's accounts, this money was technically providing services for people with disabilities for the whole of 1999. In the Midland Health Board area, all the money for service provision was allocated to a premises which will not be in use until the end of next year.</P>
    <P>There needs to be a review of procedures in relation to these committees. Some health board areas have made a promising start and are sensibly working through a service plan. In the absence of focused guidelines and regular quality audits of the service plans of these committees, the old regional inequalities and imbalances will persist to the detriment of those people who require speedy and high quality services. Surely the simplest way to address needs of people with disabilities is to set up simple clearing houses to evaluate needs and target resources. The voluntary agencies would wish to see this in place. When will the Minister actually move to put these structures in place? In response to parliamentary questions tabled by me, he has advocated the clearing house role for the co-ordination committees in relation to waiting lists for aids and appliances. Today, in reply to a question, he said:</P>
    <P>. . . aids and appliances are also provided by a number of voluntary [agencies] . The position regarding waiting lists for these items is therefore more complex ., as many people, who are in contact with voluntary [agencies] ., are not always known to the health boards. This makes it difficult to get an accurate picture of the overall numbers and the . waiting times for the provision of equipment . However, this matter is being addressed by the boards in co-operation with their co-ordinating committees .</P>
    <P>The Minister then uses this lack of co-ordination, for which he is responsible, to provide data on waiting lists for aids and appliances which is typically obscure. According to the Department's estimates, there are approximately 1,600 people waiting for essential aids and appliances, but the Minister does not know who they are and either was unable or deliberately failed to tell the House for what they are waiting.</P>
    <P>The service deficit for people with an intellectual disability is apparent through the intellectual disability database and the assessment of needs document. Despite the Government's assertion that the situation has improved in recent years, the database figures show that 3,380 people with intellectual disability will require a new service in the next five years.</P>
    <P>The principal carers of persons with mental handicap are their parents. The age profile of those identified as requiring a service has a very significant implication. There are very elderly parents caring for middle aged and older sons or daughters. Parents in their 70s and 80s are looking after their adult mentally handicapped sons or daughters. For all of them, quite apart from the daily physical and emotional demands made on <Col N="1369" /> them, there is the fear of what will happen to their child if they die or become incapacitated.</P>
    <P>In this country, we claim to value the elderly. Based on the figures to which I referred, it is clear that there may be over 8,000 old age pensioners caring for a dependent mentally handicapped son or daughter. What will the Minister do for them? Will an increase in their old age pension, welcome though it would be, relieve the pressure of caring? Will it provide the residential, day or respite care that they so desperately need? Will it end the sleepless nights or provide peace of mind?</P>
    <P>The parent of a mentally handicapped adult, in a submission to the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities, summed up the position in this way:</P>
    <P>Parents do not expect the state or society to take over their responsibilities. They are prepared to make whatever sacrifices are necessary but with the best will in the world, they cannot do it from beyond the grave.</P>
    <P>The Government's programme, An Action Programme for the Millennium, made various promises to people with disabilities. The revised Government programme, published in recent weeks, states:</P>
    <P>At this time it is clear that the services for those suffering from a mental or physical handicap, which have improved since this Government took office, must be developed at an even faster rate to ensure that facilities already in place are improved upon as well as providing for additional places which are backed up by a range of supports available to patients, family and carers. The Government pledges to do this as a priority.</P>
    <P>While these are fine words, where is the evidence of the Government's fine deeds? The Government recognises that there is a need to develop services at an even faster rate. Why did it not provide funding for service provision at a faster rate?</P>
    <P>The Government has, at year end, £2 billion more at its disposal than estimated at the start of this year, not including the receipts from the sale of Telecom Éireann. Last year, at about this time and in a debate on a similar motion, I highlighted the fact that £21 million in receipts from the health levy would not be spent by the end of 1998. The highlighting of this unspent £21 million forced the Government to make an additional financial allocation for the provision of services for people with disabilities. This year, there has been a substantial increase in receipts from the health levy, which is, I remind Members, expressly intended to provide additional funds for health service provision.</P>
    <P>This year, it is conservatively estimated that the Department of Health and Children will have £80 million in health levy receipts unspent at the end of 1999. On the eve of the millennium, the Department of Health and Children will have saved £80 million. This sum is just £10 million <Col N="1370" /> short of the total so-called additional funding of £91 million allocated by the Government to disability service provision over the past two and a half years for which it congratulates itself in its proposed amendment to the motion. Scrooge would be proud of the Government. The Minister for Health and Children could have made a far greater financial allocation this year to meet the needs of people with intellectual, physical and sensory disability and those of carers and to assist with the care requirements of people with dementia, those with mental illness and the chronically ill.</P>
    <P>The Government, in its amendment, also attempts to congratulate itself for &ldquo;putting in place arrangements to meet the educational needs of children with special needs&rdquo;. While some progress has been made in this area, over the past two years we have seen a procession of parents with disabled children being obliged to take High Court action against the Departments of Education and Science and Health and Children to force them to provide basic specialist educational services for children with special needs.</P>
    <P>If this was a simple political point scoring exercise, the Government should be embarrassed. Sadly, the unspent millions are not a cause of embarrassment, they are a national scandal. Every pound of those unspent millions could have made substantial differences to the lives of people with disabilities. I hope the Minister for Health and Children can again this year be shamed into spending some, at least, of the additional health levy receipts. All £80 million could have been spent this year on people with disabilities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford:</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion tabled by Deputy Jim O'Keeffe. It is appropriate that the Dáil should be discussing this matter at this time. Yesterday, the seven year national plan, which is worth £40 billion, was launched. This plan gives the Minister for Health and Children and every other member of the Cabinet a great opportunity to decide whether we want to build a genuinely fair society. I recall that the previous national plan was launched amid similar fanfares. However, many people did not benefit as much as others under that plan. Among those who did not get their fair share are those to whom the motion refers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many people who will look at the huge budgets and resources available to the <Col N="1371" /> Government and the Minister for Health and Children, wondering how they will respond to this motion. Every policy put in place by the Minister's Department during the next three years must be designed to ensure that we look after the needs of the marginalised in society.</P>
    <P>I support Deputy O'Keeffe's comments about the carer's allowance which was designed seven to eight years ago as a mechanism to give a little reward to many people throughout the country. The people in receipt of the allowance are doing a huge service not just for their families but the country in general. The rate of pay they receive is entirely insufficient and the means test designed to regulate the scheme is most unfair. Both must be reviewed.</P>
    <P>I also concur with Deputy O'Keeffe's remarks in respect of the home help service. The home help scheme was introduced almost as a stop-gap measure to allow people to look after their neighbours. However, society has changed. Home helps do tremendous work and they save the State millions of pounds each week but they are paid a pittance. The Minister must ensure that a proper home help scheme with a proper rate of pay is put in place because his Department, the district and county hospitals and the nursing homes throughout the country are saving millions of pounds each week as a result of the work done on an almost voluntary basis by home helps.</P>
    <P>My final point relates to the educational services which should be made available to the many people suffering from disabilities, particularly the young. Last weekend I met the parents of a four year old deaf child who are obliged to transport their child 25 miles to school each day. The total assistance they receive from the State is £1,500. That situation is grossly out of touch with reality in the Ireland of the new millennium. Cases of that sort, of which there are many, require urgent attention from the Department if we are to build a fair society with the £40 billion to which the Minister and his colleagues have access.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this debate and I congratulate Deputies Jim O'Keeffe and Shatter on tabling the motion. I wish to draw attention to the difficulties, sadness and pressure visited upon carers of those who are mentally ill. The mentally ill and those recovering from mental illness are a particularly vulnerable group. Earlier this month the Report of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals for the year ending 31 December 1998 was published. It outlined the neglect of people who are forced by their illness and the State's response to it to live in institutions, many of which are totally unsuitable for the provision of modern health and caring services. The report states that, because of State neglect, people have died. This is a disgrace.</P>
      <P>In section 1, which outlines an overview of the inspector's findings, it is stated that:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whilst not wishing to intrude on the minutiae of clinical practice, the Inspector felt drug prescribing in some locations is often arbitrary <Col N="1372" /> and made without regard to appropriate clinical diagnosis. The number of patients, particularly long-stay patients, was striking. In some instances the prescriptions had not been reviewed for some considerable time. It is important to review medication at frequent intervals. There appeared to be an increasing number of sudden deaths in psychiatric hospitals, some of which were attributed to drug-related effects.</P>
    <P>This is a disgrace. It is not acceptable that people are dying in such situations and the matter requires immediate investigation. We must examine it and shout &ldquo;stop&rdquo;. The Minister must intervene and establish an investigation into what is happening in our mental institutions.</P>
    <P>The report calls attention to the inadequacy in the provision of community mental health centres, day hospitals and community residential facilities for people with psychiatric disorders. In some hospitals, as many as 50 per cent of the acute psychiatric beds are occupied by persons who do not need such a high level of in-patient care. A major reason for this is the absence of appropriate alternative care. Surely it is unacceptable that in 1999 we deny a quality of life to the mentally ill commensurate with the level of health they enjoy. We treat such people like prisoners. The level of neglect is as much a scandal as any of the others about which we read on a daily basis. It must be highlighted. The Minister and the Department responsible stand indicted. Up to 90 per cent of the people who commit suicide have some form of mental illness. Research shows that current psychiatric patients are ten times more likely to commit suicide than people among the general population. In the four weeks following discharge from a psychiatric hospital, psychiatric patients are between 100 and 200 more time more likely to commit suicide than people in the general population.</P>
    <P>In the report of the National Task Force on Suicide, there was a recommendation that the possibility of suicide should be considered when treating people with mental health problems, in particular there should be pre-discharge assessments of patients leaving in-patient care which should have regard to the high risk of suicide in newly discharged patients. It is recommended that such assessments should be thorough and comprehensive. Nothing has been done to introduce this. The authorities and the Minister do not care.</P>
    <P>The national task force further recommended that steps be taken to make the health service, including mental health services, more acceptable to the public, particularly the young who may perceive them as not being readily available to address their needs in times of crisis. Two years after these recommendations nothing has been done. In 1998, 504 people died by suicide, a 14 per cent increase on the previous year. The State has failed to respond to the young and other people in crisis. That is unacceptable, a disgrace. We must start to care for those people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Jim O'Keeffe for tabling this motion. The Government's national development plan states that people are the country's most important asset. People fail to realise, however, that part of this asset has been ignored and neglected for years. Some of these people cannot speak up for themselves. Those who can have seen their words fall on deaf ears when they did speak up.</P>
      <P>The Tánaiste, at the launch of the national development plan, spoke of the abundance of funds available to the Government, all that was needed was the imagination for how it would be spent. In the current climate, with staff shortages in industry, many disabled people would welcome the opportunity to work.</P>
      <P>I ask the Tánaiste to imagine the situation for Benny, who is blind. With the help of his personal assistant he travelled to Sligo to do a computer course to enable him to avail of employment. Six weeks after the commencement of the course, however, the FÁS funding for the personal assistant ran out and he had no means of transport to connect with the bus to Sligo 15 miles away.</P>
      <P>What do I say to 18 year old Caroline who is in a wheelchair and is seeking a part-time personal assistant so she can get out of the house, socialise with her friends or go to the cinema? How can she live an independent life when she is trapped in her own home? Can the Tánaiste explain to Caroline that funds are available and all that is required is imagination?</P>
      <P>What about the man in a wheelchair who, for six months, had to use a spoon to turn the taps in his own home on and off because he had to wait for an occupational therapist to call and assess before the taps could be changed? What about the elderly wheelchair bound woman who had to be lifted in and out of her home every day over three steps while she waited to be assessed for a ramp? </P>
      <P>The current situation where I, as a health board member, receive as much for attending a health board meeting as my neighbour receives in domicilary care allowance per month for minding her disabled son who requires constant supervision is unacceptable.</P>
      <P>Gone are the days of shoving people with disabilities into dark corners. They are still in the dark corners of the Government's mind, however. Imagination is not the issue, funding is. These people have been ignored for long enough. If the Government requires imagination, it should imagine being in their shoes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Jim O'Keeffe for tabling this motion. I clearly remember last year's pre-budget debate on funding for people with disabilities. It was the most intense and emotional debate I have witnessed in the House since I have been here. This year will be no different. The Government has not yet taken seriously enough its duty toward the huge number of people with disabilities in the community .</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept the Government has made some pro-<Col N="1374" /> gress in the areas of disabilities and carers. That is only the tip of the iceberg. This week we saw the announcement of massive increases in investment and spending by this Government on infrastructure and housing, evidence of just how much money we have at our disposal. We heard talk of giving people equal opportunities, social integration and a fairer society yet we see a miserable increase in the overall spending on the disabilities sector in the Estimates.</P>
    <P>There are an estimated 140,000 people with physical and sensory disabilities who have yet to experience real integration into society from a social, economic or educational perspective on an independent and equal basis to those who do not suffer from disability. There is not even an accurate, official list outlining the number of people with an intellectual disability. We are, however, aware from Government reports that 1,000 people with an intellectual disability live in inappropriate surroundings and thousands more are on waiting lists for essential services such as residential or respite care.</P>
    <P>Government spokespersons have stated many times that they are committed to the recommendations contained in the report &ldquo;Towards an Independent Future&rdquo;. If that is so, why do we not see more evidence of that commitment from a funding point of view? Lack of resources is no longer a valid excuse.</P>
    <P>I will focus on one area &ndash; the right of an individual to live independently and fulfil his or her potential as a human being in the community. The Independent Living Movement has put forward a pre-budget submission which makes a great deal of sense. It proposes that a pure personal assistance service would be provided in a secure way by Government funding to allow as many people as possible to live as independently as possible. It suggests that people with disabilities who need assistance for more than 20 hours a week, referred to as &ldquo;leaders&rdquo;, will be involved in choosing the type of person who will be involved in caring for them. They will also be involved in deciding what tasks they need help with and when they will need help. Assistance in independent living includes assistance with personal and domestic needs, as well as social, educational and work activities. That is why each individual is different in his or her requirements and so must be involved in choosing the tasks where help is needed.</P>
    <P>A proper, pure personal assistance service allows a large number of people with disabilities to do so many things that they cannot currently do by themselves. This is about giving people rights, empowering them to make choices by themselves and live by themselves, not depend on charities or their families, but to live a life by themselves and fulfil their potential. The Government must ensure that as many people as possible are allowed to do that.</P>
    <P>There are many problems in this State that will not be solved by throwing money at them. In the disability sector, however, this is not the case. <Col N="1375" /> Throwing money at this problem will reap ripe rewards.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">

      <P>To delete all words after the word &ldquo;that&rdquo; and to substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann recognises the need for the further development of services to people with disabilities, their families and carers and approves both the Government's commitment to put in place an enhanced level of service provision in line with the commitments outlined in the Programme for Government and Partnership 2000 and the actions taken by the Government to date in meeting these commitments, which include the provision of additional funding of £91.662 million, the putting in place of arrangements to meet the educational needs of children with special needs and the enhancement of the Carers' Allowance.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I wish to share my time with the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern.</P>
      <P>We do people with disabilities a disservice in the context of the debate, as illustrated by the front bench spokesperson of the Fine Gael Party, in introducing this motion &ndash; as distinct from the party's backbenchers who had something constructive to say. On one hand Deputy Jim O'Keeffe comes forward and raises the bar to ensure it cannot be climbed in one go and suggests that illustrates his commitment and that of his party to people with disabilities. Then Deputy Shatter, who, as health spokesperson, one would expect at this stage would understand how the health services are funded, goes round peddling the same untruth he peddled last year in relation to Supplementary Estimates and how we fund our services.</P>
      <P>It insults people's intelligence to suggest that there is £80 million in a pot in the Department of Health and Children which I refuse to spend because I am a scrooge and that this debate will convince me to spend some money on the disability sector. That is the most foolish, stupid and insulting remark that could be made in regard to people with disabilities at this time.</P>

If the buoyancy is 13 per cent, the Exchequer commitment will be 87 per cent. The bottom line is that full allocation on health services and any other area in the Estimates, which is agreed by this House, will be spent.

      <P>With regard to the principles that underpin the development of services for people with disabilities it is important to confirm that it is not just within the health services that improvement is needed for such people. Disability groups insist quite rightly that the health model of disability is not appropriate. People with disabilities wish to live independently with dignity and want equality and we must devise the structures and legislative and institutional frameworks that will allow them to do so on a rights based principle and not on the basis of them being entitled to health services because of their disabilities.</P>
      <P>The need to emphasise their abilities is regarded as the positive framework through which these issues are addressed. That is not a party political point but one which is agreed by everybody in the House. The mainstreaming of services must be achieved to make sure that some gaps in services, to which Deputy Naughten adverted, are addressed not just on an individual basis, but generally. That is the challenge for services in my sector and other sectors that deal with disability issues. I have already stated on the record many times the Government's commitment <i>vis-à-vis</i> previous performance. People are entitled to examine the comparative performances of various Governments on this issue.</P>
      <P>Our amendment states:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>recognises the need for the further development of services to people with disabilities, their families and carers and approves both the Government's commitment to put in place an enhanced level of service provision in line with the commitments outlined in the Programme for Government and Partnership 2000 and the actions taken by the Government to date in <Col N="1377" /> meeting these commitments, which include the provision of additional funding of £91.662 million, the putting in place of arrangements to meet the educational needs of children with special needs and the enhancement of the Carers' Allowance&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>My colleague, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, will deal with the latter issue later.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education and Science earlier this year announced a major initiative in the special education area under which all children in the primary system assessed as having special needs arising from a disability will be entitled to an automatic response to those needs. He considered that this initiative represented a major advance in the education of all children with special educational needs and demonstrated the Government's commitment to the need to provide suitable education for children with special needs.</P>
    <P>A total of £8 million has been allocated over the next two years for teacher and special needs assistant support. The Minister also recently reduced the pupil-teacher ratio in all special schools and classes catering for children with mild or moderate learning disabilities, emotional disturbance or a physical disability. These reductions will decrease the pupil-teacher ratios in all special schools and classes to the level recommended by the special education review committee and represents the full implementation of one of its key recommendations.</P>
    <P>In addition, £3 million has been allocated this year to facilitate the introduction of escorts on all special school transport services and the provision of safety harnesses on such services when required. A further £800,000 has been allocated over the next two years for the purchase of special equipment for children with disabilities. The Minister also extended the remedial teaching service to ensure that all schools at first and second level had access to this service in September. These measures provide concrete evidence of the Government's commitment to ensuring that all children with special needs receive the support they require to enable them to gain maximum benefit from the education system.</P>
    <P>While the National Intellectual Disability Database gives information on services currently provided and the current and future needs of persons with an intellectual disability, there are no definitive statistics in regard to the number of people in Ireland with physical and sensory disabilities. However, we are addressing that. Based on population trends in other countries, it has been estimated that the number could be as high as 200,000. However, not every person with a physical or sensory disability needs a health service. The report, &ldquo;Towards an Independent Future&rdquo;, highlighted the lack of reliable information on the numbers and service needs of people with physical and sensory disabilities and recommended the establishment by the Depart<Col N="1378" /> ment of Health and Children, health boards and voluntary bodies of a database on the health service needs of persons with physical and sensory disabilities.</P>
    <P>The database development committee recommended by the review group is already in place and hopes to complete its work by the end of this year. That will be an important and valued mechanism by which this or any other Government can set out a structured response to the identification of the needs set out in the database. That is the basis on which we have been able to proceed in the intellectual disability area with some success. As a result of the review, it has also been discovered that the programme needs to be accelerated to meet increasing and emerging needs because intellectual database statistics show a different matrix of requirements and services for people who can sometimes move from medium to high dependency. Thankfully, because people live longer, there has been more success in ensuring people experience social and health gains despite their handicaps.</P>
    <P>The important role of the voluntary sector was fully recognised by the review group in looking at the organisation of services. It recommended the structured involvement of the voluntary agencies in the planning and co-ordinating of the services and the setting of priorities for the allocation of funding for the development of the services. It is a participative, not bureaucratic, model which provides an opportunity for people with disabilities to be involved not only in policy formulation or advocacy, but also in the allocation of funds. That is the entire basis upon which the co-ordinating committees have been established.</P>
    <P>In response to Deputy Shatter, wherever management does not meet its responsibility in ensuring that works, I will take issue with it and I have no problem in doing so at any time. It is not acceptable that the mission statements of the committees will not be achieved if there is a lackadaisical approach in any individual instance, whatever the excuse. These committees are working well and there is room for improvement, as there is with every new partnership that is established. This is another example of where social partnership must deliver on the ground for people, particularly those who feel excluded and peripheral to the decision-making processes.</P>
    <P>There have been calls by the Centre for Independent Living for a personal assistance service funded by an &ldquo;Independent Living Fund&rdquo;. A personal assistant provides assistance at the discretion and direction of a person with a disability with everyday tasks, such as personal care, household tasks, etc. which the person is unable to do for himself or herself. A full PA service is defined by the centre as a need for at least 20 hours service per week. The &ldquo;Independent Living Fund&rdquo; is no more than a particular model for funding a PA service. It is important that the service is provided to those needing it. The PA service is one of a range of support services designed to enable people with disabilities to live in the community <Col N="1379" /> with the maximum degree of independence. The range includes home helps, home care attendants, respite care, day care, etc. and the objective of policy is to develop the range of services as a whole. The amount of funding to be devoted to the development of this service will be decided in each health board area in accordance with locally perceived priorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen:</NameTxt>
      <P>I look forward to the Deputy's contribution. As I have already indicated, health boards decide on priorities for the allocation of development funding in consultation with the regional co-ordinating committees for physical and sensory disability services. The Centre for Independent Living is represented on most of the co-ordinating committees. Out of £3 million provided for development of services in 1998, £596,000 was allocated to home support services, of which £190,000 was for personal assistance services. Final figures for 1999 are not yet available, but on the basis of returns currently to hand at least £400,000 has been allocated by health boards for home support services, of which more than £300,000 is for personal assistance services.</P>
      <P>One of the difficulties in developing services for people with physical and sensory disabilities is the wide range and variety of disabilities included in that category. That makes the development of the services complex. From time to time a certain group will mount a campaign for the development of a particular service &ndash;  respite care and personal assistant services are examples. While these and other services are of vital importance and are among the priority areas of development, they cannot be treated in isolation. What is involved is a wide range of interlocking and complementary services, designed to provide the person with a disability with a flexible range of services. Many individuals with disabilities may require a combination of several services to meet their needs.</P>
      <P>Many of the services for people with disabilities are provided by agencies in the voluntary sector. While the State made a substantial contribution to the costs of such services, they were not fully funded by the State. In recent years, with falling income from fundraising, some agencies have been running services at a loss. One of the basic recommendations of the review group was that existing services be put on a firm financial footing in order to provide a sound basis for future development. Within months of coming into office the Government provided, by way of a Supplementary Estimate, £5 million to eliminate the accumulated deficits of these agencies. To help eliminate the on-going underfunding of the services, £2.4 million revenue was provided in 1998 and £6.4 million this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the areas singled out by people with disabilities and their advocates is aids and appliances for people with physical and sensory <Col N="1380" /> disabilities, an idea that emerged from these benches, not from any debate which took place here. Shortly after taking office the Government took an early opportunity to alleviate this problem by making £4.325 million available. It is estimated that more than 10,000 people with disabilities benefited. It was a practical example of what could be done quickly by this incoming Administration. That is not to suggest we have discharged our responsibilities even in relation to that matter as a reply to Deputy Shatter confirmed today. Since then a further £5 million capital funding was made available to health boards for aids and appliances. Despite these substantial injections of funding, health boards are still experiencing difficulty in keeping up with demand for aids and appliances. Consideration is currently being given to the allocation of further additional funding for this purpose.</P>
    <P>In 1997, in addition to the £9.325 million made available for aids and appliances and to eliminate the accumulated deficits of voluntary sector service providers, capital grants totalling £675,000 were given to voluntary sector service providers for the provision of additional respite and long-term residential care places and much more work has to be done.</P>
    <P>In 1998 a total of £8.4 million was allocated to the maintenance and development of services for people with physical and sensory disabilities. Of this, £2.4 million was devoted to eliminating core underfunding of existing services and nine of the main voluntary agencies in the sector received grants for this purpose. A further £3 million was provided for capital projects, of which £1 million was invested in aids and appliances. The balance of £3 million was allocated to health boards for the further development of the services. Almost half of this £3 million was used to create 50 new posts in health boards, such as speech and language therapists, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, social workers and public health nurses.</P>
    <P>This year a total of £13.4 million, rising to £16.4 million in 2000 has been allocated to the maintenance and development of services of people with physical and sensory disabilities. Of this, £6.4 million is for the elimination of underfunding of existing services, £3 million, which increases to £6 million in a full year cost in 2000, is for development and £4 million is for capital developments. A further £2 million capital has been committed this year to a major building project which is being undertaken by Cerebral Palsy Ireland at its premises in Sandymount, which I visited also.</P>
    <P>Since my appointment as Minister, I have consistently identified the ongoing development of services to persons with an intellectual disability and their families as one of my priorities. In addition to allocating significant levels of additional funding to develop new services and to meet identified needs in existing services, I have taken a number of measures to ensure the services are developed in a planned and orderly manner, in line with identified priority needs and <Col N="1381" /> with a secure financial basis for the future. While the additional services which have been put in place have made a significant difference, their impact on the waiting lists has been reduced because of the numbers of emergency admissions which have been and continue to be made to the residential services.</P>
    <P>Given the age profile of clients and carers and the general unavailability of planned respite breaks, I am tackling the expansion of the residential services on three fronts: provision for the management of emergency cases which had not been there before I came to office; provision for new residential places for those who have been assessed as requiring this service and provision for an increase in the level of respite care. I have already begun this process and intend to develop it as additional resources come on stream.</P>
    <P>For the first time ever &ndash; it is unfortunate to have to say this &ndash; the national capital programme for the intellectual disability services commenced in 1997 on a multi-annual basis. The importance of having such a programme available to the services has already been demonstrated in that, in addition to the capital allocated to support new developments, we have been in a position to approve a number of major initiatives designed to provide new or refurbished facilities for people with an intellectual disability accommodated in psychiatric hospitals and other inappropriate placements. For example, in addition to the major developments in St. Ita's, Portrane, initiatives which will benefit persons with an intellectual disability in services in St. Raphael's Youghal, St. Finian's, Killarney, St. Joseph's, Limerick, St. Canice's, Kilkenny, and Kelvin Grove, Carlow, are at various stages of planning or nearing completion.</P>
    <P>I was pleased to be in a position to allocate revenue funding of £12 million in 1999, with a full year cost of £18 million in 2000, for the intellectual disability services. This funding is in addition to the £6 million already allocated to the services in 1999 to meet identified needs in existing services. This brings the total additional revenue funding provided in 1999 for the services to £18 million, with a full year cost of £24 million in 2000. There will also be a budget day package.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the anxiety among families and service providers regarding the future development of services beyond the timeframe outlined in the original assessment of need 1997-2001. While the provision of the additional services outlined in that document will enable the health boards and voluntary agencies to deliver a greatly enhanced level of services to meet the needs of this population group, it is clear from the demographics that an ongoing investment programme will be required in the coming years if we are to provide an appropriate response to the needs of persons with an intellectual disability and their families.</P>
    <P>I addressed this concern both at the NAMHI AGM last April in Galway and again when I met representatives of the Federation of Voluntary <Col N="1382" /> Bodies Providing Services to People with Mental    Handicap, NAMHI and the National Parents and Siblings Alliance last week.</P>
    <P>I reiterated my commitment to the ongoing development of these services and informed those attending the meeting with me last week that it is my intention, subject to Government agreement which I believe will be forthcoming, to have significantly reduced the waiting lists, in addition to having enhanced the level of respite care available, over the next two years.</P>
    <P>The evidence of my commitment to these services is clearly demonstrated by the level of additional funding which I have provided since my appointment as Minister nearly two and half years ago.</P>
    <P>Government policy in the care of older people is to maintain them in their own homes for as long as possible and the home help service has a key role in implementing this policy. There are approximately 11,000 part-time home helps employed throughout the eight health boards and the number of beneficiaries of the home help service throughout the country is around 20,000. Without going into details, the Government will provide in the Estimates additional funding to bring the minimum rate of payment for all home helps up to £3 per hour. Deputy Jim O'Keeffe referred to the background of the scheme. The home help scheme is a good neighbour scheme. At no stage either at £1.20, in the Southern Health Board when the Deputy was in office, or now at £3 is that meant to be the total remunerative value we put on the work of home helps. It is not meant as that type of scheme. It has been provided by the people in the health boards on that basis. We should not underestimate the voluntary nature of the home help scheme while improving the remuneration that people will obtain. I see Deputy Creed shaking his head in disagreement. That is the point. I will ensure they get the national minimum wage &ndash; which Members opposite could not agree on when in Government up to three years ago.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to mental health services we will make substantial commitments in that area. The matter of inappropriate placement, an historical legacy, is being dealt with and there will have to continued progress in that area. The Estimates outline what we will do, not exclusively, because there will also be a budget package and the national development plan which has been explained in some <Col N="1383" /> detail. I wish to hand over to my colleague, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Ahern, to explain the major improvements he has made. It is fair to say that a degree of optimism for the future by people with disabilities, older people and those with mental health problems is justified on the basis of present trends and especially on the basis of the Government's demonstrable commitment to take all possible steps to enhance the quality of life for these population groups in the years ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Government took office in 1997 it promised in An Action Programme for the Millennium to do two things with regard to the carer's allowance. First, we said we would progressively relax the qualifying criteria for the allowance to ensure that more carers got the benefit and, second, we said we would increase the value of the allowance in real terms. We delivered on that commitment.</P>
      <P>In last year's budget I introduced a range of measures at an additional annual cost of over £18 million to improve and develop the position of carers and the carer's allowance. These measures, which were implemented between April and August this year, bring expenditure on the carer's allowance scheme in 1999 to over £60 million, which represents a 33 per cent increase over the £45 million spent in 1998. I believe it is the biggest percentage increase allocated to any scheme in the social welfare code and is probably one of the biggest increases awarded to any other scheme in a similar Department. This increase is reflected in the increasing numbers of carers in receipt of the allowance, which are up over 50 per cent, from 9,200 when we took office to 13,850 carers at the end of October this year. This is a true reflection of the concern and commitment this Government has for carers and the appreciation we have for their valuable role in our society.</P>
      <P>The carer's allowance was introduced in 1990 by my predecessor, the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Woods. A Fianna Fáil/Progressive Democrats Government introduced the payment and in the last budget a Fianna Fáil/Progressive Democrats Government introduced the biggest reform of the allowance. In this respect, no other Government has done as much for carers, but more needs to be done.</P>
      <P>The Government is committed to supporting care in the community to the maximum extent possible. People want to live in their own homes with their families. Families want to be able to care for their loved ones at home. We have a great tradition of family support in this country. Public services could never replace the vital work carried out by families and communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Minister with responsibility for family affairs, I believe the Government must work in partnership with families and support them in every way possible. It was with this in mind that I introduced the range of measures in support of <Col N="1384" /> carers in last year's budget. We extended the carer's allowance scheme to all carers who are caring for someone between the age of 16 and 65, regardless of the source of income of the care recipient. We introduced an annual payment of £200 to all carers in receipt of a qualifying payment to use for respite care. We extended the allowance to include carers who are looking after children in receipt of a domiciliary care allowance from the health boards. My colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, has announced that this allowance will be extended to children under two years of age from 1 January 2000. As Deputy Jim O'Keeffe remarked, we want action, not words. The action is on this side of the House. When the Deputy's party was in Government it did not introduce these measures, although he is calling for them now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister for Health and Children for introducing that much needed change. Consequent on that change, the carer's allowance will also be extended to carers of this group. The cost of this extension is estimated to be in the region of £1 million annually.</P>
      <P>I extended the free travel and the free telephone rental allowance schemes to all people in receipt of the carer's allowance and related payments to help alleviate the isolation felt by carers. I eased the residency and the full-time care rules to include a larger number of carers and to make it easier for carers to engage in therapeutic and economic activity outside the home. These are just a number of the many changes I made last year for carers.</P>
      <P>I also introduced a range of measures worth an additional £20 million annually in last year's budget in support of people with disabilities. These measures, in brief, include the continuation of disability allowance for existing recipients who go into hospital or full-time residential care, the increase of the upper ceiling for entitlement to the qualified adult allowance from £90 to £105 per week, the doubling of the additional income limit which applies under the fuel allowance in the case of invalidity and disablement pensions and the reduction of the age limit for the back to education allowance for people with disabilities from 21 to 18 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My colleagues in Government, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, also brought forward proposals last year to assist carers and people with disabilities. The Government is conscious of this cross-cutting approach and the fact that it is necessary. Most recently, the details of a range of new social inclusion measures in the Government's review of its action programmes were announced and I take this opportunity to reiterate the point that building an inclusive society &ndash; one where everybody feels they belong &ndash; is the key objective of the Government. Following on from the National Economic and Social Council's <Col N="1385" /> call for an increased emphasis on social inclusion, the review of the action programme sets out a range of specific commitments to improve the position of all our people. One of our key commitments is that a co-ordinated approach addressing the needs of carers be established. This will include establishing a new partnership model to facilitate the State, in conjunction with the private sector, to develop an improved system for meeting the costs of long-term care and a pilot system of needs assessment for carers and people needing care.</P>
    <P>In looking towards the longer term, I am delighted to note that Deputy Jim O'Keeffe now accepts the fact that in a number of years we will have a much older population. On many occasions during Question Time both he and his colleagues denied my figures. We will look at the issue of a PRSI benefit arrangement for care recipients, that is, those in need of care as proposed in the review of the carer's allowance completed by my Department. Given that there is a high probability that many of us will need some form of long-term care in the future, such an arrangement could enable care recipients to meet some or all of the costs of their own care. The Government agreed, given the complexity of the issues raised, that this proposal should be pursued at both the policy and operational levels as a separate consultancy project and my Department is progressing this proposal.</P>
    <P>Another issue which I have asked my Department to pursue is the way to assist and ease the pressures on those who are caring and also working full time. A working group has recently been established in my Department to examine the operational details involved in the introduction of a carer's benefit scheme. This would facilitate carers in employment to temporarily leave work to care for somebody at home. To fulfil the Government's commitment on needs assessment, a working group, chaired by the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Moffatt, has been set up to examine the introduction of a needs assessment. The needs assessment would encompass both the needs of the care recipient and the carer and would separate care needs from income support and could be used by all State organisations which provide reliefs or grants to those in need of care.</P>
    <P>Tomorrow I will introduce in the House legislation to establish Comhairle on a statutory basis. This agency will use the combined skills and expertise of the National Social Services Board and the National Rehabilitation Board and will implement a key recommendation of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities. The measures which this Government has undertaken indicate the depth of our support for carers and people with disabilities. When we leave office we will stand on our record with regard to people who care and those with disabilities. It is a record that will stand the test of time. No previous or future Government will meet its standards in this area.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to support the motion. For the second year in a row Opposition Deputies have used Private Members' business to urge the Government to use the opportunity presented by the budget to make a real and substantial difference to the lives of thousands of people throughout the country. Last year the Government's response to our calls was piecemeal. The Government was long on rhetoric but short on action and, most importantly, short on funding. The improvements sought included doubling the number in receipt of the carer's allowance from 11,500 to 23,000. We were told it would have reached 15,000 by this stage but it has not, as the Minister outlined this evening.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. S. Ryan Mr. S. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Another improvement sought was the increase in the carer's allowance to £100. A £3 per week increase was granted for carers under 65 and a £6 increase for those over 66. That was from June 1999. Another request was for the abolition of the means test for full-time carers but that did not happen. Another was to stop regarding the carer's allowance as taxable income but that was not granted. Another was to introduce a carer's benefit for carers who have to give up paid work to care at home but there was nothing for them. Another was to abolish VAT on incontinence pads and other basic care items but no improvement came about. Can we expect something more hopeful and positive in this budget? I sincerely hope so.</P>
      <P>The motion adequately summarises the failure of the Government to tackle the ongoing crisis in funding for carers and people with a disability. That this crisis and lack of resources should continue to this day is a disgrace. Deputies have repeatedly referred to the historic level of revenue flowing into the Exchequer &ndash; the budget surplus will be in excess of £6 billion this year. Never in the history of the State has a Government been graced with such a remarkable financial position. The choice for politics now is how we use the new-found resources available to us. What issues do we treat as priorities? What will we do with our new-found wealth to create a fair and just society as we enter the new century? These are the issues the political system must now face.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We in the Labour Party look forward to this task. Despite the cynicism which prevails in some quarters, we believe politics is entering an exciting, important and challenging time. We have the resources and the opportunity to ensure the principles of justice and equality are made a reality for all people in society. To that end, the Labour Party held two important fora in the past month. <Col N="1387" /> I and my parliamentary colleagues met a wide range of organisations which work on vital social issues. One of the conferences, entitled &ldquo;Promoting Care and Independent Living&rdquo;, addressed the exact issues referred to in the motion.</P>
    <P>I wish to communicate to the three Ministers present the anger and frustration in the voluntary sector with the Government's response to date. At the heart of the motion are the civil rights of people. The lack of funding for social services for carers and people with a mental or physical disability undermines their social rights. It erects obstacles to their participation in society as full and equal members of the community.</P>
    <P>The official response until recently has been based on the concept of charity and that thinking still exists in some quarters. Some of the most vulnerable people in our community are being told to take their place in the queue and not to expect too much too soon. It is an attitude which fundamentally underestimates the injustice which people with disabilities have had to endure since the foundation of the State. The Labour Party wants to fundamentally change this attitude. To this end, my party leader, Deputy Quinn, recently published the text of two constitutional amendments which would expand the definition of citizenship in the Constitution.</P>
    <P>In the context of the motion, these amendments would have significant effects. One amendment would enshrine in the Constitution the right to adequate health care and the right to an adequate standard of living and other means necessary to dignify existence, something which is not in it at present. This amendment would, in effect, place a political and moral obligation on the Government to ensure that the basic requirements of citizens are met. How can a family enjoy a dignified existence if it cannot avail of a respite place for a son or daughter? How can a person with a disability enjoy a dignified existence if they have to join an ever-growing waiting list for some of the most basic aids and appliances? These are issues which can no longer be dealt with on the basis of charity. We must adopt a rights-based approach to the issues of disability and social care. The Labour Party's constitutional amendment is important in this regard.</P>
    <P>In addition, we have proposed an amendment which would, among other things, address the constitutional issues which arose when the original Employment Equality Bill was declared unconstitutional during the lifetime of the previous Government. The Constitution should not place the rights of property owners above the rights of people with disabilities. The Government has side-stepped this issue since coming into office and we are now expected to wait until the disability Bill is published before we know where the Government stands on this issue. This approach is not good enough. The courts have established that, under the Constitution, the rights of property owners come before the rights of people with disabilities. We must amend the <Col N="1388" /> Constitution to put right this matter and we should do so immediately.</P>
    <P>In my role as spokesperson on older persons' issues, I wish to comment on the position regarding carers. Life expectancy has increased due to medical advances and, accordingly, many more people are in need of care. Family carers in the home are expected to provide the bulk of care in this country. It is estimated that there are in excess of 100,000 carers in Ireland and little more than 14,000 are in receipt of the carer's allowance, which despite all the riches available to it last year the Government could only see fit to raise to £76.50 per week.</P>

      <P>This would include the provision of more professional workers such as public health nurses, occupational therapists, physiotherapists, community social workers, care attendants and home helps. A liaison person with each community care area who would assess carers' needs and liaise between carers and the statutory services should also be appointed.</P>
      <P>The forthcoming budget must address the legitimate demands of carers. This includes a substantial increase in the rate of payment of the carers' allowance to £100 per week as stated in the motion. In addition, the stringent means test which applies to carers must be radically reformed or, better still, abolished. Although nearly 80 per cent of carers are women, the means test is based on the household income with the Department insisting on the antiquated notion that a woman enjoys half her partner's income. This is discriminatory. Carers should be assessed individually and they should be provided with the necessary finance to adequately care for their loved ones.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every Member knows the sacrifices carers make in terms of their careers and ambitions to attend to the needs of a sick or dependent loved one. This sacrifice cannot be taken for granted anymore. The State must recognise and take account of the huge savings which accrue to the health budget because family members are prepared to care full time for their relatives and loved ones. These savings should be calculated and channelled back into resources and support for carers. The test of this Minister and this Government will be how they deal with those <Col N="1389" /> people most in need. Carers are providing an invaluable service, the cost of which it would be impossible to quantify. I hope the Minister will respond to their needs and demands.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to deliver my first contribution in the Dáil on the issue of provisions for the people who have been most neglected in our society over the years, namely, people with disabilities, people with a mental illness, older people and the chronically ill. When I decided to enter national politics I made a commitment to this group of people to fight to deliver a decent standard of living for them.</P>
      <P>I hope that, in the lifetime of this Dáil, meaningful investment will be made to improve the lot of those who have waited the longest. I feel a certain sense of futility in making this contribution because I know that come this time tomorrow, the Government and its Independent supporters will vote down this motion. It is the normal practice of the Government of the day to reject Opposition calls but playing politics with a group of people who are living in poverty and inappropriate care is insensitive and uncaring. These people's needs should not become a political football. Now, more than ever, we have a real responsibility to invest in care facilities. We are fast becoming a rich and affluent society but that brings with it a social responsibility to those who do not have the same chances we have to work and live a full life.</P>
      <P>I want to touch on some areas which require substantial investment in order to allow people with disabilities to have the same rights, choices and options as everyone else in society, to ensure that people requiring full-time care are provided for and that the people who administer that care are recognised by the State. The quality of assistance and care which we can provide can have a remarkable impact on the quality of life of the people being cared for. As it stands, we treat carers, personal assistants and home helps as low grade workers. The remuneration they receive is mere tokenism. In the main, personal assistants are employed under the community employment scheme which came under attack earlier this year when the Government attempted to reduce its numbers by 5,000 without having any regard to the valuable work being carried out by participants, such as personal assistants. It is crucial that the Government makes a commitment to fund the work of personal assistants from the Exchequer before the end of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A commitment is contained in Partnership 2000 to provide 5,000 social economy jobs. I believe the case for developing 1,000 of these into personal assistants is crystal clear. Indeed, in the run-up to negotiations on a new national programme, the social partners also have a responsibility to ensure this happens. In terms of home helps, it is nothing short of a disgrace that we are standing over hourly pay rates of less than £3 or £4 for work which would cost the State thousands <Col N="1390" /> of pounds per week if it was carried out in a hospital. Home helps provide an invaluable service. Not only do they cover necessary domestic jobs and care duties but they regularly exceed their role by running errands and providing company for people. They deserve decent remuneration for that.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that 100,000 people currently provide care for family members in their own homes. Their work continues to go unnoticed. The commitment of carers, the sacrifices they make and the expenses they incur in carrying out their work have never been meaningfully addressed. The time has come to change that. If Ireland's carers were to decide to abandon their duties where would we be? Our inadequate hospital and respite facilities simply could not cope. The knock-on cost to the State of providing for every person in need of care would immediately put the Government's national plan on ice. Carers make an invaluable contribution to the economy and to society and that must be recognised. I fully endorse Labour's pre-budget proposal to use the forthcoming budget as an opportunity to initiate the process of abolishing the punitive means test for carers. Furthermore, as with other payments administered by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, the budgetary increase in the carer's allowance should be linked to average earnings.</P>
    <P>Addressing the needs of people requiring care is about much more than assisting those who provide that care. We must invest in a package of supports which would substantially improve the quality of life for people with disabilities, mental illness or long-term illness. I am appalled by the level of supports which this group of people receive.</P>
    <P>During my first week in the Dáil, I met protestors from the Irish Wheelchair Association. I was appalled by the run-down quality of their wheelchairs. They called them tins on wheels, a description which was too glamorous in some cases. Given that people with a physical disability sit in their wheelchairs for at least 12 hours a day, 365 days a year, wheelchairs should undergo rigorous and regular quality testing. The provision of decent wheelchairs and necessary aids and appliances for people with disabilities can make a significant difference to their quality of life. It is time to give them the quality of life they deserve.</P>
    <P>One of the biggest scandals in our society is the manner in which people with a mental handicap, dependent older people and people with mental illness have been treated. The placement of people in unsuitable accommodation continues. Many older people requiring care currently occupy acute beds in our hospitals. People with a mental disability are still being treated in unsuitable institutions. Last year's budget did not do anything serious to improve this situation and I am not convinced there is a will to turn respite and hospital care around this year either.</P>
    <P>All people in need of care should have access to respite care where necessary. No carer should <Col N="1391" /> have to work around the clock on a daily basis. They, too, should have a right to respite care and they should be assured that, when in care, their relatives receive the care and help they require. Capital investment in the provision of respite places is crucial as is the provision of properly trained nursing and medical staff. I am convinced that in the space of two budgets, provisions could be put in place to ensure the provision of resources for those in need of care and assistance. The niggardly approach which this Government has taken to providing for this group of people is, and has been, appalling. It is now time for those who have waited the longest to share in the spoils of our economic growth. It is payback time.</P>
    <P>Carers' ability to continue caring and to cope with life when caring ceases is dependent on them having lives and interests apart from caring. Time off is vitally necessary to enable the carer to develop outside interests, as is a certain level of disposable income. Carers also need to be able to devote time to other members of their families. Breaks from the ongoing pressures of caring and a good night's sleep are basic necessities for carers. Respite of all kinds, in and outside the home, long-term and short-term, emergency respite when the carer is ill and access to suitable day care centres with activity programmes are required. Respite needs should be estimated and provided as part of patient management, not according to the current &ldquo;you might get it if you're lucky&rdquo; approach. Studies show that the health of many carers breaks down because of the stress of caring and that, eventually, carers become frequent users of health services. They do not have a healthy old age because their health resources are used up by spending their middle years caring for others. It would seem to be common sense to support carers in order to maintain their health and ensure that they, in turn, will not require care and become a further drain on the already overburdened services.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very saddened to have to bring this matter to the attention of the House. It relates to Question No. 195 of 6 October wherein I asked the Minister for the Environment and Local Government the number of houses allocated to tenants by various local authorities on a county by county basis, including urban and rural areas; the number of families on the housing lists in these areas and if the Minister would make a statement on the matter. It was a simple question which deserved a simple and careful answer, <Col N="1392" /> particularly at this time. The Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, said</P>
      <P>Details of lettings by local authorities are published in my Department's housing statistics bulletins, copies of which are available in the Oireachtas Library. Details of the results of the assessment of housing needs undertaken by local authorities until the end of March last were released yesterday and are available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether that was contempt for the House, the people on the housing lists or the Member who asked the question. It is no reflection on the Minister of State, Deputy Dan Wallace, who is here to respond to this matter but it is a sad reflection on the Minister of State who deigned to answer a parliamentary question in that fashion. I have been a Member of this House for a number of years, although not as long as the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy. Any Member asking a serious question about a serious issue is entitled to get a detailed and serious answer. Maybe the Minister of State was not prepared to answer the question or was embarrassed by the nature of the reply, but that is not my problem.</P>
      <P>I listened with interest to the Minister of State today while he indicated to the Opposition that two and half years ago, it was responsible. Two and a half years before that, he and his former colleagues were responsible. Be that as it may, whoever is responsible at this time needs to recognise that the number of people who require housing, as a matter of urgency, is serious. All the billions in the national development plan and the grandiose notions in the world will do nothing in terms of embellishing the issue.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State, in his reply to the parliamentary question, did not fully realise the serious nature of the issue as far as those in need of housing are concerned. I am not talking only about people who are unemployed but also about people who are employed, who have reasonably good jobs &ndash; public service and private sector jobs &ndash; and who have a reasonably high income but who have no chance of obtaining a house in the foreseeable future. I would have thought given that background and that the Minister of State has spent the past two and half years looking at the issue, but never dealing with the problem, he would have had the manners to come to the House tonight to respond to the matter because that is what he should have done.</P>
      <P>If the Minister is really serious about the issue he should look at it again and ask himself whether he should have answered the question in the first instance. There is a growing tendency among some Ministers to try to avoid answering parliamentary questions and to answer them in such a way as to consider it smart to have got away with the answer. There is no smart way to get away without answering a parliamentary question. History should sufficiently illustrate that to all and sundry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace):</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Durkan for raising this matter and apologise for the unavoidable absence of the Minister. As the Deputy outlined, the question asked was as follows:</P>
      <P>To ask the Minister for the Environment and Local Government the number of houses allocated to tenants by the various local authorities on a county by county basis, including urban as well as rural areas; the number of families on the housing waiting list in these areas; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
      <P>In the reply to the question, the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, informed the Deputy that details of lettings by local authorities were published in the Department's housing statistics bulletins and, in relation to matters relating to housing needs, that details of the results of the assessment undertaken by local authorities at the end of March last had been released on the previous day and that the entire assessment had been placed in the Library for the information of Deputies.</P>
      <P>It is a long established practice in the Department, when replying to questions requesting detailed statistical information, to refer in the replies to published documents or sources of information available in the Library. Of course, in any case where statistical information is sought which is available in the Department and has not already been published the Department will, where sufficient time is available, compile the necessary information and will include it in the reply.</P>
      <P>The Department's housing statistics bulletins are published on a quarterly basis and contain a vast amount of information on housing matters, including housing output, housing mortgage finance, house prices, activity under the various social housing schemes and progress on local authority housing programmes. The published results of the assessment of housing needs contained a detailed commentary on the results of the assessment as well as background information on the undertaking of the assessment and six tables which set out the detailed results of the assessment. The information, therefore, which was placed in the Library was very comprehensive and would be of great assistance to any Deputy consulting the material.</P>
      <P>The practice of referring in a reply to parliamentary question to extensive and detailed information published by the Department and placed in the Library is wholly appropriate. I reiterate that my colleagues and I will always endeavour to make available in replies any unpublished data which is available to my Department. It will remain the practice to include in replies published data which are relatively brief and germane to the issue raised in the question.</P>

      <P>
        <i> (Mayo)</i>
        <b>:</b> I thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for choosing this matter on <Col N="1394" /> the Adjournment this evening. The decision by gardaí to refuse to work the new £55 million PULSE computer system from midnight last night represents yet another crisis which might well have been averted had action and intervention by the Minister and his Department occurred at an earlier stage. Unfortunately, they did not act and the result is that we are now at an impasse where 1,400 state of the art computer terminals which should be fully functioning at Garda stations this morning are lying idle. This was the equipment that was going to be a vital instrument in the collection and accessing of files on criminal records, car registrations and firearms.</P>
      <P>This system was not devised yesterday or today. It is three and a half years since the former Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, announced the introduction of the PULSE technology and made £20 million available. The idea was that full training would be provided for gardaí using the system and that the system would be fully operational early in 1999. Apart from the updating of resources to fight crime, the danger that the existing system would be caused to malfunction by the Y2K bug was also a major consideration. While all kinds of assurances are being given by the Minister that normal policing is not affected, we are witnessing yet another in the long litany of debacles that have characterised this Minister's term of office.</P>
      <P>What I cannot understand is how the crisis was not foreseen and forestalled. I cannot understand how the PULSE issue could not have been factored into the wage negotiations which have already taken place between the Garda representatives on the one hand and the Minister and his officials on the other. The two day &ldquo;blue 'flu&rdquo; in 1998 led to negotiations which eventually yielded a 9% increase in Garda pay. Why was the PULSE issue not sorted out as part of those negotiations? That was 18 months ago. Had the new system been included in the negotiations, today's stand-off need never have happened. Why was no attempt made to try to have the issue included in the recent offer of a 4.4% increase, albeit rejected? Why was it not dealt with during the long training and installation period? Why was it allowed to drag on to the eleventh hour so that today the screens of the new expensive computers which should be supplying vital crime data are blank?</P>
      <P>Contrast this to the AFIS, automated fingerprinting system, introduced by the former Minister, Deputy Owen. It is a phenomenal success reducing the reading time for identifying fingerprints from 500 hours to a mere ten minutes. There was no industrial relations hitch because proper discussions and negotiations took place, and in good time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Instead of meaningful and early discussions, we awoke this morning to learn from news bulletins that talks were still at the talks about talks stage. An offer of formal talks with the gardaí was still being considered by the Department. The Mini<Col N="1395" /> ster of State should convey to the Minister that he is responsible for the operation of the different sections of his Department. His officials, on his instructions, should have sat down at an early stage and resolved whatever difficulties were likely to arise but, unfortunately, this did not happen. The result is that instead of officially switching on the new system last night, the Minister has his representative here this evening answering questions and giving excuses why £55 million of taxpayers' technology lies paralysed and an old outdated system is still in use. There could well be court disruption also if gardaí are unable to provide judges with defendants' previous criminal records.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State should tell the Minister that the past two weeks have been bad for the criminal justice system, with three bank raids, two unopened prisons, two prison suicides, court cases collapsing because of wrong charges or shoddy preparation. That is simply not acceptable, but unfortunately this week promises to be no better.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Miss M. Wallace):</NameTxt>
      <P>PULSE, an acronym for Police Using Leading Systems Effectively, is the main implementation vehicle for the information technology plan of the Garda Síochána. The PULSE project seeks to replace many manual and paper-based methods of operations with an integrated suite of 17 computer systems that will provide significant operational benefits for the force. The 17 PULSE systems relate to incident response, general inquiry, firearms, intelligence, property, incident analysis, summons, charges, bail, prisoner logs, court outcomes, dispatch, alarms, warrants, road traffic accident document production, traffic accident analysis and juvenile liaison.</P>
      <P>Once fully developed, the systems will computerise all aspects of the aforementioned operational areas. All data generated within these functions by gardaí on the beat will ultimately be inputted directly into the PULSE systems from Garda stations, and, conversely, data inquiries will be made directly from Garda stations. This point-of-generation data input will ensure that PULSE systems will always contain up-to-date information within these 17 operational areas.</P>
      <P>The critical year 2000 compliance component of the PULSE project, namely, the so-called Release 1b, replaces the existing non-Y2K compliant Garda mainframe systems. Release 1b includes systems for incident response, interim court outcomes, firearms, vehicle registration, general inquiries, photographs, property and incident analysis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Release 1b went live at midnight on 15 November. There really was no option but to go live on this date, as the existing mainframe computers were in danger of collapse at any time due to <Col N="1396" /> their Y2K deficiencies and it was therefore imperative to secure Garda records by transferring them to the Y2K compliant platform lest they be lost.</P>
    <P>Data conversion from the mainframe systems to the PULSE platform had been proceeding since 15 October and the new PULSE databases were successfully populated with criminal intelligence data by the scheduled completion date of midnight on 15 November. In effect, gardaí now have operationally ready Y2K-compliant PULSE systems available at 29 sites. These systems provide an equivalent degree of functionality as existing systems, with expanding capability thereafter. However, members of the Garda Representative Association and the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors have indicated that they will not operate PULSE systems pending the resolution of their outstanding pay claims. As a consequence, gardaí may have to operate fallback, paper-based, manual procedures.</P>

      <P>This would mean that newly created data would continue to be collected in paper form and would be available for entry on PULSE systems when the industrial relations difficulties are resolved. In general, the impact on policing of having to revert to manual systems would be to slow the recording and retrieval of data. It should be stressed, however, that essential policing services will continue to be provided and no particular impact is anticipated on the wider criminal justice system.</P>

      <P>On the industrial relations question, I understand that the GRA asked for discussions with the official side on the Garda pay issue and those discussions commenced this afternoon. It should be made clear, however, that the Government's position is that there cannot be further money on the table, as the question of Garda pay has already been the subject of recommendations by the adjudication board which was established to resolve PCW claims. In any event, the Government is satisfied that essential policing services will continue to be provided, despite the current industrial relations difficulties, which, as with all such situations, I hope to see resolved as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>Speaking in the Dáil in November 1995, the then Fianna Fáil spokesperson on Justice, Deputy O'Donoghue, said that the status of refugees was an issue which should strike a chord with every man, woman and child here who has <Col N="1397" /> any grasp of Irish history, as Irish history books were littered with the names and deeds of those driven from our country by fear of prosecution.</P>
      <P>The same Deputy is now the Minister who must take primary responsibility for a policy on dealing with asylum seekers which has accurately been described by the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy O'Donnell, as a doom-laden, <i>ad hoc</i> policy, as chaos and a shambles.</P>
      <P>The Irish are a predominantly humane and tolerant people and the great majority have been shocked, not just by the appalling scenes we witnessed at the Refugee Applications Centre in Mount Street in the past two weeks, but also at the increasingly harsh and intolerant tones that have come to characterise public pronouncements on this issue by senior Government Ministers. No matter what a person's economic status, nationality, skin colour or ethnic background is, that person is entitled to be treated by the institutions of this State with courtesy, respect and dignity. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has failed to ensure that asylum seekers in this State are treated in an acceptable manner.</P>
      <P>I do not blame the staff at the Refugee Applications Centre, who have been working in intolerable conditions for some time. In many respects, the staff's decision to take action finally forced the Minister to move to acquire additional accommodation as well as extra space and staff.</P>
      <P>However, the Minister must take responsibility for allowing last week's situation to develop. It besmirched the good name of this country. He has been in office since July 1997 and it is time he stopped blaming the previous Administration and accepted that he has failed utterly to do what is needed after two and a half years in office, promising he would deal with delays in processing asylum applications. We have had the appalling spectacle of men, women and children queuing from as early as 5 a.m. They queue for hours with nowhere to sit, no shelter from the weather and without even the most basic toilet facilities. They queue for hours only to be turned away and told no service is to be available at the office. If those scenes were not bad enough, the atmosphere has been further inflamed by a series of harsh and intolerant pronouncements by Government Ministers. In a phrase that would be music to the minority of racists in the country, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform talked on RTE of the country being swamped by asylum seekers. Last night the Minister for Finance suggested the problem had been solved in June and July and blamed the Government decision to allow employers to seek permits to employ some asylum seekers for acting as a pull to bring more asylum seekers into the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the Government decision in July, just 15 work permits have been issued for the thousands of asylum seekers here. The Government is <Col N="1398" /> clearly divided on the issue. As the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, acknowledged, Government policy is a shambles, but far from trying to deal with the problem identified by her, senior Fianna Fáil Ministers have, on television, poured scorn on her. Surprisingly &ndash; or perhaps not &ndash; the Tánaiste has failed to come to the defence of her colleague and has implicitly taken the side of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Immigration into this country from outside the EU is a fact of life with which we will have to live. We have two choices &ndash; we can see it, as the Minister does, as a problem to be dealt with through restrictions, harsh measures, legal sanctions and deportations or as a potentially positive development which provides us with an opportunity to promote diversity in Irish society and to meet the labour shortages already identified. The most immediate priority should be to put in place facilities that will ensure that all applicants are dealt with promptly and efficiently. That is the demand of the people of Ireland to which the Minister and the Government must respond without further delay.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace:</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that the situation which has obtained in the Refugee Applications Centre for the past number of weeks and in particular the past week is not satisfactory. In so far as this Department is concerned a full service has been provided for all applicants at all times. The difficulties arose as a result of the Eastern Health Board being unable to provide an adequate response to demands for services from clients. Additional staff, accommodation and extended outreach clinics are being put in place by the Eastern Health Board and these measures should solve the current problem. Already six clinics are in operation and it is hoped to more than double this number. Approximately 160 people visited the Eastern Health Board at the centre today and all have been accommodated.</P>
      <P>The numbers applying for asylum during 1999 increased from 234 in January to 453 in June but jumped dramatically from 571 in July to 962 in August and 938 in September and over 1,000 in October. Nobody could have possibly predicted and it is unrealistic to think that any Department or indeed Government could have foreseen such an unprecedented increase in numbers. It is no coincidence that the recent announcement on entitlement to work, which the Minister believes has been deliberately misinterpreted abroad by those trafficking in asylum seekers as a general entitlement, is a factor which may have influenced the current rate of arrivals. That, together with the public debate concerning the introduction in the UK early next year of providing for asylum seekers' needs by direct provision with minimal cash rather than cash based welfare benefits has clearly contributed to the current increase in applicants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1399" /> As I have stated, in so far as my Department is concerned, a full service has been provided for all applicants at all times. The measures introduced in early 1998 had begun to produce results with the task force dealing with new and old applications simultaneously. At the rate of progress in relation to processing cases at first instance based on application figures up to July of this year, it was intended that the task force would have dealt with the entire backlog of applications by July 2000 and from that date would be processing applications within weeks of arrival. The target was to reach a stage where an applicant would be interviewed within weeks of arrival, notified of the decision as soon as possible thereafter so that an applicant would complete the entire application process in six to seven months. Because of the dramatic increase in new applications in recent months, additional resources will be needed to achieve this target. The Minister will not be found wanting in providing those resources, as he has not been found wanting since entering office.</P>
    <P>From May 1998, the starting point from which we began to fully address the backlog, to 31 October 1999 a total of 6,332 interviews were scheduled from which 4,113 interviews were completed. During this period there were 1,794 persons who did not attend for interview and 2,000 were deemed abandoned for a number of reasons. My Department's officials are committed to processing applications for refugee status in accordance with our international obligations and domestic rules and procedures with a view to providing the best possible service for all applicants. Applicants for asylum are treated with courtesy and professionalism by all members of staff from reception to the final stage of the process. All staff working in the asylum division, including the reception and interviewing personnel, have completed appropriate training courses and have received on the job experience of interviews and assessments. The training programmes were agreed with the UNHCR and delivered by a combination of this Department's own experienced personnel, UNHCR training specialists and the UNHCR's full-time official here and includes the necessary training for dealing with sensitive matters such as gender issues and victims of trauma and violence.</P>
    <P>The significant increase in the number of persons applying for refugee status has given rise to a very acute shortage of accommodation. The Eastern Health Board refugee unit has, as I outlined, put a number of measures in place to address this problem and the Government has accordingly decided that asylum seekers should be dispersed to locations around the country. At its meeting on 9 November the Government again considered the situation which has arisen as a result of the unprecedented increase in asylum <Col N="1400" /> applications. The Government decided that a central directorate unit should be established immediately to deal with matters relating to the dispersal of asylum seekers throughout the country and the preparation of plans for a system of direct provision of housing and welfare needs of applicants. My Department is now faced with new challenges and the Government is fully supportive of the resources required to meet these challenges. In relation to immigration policy and a review of same, I must state that the immigration policy and procedures operated by my Department are summarised in a series of public information leaflets, which I recently placed in the Oireachtas Library for the information of Deputies.</P>
    <P>As I have indicated in the past, the Minister is prepared to consider new arrangements, including a quota system to facilitate immigration to Ireland to alleviate labour shortages. The press statement which was issued to announce the Government's decision allowing a certain group of asylum seekers to work also stated that we would issue visas on a limited basis to persons from non-EU countries to enable them to take up unfilled employment opportunities in Ireland and that the interdepartmental committee on immigration matters would be reconvened to decide the precise methodology to apply to the new arrangements. However, when the matter was discussed at the interdepartmental committee, I understand that the prevailing view was that the existing work permit system was operating well and responding satisfactorily to the emerging labour market needs of the economy. The position continues to be that the Minister is open to considering any proposed change to present arrangements.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny)</i>
        <b>:</b> Táim an-bhuíoch go bhfuil deis tugtha dom labhairt ar an ábhar tábhachtach seo. The introduction to my contribution has to be &ldquo;cead míle fáilte, how are you?&rdquo; On 14 October, three guests invited to a wedding in Carlow arrived by car at Dún Laoghaire port. The driver and owner of the car was a native Dubliner and her two pals were natives of Ghana. All three were coming to Carlow to attend the wedding of their colleague of seven years' standing in England. The car in which they travelled was the only one of about eight cars coming to the wedding which was stopped. Despite the fact the two ladies from Ghana had their driving licences, bank cards and wedding invitations, they were not allowed enter the country. The Dubliner contacted her mother who arrived with a friend and both were willing to go guarantor for the genuine status of the wedding guests. However, there was no budging.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One immigration official suggested they be let <Col N="1401" /> through but the other, whom I presume was his superior, said no. They were allowed to hand over their wedding presents to the mother and having spent two hours in a cold portakabin without even the comfort of a cup of tea, they left our shores with the phrase &ldquo;Ireland of the welcomes&rdquo; flashing before their eyes. The fact that one of them had visited Ireland six months previously, coming through Dublin Airport, did not soften the blow to her pride.</P>
    <P>Why did an official under the Minister's control show such utter disregard to visitors who were also British citizens and clearly genuine guests invited to a wedding in Carlow and why did he go beyond the call of duty in deciding they were dangerous and should be kept out of the country? At a time when there is uproar about the way asylum seekers and others are being treated, it is time we reviewed our attitude towards people of a different colour when, as in this case, their credentials are beyond question. In view of the fact that for many years, Irish and Ghanaian troops worked together in the Lebanon, it is poor that we have a different attitude at home to that displayed by the gallant members of our Defence Forces who help keep the peace in other lands.</P>
    <P>There is a <i>prima facie</i> case that these women from Ghana were drummed out of the country because of the colour of their skin, which would amount to blatant racism. It is possible the Minister can rebut this charge. However, in the absence of a credible explanation, the Minister and his officials stand indicted. I look forward to his reply and I hope it will offer an apology to our visitors who were so badly treated and also to the bride and her family who were humiliated by the way their invited guests were insulted and belittled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace:</NameTxt>
      <P>In the absence of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, I will respond on his behalf to the matter raised by the Deputy and clarify the legal position with regard to persons arriving in the State from within the common travel area between Ireland and the UK.</P>
      <P>The provisions of the common travel area are for the benefit of Irish and UK nationals only. Other persons availing of it require a passport or national identification if they are EU nationals and a visa if required. Arising from growing evidence that the common travel area was being abused by persons who were not entitled to avail of it, an amendment was made to the Aliens Orders in June 1997 by the then Government, which included the Deputy's party, which gave immigration officers the power to carry out the same checks on persons arriving in the State from the UK as for persons arriving from outside the common travel area. These checks are carried out by immigration officers who are members of the Garda Síochána and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has no formal role in a decision taken in any particular case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1402" /> I am informed that the Garda authorities have issued instructions to their members that the checks are to be carried out in a courteous manner with as little inconvenience to genuine travellers as possible. While recognising the difficulties faced by immigration officers, who are members of the Garda Síochána, in carrying out their work, I would be concerned generally to ensure that there should not be any occasion where immigration controls would be exercised in an unreasonably discriminatory fashion or without an acceptable level of courtesy. As members of the Garda Síochána, immigration officers are subject to the normal Garda regulations governing conduct and application to duty. It is, therefore, open to a person who is dissatisfied with treatment by an immigration officer to make a complaint to the Garda Síochána Complaints Board under the provisions of the Garda Síochána (Complaints) Act, 1986.</P>
    <P>As I said, the Minister has no formal role in the decision taken in any particular case, but I understand that in this instance the two persons in question arrived in the State at Dublin Port on a car ferry from Holyhead. The Garda immigration officer formed the conclusion that the persons in question were Ghanaian nationals and as such should both have been in possession of passports as well as valid entry visas for Ireland. As they had neither passports nor visas, they did not, therefore, qualify for entry and it was in order to refuse them leave to land. The persons were, I understand, served with a notice of refusal of leave to land by the immigration officer, which includes a statement of the reasons for the refusal of entry.</P>
    <P>Possession of residency permission in the UK does not exempt a person from the requirement to carry a passport when travelling to Ireland nor does it in itself exempt visa required nationals from the visa requirement, although a visit visa would generally be readily granted to a person with long-term legal residence in the UK. While I appreciate that the refusal of entry must have been a disappointment for the two women as well as their friends, these matters could have been clarified prior to travelling with either the Irish Embassy in London or the Department in Dublin.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace:</NameTxt>
      <P>It would also be open to a person refused entry on these grounds to return to the State with the necessary documents and provided an immigration officer had no other concerns, they would then be admitted to the State. I understand that the persons in question were advised accordingly by the immigration officer dealing with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could not accept that the application of normal immigration regulations on the part of an immigration officer is in any way unreasonable, nor that these controls amount to racism. Exam<Col N="1403" /> ination of the nationalities of those persons refused entry to the State from the UK reveals a much broader range of nationalities than one would expect if these controls were informed by racial bias.</P>
    <P>While the 1997 change in the law does not impose a requirement on either UK or Irish citizens travelling between the UK and Ireland to <Col N="1404" /> carry or present a passport, travellers who are concerned at the possibility of being questioned as to their entitlement to use the common travel area may wish to carry with them some evidence of identity and nationality which will make the work of the immigration officers easier and ensure that the traveller's journey is not unduly delayed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 38, 68 and 74 together.</P>
      <P>County-city development boards are scheduled to be established in each county council and county borough corporation area early next year. Directors of community and enterprise for these bodies have been recruited and are making the necessary arrangements for their establishment. The setting up of CDBs was recommended in the report of the interdepartmental task force on the integration of local government and local development systems, which has been endorsed by Government.</P>
      <P>The CDBs will see local government and local development agencies &ndash; area partnerships, Leader groups and county-city enterprise boards &ndash; together with the social partners and public agencies operating locally, come together to draw up and implement a strategy for economic, social and cultural development. The strategy will be the framework for public services and local development in each county and city area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Social inclusion and community development generally will be a particularly important focus for the CDBs. This is underlined by the make up of the CDBs which includes agencies such as local authorities, local development bodies and health boards which are involved in these areas. As regards community development generally, the CDB process will see a move towards local authority area committees being expanded to include representatives of the wider community and local development bodies when dealing with community development. This will give local people <Col N="1406" /> a real say in local decision making on community matters.</P>
    <P>As part of the ongoing programme of local government renewal local authorities themselves will expand their involvement in tackling social exclusion. For example, where local development bodies with a focus on social inclusion do not exist, this role will be fulfilled by local authorities. Local government is already involved in a wide range of policies and initiatives dealing with social inclusion and in many cases in partnership with relevant interests, for example, local drugs task forces, the integrated services process, the young people's facilities and services fund. This trend will continue to grow, and local authorities will play an increasing role in the context of the national anti-poverty strategy, counteracting social exclusion and poverty in a strategic way at local level.</P>
    <P>The success of the county-city development boards will be a major challenge and opportunity for all the local participants, including the local authorities. Implementation of the task force's recommendations will give local authorities a wider role and will provide the framework under which consideration can be given to an evolving role for local government with a wider range of functions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 39, 45 and 60 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am currently considering the housing starts allocations for the four year multi-annual local authority housing programme and I will be shortly determining and notifying allocations to individual authorities. I propose to allocate the 22,000 starts available under the multi-annual programme to local authorities having regard to the results of the recent assessment of housing needs and the capacity of authorities to deliver <Col N="1407" /> the housing required to meet their needs. In this regard, local authorities were asked to indicate what level of a programme they felt they would need and be capable of implementing and I will also consider their responses in determining the allocations.</P>
    <P>I will be advising authorities to implement a continuous programme of output over the next four years so as to produce a streamlined delivery of housing thereby providing a better and more effective mechanism of social housing delivery. Authorities will be advised to front load the programme as far as possible to meet housing needs as quickly as possible. Programmes for individual years will be developed and agreed with individual authorities and this will secure the funding for each authority's programme. In order to emphasise the need to accelerate local authority output over the next four years my Department held a series of regional workshops recently with key personnel in local authorities and it has been emphasised that my Department will co-operate in every way in helping them meet their housing programmes.</P>
    <P>The current indications are that the level of housing starts achieved by authorities so far this year is similar to the position at this time last year and the great majority of local authorities should reach their targets of starts by the end of the year. However, it is apparent to me that a limited number of authorities, mostly urban authorities, will not reach their targets of starts. I have accordingly written to the relevant managers to express my concern over the lack of progress being made in implementing their programmes and I have asked for reports to be sent to me which I will examine before determining the allocations. My Department is prepared to consider requests for additional starts from authorities where there is an identified need and their current programmes are well advanced but I am not pressed with such requests. I will continue to urge authorities to ensure maximum output is achieved in the current year. I expect that the local authority housing programme will complete 3,700 houses in the current year and that over 4,000 starts will actually commence this year. Any starts which have not commenced by end of year will commence early in the new year and will not be lost to the programme.</P>
    <P>I am very conscious of the increased level of social housing need and priority is being given in tackling this need. The local authority programme is the major contributor to social housing output. I expect that taken with the output from the complementary social-voluntary housing measures, and vacancies occurring in the existing housing stock the housing needs of some 9,800 households will be catered for in 1999 and that the increased social housing output over the next four years will meet the needs of over 50,000 households.</P>

      <P>Some 1,193 applications for gratuities under the local authority members (gratuity) scheme, 1998, were received by local authorities in respect of eligible persons. This figure includes 155 applications in respect of dual members, that is, people who held membership of a county council and an urban town authority, and 70 in respect of former members who had retired or died since the previous local elections.</P>
      <P>The number of persons who qualified for the gratuity was 487. The total cost of the scheme was £5.23 million.</P>
      <P>No specific amount of money was set aside to finance the scheme. It was not possible to estimate what the scheme would cost in the immediate aftermath of the closing date for applications since most of those members who applied had not decided whether they would retire at the June 1999 local elections or not. Had all those who applied actually qualified for gratuities the total cost would have been in the region of £11.3 million.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 42, 67, 81 and 92 together.</P>
      <P>Some 94,900 applicants are at present awaiting driving tests. Of these, approximately 32,000 have been given test appointments and a further 14,000 have indicated that they are not currently available to be tested. Some 29,000 of the 94,900 applicants are awaiting tests in the Dublin area. The longest waiting times in the Dublin area are 59 weeks in the Finglas-Raheny centre and 47 weeks in the Churchtown-Rathgar-Tallaght centre. The average longest waiting time nationally is some 29 weeks. However, applicants who require a test for urgent reasons are being given earlier appointments: about 25 per cent of applicants are tested within 15 weeks. Average waiting times have not been compiled for each centre due to limitations in the IT systems involved.</P>
      <P>Applications for driving tests are now running at more than a third above earlier levels, driven by exceptional conditions of economic growth. In 1998 an all time record of 146,000 test applications were made to my Department and applications in 1999 are running at an even higher level.</P>
      <P>Significant additional resources have been allocated to the driver testing service, which now numbers 101 testers compared to 66 in 1998. Together with recent productivity agreements and Saturday working, this has increased the testing capacity of the service by over 90,000 tests to some 202,000 tests annually. Two new test centres have been provided in Tallaght and Raheny.</P>
      <P>As I have indicated in replies to previous questions, I am determined to bring progressive and substantial improvement to the quality of the driving test service provided for the public; and in particular to end present excessive and unacceptable waiting times: a maximum waiting period of ten weeks is being targeted by the end of next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The priority at present is to improve the driving test service to acceptable quality standards on the basis of the measures outlined, rather than to introduce a new driving test system. However, it is intended to introduce a driving theory test, sep<Col N="1410" /> arate from the driving test, in 2000 on a PPP basis. Some minor additional elements will also be introduced to the driving test from 3 April 2000 on the basis of the Road Traffic (Licensing of Drivers) Regulations, 1999, which I have recently made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 44, 53, 65 and 96 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The DTI strategy, which was published in 1995 with a planning horizon to 2011, provides the framework for a wide range of initiatives to respond to Dublin's transportation needs. These include major infrastructural projects such as Luas, the Dublin Port tunnel and completion of the Dublin C-ring, other improvements in public <Col N="1411" /> transport, such as quality bus corridors; and traffic and parking management measures. Progress with the construction and planning of these infrastructural projects is indicated in work being undertaken on the DART extensions and the southern cross motorway, and ministerial approvals to the Tallaght-Abbey Street and Sandyford-St. Stephen's Green links of the Luas and to the south-eastern and northern motorways. By the end of 2000, it is estimated that more than £500 million will have been invested in Dublin transport management and infrastructure within the DTI framework. Under the national development plan, which has just been published, over £3 billion is provided to continue DTI &ndash; related funding through the period 2000 to 2006.</P>
    <P>The DTO short-term action plan, published in September 1998, is designed to advance and accelerate a set of measures consistent with the DTI strategy which can be completed in the period to end 2000. Detailed objectives include completion of 12 QBCs and 180 kms of cycle tracks by the end of 2000, provision by the end of 1999 of an additional 150 buses by Dublin Bus at a cost of £26 million, additional rolling stock for the DART, the lengthening of outer suburban and key DART station platforms, and the upgrading by the end of 2000 of the Maynooth-Clonsilla rail line.</P>
    <P>Good progress is being made with implementation of the short-term action plan. For example, the programme of platform lengthening has commenced, contracts have been entered into for the additional DART rolling stock, work is proceeding on the planning, design and implementation of the QBC network with three QBCs now in operation, and 132 of the new buses have already been delivered, of which 102 are in service. Moreover, the increased bus capacity now available is enabling the provision of significantly enhanced bus services along the three QBC routes. This capacity will be further augmented as more buses become available in the coming months.</P>
    <P>The development of quality bus corridors and park and ride facilities are important elements within the framework of the DTI strategy and the DTO short-term action plan. Three QBCs have already been completed and results from the Lucan and Malahide QBCs, which have been in operation for some time, indicate an overall increase in total person trips, a considerable reduction in bus journey times, and an increase in bus passengers of between 15 per cent and 20 per cent on the routes. Preliminary results for the Stillorgan QBC indicate that bus patronage on this corridor has more than doubled in the short time since the QBC became operational.</P>
    <P>In addition, the provision of park and ride facilities is being encouraged by the inclusion of a tax incentive regime in the Finance Act, 1999, aimed at encouraging the participation of the private sector in the development of park and ride facilities, and also by the provision of £2 million in the 1999 budget for the development of <Col N="1412" /> such facilities in the Dublin area. This funding is being used for the development of new and the upgrading of existing, mainly rail-based, park and ride facilities. I recently published guidelines on the development of park and ride facilities setting out criteria and requirements for developers to avail of the tax incentives provided in the Finance Act, 1999.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Transportation Blueprint 2000-2006 was published by the DTO in September 1999 to assist the preparation of the national development plan. The contribution of the blueprint to the NDP process has been valuable and all of its significant elements are now endorsed by the NDP.</P>

      <P>The rate at which asylum seekers are entering the country has escalated significantly in recent months and the supply of accommodation available for asylum seekers in the Dublin area is now virtually exhausted.</P>
      <P>An advertisement was placed in the national and local newspapers by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform seeking offers of accommodation and there has been a significant response offering a wide variety of accommodation. My Department has sent details of these responses to each county and city manager requesting that the premises offering the greater level of accommodation be vetted as to their suitability as a matter of great urgency and to establish, in particular, that premises meet with appropriate fire precautions. Local authorities themselves have identified some premises at local level which may be suitable and these will now be vetted.</P>
      <P>At its meeting on 9 November, the Government considered the serious situation which has arisen as a result of the unprecedented increase in asylum applications. The Government decided, <i>inter alia,</i> that a central directorate be established immediately under the aegis of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to deal with matters relating to the dispersal of asylum seekers throughout the country and preparation of plans for a system of direct provision of accommodation, welfare needs, etc. Reports on the assessments from the local authorities are to be forwarded to this central directorate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The central directorate will liase with local authorities and health boards in identifying suitable accommodation for asylum seekers. It will also decide on the location and specific accommodation to which asylum seekers are to be dispersed. Local authorities will meet the cost of <Col N="1413" /> accommodation under the homeless persons provisions and these costs will be recouped in full by my Department.</P>

      <P>The primary purpose of bus lanes and quality bus corridors is to support the improved operation of public transport services and thereby to benefit road traffic conditions generally.  Accordingly full access to these facilities is at present limited to buses, with taxis and pedal cycles being permitted access to &ldquo;with flow&rdquo; bus lanes.</P>
      <P>Current regulations also provide for the non-application of bus lane restrictions to certain vehicles, including Garda, ambulance and fire service vehicles and vehicles used in connection with roadworks or other operations designed to assist traffic management. It would not be practicable to provide a wider exemption of this kind for public utility vehicles more generally.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 49, 52 and 296 together.</P>
      <P>The Dublin Taxi Forum, chaired by the chairman of the Dublin Transportation Office, was established in December 1997 and completed its work in August 1998. My Department's involvement in the forum related to participation by one member at its meetings, preparation of some discussion-information papers and other research work to assist completion of the forum recommendations. The total estimated person hour input from my Department was 51.25 hours, equivalent to a cost of some £2,264.</P>
      <P>The forum addressed a comprehensive set of recommendations to various Departments, An Garda Síochána, local authorities and the service providers. At this stage, many important recommendations of the taxi forum have been adopted by the parties involved. As far as my Department is concerned, regulations have been made to amend the points system for taxi licence applications, introduce a standard sign for hackneys and limousines for identification purposes and to facilitate enforcement by An Garda Síochána, remove restrictions on the use of two-way radio and telephonic equipment by hackneys and limousines, introduce a separate licensing regime for limousines, introduce the requirement for hackneys to carry a log of agreed fares when driving into, through or out of a taximeter area, and restore a five year period of validity for small public service vehicle drivers licences.</P>
      <P>New taxi licences are being granted by Dublin Corporation on a basis similar to that recommended by the taxi forum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An Action Programme for the Millennium, as reviewed by the parties in Government, undertakes to introduce measures to increase progress<Col N="1415" /> ively the number of taxi licences in Dublin as quickly as possible to ensure a proper balance between supply and demand in the market. Pending finalisation of particular measures in relation to this proposal, which will be developed as soon as possible, it is not possible to detail the structures or other particular arrangements for taking it forward.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy):</NameTxt>
      <P>House price statistics published by my Department are derived from returns made by mortgage lending institutions in respect of all housing transactions. As final figures are not yet available in respect of all institutions for the September 1999 quarter, I regret I am not in a position to provide information on price trends for the first nine months of 1999 at this stage. In line with the accepted practice for many years my Department does not publish projections of future house price levels.</P>
      <P>The Government has implemented a comprehensive range of initiatives to stabilise house prices, increase housing supply, and make available more affordable housing. There is clear evidence that these measures are having significant effects.</P>
      <P>House price statistics for the June quarter of 1999 contained in the housing statistics bulletin published by my Department showed a number of positive trends in house prices. For example, the annual rate of increase in new house prices in Dublin was lower than at any period since the last quarter of 1996. These indications of house price moderation have been backed up in data and statements from housing market sources generally.</P>
      <P>It is important also to point out that housing output continues to increase significantly. New house completions nationally are up more than 11 per cent in the first nine months of 1999 on the same period in 1998 and last year's record level of over 42,000 completions is likely to be significantly exceeded this year. In Dublin, the most critical area in relation to housing demand and supply, the increase in output is running at 18 per cent in the first nine months of this year compared to the same period last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As indicated in the recent review of An Action Programme for the Millennium, the Government will maintain the effectiveness of measures to achieve price stabilisation and balance in the <Col N="1416" /> housing market and fine tune them as appropriate.</P>

      <P>I refer to the reply to Question No. 64 on 5 October 1999, which, while indicating greenhouse gas emissions growth to the end of 1997, emphasised that all EU member state targets, within the overall EU reduction target of 8 per cent under the Kyoto Protocol, were developed on the basis that they would represent a substantial reduction on business as usual scenarios.</P>
      <P>A national greenhouse gas abatement strategy, now at an advanced stage of preparation and subject to consideration by Comhar, the national sustainable development partnership, will provide a framework for meeting Ireland's Kyoto target. The strategy will build on existing greenhouse gas mitigation measures in economic sectors, identify additional policies and measures for all sectors, and be complemented by further common and co-ordinated policies and measures across the EU.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 57 and 100 together.</P>
      <P>The Government strategy for road safety 1998 to 2002 has set out specific targets for improving road safety in Ireland, notably the objective of reducing deaths and serious injuries by at least 20 per cent by 2002 relative to 1997. This target will be achieved by enhancing and intensifying existing road safety measures and by a number of new initiatives which include a penalty points system for driving offences and the introduction of a theory test in connection with first applications for provisional licences.</P>
      <P>As indicated in the first progress report on the strategy, a new road traffic Bill is being drafted in my Department to provide a legislative base for a penalty points system in Ireland. The scheme of the Bill will be brought before Government at the earliest possible date with a view to publication by mid-2000. The operation of the points system is also linked to the development of a national computerised driver licence file which is being urgently progressed.</P>
      <P>The theory test is being progressed on a PPP basis with a view to its introduction within 2000.</P>

      <P>San Tuairisc den Ghíomhaireacht um Chaomhnú Comhshaoil (GCC) ar Chaighdeán <Col N="1419" /> Uisce in Éireann 1995-1997 dúradh go raibh staid na n-uiscí Éireannacha sásúil agus nach raibh siad go dona i gcomparáid leis an staid i dtíortha Eorpacha eile. Leírigh an Tuairisc go raibh thart ar 67 per cent de na haibhneacha nach raibh truaillithe. Maidir leis an bhfuíollach de bhreis ar 32 per cent chuir rudaí mar mhion truailliú agus truailliú measartha, .i. eotrófú, isteach orthu tríd is tríd, go príomha de bharr an iomarca fosfair.</P>
      <P>Ó 1997, tá mo Roinn ag leanúint straitéis chuimsitheach chomhtháite chun dul i ngleic le gach foinse eotrófaithe. Cheana féin tá fianaise d'fheabhsú sa chaighdeán uisce le feiscint in áiteanna éagsúla. Buntaca na straitéise seo is iad Na Rialacháin um An Acht Rialtais Áitiúil (Truailliú Uisce), 1977 (Caighdeáin Cháilíochta Uisce d'Fhosfar), 1998, a rinne mé in Iúil, 1998. Leagtar síos ins na Rialacháin seo spriocanna soiléire chun leibhéil an fhosfair in aibhneacha agus i lochanna a laghdú laistigh de thréimhse 10 mbliana.</P>
      <P>Tacaíocht don straitéis is é an clár mór infheistíochta atá ag mo Roinn chun áiseanna bonneagar séarachais a chur ar fáil tríd an tír ar fad. Déanfar soláthar de £2,495 milliún le laghaidh Bhonneagar Uisce agus Uisce Fuílligh sa Phlean Forbartha Náisiúnta 2000-2006. Leagann an clár seo béim ar leith ar sholáthar áiseanna a laghdaíonn fosfar nuair is léir go bhfuil gá lena leithéid. Tá tionscnaimh thábhachtacha ar bun chomh maith ag mo chomhleacaí, an tAire Talamhaíochta, Bia agus Forbairt Tuaithe, chun dul i ngleic le inchur fosfair ón tálmhaíocht an Scéim Chosanta Comhshaoil Tuaithe (SCCT) agus an Scéim Rialú Truaillithe Feirme (SRTF) san áireamh. Tá soláthar fónta déanta sa Phlean Forbartha Náisiúnta don dá Scéim seo &ndash; £1,500 milliún i gcás SCCT agus £147 milliún i gcás SRTF. De thoradh thiocsnaimh sa tionscal glantaigh le déanaí meastar go dtiocfaidh laghdú de thart ar 50% ar mhéid an fhosfair ó earraí glantaigh roimh lár 2000, agus laghduithe sa bhreis le teacht ina dhiaidh sin.</P>
      <P>Táim cinnte gur trí na bearta atá idir lámha anois a thiocfaidh na feabhsuithe is gá a dhéanamh faoi Na Rialacháin Fhosfair.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace):</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer to the reply to Question No. 107 of 5 October 1999. While it is a matter for each local authority, using the extensive powers available under the Waste Management Act, 1996, and the Waste Management (Packaging) Regulations, 1997, to ensure that organisations comply with their legal obligations, I am concerned that there should be effective implementation of the regulations so that responsibility for recycling packaging waste is borne equitably by packaging producers. The regulations require all businesses to take steps regarding in-house packaging waste, while extra obligations are imposed on businesses defined as major producers under the regulations. Major producers may meet their producer responsibility obligations, either as members of Repak or on an individual basis and they should not be placed at a commercial disadvantage by free riders who seek to evade these obligations. Accordingly, my Department has, where possible, <Col N="1421" /> endeavoured to facilitate the effective enforcement and implementation of the regulations by local authorities.</P>
      <P>As previously stated, I am aware that local authorities are generally now devoting more resources to the enforcement of the 1997 regulations than was the case heretofore and, while further improvement is necessary in this regard, I am satisfied that progress is being achieved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey):</NameTxt>
      <P>Part B of the building regulations, which came into effect on 1 June 1992, sets out the requirements in relation to fire safety in the design and construction of new buildings and the extension of or material alteration to, existing buildings. These requirements were updated when I published a revised and upgraded Technical Guidance Document B (Fire Safety) in December 1997 which recommended that houses built on or after 1 July 1998, should be fitted with mains operated smoke alarms.</P>
      <P>Fire safety in the home is the responsibility of the individual householder. Better awareness of the dangers of fires and fire hazards, together with simple common sense fire prevention practices and the installation of smoke alarms, can help to prevent and reduce the number of fires and consequent tragic fatalities and injuries. Accordingly, the National Safety Council, which is responsible for the promotion of fire safety, actively encourages fire safety in the home as part of its ongoing fire safety education and publicity campaigns. Particular stress has been placed in recent media campaigns on the routine tasks to be carried out nightly to guard against fire and on the value of smoke alarms which, if installed and maintained, can provide early warning of fire and save lives. As regards smoke alarms, local authorities have been asked by my Department to consider their provision in all their rented dwellings. The vast majority of house insurance policies also provide a financial incentive in the form of discounts where smoke detectors are provided. I am satisfied that fire safety in the home is best achieved with the voluntary and active involvement of householders and this will continue to be supported by the National Safety Council.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy):</NameTxt>
      <P>On 8 April 1999, all housing authorities were requested to assess the extent to which the new affordable housing scheme could appropriately be used in their areas and to formulate proposals for specific developments which should be brought to construction at the earliest possible date. Responsibility for inviting, processing and approving applications under the scheme rests with individual housing authorities and, accordingly, I have no function in this regard.</P>
      <P>The affordable housing scheme involves the provision by the local authorities of additional new houses specifically for low-income house purchasers on land provided by the local authorities. The development of suitable sites, including, where necessary, the acquisition of land and the planning and construction of houses does, of necessity, require some time to arrange. Nevertheless, the new scheme is progressing satisfactorily and the first houses under the scheme will be completed by the end of this year. There are projects under the scheme at planning stage throughout the country and construction of a substantial number of dwellings will be under way by early 2000. I envisage that some 1,100 houses will be provided under the scheme by the end of 2000.</P>

      <P>The Government's Action on House Prices, published last year, and Action on the Housing Market which was published in March of this year, involve a balanced range of measures to increase the supply of housing, reduce overheating in the market and assist first-time house buyers. The important measures taken which are of direct benefit to first-time buyers include reductions in stamp duty rates, particularly at lower house price levels, significant <Col N="1425" /> improvements to the terms of the shared ownership scheme and the introduction of a new affordable housing scheme. The new affordable housing scheme is designed to provide houses at prices that would be less than the market price for comparable new houses in centres where house price increases have created an affordability gap for lower income purchasers. A grant of £3,000 continues to be available to first-time purchasers of new houses.</P>
      <P>In addition, with regard to social housing needs the new multi-annual local authority housing programme will provide for 22,000 local authority housing starts over the next four years. I also recently announced significant improvements to the terms and conditions of the voluntary housing schemes. This was the third time in two years that I have improved the voluntary schemes and I am confident that this will enable output from the sector to increase to some 4,000 units per annum over the coming years.</P>
      <P>The inclusion of housing in the national development plan for the first time and the provision of substantial funding for housing and related infrastructure is evidence of the Government's commitment to meet the needs for social and affordable housing in the coming years.</P>
      <P>In overall terms I expect that social housing provision through the range of schemes will expand to meet the needs of some 50,000 households over the next four years.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 78 and 86 together.</P>
      <P>The fifth conference of the parties, COP5, to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, UNFCCC, was held in Bonn from 25 October to 5 November. I attended the high level segment from 2 to 4 November. The main emphasis at COP5 was to maintain political momentum towards the necessary decisions at COP6 which will be held in The Hague in November 2000, and to secure adequate arrangements at UN level to make the necessary technical and drafting progress over the next year with a view to the early entry into force of the protocol.</P>
      <P>The position that I adopted at COP5 was in line with the overall EU position, which was to maintain its lead role in the negotiations, and make progress on outstanding issues under the convention and the protocol to keep up the momentum of Kyoto, so that sufficient parties will have ratified it to enter into force by 2002 &ndash; the tenth anniversary of the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, when the convention was signed.</P>
      <P>I made clear Ireland's opposition to the inclusion of nuclear energy projects under the clean development mechanism of the protocol. This is a project based flexibility mechanism still under negotiation, whereby countries with targets may receive emissions credits for investment in sustainable development projects that reduce greenhouse gas emissions in countries without targets.</P>
      <P>A number of decisions at COP5 settled important substantive technical issues. Agreement was reached on how to improve the rigour of national reports from industrialised countries and strengthen the guidelines for measuring their greenhouse gas emissions. COP5 also pointed the way forward for determining how to address adverse effects on developing countries and how to account for carbon sequestration for afforestation, reforestation and deforestation.</P>
      <P>The national greenhouse gas abatement strategy is currently at an advanced stage of preparation. I have asked Comhar, the national sustainable development partnership, to consider and make recommendations to me on the draft by mid-December.</P>

      <Quest>if he has satisfied himself with the commitment contained in county development plans espousing development of pedestrian and bicycle facilities; and the measures, if any, he proposes to ensure a balanced provision for the needs of cyclists and pedestrians alongside provision for cars.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey):</NameTxt>
      <P>The main instrument for the regulation and control of development is the development plan. Each local planning authority is required to make a development plan and to review and update it every five years. In general, the plan indicates the objectives of the planning authority for the use, solely or primarily, of particular areas for particular purposes, whether residential, commercial, industrial, agricultural or otherwise, for road improvements, development and renewal of obsolete areas and for preserving, improving and extending amenities. The adoption of a development plan is a matter for the elected members. The setting of standards in relation to pedestrian and cycle facilities is therefore a matter for each individual planning authority to deal with in the context of its development plan.</P>
      <P>In March 1998, the Dublin Transportation Office, on behalf of my Department, produced a cycle facilities design manual that was sent to all county councils, county borough corporations and borough corporations. The manual comprises a comprehensive set of guidelines for the design and provision of cycle facilities.</P>
      <P>The Planning and Development Bill, 1999, contains provisions to enable planning authorities in their development plans to provide objectives for: facilitating the provision of sustainable integrated transport, public transport and road traffic systems and promoting the development of local transport plans; and establishing the line, width, level and construction of, the means of access to and egress from, and the general dimensions and character of, roads, including cycleways and busways, and, where appropriate, other transport networks, whether new or existing.</P>
      <P>The development plan is not the only means of implementing a local authority's policies on pedestrian and cycling facilities. Cycling and walking are important means of transport for travel to work, school, shops and other activities. They are environmentally friendly and health promoting. Particular attention is being devoted, within the DTI strategy, to promoting both cycling and walking as a means of transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the Dublin area in particular, the DTO established the DTI strategic cycle to oversee the development of an integrated cycle network by each of the relevant local authorities. Local authorities in the Dublin area have identified a comprehensive 180 km network of cycle routes. This network concentrates on commuter routes in order to effect a modal shift from the private car. Some 72 km of cycle routes have been completed to date and the DTO has earmarked some £10 million for cycle facilities in the next <Col N="1428" /> two years in order to substantially complete the DTI cycle network by the end of 2000. It is only when the full cycle network is completed that the benefits of the cycle routes will become apparent.</P>
    <P>As indicated in the DTI final report, a city centre pedestrian network is being developed by Dublin Corporation, with some funding being provided by the DTO. The DTO is currently updating the original DTI strategy; this will lead to the publication by the end of 1999 of an updated strategy for the period 2000 to 2016.</P>
    <P>The planning of individual projects must include consideration of the needs of cyclists and pedestrians where appropriate. Local authorities now have a statutory obligation to have regard to the needs of all road users when performing their road construction and maintenance functions.</P>
    <P>It is clear from the above that a wide range of measures in relation to pedestrian and cycling facilities are being pursued.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy):</NameTxt>
      <P>Local authorities have a wide range of powers to enable them to respond to the accommodation needs of homeless people in their areas, including the direct provision of accommodation and securing accommodation for homeless persons through the agency of the health boards or voluntary housing organisations. In the Dublin area a referral service is operated by the Eastern Health Board on behalf of the local authorities to arrange emergency accommodation for homeless persons. Dublin Corporation, in whose area the greatest incidence of homelessness is found, has a cold weather strategy to increase the supply of accommodation, including the establishment of a night-time drop-in service, operated by CROSSCARE, for homeless people during the winter months. The corporation is also pursuing a strategy to assist homeless people back into independent living or into sheltered housing accommodation with the objective of freeing up emergency hostel accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Within the past few years the corporation has acquired or leased several premises for homeless persons and it is continuously engaged in seeking to identify and acquire premises which would be suitable as both emergency and sheltered accommodation for homeless persons. My Department provides 100 per cent capital funding for local authorities in respect of the acquisition and redevelopment costs. In addition, my Department recoups 90 per cent of local authorities contri<Col N="1429" /> butions to voluntary bodies who provide accommodation for homeless persons.</P>
    <P>The position in relation to the provision of suitable accommodation for homeless persons in other major towns is similarly a matter for the local authorities concerned and the Department is aware that these local authorities continue to seek out and provide suitable accommodation.</P>
    <P>The local authority housing programme is the main element in housing homeless people in permanent housing accommodation. In any year local authorities allocate 500 to 600 tenancies to homeless households. The local authority housing programme has been significantly increased in recent years and will be increased further over the next four years. This expansion of the programme will enable local authorities to house more homeless people.</P>
    <P>The cross-Department team on homelessness, established by my Department to prepare a comprehensive response to the many issues which affect homeless people, is well advanced in the preparation of its report which is expected to be finalised in the near future.</P>

      <P>My Department is in contact with representatives of the Catholic church and the Church of Ireland regarding the making available of land or property which may <Col N="1430" /> be surplus to requirements for residential use or development. Officials from my Department met the Conference of Religious in Ireland on 5 October 1999 and with the representative body of the Church of Ireland on 4 November 1999. A meeting with representatives of the Irish Episcopal conference has been arranged for later this month.</P>
      <P>This initiative was taken in the context of Government policies to increase housing supply in relation to which the availability of land, especially serviced land, is a crucial factor. Clearly, it is desirable that as large a proportion as possible of the demand would be met from land within existing built-up areas since these are often the areas of greatest need and where best use can be made of existing infrastructural and community facilities. The Department has had successful discussions with the Department of Defence and is in contact with other State agencies in relation to the release of such land or property that is surplus to requirements. On the same basis contact has been made with the religious authorities.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the contacts is to get an estimate of the amount of land or property available and agreement that such land or property would be offered first to the local authority on terms acceptable to both parties. Thus, my aim is to have in place an overall agreed framework with which the churches and local authorities could co-operate in regard to the disposal of surplus land or property.</P>
      <P>My Department's contacts have met with a positive response in keeping with the positive contribution which the religious authorities have made to housing for disadvantaged people in the past. The matter will be taken forward when the respective bodies have had an opportunity to ascertain the potential availability of land-property nationally.</P>
      <P>This is very much in keeping with the positive contribution which the religious authorities have made to social housing in the past.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 85 and 99 together.</P>
      <P>The Government Strategy for Road Safety 1998-2002 acknowledged the importance of driver training and testing, with the qualification that these could not be expected to yield road safety benefits on the scale of measures directly targeted at speeding, alcohol and seat belt wearing which have been prioritised by the strategy.</P>
      <P>Driver training is available at present from private motoring schools, many of whose instructors are registered with the voluntary driver instructor register, which has been financially supported by my Department, and the Irish Insurance Federation. Education and information is recognised in the safety strategy as being vital to forming good road safety habits in younger people who are the adult road users of the future. The National Safety Council is developing special material and programmes for the post primary sector that will focus both on safe road use by teenagers and the future responsibilities of young people as drivers. The council also regularly targets young drivers in its public media campaigns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first progress report of the High Level Group on Road Safety on the National Road Safety Strategy published in July 1999, noted with concern the increased involvement by young <Col N="1432" /> people in road accidents and recommended that further study of this phenomenon should be undertaken as a priority.

      <P>I have welcomed the report for its confirmation that the benefits of measures to prevent and reduce road accidents prioritised in the Government strategy significantly outweigh their cost. The benefit cost of the incremental road safety gains envisaged by the strategy is calculated at 4.5:1 rising to an annual benefit cost of 8.3:1 after implementation of the strategy is completed.</P>
      <P>The report also makes a range of recommendations for the future cost benefit appraisal of road safety measures and it contains proposals for the development and refinement of road accident data.

      <P>Information on housing starts-acquisitions is returned by local authorities to my Department on a quarterly basis and is published in my Department's housing statistics bulletin. Details for the quarter ending September 1999 are being compiled in my Department at present and will be included in the next edition of the bulletin to be published at the end of the month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current indications are that the level of housing starts-acquisitions achieved by authorities between January and the end of September is of the same order as that achieved by authorities in the same period last year when <Col N="1433" /> some 1,200 houses were started/acquired. Because of the nature of an annual programme most of the starts authorised for a current year do not usually start until the last quarter of the year. I expect that the total number of starts to be commenced or houses acquired this year will be of the order of 4,000. A new four year multi-annual programme is being introduced next year to overcome the stop go nature of a single annual programme and to help ensure that starts are not bunched towards the last quarter of the year.</P>

      <P>Under the Litter Pollution Act, 1997, primary responsibility for the development of management and enforcement responses to litter pollution, including litter in tourist areas, rests with the individual local authorities.</P>
      <P>I share the widespread concern at the extent of our national litter pollution problem. I have, therefore, been pursuing a major programme of measures to support more effective local authority action against litter. Earlier this year, I allocated £350,000 in grants to local authorities to co-fund selected public education and awareness initiatives against litter. A national litter pollution monitoring system is being developed to monitor and assess local authority litter management and enforcement action &ndash; this will be operational in the new year. I have provided financial support for the An Taisce-led National Spring Clean 1999, which took place in April and included a central role for local authorities. A national anti-litter forum was established last July to promote greater sectoral involvement, in particular on the part of the business and commercial sectors, in anti-litter initiatives. The forum is reviewing the current actions targeting litter pollution and developing a programme of measures to enhance and extend those responses. I intend to increase the on-the-spot fine for alleged offences under the Litter Pollution Act and will be announcing the details shortly.</P>
      <P>I will continue to work actively with local authorities and the various sectors to secure effective implementation of the range of ongoing measures and to develop new anti-litter initiatives.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy):</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a range of projections of future housing output. In particular, the ESRI in its report on national investment priorities for the period 2000-06 estimated that housing demand will average 38,000 units per annum from 1996 to 2006 and 40,000 units per annum between 2006 and 2011. In the Government commissioned report An Economic Assessment of Recent House Price Developments, Peter Bacon and Associates forecast that annual private housing output could increase to 46,000 units by 2003. Annual housing output already exceeds the ESRI projection and is very much in line with the projections in the Bacon report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Taking account of these projections and the provision for social and affordable housing included in the national development plan, total housing output is likely to be of the order of 200,000 houses over the next four years. It is envisaged that social and affordable housing will account for some 15 per cent of total new housing output over the period. Of this, it is envisaged that local authority housing will account for some 65-70 per cent, voluntary housing some 20 per cent and affordable housing the balance of new social and affordable housing output. Of course, new housing output is only part of our response to social and affordable housing need. The full <Col N="1435" /> range of social and affordable housing measures will meet the housing needs of over 50,000 households over the next four years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey):</NameTxt>
      <P>The new national development plan provides for expenditure of £3 billion over the next seven years on water and sewerage infrastructure. This is three times the size of the expected outturn of £960 million for these services under the current NDP and will require a proportionately much greater contribution from the Exchequer because of the reduction in cohesion funding resulting from economic advances in recent years. Early in the new year I will be publishing a comprehensive water services investment programme which will set out in detail the areas and schemes that will benefit from this unprecedented level of spending.</P>
      <P>The increased investment envisaged in the new NDP is an acceleration of the pattern of recent years which has seen spending on water and sewerage schemes increase by 50 per cent in 1999 over the 1998 figure, and to twice the 1996 level. Between 1994 and the end of 1999 over £960 million will have been spent on water and sewerage services which, even allowing for adjustments for inflation, is well in excess of the £605 million envisaged at the start of the national development plan 1994-99. Major water schemes completed between 1994 and 1998 have provided an increase in water treatment capacity nationally of 44 million gallons of water per day or the equivalent of providing an additional supply for over 812,000 persons.</P>
      <P>The 1999 programme included 18 major public water schemes to commence construction this year at a cost of £61 million, a further 16 to continue construction at a cost of £79 million and 27 schemes worth £152 million to be advanced through planning. It also included 15 water conservation schemes with a total cost of just under £50 million &ndash; 14 of these are already underway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To determine the extent of future development of the water supply systems my Department has funded a series of studies over the last few years to assess existing levels of service and to estimate future demand, taking account of parameters such as population increases and projected industrial and commercial development. A major study was completed in 1996 on the water supplies in <Col N="1436" /> the greater Dublin region, including counties Kildare and Wicklow. This is currently being reviewed. Studies have also been carried out in other cities and several other major population centres. These studies form the basis for the water conservation programme being funded by my Department.</P>
    <P>I have also commissioned consultants to carry out a national water study of all medium to large public water supplies. This study will assess the adequacy of existing systems for each area served and make recommendations on an appropriate approach for improving inadequate supplies to cater for existing and future demand. The consultants are due to report by the end of this year.</P>
    <P>To assist in the development of rural water supplies, my Department has asked county councils, in consultation with the voluntary group sector, to prepare strategic rural water plans which will map out the best approach to the provision of an adequate water supply to households served by private group or individual supplies. As part of this process, an assessment will be made of existing levels of services, quality of sources and current and future demand.</P>
    <P>My Department invited all local authorities in October 1998 to prepare and submit an assessment of needs at county or regional level for water services capital works. The needs assessments have a medium term horizon to the end of 2006 and a longer term horizon covering the 20 year period commencing in 1999. They are required to take account of information emerging from the national water audit and the strategic rural water plans and will have regard to the development plan for the area and any relevant strategic planning guidelines. These inputs have all helped to quantify the amount of investment needed in our water supplies to support future economic and social development, as reflected in the new National Development Plan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Building Control Act, 1990, regulates the standard of construction work on new buildings and extensions or material alterations to existing buildings. Enforcement of the 1990 Act is a matter for the local building control authority. The authority usually seeks voluntary co-operation in compliance with the national building regulations made under the 1990 Act. If that fails, the authority can serve an enforcement notice on the builder, designer or owner of the building, as appropriate. In the event of non-compliance with the notice, the authority or the DPP can institute a prosecution in the courts. Where there is a dangerous defect, the authority can seek a High Court injunction requiring the execution of remedial work to make the building safe. The authority can exercise its enforcement powers on its own initiative, following inspection of a building, or on foot of a complaint from a member of the public.</P>
      <P>In the case of new houses, Homebond independently operates a guarantee scheme. This guarantee covers major defects of a structural nature for a period of ten years following completion of the building work. Normally complaints about the quality of work done by housebuilders registered with Homebond are resolved without the need for the householder to resort to legal action.</P>
      <P>Where the construction of a building is the subject of a contract between the client commissioning the building and the builder, enforcement of this contract is a civil matter.</P>

      <P>An estimated 371,000 provisional licences were current as at 31 December 1998.</P>
      <P>The Government Strategy for Road Safety 1998-2002 acknowledged the importance of driver training and testing, with the qualification that these could not be expected to yield road safety benefits on the scale of measures directly targeted at speeding, alcohol and seat belt wearing which have been prioritised by the strategy. The strategy proposed, for the longer term, a significant reduction in the number of Irish drivers relying on a provisional licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to attain this longer term goal, the short-term priority must be to restore waiting periods for driving tests to acceptable levels. I have already outlined, in the reply to Questions <Col N="1438" /> Nos. 42, 67, 81 and 92 on today's Order Paper, the significant additional resources now being made available to support this process.</P>
    <P>Measures have been in place for some years, and will be maintained, to restrict the indefinite holding of provisional licences. In addition, the Motor Insurance Advisory Board, is developing recommendations for improving access to motor insurance for young people. The possibility of affording greater credit for the holding of a full driver licence may arise in this context.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney):</NameTxt>
      <P>The social economy in Ireland has developed over many years. The strong impetus for community development in this country has resulted in an enhanced focus in recent years on the possibilities for development for this area of the economy.</P>
      <P>The EU White Paper, Growth Competitiveness and Employment, 1994, gave a clear endorsement to the concept of the social economy. The White Paper identified the possibility of encouraging new types of social service provision and useful social employment opportunities in response to local demand for services which neither the mainstream market nor the public sector could satisfy.</P>
      <P>Against this background a working group on the social economy was set up on foot of the commitment in Partnership 2000 to undertake a detailed examination of the potential of the social economy in Ireland, both in terms of employment and also in the supply of services, such as childcare, eldercare and services improving the quality of life in disadvantaged areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The working group was made up of representatives from the four pillars of Partnership 2000 and relevant Departments, and was chaired by the Department of Enterprise Trade and Employment. The group met from October 1997 until completion of its report in July 1998. The group <Col N="1441" /> examined existing provision for social economy type activity and concluded that while a considerable level of State and EU funds, approximately £130 million per annum, was already being invested in social economy type activity, there was a case for a dedicated social economy programme which would have as its primary aim the regeneration of disadvantaged communities, and thereby enhance opportunities and the quality of life in such communities. The report and its recommendations were agreed by all the social partners and endorsed in the P2000 process.</P>
    <P>Arising from the conclusions and recommendations of the working group's report the Government decided in July 1999 to approve the introduction of a social economy programme to be overseen by a national monitoring committee.</P>
    <P>The monitoring committee, chaired by the Department of Enterprise Trade and Employment and representative of relevant Departments and the social partners, held its first meeting on 3 November. A further meeting will take place in mid-December 1999 where it is expected that the committee will adopt the framework for the social economy programme.</P>
    <P>Following agreement on the framework, FÁS will establish local working groups to oversee the programme at local level and will begin to promote and fund projects. Applications for funding will be made through FÁS offices locally. The monitoring committee intends to carry out an evaluation of the new programme before the end of its second year of operation.</P>
    <P>As defined by the P2000 working group the social economy projects would have the following characteristics: ownership within a community or community of interest e.g. travellers, and responding to market demand regardless of source of income; focus on the economic or social development of a community or community of interest; operation benefiting the community and individual members;and providing for employment experience and employment opportunities which are sustainable, but which might nonetheless be dependent on State support.</P>
    <P>Three categories of projects will be funded under social economy: community businesses, ultimately financed from trading income alone; deficient demand social enterprises, where the demand for particular goods and services within a community is not matched by resources to pay for these due to disadvantage or low density of population; enterprises based on public service contracts, where public services in disadvantaged areas and communities are subcontracted to local social economy enterprises.</P>
    <P>When fully operational, it is expected that the social economy programme will provide for an annual investment of approximately £41 million. The programme will be funded primarily through a reallocation, on a phased basis, of a proportion of funding currently committed to community employment.</P>
    <P>In view of the extensive examination of the <Col N="1442" /> social economy carried out by the P2000 working group, the decision by the Government to establish a new dedicated social economy programme, the recent establishment of the monitoring committee for the new programme and the intention of the committee to evaluate the programme within two years, I have no plans to conduct a White or Green Paper process on the social economy.</P>

      <P>Operational responsibility for the delivery of the community employment, CE, programme, including the allocation of places and project selection and appraisal is a matter for FÁS as part of its remit under the Labour Services Act, 1987. The primary purpose of community employment as an active labour market measure is to reintegrate long-term unemployed persons into open labour market jobs. The Deloitte &amp; Touche evaluation of community employment set a framework for a reform of the programme for the years ahead. It recommended that there should be a reduction in participation on the programme over time, as well as a range of other reforms aimed at enhancing its effectiveness.</P>
      <P>The restructuring of community employment, which was approved by Government earlier this year and was based on the recommendations of Deloitte &amp; Touche, is set against a background of significant employment growth and unemployment reductions and is aimed at securing better targeting and outcomes from the programme. The reduction in the number of places on CE to 28,000 by the end of 2004, will be implemented on a phased basis over a five year time frame and in accordance with priority local needs identified by FÁS. This reduction includes the transfer of resources equivalent to some 5,000 community employment places to the new social economy programme.</P>
      <P>It should be noted that I have committed to further consultations on how best to allocate resources freed up by the restructuring of community employment to meet the needs of the long-term unemployed, and on the proper funding or mainstreaming of essential services currently provided under community employment.</P>

      <P>One of the recommendations of the commission on the newspaper industry which reported in June 1996 was that an independent ombudsman to investigate complaints of breaches of press standards be established. The commission was clear that this ombudsman should be appointed and funded by the newspaper industry, both indigenous and imported. The commission made the point that if the newspaper industry accepted this recommendation, that there should be a change in the law of libel to provide immunity from claims of defamation to the ombudsman.</P>
      <P>In November 1996 the then Minister presented an <i>aide-memoire</i> to Government on the recommendations of the commission on the newspaper industry. Government decided that each Minister upon whose area of responsibility the recommendations impact should revert to Government in relation to any necessary legislation. Any change in the laws on defamation as recommended by the commission on the newspaper industry is a matter for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
      <P>I support the recommendation of the commission on the newspaper industry regarding the establishment of an ombudsman and I also agree that it is for the newspaper industry to regulate itself in this regard. However, I have no functions or responsibilities in respect of changes to the law on defamation.</P>

    <P>In line with economic buoyancy seaport trade nationally is rising with most ports experiencing growth rates of up to 10 % annually in the last number of years.</P>
    <P>Despite congestion problems and disruption arising from the recent major infrastructural development and capital dredging, Drogheda Port has performed remarkably well. It is attracting new shipping business and continues to expand its customer base and business.</P>
    <P>Dundalk Port has experienced modest expansion and continues to provide a valuable service to its port users and trade. Dundalk is categorised as one of the top regional ports in commercial terms.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, I recently published a major independent review of the State's 16 commercial regional ports and harbours including Dundalk Harbour. The recommendation in the review in relation to Dundalk that the commissioners be offered the opportunity to make a case for themselves to become a commercial State company has been endorsed by me. The commissioners are currently engaged in the preparation of their case and I am advised will shortly present a plan showing how they can cater for the requirements of corporatisation.</P>
    <P>Following publication of the regional ports study, I initiated a full consultative process. While I am aware that the consultants met and took on board the views of relevant interests, including those of the port authorities and management and other interested State, tourism and local commercial development bodies, I believe that it is essential that all stakeholders and interests including harbour authorities are given an opportunity to comment on the recommendations which emerged from the review in advance of any decisions being made.</P>
    <P>On conclusion of the consultative process, I will be bringing fully costed and developed proposals to Government for consideration including determinations on the most appropriate and beneficial operational and management structures for each regional port.</P>

The study involves considering the role of Coillte in contributing to the Irish forestry sector and the identification and evaluation of appropriate options for the corporate development of Coillte, including strategic alliance and wider share ownership possibilities. The consultants' report is expected shortly.</P>
      <P>The issue of public access to forests is, of course, one of many aspects which falls to be considered in the context of the preferred strategic option.</P>

      <P>Additional years service for the calculation of pension are allowed to certain civil servants who, by virtue of the qualifications and experience required for their post, would not have the 40 years pensionable service at the age of 65. This entitlement can be reduced by reference to the value of preserved benefits and refunds from other pension schemes.</P>
      <P>In the case in question, the person to whom the question relates was credited with an entitlement of ten years additional service, on the basis of an estimation of the time required to attain his qualifications. However, the entitlement was subsequently reduced when the benefits and refunds from other pension schemes were taken into account.</P>
      <P>The method of the calculation of the amount of the final award has been reviewed by my Department, in conjunction with the Department of Finance, and confirmed to be correct. The facts relating to the calculation have been outlined in detail to the person concerned.</P>

      <P>Under the new EU rural development regulation, forestry will continue to provide a reliable guaranteed income to farmers, in terms of both afforestation-maintenance grants and loss of income premiums over a 20 year period. Officials of my Department are currently in discussion with the Commission about proposals to increase the level of such payments. Pending the outcome of these discussions, existing afforestation incentives will remain in place.</P>
      <P>The development of hedgerows comes under the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands.</P>

    <P>(Dr. Woods): Under the terms of any authorisation the operator is obliged to furnish me with copies of all data obtained. However, in accordance with section 46 of the Licensing Terms for Offshore Oil and Gas Exploration and Development, 1992, I am obliged to keep such information confidential until five years after the well has been completed or earlier if the licence expires, is relinquished or revoked. I have received a full set of data from the well drilled this summer on the Shannon prospect, but I am obliged to keep the specific information confidential.</P>
    <P>The general information which I am at liberty to provide is that the well (18/25-2) was drilled between 18 August and 13 October last. It was located some eight kilometres south of the Corrib gasfield, in 336 metres of water, and was drilled to a total depth of 2,965 metres. No hydrocarbons were encountered and the well was plugged and abandoned as a dry hole. The operator and its partners and my Department are now evaluating the results of the well to help in reaching a better understanding of the geology and the prospectivity of the area.</P>

It is the operator in four of these, covering 20 blocks, and has a 15 % interest in a licence covering 11 blocks. In addition it has been granted one licensing option covering three blocks.</P>
      <P>The Corrib gas field, which was discovered in 1996, extends across two of the licences in relation to which the company is the operator. Two appraisal wells have been drilled in the Corrib, one in 1998 and the second in 1999.</P>
      <P>All of the authorisations referred to above were issued in accordance with the licensing terms for Offshore Oil and Gas Exploration and Development, 1992, a copy of which can be made available to the Deputy on request. Each authorisation has its own specific work programme which has been agreed under the terms of the licence. Each work programme is regarded as being commercially sensitive and, accordingly, I am not free to make its contents available. The Deputy will appreciate that, as all authorisations are agreements with the companies, they are not subject to change. In any event, I am satisfied that the company is complying with the terms and conditions of the licence and with the work programmes undertaken by the licensees.</P>

      <P>My statutory powers in the area of licensing of oil and gas activities relate to the exploration, development and production of oil and gas resources. My colleague, the Minister for Public Enterprise, deals with the utilisation of these resources onshore. This would include the construction and maintenance of the pipeline network and the transmission, distribution and use of these resources.</P>
      <P>I recently received a report entitled An Economic Assessment of the Contributions of Irish Oil and Gas Exploration and Production Operations to the Irish Economy, which was prepared in NUI Cork. This report was commissioned by the Irish Offshore Operators Association &ndash; IOOA &ndash; as a result of discussions within the framework group on Irish goods and services to the industry, chaired by my Department. I have asked the chairman of the group to give priority to follow up action on the report and to keep me informed of progress.</P>

    <P>I am aware that various studies and analyses have recently been undertaken in relation to gas demand and infrastructure requirements to 2025 by Bord Gáis Éireann and the Depart<Col N="1456" /> ment of Public Enterprise. I understand that the main recommendation from an economic evaluation of the various gas supply options considered in the studies is that any decision concerning major capital investment in import pipelines must have regard to the implications of the clarification of commerciality of the Corrib gas find. In the meantime, Bord Gáis Éireann is continuing with its work on preliminary engineering and routing studies regarding the various new gas supply infrastructure options identified in the studies.</P>

      <P>I and my officials meet on a regular basis with the company in question regarding the possible development of the Corrib field. The most recent discussions, earlier this month, focused on the company's plan for future work on the field and issues relating to a plan of development should the company decide to submit such a plan.</P>
      <P>The company is not yet in a position to decide on whether the field is commercial and has stated that further work needs to be done to enable a conclusion to be reached. In that context the company is considering drilling another appraisal well next year after which I expect that it would be in a position to make a decision on whether the gas can be produced commercially. Should it conclude that the field is commercial the company will be obliged under the licensing terms for Offshore Oil and Gas Exploration and Development, 1992, to so notify me and apply forthwith for a petroleum lease with a view to its development.</P>

      <P>I understand that the matter to which the Deputy refers concerns an action which the Commission has brought against Italy in the European Court of Justice &ndash; ECJ &ndash; case number C-212/99, which claims that the Italian authorities have failed to uphold the principle of non-discrimination on grounds of nationality. The case involves the status of a number of foreign lecturers employed by Italian public universities, including some 40 Irish citizens of whom the individual named by the Deputy is one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1457" /> Under Article 93 of the ECJ's rules of procedure, member states may make an application to intervene in such cases. In the current case, I am not satisfied that intervention is the most appropriate course for the Government to follow. The Commission is responsible for enforcing the provisions of the treaties in matters such as these and the Commission is now pursuing the matter in the European Court of Justice. This is the remedy which the treaties provide for infringements such as the one alleged.</P>
    <P>The situation of the Irish citizens is a matter of concern to me and I understand the frustration of all those involved at the length of time for which this matter has been in dispute. I am aware that rulings by the ECJ in 1989 and 1993 have not resolved the matter and that the Commission has felt obliged to return to the court for a third time. It is obviously a matter which the Department of Foreign Affairs in Dublin, the permanent representation of Ireland in Brussels and the embassy of Ireland in Rome will continue to follow closely. Action at this stage rests with the Commission, however, and it continues to be my view that the Commission is fulfilling its role.</P>

      <P>I am aware of issues concerning the restitution of church property and places of worship in relation to the Eastern Rite Catholic Church in Romania, also known as the Romanian Uniate Church. We have raised this matter with a number of interested bodies, including the Vatican authorities, the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe &ndash; OSCE &ndash; and the EU Commission office in Bucharest. It has also been raised directly with the Romanian authorities. As chairman of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, I am looking in particular to see how that organisation may be able to assist in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From our contacts with the bodies I mentioned above, there would not appear to be reports of systematic discrimination against members of the Romanian Uniate Church. However, the situation regarding the restitution of church property is very complex. Last year the judicial committee of the Romanian Senate decided that the matter should be settled among the churches rather than in parliament on the grounds that, according to the 1991 Romanian Constitution, the parliament cannot take decisions involving church matters. The vast majority of properties whose restitution is sought by the Romanian Uniate Church are currently in the possession of the Orthodox Church. This issue is one of several considered <Col N="1458" /> at the Reconciliation Dialogue between the two churches which was held in Bucharest on 28 October 1998. It was agreed that in the first instance the issue should be addressed at diocesan and parochial levels and that each and every case should be examined to determine the practical possibility of resolving problems in consultations involving the clergy and the faithful. I understand that negotiations between the orthodox and uniate churches are continuing. Ireland will continue to keep all aspects of this issue under review, both in our EU and multilateral contacts and directly with the Romanian authorities.</P>

      <P>In developing a light railway system the most significant single aspect of the construction phase is the laying of the trackbed and rails and the erection of the overhead electrical lines. However, as with all major projects, before the main construction work can be done, there is a very substantial amount of preparatory work to be undertaken.</P>
      <P>The light railway order &ndash; LRO &ndash; in respect of the Sandyford to St. Stephen's Green light rail line came into effect on 8 November 1999. CIE is already making progress on the process work including the tendering for the major contracts. Preparatory physical work ranging from items as mundane as clearing the old trackway to major tasks including the relocation of utilities will also be undertaken before construction begins. There will, therefore, be real and significant progress in the coming months.</P>
      <P>I understand that to the outside observer a project only becomes tangible when they see recognisable elements being put in place. However, it would give entirely the wrong impression to suggest that because actual construction is not under way, no work is taking place. The target completion date for construction is summer 2003. The advisory action group which I appointed to oversee the planning and implementation of the light rail project, is reviewing the potential for an earlier date for commencement of services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 131 and 133 together.</P>
      <P>Regulations to implement the ground handling directive were signed by me on 16 December 1998. With regard to third party ground handling the provisions of the directive apply from 1 January 1999 at any airport whose annual traffic is not less than three million passenger movements and, from 1 January, 2001, at any airport whose annual traffic is not less than two million passenger movements. The directive provides for free access for suppliers of ground handling services to these airports. At the moment, therefore, this provision of the directive currently applies only at Dublin Airport.</P>
      <P>With effect from 1 January 1998, the directive applies at all airports in respect of certain services for air carriers who wish to provide their own ground handling services. Some aspects of this self-service provision only apply at an airport whose annual traffic is not less than one million passengers. Therefore, the self-service provision of the directive currently applies fully at Cork, Dublin and Shannon Airports and partially in respect of the six regional airports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The directive does not set out any minimum standards with regard to ground handling services. When airlines use sub-contractors to provide ground handling services, it is the airlines' responsibility in the first instance to satisfy themselves as to the adequacy of the standards, procedures, equipment and training of the service <Col N="1463" /> provider. In Ireland, the Irish Aviation Authority &ndash; IAA &ndash; is the regulatory body responsible for the safety and technical aspects of civil aviation and they monitor the activities of airlines in this regard.</P>
    <P>Where the provision of ground handling services does not impinge on aircraft safety, such as catering supplies or aircraft cabin cleaning services, it is the responsibility of the existing agencies such as the Regional Health Board's Environmental Health Service for food safety, the Health and Safety Authority for safe work practices and the Environmental Protection Agency to enforce the legal standards in the same manner as for any other industrial activity or service in Ireland. The general standards which airport authorities require ground handling companies to meet will be in addition to the regulatory requirements set out above.</P>

      <P>The arrangements governing access to Dublin and Shannon for services between Ireland and the US which were agreed with the United States in 1993 were designed to ensure that during every 12 month period commencing 1 April, any airline serving the Ireland/US market must, taking all of its flights on all routes together, operate at least as many flights to Shannon as to Dublin. My Department monitors the operations of all airlines operating such services to ensure that this requirement is met.</P>
      <P>Aer Lingus have informed my Department that due to aircraft shortages during the period 25 October 1999 to 19 December 1999 arising from their winter aircraft overhaul programme, the airline is making changes to their normal winter schedules in relation to their Newark and Los Angeles services. These revisions result in lower frequencies on the Newark service to Shannon and Dublin and also involve a feeder service between Shannon and Dublin for their Los Angeles service during this period. My Department is satisfied that these revisions do not in any way conflict with the requirement which I set out above.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob):</NameTxt>
      <P>The need for a second gas interconnector arises because gas demand, driven mainly by our economic growth in the 1990s, has exceeded significantly projections which underlay the design of the Scotland-Ireland interconnector built in 1993. As a result, additional gas import infrastructure may be required by 2004.</P>
      <P>Because of the constraints of the existing interconnector, it has been necessary to consider other supply options. A number of technical studies and economic evaluations have been prepared in relation to these options and these reports are available on my Department's website. The main recommendation from these reports is that any decision concerning major capital investment in import pipelines be delayed pending clarification on the commerciality of the Corrib gas find.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, Bord Gais Éireann have continued with their work on preliminary engineering and routing studies regarding various new gas supply infrastructure options, including a second Scotland to Ireland interconnector. The estimated cost of such an interconnector would be around £300 million. There is also the possibility that Ireland's infrastructure requirements could be met by way of a proposal for a Belfast/Dublin gas pipeline as referred to in reply to PQ No. 13 of 3 November, 1999.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob):</NameTxt>
      <P>In August 1999, Bord Gais Éireann published a Review of Natural Gas Transmission Capacity Requirements to Year 2025, a copy of which is on the BGE website. The review outlines the findings of the &ldquo;Gas 2025&rdquo; project jointly commissioned by my Department and BGE. &ldquo;Gas 2025&rdquo; examined a number of gas demand scenarios, all of which envisaged power <Col N="1466" /> generation becoming the dominant source of overall gas demand by 2010.</P>
      <P>Currently gas demand for power generation represents 59 per cent of overall gas demand. Both the low demand and high demand scenarios in &ldquo;Gas 2025&rdquo; estimate that power generation will account for 70 per cent of overall gas demand by 2010.</P>
      <P>At present, approximately 35 per cent of all gas demand for electricity generation is met through indigenous supplies from the Kinsale Head Field with the balance coming via the interconnector. As the Kinsale Field depletes over the coming years, and in the absence of further indigenous gas finds, the interconnector will supply 83 per cent of gas demand for electricity by 2003. New gas infrastructure will be required by 2004 to meet rising gas demand. Here there are a number of possibilities &ndash; the Corrib Field, if it is developed commercially; further interconnection with Britain; or a north/south pipeline.</P>
      <P>The prospects for the Corrib field look promising but the consortium involved in the exploration of the field, Enterprise Oil and partners, has indicated that further appraisals will have to be carried out before a decision can be taken on whether the field is to be developed commercially. Until there is more certainty about its commerciality it is impossible to say what its potential impact on gas supply in Ireland will be.</P>

      <P>BGE's present workplan comprises six major pipeline projects in Ireland involving 120 kms of pipeline: Ballough to Kilshane (County Dublin); Abbotstown to Poolbeg (Dublin City); Caherlag to Ballincollig (Cork); Pilltown to Navan (County Meath); Baunlusk to Ballyraggett (County Kilkenny) and Ballyvass to Athy (County Kildare).</P>
      <P>In addition, my Department has recently received a request from Bord Gáis Éireann seeking approval under section 8 of the Gas Acts, 1976-1998, to extend the natural gas grid from Dublin to Galway and onwards to Limerick. The request is now being considered in my Department in the light of my obligations under the Gas Acts.</P>
      <P>The project will also have to be examined in the context of the emerging regulatory environment for the liberalised gas market and in the light of recent studies into gas demand and infrastructure requirements to the year 2025.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Growing gas demand dictates that new primary gas supply infrastructure will be required by 2004. However, an economic evaluation of future import infrastructure options, commissioned by <Col N="1467" /> my Department, recommended that no decision be taken until there is clarity about the commerciality of the Corrib field. While prudence ordains that we cannot wait indefinitely for decisions about Corrib, the timing and configuration of the additional infrastructure will depend on whether the Corrib field is declared commercial and on decisions by Enterprise Oil and their partners on where to bring the gas ashore and how to bring the gas to market. The primary initiative in relation to new pipelines rests with market players of which BGE is one.</P>

Certain criteria must be fulfilled. In the case of new entrants with no quota the applicant must have a separate, independent herd number and separate milking and milk storage facilities. In addition he/she must be under 35 years of age and satisfy certain educational and training requirements. The restructuring scheme is administered at milk purchaser level.

      <P>The person named submitted an area aid application on which he declared 72.16 hectares of forage area in 1998. However, the documentation provided only supported an area of 50.65 hectares. This represents a difference of 21.51 hectares or 42.46 per cent between the area claimed and that found. Under Article 9 of EU Regulation 3887/92, no penalty is applied when the difference is less than 3 per cent, the penalty is based on double the difference when it is between 3 per cent and 20 per cent and when the difference is over 20 per cent, a 100 per cent penalty must be applied. The penalty applicable in this case was therefore 100 per cent. The person named requested copies of the digitised maps of his holding for 1998. These maps were returned to the area aid unit on 28 October 1999 with amendments. These amendments are being entered on the Department's electronic database at present and on completion the application will be reviewed.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions 168 to 171, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the limited staff resources available at technical agricultural officer, TAO, level to carry out TB eradication and wildlife investigation duties at my Department's district veterinary office in Naas, County Kildare.</P>
      <P>On 1 January 1998, a total of two officers, based at Naas DVO were involved in TB monitoring duties in West Wicklow, one in south west Wicklow and south Kildare, the other officer in north west Wicklow and north Kildare. It is estimated that one officer's time was spent on West Wicklow's disease problems.</P>
      <P>As at 1 November 1999, it is estimated that two-thirds of one officer's time is spent on west Wicklow's disease problems. The duties involve arranging, tagging and removing reactors, supervising disinfecting of premises following removal of reactors, obtaining the names of contiguous herdowners and visiting livestock marts.</P>
      <P>My Department keeps its procedures and its deployment of staff at all offices under its control, under ongoing review with the aim of insuring the best possible service to its farming clients.</P>
      <P>My Department operates within the strict Government policy on Civil Service numbers. An additional TAO will shortly be assigned to Naas DVO and this will provide an opportunity for local management to review resources in the areas concerned.</P>

      <Quest>if, further to Parliamentary Question No. 117 of 14 October 1999, he will intervene with the area aid unit on behalf of a person (details supplied) in view of the fact that written confirmation has been submitted that he has the right to declare the parcel of land as he has the lands rented for the past seven years; if cattle headage payment will be released; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>As stated in my reply of 14 October 1999, one of the parcels claimed by the person named as part of his 1998 area aid <Col N="1478" /> application was also claimed by another herdowner. Letters accompanied by maps issued to both herdowners with a view to resolving the dispute. The other herdowner involved provided proof of his entitlement to claim the parcel in question.</P>
      <P>The area aid unit has however, re-examined the 1998 application submitted by the person named having regard to additional material which he submitted. While he does not have a right to claim the parcel in question he does have a right to claim a plot of land adjacent to this parcel. In all these circumstances the area aid unit is prepared to regard the dual claim as an obvious error on the part of the person named and to allow the plot concerned to be added to his application. This plot is currently being entered onto the Department's electronic database. When this process is complete any balancing payments due for 1998 will issue as soon as possible.</P>

    <P>The Protection of Animals Acts, 1911 and 1965, are the principal statutes governing cruelty to animals in this country. These Acts are enforced by the Garda Síochána. If any person has reason to believe that there has been an act <Col N="1479" /> of cruelty against an animal, the matter should be reported to the Garda for any action which they consider appropriate. The penalties for cruelty under the 1911 Act have been increased significantly in the context of the Control of Horses Act, 1996. These penalties now are: a fine of up to £1,500 and/or six months imprisonment on summary conviction; and a fine of up to £10,000 and/or two years imprisonment on conviction on indictment.</P>

    <P>Poultry products are imported from other member states of the European Union and from third countries, which may be exported direct to Ireland or through another member state.</P>
    <P>The importation of meat products is governed by the European Union harmonised rules. The main conditions for imports into Ireland are: advance notification to my Department of each consignment; the goods must be accompanied by veterinary certification or, in certain cases, a commercial document; the goods must come from an approved establishment, that is, slaughterhouse, cutting plant or cold-store which has been approved by the EU Commission; and the goods may be subject to inspection by officials of my Department.</P>
    <P>Imports of poultry meat products are selected for sampling on a regular basis to monitor the health status of the product. Under arrangements agreed between the Food Safety Authority of Ireland and my Department, 1,200 samples of imported poultry meat will be tested to check for the presence of illegal residues. It must be borne <Col N="1484" /> in mind, however, that particular imports cannot be specifically targeted for monitoring as Ireland, being a member of the European Union, is obliged under EU legislation to allow the free circulation of legally imported goods within the EU. Goods detected as not being in compliance with the veterinary control checks may be detained for further examination and if necessary destroyed.</P>

      <Quest>the indications he can give to farmers regarding the breeding categories they should incline towards in order to have a marketable product in the beef sector; the guidelines he will lay down in respect of quality and standards; and the way he which he disseminates this information to farming communities in order that they might avail of quality breeding and its benefits.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh):</NameTxt>
      <P>The breed of cattle needed for the successful marketing of Irish beef on our export market varies from market to market. As a general rule, the European continental markets require heavy, well shaped carcases with a high meat yield and low fat cover and the continental breeds fulfil this requirement best. The requirements of the live weanling trade are for lean well-conformed animals with a high growth rate, which can deliver uniformity. The continental breeds also fulfil this requirement. Our more traditional breeds of cattle as well as the lighter continental type animals are in demand for the UK market. Payment on the basis of grades is a very effective way of conveying market information to producers.</P>
      <P>As far as standards are concerned, the national beef assurance scheme Bill, currently before the Oireachtas, is designed to establish in detail the standards of Irish cattle and beef from production right through to marketing. It is intended that, when adopted, these standards will be applied through a process of registration, inspection and approval such that only those parties meeting the standards set will be approved for the production, processing and trade in Irish cattle and beef. An Bord Bia already operates a voluntary quality assurance scheme with the beef sector. This scheme is market led and is designed to provide assurances to customers about the quality, origin and integrity of Irish beef. It is essentially a code of &ldquo;best practices&rdquo; covering both farm production and factory processing and is monitored by audit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The dissemination of information about appropriate breeding practices to farmers to meet the specific needs of the marketplace is an ongoing process supported by my Department through the beef improvement programmes and the supervision of the beef carcase classification scheme. The recently established Irish Cattle Breeding Federation, which deserves the full sup<Col N="1485" /> port of the industry, is working to devise specific breeding objectives for beef cattle production in Ireland and to review the breeding improvement measures already in operation here. In addition, Teagasc has made a valuable contribution in this area over a number of years. Its booklet &ldquo;Breeding Better Quality cattle from EU Markets&rdquo;, which was published recently, includes extremely useful information on best breeding practices for quality beef production. Through all these developments, I am satisfied that significant improvements targeted on specific market requirements can be achieved in cattle breeding and production.</P>

      <P>The Guidelines for the Appraisal and Management of Capital Expenditure proposals in the Public Sector, published by the Department of Finance in July 1994, aim to assist public sector managers in their assessment of major capital projects.

    </Speaker>
    <P>The principal stages of project appraisal and management set out in the guidelines are as follows: preliminary appraisal, to assess if a project has sufficient merit to justify a detailed appraisal; detailed appraisal, aimed at providing a basis for a decision on whether to approve a project in principle; planning, involving detailed planning and costing on a project, with a view to deciding if the project should be financed; implementation, which requires appropriate arrangements in relation to tendering, regular monitoring and cost-control; and post-project review, which aims to review the outturn of the project and whether appropriate appraisal and management pro-ced<Col N="1486" /> ures were used. In addition, there is a system of regular monthly monitoring of all Government expenditure against budget throughout the course of each year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the year 2000 issue relates to the possibility that computer and electronic production systems will not recognise 2000 as a date and instead will read it as 1900 or some other date. It should be emphasised that this could potentially impact on businesses mainly, rather than on households or household appliances.  Accordingly, a comprehensive business awareness campaign is being carried out to raise awareness of the problem and provide guidance, under the aegis of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. The campaign includes a guide which issued to 150,000 business nationwide, seminars, a national Y2K information service for business free of charge and TV and radio advertising campaigns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, the Government has adopted a number of measures to deal with the issue. First, since 1996, Government Departments and public bodies have concentrated on remedying the problem in computer systems, equipment and plant and practically all critical business and service delivery computer systems are now year 2000 compliant or are very nearly so. Second, since the beginning of 1999, the focus has been on preparing business continuity and contingency plans for all business-critical operations in the civil and <Col N="1487" /> public service. Third, we are also looking at the co-ordination arrangements needed between the key sectors and the Government set up a national year 2000 emergencies co-ordination committee in September 1999, which I chair, to oversee and co-ordinate the year 2000 contingency preparations of the key national utility, health, security financial and business sectors so as to mitigate potential disruptions from year 2000 related incidents and-or millennium celebrations.</P>
    <P>It should be pointed out that responsibility for ensuring that systems are year 2000 compliant and that appropriate contingency arrangements are in place, is a matter for the sectors themselves. This includes the provision of information to the public in relation to the measures taken. Each of the key sectors involved in the provision of services to the public and which are represented at the national year 2000 emergencies co-ordination committee, are providing information to their customers, for instance the banking sector has conducted a campaign on money and the millennium. The key public utilities, road, rail and air services; gas, electricity, postal, telecommunications and broadcasting services are also engaged in publicity campaigns. Earlier this year, the ESB sent a customer care pack to every household in the country which included a leaflet on &ldquo;the Year and my home&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The emergencies co-ordination committee is currently reviewing the various sectoral public information campaigns and arrangements with a view to determining what overall co-ordination arrangements might be put in place. The committee will decide on the actions necessary at its next meeting on Thursday, 18 November.</P>

      <P>As of 1 April 1999 there were 743 people with disabilities employed in the Civil Service, representing 2.7 per cent of the total staff. Following is a tabular statement showing the percentage of staff with a disability, by Department. My officials are currently in the process of gathering the figures for 1 October 1999. That the numbers of people with disabilities has dropped below the target of 3 per cent continues to be a cause of concern. The heads of each Government Department and office have been made fully aware of the importance of reaching and maintaining the 3 per cent quota.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Civil Service Commission recently announced an open recruitment competition for clerical officers for people who are registered with, or entitled to be registered with, the National Rehabilitation Board, NRB, as having a disability. A panel of suitably qualified people will be established through this competition. Applicants will be facilitated by the provision of <Col N="1490" /> enlarged scripts, braille and audio test material, interpreters for interviews, and wheelchair access to test and interview locations. As soon as a panel of qualified candidates becomes available for appointment, each head of Department will be encouraged to draw from that panel when recruiting clerical officers.</P>
    <P>The figure of 3 per cent relates to the Civil Service as a whole. It is not always possible to ensure that each Department individually fulfils the 3 per cent quota at all time. For example, the regular and ongoing movement of staff between Departments may impact on the quota at any given time. In addition, a number of positions across the Civil Service may not be suited to those with certain types of disabilities. For practical reasons therefore, in monitoring the number of disabled staff, the aim at present is to achieve an overall quota of 3 per cent.</P>
    <P>The Civil Service, as an employer, is committed to a policy of equal opportunity which includes ensuring that people with disabilities who are capable of effective performance in the jobs to which they aspire are not disadvantaged by reason of having a disability.</P>
    <P>Since 1994 a code of practice for the employment of people with disabilities in the Civil Service has been in place. The code of practice covers issues such as recruitment, reception and integration into the workplace, career development, accommodation, equipment, safety and evacuation procedures. The implementation of the code of practice is monitored by a committee representative of staff and management. In addition, in the context of the strategic management initiative in the Civil Service, equality issues, including issues relating to the employment of people with disabilities, are being examined by a committee set up specifically for this purpose.</P>

      <P>Generally speaking, staff of Government Departments and offices are funded from the appropriate Department-office's administrative budget pay subhead which is settled in the normal Estimates process. Most Government Departments and offices operate under the administrative budget system and have done so for a number of years now, under which, among other issues, the allocation and deployment of staff is a matter for the Department or office itself. The actual allocation of staff to the Naas district veterinary office is, therefore, entirely a matter for my colleague the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development.</P>

      <P>It is not correct to say that the diesel used for leisure boating in inland waterways is free of excise duty. Such operators pay duty at the rate of £37.30 per 1,000 litres. In accordance with the provisions of article 8.4 of Directive 92/81/EEC, Ireland has <Col N="1492" /> been authorised by Council decision 97/425/EC to continue to grant a derogation from the payment of the full excise rate of duty in respect of diesel used for navigation in private pleasure craft. This derogation applies until 31 December 1999 and will continue to apply automatically for subsequent periods of two years, unless the Council decides unanimously before the end of that period on a proposal from the Commission whether the derogation should be abolished or modified.</P>
      <P>It is understood that the Commission will present proposals on this and on other derogations later in the year. Any such proposals will have to be considered, but as previously mentioned, any decision on the derogations will require unanimous agreement in Council.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not correct to say that a recent EU directive has issued which will result in a reduction in the price of a bottle of wine. The position is that the EU Commission has issued a reasoned opinion to Ireland, pursuant to Article 226 of the EU Treaty, concerning Directive 92/84/EEC on the approximation of the rates of excise duty on alcoholic beverages. The opinion argues that the present Irish alcohol tax regime is contrary to Article 90 of the EU Treaty in that the Irish excise duty on wine is, in its view, discriminatory as a consequence of the lower excise imposed on beer.</P>
      <P>We have responded to the Commission pointing out that: Irish excise rates on alcohol broadly reflect alcoholic strength of products; the ratio between beer-wine is approximately 1:3, reflecting the relative alcoholic strength of beer and wine actually sold in Ireland; beer and wine are not in the sort of direct competition which the Commission maintain and are not marketed, distributed or sold in the same way; and the EU Commission permits a zero rate of excise on wine in many member states which tax beer. This in itself is a distortion which the Commission has not acted on. It is a matter for the Commission to decide in the light of our response whether to pursue its case under legal procedures provided for in the treaty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>The 1998 Finance Act reduced the aggregate amount that a company could raise under the business expansion scheme, BES, from £1 million to £250,000. The BES limit was reduced to refocus the relief on start-up/smaller companies which find it hard to raise finance elsewhere. This was the original intention of the BES. It was also to reduce the growing cost of the relief to the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>The BES was due to finish on 5 April 1999. A paper prepared for the tax strategy group, in October 1998, concluded that information was not yet available to determine what effect the reduction in the aggregate amount a company could raise under the BES had on the scheme. However, initial indications were that the budget day changes had the desired effect in focusing the BES on smaller/start-up companies.</P>
      <P>The Finance Act, 1999, extended the BES to 5 April 2001. The scheme will be reviewed again before any decision is taken on whether to extend it beyond 5 April 2001.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>In its budget 2000 submission, in relation to services for people with physical and sensory disabilities, the Irish Wheelchair Association calls for additional revenue funding totalling £32 million to be made available for the provision of additional residential and respite places, day resource centres, personal assistance services and the introduction of a cost of disability payment scheme.</P>
      <P>Since the Government took office in 1997, a total of £38.162 million additional funding has been provided for services to people with physical and sensory disabilities. In line with the recommendations of the report of the Review Group on Health and Personal Social Services for People with Physical and Sensory Disabilities, Towards an Independent Future, this funding has mainly been allocated to address historical deficits in the voluntary sector, to address identified core underfunding of existing services and to develop a number of services such as respite, residential, home support &ndash; including personal assistance &ndash; day care, therapy services and sheltered employment. Once-off funding has also been provided for the provision of aids and appliances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Between 1997 and 1998, a total of £2.762 million has been provided for respite and residential services; £841,000 for day activity-day resource services and £902,000 for home support services, including personal assistance services. This year capital funding of £520,000 is being provided for respite and residential services and £1.477 million for day activity-day resource services. The allocation of development funding provided to the health boards in 1999 &ndash; £3 million, with a full year cost of £6 million in the year 2000 &ndash;  is being finalised by a number of the boards in consultation with their regional co-ordinating committees for physical and sensory disability services. Since 1997, an additional 95 respite care places and 51 residential places have been put in place. It is my policy to continue to <Col N="1495" /> develop these services in accordance with the availability of funding.</P>
    <P>The costs of disability payment is one of the recommendations of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities. The implementation of the Commission's recommendations has been under examination by an interdepartmental task force and the costs of disability payment is one of the items under consideration. A progress report is being drawn up by the task force.</P>

The figures in relation to 1999 reflect the information received to date from the health boards in respect of the first two quarters of the year and so are not necessarily complete.

    <P>
      <Col N="1496" /> The information available to my Department indicates that persons born outside Ireland accounted for approximately 8 per cent of tuberculosis cases in Ireland in 1998.</P>
    <P>My Department has issued guidelines to all health boards in relation to health screening services for refugees and asylum seekers. These include recommendations that medical screening and, if appropriate, medical attention for tuberculosis and a range of other infectious diseases be made available to such persons as soon as possible after their arrival in this country. This is in the interests of both those persons themselves and the general public.</P>
    <P>As it is considered desirable that the proportion of asylum seekers who avail of screening services should be higher than is currently the case, consideration is being given to ways in which the uptake of screening can be maximised.</P>

I understand from the Eastern Health Board that the contractor receives 28 per cent H2SiF6 in bulk containers from suppliers in Holland. The composition of the remaining 72 per cent is potable water. The material is diluted to a 14 per cent solution prior to transportation to the water reservoirs as required by the local authority.</P>
      <P>The most recent certification of laboratory analysis for a consignment to a local authority showed 14.01 per cent fluosilicic acid by weight and heavy metals as less than 0.012 per cent when expressed as lead.</P>

The principal method for ensuring optimal levels of fluoride intake is by the control of the levels of fluoride in public piped water supply systems, which are monitored on a regular ongoing basis.

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on means. Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board. Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.</P>
      <P>Income guidelines have been drawn up by the chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these are revised annually in line with the consumer price index. However the guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that his-her medical needs or other circumstances would justify this.</P>
      <P>The number of eligibility categories for entitlement to health services was reduced from three to two as a result of the Health (Amendment) Act, 1991. This followed the detailed analysis of the eligibility system by the 1989 Commission on Health Funding and its recommendation of measures to simplify the system and make it more equitable. In particular, the commission found that there were major problems and inequities inherent in allocating non-medical card holders to more than one eligibility category on income grounds. These problems were removed when the new eligibility system came into effect. A tiered means system of entitlement for non-medical card holders would presumably have to be based on income and would thus reintroduce these problems.</P>

      <P>Under the Health Act, 1970, a health board may make arrangements for the supply without charge of drugs, medicines and medical and surgical appliances to persons suffering from a prescribed disease or disability of a permanent or long-term nature. Diabetes mellitus and diabetes inspidus are among the conditions prescribed under the Act. Drugs which are directly related to the treatment of these conditions are made available free of charge. The operation of the scheme is primarily a matter for the relevant health board and information on the operation of the scheme with regard to the provision of drugs for the treatment of hypercholesterolaemia and hypertension arising from diabetes was sought from each health board. This information has now been received and is being reviewed by my Department. As soon as this review is completed I will communicate further with the Deputies in the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 223, 260, 261, 266 and 272 together.</P>
      <P>The Irish Medicines Board is the competent authority for the regulatory control of medicinal products in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>EU Council Directive 65/65/EEC defines a medicinal product as any substance or combination of substances for treating or preventing disease in humans or animals or which may be administered with a view to making a medical diagnosis or to restoring, correcting or modifying <Col N="1502" /> physiological functions. The directive does not make any distinction between conventional medicines and those medicinal products containing ingredients which may be described as &ldquo;natural&rdquo; or &ldquo;herbal&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Irish Medicines Board, in its recent guidelines on the interpretation of the EU definition of a medicinal product, has revised and updated the similar guidelines published by my Department in 1988. The policy in regard to the controls in force in respect of medicinal products including &ldquo;natural&rdquo; medicinal products has not changed in any significant way.</P>
    <P>If a product placed on the market includes a medicinal claim, the product concerned becomes a medicinal product and should be the subject of a product authorisation granted by the Irish Medicines Board under the Medicinal Product (Licensing and Sale) Regulations, 1998. These regulations give effect in this country to the EU Council Directive 65/65/EEC. Before the board may grant an authorisation, it must first be satisfied as to the safety, quality and efficacy of the product concerned. In the case of unlicensed products that may be available on the market, neither the safety, quality nor efficacy of such products would have been established by the board.</P>
    <P>Products containing the herb hypericum perforatum (St John's Wort) are medicinal products and, as such, must be the subject of product authorisations from the Irish Medicines Board in order that they may lawfully be placed on the market in this country. The decision by the board to recommend that products containing St John's Wort should be placed on medical prescription was taken following appropriate medical assessment by the board. This was subsequently advised to my Department. A number of reasons has been given by the board for its recommendation. These include the fact that the products appear to act as monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). These products must therefore be used with particular care because of risks of interactions, not just with other medicines, but also with certain foods. Patients therefore may be at risk from hypertension (increased blood pressure) if these products were to be taken with certain other antidepressants, over-the-counter cough mixtures (sympathomimetics) and with foods rich in tyramine such as cheese, yeast extract and red wine. Side effects such as photosensitivity, gastrointestinal disturbances, fatigue and nervousness have also been reported. Furthermore, the board has expressed concern at the possible treatment of mild to moderate depression by use of an over the counter medicine. The board considers that the treatment of such a condition should be under medical supervision and that self-diagnosis and self-medication are inappropriate.</P>
    <P>In relation to medicinal products containing ginkgo biloba, the position is that such products have been subject to prescription-only control since 1987.</P>
    <P>The placing of any medicinal product under prescription-only control is carried out in the <Col N="1503" /> interest of protecting public health and safety and where it is considered appropriate that such products should be used only under medical supervision and advice. The criteria concerned are included in EU Council Directive 92/26/EEC concerning the classifications for supply of medicinal products for human use.</P>
    <P>I am aware of concerns expressed by both consumers and representative organisations regarding the decision to place products containing St Johns Wort under prescription-only control and I would like to assure the Deputies that it is not my intention to in any way interfere with the rights of individuals to avail of appropriate medicines which they may wish to use. However, it is generally accepted that in the interest of consumer health and protection, some form of regulation of &ldquo;alternative medicines&rdquo; is desirable and this view is supported in principle by the health food and alternative medicines industry. My Department has ongoing contact with the European Commission through its various working groups and committees and I understand that the European Commission is currently considering what controls, if any, should be applied to &ldquo;health food&rdquo; products and &ldquo;natural&rdquo; medicines, including the possibility of providing simplified procedures for the licensing of alternative or traditional medicines, but no definitive proposals have been brought forward at this stage. While there is no definition of &ldquo;health food&rdquo; or &ldquo;foodstuff&rdquo; in European legislation, the forthcoming White Paper on Food Law, the aim of which is to simplify EU food legislation, may well make recommendations in this regard. Deputies may be interested to know that under European food law, no &ldquo;health claims&rdquo; may be made in relation to food. The White Paper is due to be published later this year.</P>
    <P>The suggestion that special labelling could apply to these products is a matter for consideration by the Irish Medicines Board in the context of an application for a product authorisation.</P>
    <P>On the question of consultation with the various interested parties in this debate, I would like to advise the Deputies that there has been an on-going discussion in the European Union, including the European Commission, in relation to the control of &ldquo;health foods&rdquo;, many of which have been claimed as being &ldquo;alternative&rdquo; or traditional medicinal products. I am aware that the Irish Health Food industry is represented in these discussions through its participation in ESCOP (European Scientific Cooperative on Phytotherapy). The question of working groups and further consultation in this area will be kept under review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>The safety and effectiveness of water fluoridation as a public health measure has been evaluated frequently by the World Health Organisation and other reputable authorities, such as the Health Research Council of the United States, and concerns about adverse health effects have not been substantiated. If an authoritative body in this country or internationally indicates that there is an issue of public health significance relating to the use of fluoride in water which should be investigated my Department would support this research in the usual manner.</P>
      <P>A survey of adult dental health carried out in 1991 found that no significant difference in regard to general health status between fluoridated and non-fluoridated areas.</P>
      <P>Health research in Ireland normally takes place under the auspices of the Health Research Board which identifies suitable projects based on priorities and peer evaluation.</P>

      <P>I have not been made aware of any specific concerns of health board management regarding potential legal issues surrounding the position of drug treatment services to under-aged addicts, where obtaining parental consent is difficult.</P>
      <P>The position regarding consent of minors is that under section 23 of the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act, 1997, the consent of a minor who has attained the age of 16 years to any surgical, medical or dental treatment, which in the absence of consent, would constitute a trespass to his or her person, shall be as effective as it would be if he or she were of full age: and where a minor has by virtue of this section given an effective consent to any treatment it shall not be necessary to obtain any consent as it applies to that treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to treatment of under 16 year olds the issue of consent of minors to medical procedures versus the consent of parents has yet to be addressed by Irish courts. Persons involved in the provision of treatment should obtain, wherever possible, the consent of parents or guardians before commencement of such treatment to under 16 years olds. If this is not available or <Col N="1505" /> forthcoming they must seek legal advice on the matter.</P>

      <P>Sildenafil (Viagra) did not receive a marketing authorisation until late 1998 and has been available on the general medical services (GMS) scheme and the community schemes since 1 July 1999. The drug has been made available in accordance with the recommendations of the expert group which I established to monitor the prescribing of Sildenafil (Viagra) and to recommend a prescribing protocol and controls which, while ensuring that patients with genuine medical need can obtain the drug, would also protect against possible misuse. I have no plans to review the current reimbursement arrangements.</P>
      <P>Figures relating to the cost of Sildenafil (Viagra) since it was made reimbursable on the general medical services (GMS) scheme are not yet available.</P>

      <Quest>the hospitals which have not implemented the 1992 Patients Charter guidelines on offering patients individual out-patients appointment times.</Quest>
      <QRef>[23231/99]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department recently sought information on out-patient appointment times from all acute hospitals, in order to assess whether any particular difficulties had arisen in relation to adherence to the standards specified in the Patients Charter. The specific information as requested by the Deputy is set out in the following table.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The initial analysis of the responses collected, shows that in a small number of hospitals, it has not been possible to date to fully implement the Patients Charter guidelines regarding out-patient appointment times due to logistical and other factors. However, these hospitals have confirmed that they are currently reviewing their practices with a view to offering individual appointment times. The survey also indicates that some <Col N="1508" /> hospitals offer appointments on a staggered basis with the interval between appointments set in line with the requirements of the individual clinics, and experience has shown that this is the most effective way of operating these clinics. Once again, the hospitals have indicated that they are keeping this practice under review to ensure that patient interest is served. In addition, some hospitals are currently carrying out individual patient satisfaction surveys and the specific issue of outpatient appointments is being examined in this context. Once my Department's analysis on this issue is complete, I will take whatever steps are necessary to ensure that the provisions of the charter are being met.</P>
    <P>The development of mechanisms for improvements in patient advocacy is an important task for my Department and in this regard, my objective is to provide a patient focused service, within which the priority must be equity of access to high quality of care, based on clinical need. The Patients Charter was an important step in developing awareness of patients' rights and I intend to develop a comprehensive policy which will build on the good standards of practice which the charter provides.</P>

      <P>The provision of medical services to eligible persons in this instance is the statutory responsibility of the South-Eastern Health Board. I understand from the South-Eastern Health Board that a good relationship exists between the board and Beaumont Hospital in relation to patient transfers. Transfers are not made on a trade off basis but are arranged on the basis of individual patient needs, as the occasion arises. This process is advised by the individual consultant involved and is also guided by the resources available with particular reference to acquired brain injury (ABI) patients.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on means. Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board. Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Income guidelines have been drawn up by the chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these are <Col N="1510" /> revised annually in line with the consumer price index. However these guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, he\she may still be awarded a medical card if the chief executive officer considers that his\her medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. Medical cards may also be issued to individual family members on this basis.</P>
    <P>In view of this special provision, I do not feel it justifiable, nor did previous Governments, on health policy grounds, to extend an automatic entitlement to a medical card to any specific group without any reference to their means as a general rule. It is of course open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer, of the appropriate health board, for health services if they are unable to provide these services for themselves or their dependants without undue hardship.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>The new drug payment scheme, with a threshold of £42 per month per individual or family, was introduced on 1 July 1999 and replaced the drug cost subsidisation scheme (DCSS) and drug refund scheme (DRS). The primary aim of the new drug payment scheme is to bring about important improvements over the previous <Col N="1511" /> schemes and the scheme is designed to be more streamlined, user friendly and to significantly improve the cash flow situation for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines. With regard to the increase, I would point out that there has been no increase in the thresholds for the DCSS or DRS since 1991.</P>
      <P>A common list of reimbursable items was introduced for the general medical services scheme and the drug payment scheme to ensure equity in relation to the products reimbursed by the State under both schemes. The list of reimbursable food items to which persons registered under the drug payment scheme are entitled is therefore in line with those items available to medical card holders and includes breads, bread mixes, flours, and pizza bases. It is considered that the range of such items available under State reimbursement schemes provides a reasonable choice and persons requiring items which are not reimbursable would be expected to meet the full cost of such items.</P>
      <P>There are no plans to include other coeliac foods in the common list.</P>

      <P>Economic and social progress and improved health services have combined to reduce premature mortality. This Government recognises the challenge to the health services of a rapid increase in the population of older people. The care of older people is clearly going to be one of the key issues to be addressed by the health services in the next decade. The challenge is to reorganise existing services and develop new services to ensure that older people get the most effective care available. In this connection, substantial additional development funding has been made available to provide the range of services for older people, including consultant led specialist assessment and rehabilitation services for the treatment of conditions affecting older people including osteoporosis.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the factors influencing the development of osteoporosis in Irish women and in particular the risks for post menopausal women of developing the disease.

However, recent information made available to me by the National Nutrition Surveillance Centre at NUI Galway based on a sample of 8,497 Irish school-aged children in primary and post-primary schools when compared with similar data from 28 other European and North American countries, shows that in relation to time spent exercising, Irish children rank about middle of all the countries surveyed. Earlier this year, the National Lifestyle Survey (Slan) commissioned by the health promotion unit of my Department was published. This shows that more than half of boys surveyed aged from nine to 17 years, participated in vigorous exercise four or more times a week. Of girls surveyed aged from nine-14 years more than half participated in vigorous exercise four or more times a week. However, there is evidence of a fall off in exercise levels in the girls' aged 15-17 years.</P>

      <P>The recently published White Paper on Private Health Insurance sets out the Government's position with regard to the provision of private health services in public hospitals. This includes the Government's wish to safeguard the core values of the private health insurance system, while facilitating competition, as well as its intention to regulate the market only to the extent necessary to protect the interests of the common good and <Col N="1517" /> to ensure that the regulatory framework is fair and consistent. I am satisfied that sustaining the mix of public and private practice in public hospitals is desirable and to the benefit of all patients.</P>
      <P>The White Paper proposes the development, over a period of five to seven years, of pricing arrangements which will more closely reflect the economic cost of such services. The main beneficiaries from the introduction of more realistic costing will be the teaching and regional hospitals where the gap between current charges and non-capital costs is most apparent.</P>

      <P>The German authorities responsible for medical devices recently informed the authorities in 38 European countries, including my Department, of the theft in Poland of 148,500 infusion sets. I understand that the devices were in their final sales packaging which indicated that they were sterile. However, the devices were actually being transported to be sterilised when they were stolen and are not sterile.</P>
      <P>Because of the dangers from a clinical perspective of non-sterile devices being used in situations where sterility is needed and in an attempt to safeguard public health in this regard, my Department felt it was necessary to bring the information which had been sent by the German authorities to the attention of all healthcare agencies in Ireland. Letters to this effect issued in October. The Irish customs authorities were also alerted about the problem. I am not aware of any evidence that anyone has attempted to place the stolen infusion sets on the Irish market.</P>

      <P>In March of this year, agreement was reached with the Irish Medical Organisation on a one-off arrangement for entry to the GMS scheme by doctors who met certain requirements, particularly as regards experience and qualifications. In essence, the agreement allowed for limited GMS scheme Entry for doctors having five years' full-time general practice experience. Those doctors would be in a position to retain any of their private patients, who after 1 March 1999, obtained a medical card. Doctors with eight years relevant experience would be able to apply for full GMS scheme contracts. They could take on any person having a medical card. For the sake of completeness, I should point out that a limited contract holder would, after accumulating the required eight years experience, also become eligible for a full contract.</P>
      <P>As regards the implementation of the agreement, the terms of the agreement required significant elaboration before they could be implemented. This involved further discussions with the IMO aimed at mutually agreed clarification of terms as well as consultations with the health boards on the practical steps that would be required for the processing of applications.</P>
      <P>Given the above, it was recognised by all parties to the agreement that a time factor was inevitable for the full implementation of the new arrangements. Accordingly, it was accepted that doctors benefiting under the agreement who, pending the processing of their application, continued to treat their formerly private patients, would be remunerated on the appropriate basis. All of the essential implementation work has now been completed and I am satisfied that appropriate procedures are in place for the efficient and proper processing of applications. Indeed, health boards are already issuing contracts under these arrangements and no undue delays should arise.</P>

      <P>A search of the literature has not revealed any recently published new scientific findings in the mainstream, peer reviewed medical journals on the relationship between licorice and loss of libido and other sexual problems. Over the years, a number of references have been made to the physiological effect of licorice, both taken as a constituent of chewing gum and in certain therapeutic agents. Of particular interest are cases reported in which patients suffered from high blood pressure, low serum potassium levels and other physiological disturbances. Licorice also has oestrogenic effects, manufactures female hormones, which may explain its ability to affect male libido and cause other sexual problems. It would appear that some individuals are more predisposed than others to suffer this effect of licorice. In the literature, doctors are recommended to consider the regular use of licorice in taking the history of patients who present with hypertension or the other conditions mentioned above.</P>

      <P>The price of drugs and medicines, ex manufacturer, in Ireland has been subject to control since 1972 through the mechanism of formal multi-annual agreements with the Irish Pharmaceutical Health Care Association &ndash; IPHA.</P>
      <P>The current agreement, which covers the period 1 August 1997 to 31 July 2002 and the previous agreement for the period 1993 &ndash; 1997, provides for a price freeze on the price of medicines to the Irish market. In effect, therefore, at the end of the current agreement, a price freeze will have existed for ten years. Accordingly, I am satisfied that the agreements with IPHA represent good value for money for the Irish taxpayer and I have no plans to re-negotiate the current agreement. However, in negotiating future agreements with the industry, my Department will take account of any overall price variations which may have taken place internationally to ensure that Irish prices for medicines are not out of line with international prices.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>The latest figures which are available from the health boards are set out in the following table and I will communicate further with the Deputy in relation to the data which is not readily to hand. The position in general is that the health boards provide aids and appliances to people with physical and sensory disabilities on a priority basis and, in urgent cases, these items are made available without delay. However, specialised equipment can take several months to deliver.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past two years, additional funding of over £9 million was allocated specifically for the <Col N="1524" /> purpose of addressing needs in this area which this Government identified as requiring urgent attention. Aids and appliances are also provided by a number of voluntary organisations providing services for people with physical and sensory disabilities. The position regarding waiting lists for these items is therefore more complex than may first appear, as many people, who are in contact with voluntary organisations, are not always known to the health boards. This makes it difficult to get an accurate picture of the overall numbers and the average waiting times for the provision of equipment within the sector. However, this matter is being addressed by the boards in co-operation with their co-ordinating committees for physical and sensory disability services with a view to accurately identifying the numbers on waiting lists and priorities for the provision of aids and appliances within the sector as a whole.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 275, 277 and 280 together.</P>
      <P>Local authorities who are responsible for the supply and treatment of water have year 2000 remedial programmes in place for some time now and are reporting progress to my Department every month. Latest returns to the end of October indicate that critical water treatment and supply systems are now Y2K ready in all authorities.</P>
      <P>The specific information sought regarding the locations of computerised flouridation systems is of an operational nature and is a matter for the relevant local authorities. However, my Department has engaged consultants who specialise in the area of water treatment and supply systems to assist local authorities with remedial work, to review progress in each local authority and to report to the Department on local authority progress with Y2K remedial programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the latest progress report to the Department dated 27 October the consultants have reported the following findings: there is no increased risk to water supply due to year 2000 problems originating within the local authorities' equipment; there is no increased risk to water disinfection systems due to year 2000 problems originating within the local authorities equipment; and there is no increased risk to final effluent quality due to year 2000 problems originating within the local authorities' equipment. Contingency planning is <Col N="1526" /> the responsibility of each local authority. However, part of the brief of the consultants is to assist local authorities with the preparation of contingency and business continuity plans. Returns from authorities to date indicate that these plans are being completed satisfactorily.</P>

      <P>I am advised by the Environmental Protection Agency that there is no undue delay on its part in providing information on integrated pollution control licences. The orderly build-up of the EPA organisation is ongoing, taking account of its wide ranging responsibilities and practical experience to date in administering functions such as IPC licensing. As part of that process, the EPA has recently been given sanction for an additional 49 posts, to be filled over the period 2000-02. These new posts will bring the EPA staff complement, including the five directors, to 233. The abridged estimates for public services in 2000, published last week, include a provision of £12.4 million for the EPA; this is an increase of 42 per cent on 1999 and will cover, <i>inter alia</i>, the cost next year for the EPA of additional staff, wider responsibilities and expansion of laboratory services.</P>

      <Quest>the way in which he will respond to the European Environment Agency's recent report, Environment in the EU at the Turn of the Century, which highlights that landfilling costs are far below those of incineration and, unless other regulations are in place, the market mechanisms act in direct opposition to the official community strategy.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace):</NameTxt>
      <P>The report in question notes,<i> inter alia</i>, current differences throughout Europe between the costs of landfill and incineration of non-hazardous waste, and concludes that these have to be counteracted either by regulatory measures to harmonise high environmental standards for waste management activities, including rules for the implementation of post-operative control measures, which would lead to an internalisation of external environmental costs, or other measures, including economic instruments such as a landfill tax.</P>
      <P>All landfill facilities are subject to waste licensing by the Environmental Protection Agency, and significantly increased costs are being incurred by local authorities in meeting the high environmental standards being applied by the EPA in this regard. As outlined in Changing our Ways, the polluter pays principle requires that these costs should be fully reflected in landfill gate fees and waste charges, which may be expected to increase accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In accordance with the policy guidance outlined in Changing our Ways, emerging local and <Col N="1531" /> regional waste management plans provide for the development of an integrated network of waste management infrastructure, including facilities for materials recycling and the biological and thermal treatment of waste. In the context of the implementation of these plans, and having regard to their overall objectives, consideration will be given to such legislative or fiscal measures as may be necessary to ensure the proper management and treatment of wastes. In this regard, my Department, in consultation with the Department of Finance, has already initiated an assessment of issues and considerations relevant to the introduction of a landfill levy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey):</NameTxt>
      <P>For purposes of the preparation of a national greenhouse gas abatement strategy to meet Ireland's commitment under the Kyoto protocol, a consultancy study on the limitation and reduction of CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions in Ireland was published by my Department and the Department of Public Enterprise in June 1998, as a basis for public consultation. In October 1998, the two Departments held a discussion forum for interested bodies, organisations and individuals who made submissions on the report. The submissions made, and the wide-ranging discussion at the forum, are being utilised in the development of the draft national greenhouse gas abatement strategy. I have asked Comhar, the national sustainable development partnership, to consider and make recommendations to me on the draft strategy by mid-December.</P>
      <P>As part of the development of an overall policy to ensure that Ireland meets its Kyoto target, I established a consultation group on greenhouse gas emissions trading to assess greenhouse gas emissions trading as it effects Irish policy formation. The group is also examining the option of the development of a domestic emissions trading market, and the implications for Ireland of an international trading regime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In April 1999, I received an interim report from the group concerning the formulation of an overall EU policy regarding the use of concrete ceilings on the amount of greenhouse gases that can be traded under the Kyoto flexibility mechanisms, including international emissions trading. A copy of this interim report, together with my response to it, are in the Oireachtas Library. I <Col N="1532" /> understand that the group is now preparing its main report and I hope to receive it as early as possible in 2000.</P>

The manual was prepared with the assistance of major international consultants and reflects good international practice in relation to the provision of quality cycle facilities. The manual specifically addresses the need for continuity in relation to cycle facilities and shows examples where this can be achieved with particular reference to the question of continuity through junctions and at pinch points. It also presents the options for the provision of bus and cycle facilities and sets out a range of conditions which should be met when providing shared facilities.</P>
      <P>In September 1998 regulations were made to give legal effect to certain of the new arrangements proposed in the manual.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government Strategy for Road Safety 1998-2002 has set out a range of policies and measures designed to reduce road deaths and serious injuries each by at least 20 per cent by 2002 relative to 1997. The first progress report of the high level group on road safety was published in July 1999 and details progress with implementing the strategy. Copies of that report have been circulated to all Deputies and are also available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>The report notes good progress towards the primary strategy target in the first year: 3 per cent less people died on the roads in 1998 than in 1997; 12 per cent less people were seriously injured in 1998 than in 1997: this represents the lowest number of serious injuries for this decade and constitutes significant progress towards the five year target of at least a 20 per cent reduction. More recent provisional data from Garda Síochána indicate that there were 361 road deaths in the first ten months of 1999 compared to 372 in the same period in 1998.</P>
      <P>Progress towards the supporting targets of the strategy has also been made. Car and truck speeds were slightly down; there were less fatal accidents in the night-time hours, commonly drink related; and engineering measures to reduce accidents have been implemented at 93 national road locations. The report also describes progress on key strategy actions scheduled for 1998 and 1999. The use of automatic speed detection systems has been extended and preparations were well advanced for the commissioning of fixed speed cameras; evidential breath testing for drink driving, scheduled to commence in October 1999, commenced this month; and on-the-spot fines have been extended to non-wearing of seat belts and a range of other road safety related offences.</P>
      <P>Certain strategy measures will require legislative change, in particular the proposal for a penalty points system. A new road traffic Bill is being drafted in my Department to provide for these changes. In accordance with the strategy consideration is also being given to the possibility of a legislative amendment to provide for random breath testing on a selective basis. The scheme of the Bill will be brought before Government at the earliest possible date with a view to publication by mid-2000.</P>

      <P>Apart from its own programmes, my Department has no information on the overall number and types of public tenders placed by Government Departments and State bodies or other regional and local agencies which have been the subject of legal action, under national or EU law, over the past five years.</P>
      <P>In so far as programmes funded by my Department are concerned, the local authorities are primarily responsible for seeking and accepting tenders. As part of the process of devolving more power to local authorities, a growing number of works funded by my Department do not require submission of tenders for approval. Accordingly, there may be cases where litigation was initiated by unsuccessful tenderers but my Department has no record of it. Subject to the foregoing, the following is the information available in my Department regarding relevant litigation in the past five years. N20 Adare to Annacotty road contract No. 2: SIAC Construction Ltd. initiated High Court proceedings in April, 1999. Proceedings ongoing at present; Ballinrobe sewerage scheme: SIAC Construction Ltd. initiated judicial review proceedings in High Court against Mayo County Council. High Court ruled in favour of council. SIAC appealed to Supreme Court which is referring an aspect of the case to the European Court of Justice; N2 Ardee-Rathrory: Fallon Construction Ltd. initiated a legal challenge in September 1997 to the award of contract by Louth County Council (value £5,337,410).

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 298 and 302 together.</P>
      <P>My Department will seek to co-ordinate information in relation to water and waste water services projects and to have it compiled and forwarded to the Deputy. Management and co-ordination of the national roads programme is a matter for the National Roads Authority from whom the required information may be sought.</P>
      <P>In July 1994 the Department of Finance issued Guidelines for the Appraisal and Management of Capital Expenditure Proposals in the Public Sector. Following this, my Department wrote to local authorities enclosing copies of these guidelines and reminding local authorities of the various circulars issued by the Department which supplement the information in the guidelines in relation to approval, design, construction, control and general management of capital projects.</P>
      <P>The need to improve cost control and design economy in relation to national road improvements was agreed by the Irish authorities and the European Commission in the context of the mid-term review (1997) of the operational programme for transport (OPTRANS). Two studies have subsequently been undertaken under the OPTRANS technical assistance programme to assist the improvement of cost estimation and control procedures for national road projects: Design Options for Major Road Projects (MC O'Sullivan and Scetauroute) and Cost Effective Approaches to Design and Construction of Major Road Projects (Bovis Ireland and Staveley and Partners).</P>
      <P>A national roads monitoring group, chaired by my Department, has also been established to progress the implementation of the key recommendations of these studies. The National Roads Authority, which participates in this committee, has already put in place new internal project control arrangements and is finalising road scheme development guidelines for local authorities. The NRA is also promoting a number of arrangements designed both to assist PPP procurement and to improve value for money.</P>

      <P>The Operational Programme for Transport (OPT) 1994-99 provides for a technical assistance programme, one of the primary purposes of which is to strengthen monitoring, evaluation and control systems. The programme specifically provides for studies designed to ensure that the optimum value for money is obtained from investments in national roads. The national roads monitoring group, which is chaired by the Department of the Environment and Local Government and contains representatives of the Department of Finance, and the EU Commission as well as the National Roads Authority was set up, <i>inter alia</i>, to assist in the coherent and co-ordinated assimilation of the recommendations of the various studies into the day-to-day planning, design and implementation of the national roads programme.

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey):</NameTxt>
      <P>The lane rental concept involves charging a contractor for occupying lanes of a public road. The intention is to encourage a contractor to find innovative design solutions to minimise traffic disruption and to ensure that the project is completed on time. The concept is especially appropriate to design and build projects &ndash; a form of public private partnership &ndash; given a contractor's greater control over a project. To date the use of lane rental has been employed in two design and build projects, specifically the N25 Kilmacthomas by-pass and the N9 Moone to Timolin.</P>
      <P>Future developments in this area will be overseen by the National Road Authority in the context of the policy framework set out in the National Development Plan, which envisages very substantial private sector participation in the delivery of the national roads programme.</P>

      <P>The Road Traffic (Public Service Vehicles) Regulations 1963 to 1999, devolve all significant decisions relating to the licensing of taxis, wheelchair accessible taxis and hackneys to local authorities. Under these arrangements, a local authority may, as a reserved function, declare an area to be a taximeter area, may determine the number of taxi licences to be granted in respect of that area and may also determine that hackney licences shall not be granted in its functional area. The grant of taxi licences and-or wheelchair accessible taxi licences arises in taximeter areas only.</P>

      <P>The Kyoto Protocol provides for a number of flexible mechanisms, including international emissions trading, to assist in reaching national targets. Negotiations on the rules, modalities and guidelines for the operation of the flexible mechanisms are ongoing, and it is expected these will be agreed at the sixth conference of the parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change in The Hague at the end of 2000.</P>
      <P>The Irish, and EU position is that domestic action should be the main means of achieving emissions targets and that the use of flexible mechanisms should be supplemental to domestic action. Ireland and the EU also consider that the trading of &ldquo;hot-air&rdquo; (i.e. national emissions in certain countries where the business as usual projections of emissions are below the permitted levels in the protocol) should not lead to overall emissions reductions being lower than would otherwise be the case.</P>

The Kyoto Protocol, agreed in December 1997 under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, provides for cuts in emissions from industrialised countries of approximately 5 per cent below 1990 levels in the commitment period 2008-12. It is acknowledged that the Kyoto Protocol is only the first step in combating climate change and that it is inadequate as a long-term response. The analysis of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the authoritative source of scientific information in this regard, indicates that cuts in global emissions of CO2 of the order of 70 per cent over the next 100 years and beyond will be required to ensure stabilisation of CO2 concentrations at twice the pre-industrial levels &ndash; IPCC Second Assessment Report, Summary for Policy Makers, Figure 7.</P>

      <P>The Air Pollution Act, 1987, imposes a general obligation on the occupier of any premises, including land to use the best practicable means to prevent or limit emissions causing air pollution or nuisance. In addition, the occupier of any premises is prohibited from causing or permitting emissions in such a quantity or manner as to be a nuisance. The Act also empowers a local authority to serve a notice on the occupier of any premises from which there is an emission specifying the measures necessary to prevent or limit air pollution. Where it appears to a local authority that urgent measures are necessary to prevent or limit air pollution, the authority may take such steps and carry out such operations as it considers necessary for this purpose, with an option for recovery of costs through the courts.</P>

      <P>I refer to the reply to Question No. 84 of 5 October 1999. Since then, my Department has updated the figures in relation to housing lands availability in the greater Dublin, Cork and Galway areas. This shows that the potential housing land supply in the Dublin Area could, subject to the necessary infrastructure development, increase to about 193,000 housing units over the next five years. This represents an increase of over 32 per cent on the estimate of 146,000 units contained in The Housing Market: An Economic Review and Assessment published in March this year.</P>
      <P>The National Development Plan 2000-06, published yesterday, provides for massively increased investment in economic infrastructure such as public transport, roads and water and waste water services over the next seven years which will provide necessary services to open up land for housing development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department is also pursuing a number of other measures to increase the availability of land and to make more efficient use of such land. Such measures include the provision of services for housing development through the serviced land initiative which will provide 100,000 additional serviced sites by the end of next year, the targeting of key infrastructure projects, particularly in the major urban centres where housing need is <Col N="1544" /> greatest, implementation of the residential density guidelines issued by my Department in September, and the acquisition on mutually acceptable terms of surplus State and Church lands. These measures and other measures relating to the supply of housing are being co-ordinated by a special housing supply unit which I recently established in my Department.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the Planning and Development Bill, 1999 requires each planning authority to develop a housing strategy to provide for the housing needs of the area covered by the development plan and which must ensure that adequate land is zoned for housing purposes.</P>

Responsibility for inviting, processing and approving applications under the scheme rests with the individual local authorities.</P>
      <P>I understand that on 1 July Kildare County Council invited submissions from developers with a view to providing houses at Celbridge, Clane, Kilcock, Kildare, Leixlip, Monasterevin, Prosperous, Rathangan and Sallins. A project officer was recently appointed with responsibility for co-ordinating affordable housing initiatives in the county. On the basis of submissions they have received the council has commenced negotiations with land owners/developers with a view to providing approximately 61 housing units in central Kildare. Further negotiations with land owners/developers will take place in relation to further submissions received.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme is to provide a basic weekly allowance to people who have little or no income. Any person living in the State who satisfies a means test may be eligible to receive assistance under the SWA scheme. While a person's primary social welfare or health board</P>
      <P>payment is intended to cover the normal costs of food, assistance towards housing costs may be given in the form of rent supplement.</P>
      <P>The purpose of rent supplements is to assist with reasonable accommodation costs of eligible persons living in private rented accommodation who are unable to provide for their accommodation costs from their own resources and who do not have accommodation available to them from another source. Rent supplements are normally calculated to ensure that the person, after the payment of rent has an income equal to the SWA rate less £6. This £6 represents the minimum contribution which recipients are required to pay from their own resources.</P>
      <P>The health boards are required to set reasonable maximum rent levels for various household types as a basis for calculating the maximum amount of rent supplement payable in each area under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. The limits are set by the health board using local knowledge as to what constitutes a reasonable rent for private rented accommodation for various household types within and across the health board area.</P>
      <P>These maximum rent levels are reviewed regularly to take account of the actual fluctuations in accommodation costs observed in each area. The health board must also satisfy itself that accommodation is generally available within these limits.</P>
      <P>When accommodation is no longer available within these limits, rent levels are reviewed and revised upwards by the health board. The South-Eastern Health Board reviewed their current rent levels during the year and the increases were applied from 1 July 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If any tenant is experiencing difficulties, the health board has discretion to award a sup<Col N="1547" /> plement based on an amount of rent which exceeds the maximum level set where there are extenuating medical or social circumstances having regard to the applicant's means and all the other requirements of the legislation.</P>

      <P>The last budget, which was announced in early December, 1998, provided for an increase of £6 a week for old age pensioners, together with an increase of £3 a week for all other social welfare recipients aged under 66 years.

      <P>The increased weekly rates of social welfare payments took effect from the beginning of June 1999.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>The primary objective of the social welfare system is to provide income support and, as a general rule, only one social welfare payment is payable to an individual.</P>
      <P>The carer's allowance is a means tested payment for carers on low income who look after people in need of full-time care and attention. A substantial package of improvements in the carer's allowance was provided for in the 1999 budget at an additional annual cost of over £18 million to improve and develop the position of carers. These measures were implemented between April and August this year.</P>
      <P>The provision in the Estimates for expenditure on carer's allowance in 1999 is almost £60 million which represents a 33 per cent increase on expenditure over 1998. At the end of October 1999, there were 13,853 carers in receipt of the carer's allowance compared with 11,234 carers in receipt of the allowance at the same time last year. The review of the carer's allowance examined the issue of paying the carer's allowance in conjunction with another social welfare payment. As indicated, the practice of paying only one allowance is a feature, with very few exceptions, of all social welfare payments and is designed to ensure that limited resources are not used to make two income support payments to any one individual. The review concluded that this practice should continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of the person concerned, she is in receipt of a carer's allowance at the current weekly rate of £114.80. This is the maximum rate payable to a person who is caring for two people. She is also in receipt of the annual respite care <Col N="1549" /> grant of £200, the free telephone rental allowance and is the holder of a free travel pass.</P>
    <P>This rate of payment of the carer's allowance exceeds the maximum payable under the widow(er)'s contributory pension scheme &ndash; i.e. £82.10 &ndash; and, as a result, it is of more financial benefit to the person concerned to remain in receipt of her carer's allowance.</P>

      <P>In addition to the 57 social welfare local offices which are Departmentally staffed there are 70 branch offices which are managed on a contract basis by branch managers.</P>
      <P>The programme to computerise these branch offices was completed earlier this year. The computerisation of these offices allowed, <i>inter alia,</i> for the abolition of cash payments at these offices. Unemployed persons who sign at branch offices are now in a similar situation to those who sign at social welfare local offices in that they are required to sign once every four weeks and they receive their payment each week at the local post office.</P>
      <P>Computerisation of the branch offices has meant a change in the workload in these offices and, in this regard, following negotiations my Department reached an agreement with the branch managers' association on a revised remuneration package and the introduction of changes in work practice.</P>
      <P>The agreement allows for the introduction of new work into the branch offices. In particular the role these offices play in delivering information to customers will be enhanced. Training is being provided to branch managers and their staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Arrangements have also been made for introduction of the remote certificate entry system in <Col N="1550" /> these offices. This facility allows disability benefit recipients to have their medical certificates entered onto the system locally instead of posting them to the Headquarters Section in Dublin. This facility is now available in 49 Branch Offices and will be introduced into the remainder of the Branch Offices in the coming months.</P>
    <P>The new agreement also requires the Branch Managers to improve the standard of accommodation they provide where this is deemed necessary. In this regard discussions are taking place with Branch Managers locally and, where appropriate, they are being asked to submit their proposals for improving their premises.</P>
    <P>The agreement provides the basis for a significant improvement in the level of service at branch offices and will enable these offices to be developed in parallel with the Department's own offices to meet the needs of customers.</P>

      <P>The family mediation service offers a free and confidential service to couples who have decided to separate, helping them to resolve in a non-adversarial way the issues which arise on the breakdown of a marriage.</P>
      <P>The nationwide expansion of the family mediation service is a priority objective in the programme for Government An Action Programme for the Millennium. This commitment has been delivered in two years since this Government came into office. The Government has increased funding for the service from £300,000 in 1997, £900,000 in 1998 and to £1.2 million in 1999 and the number of centres providing services has been increased from two &ndash; in Dublin and Limerick &ndash; to nine in that time. New regional centres have been established to serve people living in the south, south west, south east, midlands, north east and the west of the country. It is planned to open a centre in the North West before the end of the year. The Dublin service has been expanded and relocated to larger premises to deal with an increased number of couples and to take on additional trainee mediators. A new service for the people of Tallaght was officially opened in June 1999.</P>
      <P>Details of the locations of the centres are set out in the following table.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The major expansion of the service has been accompanied by a dramatic increase in the numbers of couples seeking mediation. In 1997, 484 couples were assisted by the service. This number rose to 684 couples in 1998 and has further <Col N="1551" /> increased this year with some 779 couples seeking assistance up to September 1999. Access to family mediation has been radically improved for people living outside Dublin and Limerick, including those living in rural areas, with the establishment of the new regional centres over the past two years. The Government is committed to the further development of the family mediation service so that couples facing separation are aware of the benefits of family mediation and have access to the service at a critical time in their relationships wherever they live in the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 334 and 336 together.</P>
      <P>The rates of child dependant allowances payable to social welfare recipients are set out in tabular form below. As will be seen, there are currently three different rates of CDAs payable to social welfare recipients. The reasons for this are largely historical. In line with a recommendation made by the Commission on Social Welfare, the rates were rationalised with the result that the number of different rates has been reduced from 36 to the current three. Further rationalisation would be extremely costly: the cost of paying all child dependant allowances at the highest rate currently paid is estimated to be in the region of £48 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that the loss of child dependant allowances by social welfare recipients <Col N="1553" /> on taking up employment can act as a disincentive to taking up available work opportunities. This problem was highlighted in various reports, most notably the report of the expert working group on integrating tax and social welfare.</P>
    <P>The policy direction followed by this Government has therefore been to concentrate resources for child income support on child benefit. Unlike child dependant allowances, child benefit does not contribute to poverty traps or work disincentives, as it is a universal payment which is not subject to a means test.</P>
    <P>The value of the child benefit scheme as an effective mechanism for the provision of child income support is reflected in the substantial investment which the Government makes in the scheme, at a full year cost of around £475 million per annum. The last budget provided for increases in child benefit of £3 per month for each of the first two children in a family and £4 per month for the third and subsequent children. This brought the monthly rates payable from September 1999 up to £34.50 and £46 respectively.</P>
    <P>Any further changes is a matter for consideration in a budget context. Following is the table:</P>

      <P>In order to qualify for the free scheme allowances &ndash; electricity/gas, television licence, telephone &ndash; a person must be in receipt of a qualifying payment and be living alone or only with certain excepted people. From 1997 people over 75 years who are in receipt of a qualifying social welfare type payment can receive these allowances regardless of their household composition or medical circumstances. Those not in receipt of a qualifying payment may qualify for the free schemes, subject to satisfying a means test.</P>
      <P>Anyone over 66 who is permanently resident in the State is entitled to a free travel pass. Persons over 75 are entitled to a companion free travel pass if they are unable to travel alone.</P>
      <P>The various free scheme extensions for the over 75s were announced in the relevant budgets and received extensive publicity at those times. The Department has operated a freephone service each year following the budget to deal with client inquiries. Details of these allowances are also widely available in all the Department's offices and at post offices and community information centres countrywide.</P>
      <P>The Department recently posted a booklet to 311,000 old age and widow(er) pensioners aged 65 and over who are in receipt of a social welfare pension, to mark the UN International Year of older persons. This comprehensive booklet is aimed at assisting pensioners to identify their social welfare and other social service entitlements &ndash; including entitlement to all the free schemes. The Department also intends to issue a specific mailshot next year to all pensioners over 75 who are not in receipt of the free schemes, to notify them individually of their potential entitlements and to obtain account details for bill credit purposes where this is relevant.</P>
      <P>Backdating of the free schemes was first introduced in June 1996. Those who apply and are awarded the schemes are entitled to apply for a backdate if they have good cause for having applied late. Unless there are exceptional circumstances this backdating extends to two years in addition to the year in which the application was made.</P>
      <P>In the case of persons over 75 years of age, their free scheme entitlement is backdated automatically to age 75 or to when the entitlement was first introduced, if they were over 75 at that stage.</P>

      <P>The analysis undertaken by the Combat Poverty Agency of the report of the expert working group on childcare recommends that child benefit rates should be doubled from the current levels over a three year period. It suggested that increases of this order would make a substantial contribution to the costs of bringing up children irrespective of whether they are cared for primarily by their parents or by child care providers. The agency noted that child benefit does not link provision for childcare with employment status, it does not act as a disincentive to women's participation in the labour market, or create unemployment or poverty traps.</P>
      <P>The value of the child benefit scheme as an effective mechanism for the provision of child income support is reflected in the substantial investment which the Government makes in the scheme, at a full year cost of around £475 million per annum.

This brought the monthly rates payable from September 1999 up to £34.50 and £46, respectively.</P>
      <P>It is my intention that the potential of the child benefit scheme as an effective mechanism for the delivery of child income support should be exploited to the greatest possible extent.</P>

      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme provides for a weekly or monthly supplement to be paid in respect of rent to any person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs. The scheme is admin<Col N="1556" /> istered on behalf of my Department by the health boards and my Department has no function in deciding entitlement in individual cases.</P>
      <P>The purpose of rent supplements is to assist with reasonable accommodation costs of eligible persons living in private rented accommodation who are unable to provide for their accommodation costs from their own resources and who do not have accommodation available to them from another source.</P>
      <P>Rent supplements are normally calculated to ensure that the person, after the payment of rent has an income equal to the SWA basic weekly payment rate, less £6. This £6 represents the minimum contribution which recipients are required to pay from their own resources.</P>
      <P>In addition to the minimum contribution, applicants are required to contribute any assessable means which they have in excess of the appropriate SWA rate. In effect, this means that all of the difference between the relevant SWA rate and the means which a person has goes towards rent or mortgage, thereby reducing the amount of rent or mortgage interest supplement rate payable. This can act as a disincentive to lone parents and other rent supplement recipients who are offered part-time employment.</P>
      <P>This aspect of the rent supplement scheme is being examined under Partnership 2000 in consultation with the social partners. Any proposed changes arising from this review would, of course, have budgetary implications.</P>

      <P>Child dependant allowances are payable in all cases up to the age of 18 years. Where a claimant is in receipt of a long-term social welfare payment, child dependant allowances are payable where children are in full-time education up to the age of 22 years, or up to the end of the academic year after the 22nd birthday. This applies to long-term payments, such as pensions, only; it does not apply to short-term payments such as disability benefit, unemployment benefit, short-term unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare allowance.</P>
      <P>The more favourable treatment of people on long-term payments is in recognition of the fact that families with children on long-term payments face a higher risk of poverty.</P>
      <P>The question of extending entitlement to child dependant allowances to short-term welfare claimants on the same basis as applies to long-term welfare claimants, including claimants of unemployment benefit, is a matter for consideration in a budgetary context, having regard to the resources available and to other competing priorities.</P>

      <P>I have already indicated to the House that my Department is reviewing the current method of assessing capital, which was introduced by my predecessor.</P>
      <P>As part of this review, a recent sample survey was carried out to identify the amounts of capital held by old age pensioners. This survey indicates that of the 35,000 pensioners who have capital, approximately 24,800, 70 per cent, have less than £5,000, while some 31,000, 88 per cent, have less than £10,000. Only about 4 per cent of pensioners surveyed had capital in excess of £20,000.</P>
      <P>In the light of the survey findings, my Department is currently examining options for improving the method of assessing capital. However, in addition to benefiting those already in receipt of non-contributory pensions, any reduction of the current assessment rates would also be of benefit to pensioners with substantial amounts of capital and who are not currently entitled to payment.</P>
      <P>I would be anxious, therefore, to ensure that any possible changes to the current rules would benefit those with modest amounts of capital while the system should continue to ensure that the small proportion of people with large amounts of capital should avail of it to contribute, at least partially, towards meeting their needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1558" /> As any relaxation of the current rules would have financial implications, such a change could only be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>The designation of special areas of conservation is a requirement under the EU Habitats Directive, 92/42/EEC of 21 May 1992, transposed into Irish law by the European Communities (Natural Habitats) Regulations, 1997 (S.I. No. 94 of 1997).</P>
      <P>Earlier this year I announced the terms of a compensation package for the cessation of turfcutting in raised bogs proposed for designation as SACs. Mullagh Bog &ndash; referred to on the official list as Killyconny Bog &ndash; is on such bog. The main provisions of the package provide for a payment of £1,300 per acre for turbary and fee simple, £1,100 per acre for turbary only and in each case, an additional lump sum payment of £1,000 where the applicant agreed to cease cutting turf in 1999. A streamlined scheme which allows for early payment of compensation has been devised and advertised in local papers. Under this scheme compensation is paid primarily on the basis of an affidavit sworn by the land/turbary owner. Payments have already been made under the scheme and Dúchas are prepared to make further payments on receipt of the necessary documents.</P>
      <P>I am conscious of the social and economic impact that immediate cessation of turfcutting in raised bogs proposed for designation as special areas of conservation would have on small communities and I have decided to make exceptional arrangements in the case of cutters for domestic use. Accordingly, such cutters will be given a period of up to ten years to make new arrangements.</P>

      <P>The General Register Office which is the responsibility of the Department of Health and Children contains the records of births, marriages and deaths which are primary records for genealogical research. My Department does not have responsibility for the provision of genealogical services except in so far as two of the national cultural institutions under my aegis make available source documents of various kinds to the public, namely, the National Library and the National Archives. There have been major developments in improving all the services rendered by these institutions recently.</P>
      <P>A very successful new genealogical advisory service was established by the National Library in mid 1998, which provides a free advisory service to visitors to the library. This is not a genealogical tracing service but advises the public on the sources they should consult in carrying out family history research. In July of this year this service welcomed its 10,000th visitor and caters for an average of 1,000 visitors per month. The library intends to develop its genealogical services according as resources &ndash; premises, staff and finance &ndash; permit in the years ahead.</P>
      <P>The National Archives provides free access for genealogists and the public to records and it supplies copies of archives on payment of a fee. In the course of the year 2000 the National Archives will make microfilms available, on a self-service basis, of the census returns of 1901 and 1911. This will improve the quality of the service to the public, while safeguarding the original records from damage.</P>
      <P>My Department assumed responsibility for the funding of the Irish Genealogical Project in November 1997. Following the completion of a comprehensive review of the project I decided earlier this year to provide Irish Genealogy Limited, as manager of the project, with funding of £210,000 in the current year. This funding is being provided to enable Irish Genealogy Limited implement a business plan, which addresses and prioritises a number of critical tasks identified in my Department's review.</P>
      <P>The Heritage Council presented its report on the provision of genealogical services in Ireland to me in December of last year which includes a recommendation to establish a new genealogy body. However, I feel that the necessary improvements can best be achieved by the integrated and co-ordinated development of the services provided through existing organisations.</P>

      <P>Many statutory instruments have been made under the Wildlife Act 1976. I assume the question refers to S.I. 178 of 1980 &ndash; Nature Reserve (Glen of the Downs) Establishment Order, 1980. There is no direct requirement under the Wildlife Act or the Planning Acts for a nature reserve to be considered as a factor in a planning decision per se. Wicklow County Council consulted with the then National Parks and Wildlife Service in relation to the Glen of the Downs road scheme. The Supreme Court is currently considering certain questions relating to S.I. 178 of 1980 and the proposed road widening scheme at the Glen of the Downs and I await their judgment on the matter.</P>

      <P>The immigration policy and procedures operated by my Department are summarised in a series of public information leaflets, which I recently placed in the Oireachtas Library for the information of Deputies. These leaflets are currently being reviewed and updated and should be regarded as subject to change. A major project is also under way in the law reform division of my Department to replace the Aliens Act, 1935 &ndash; which, together with orders made under it, constitutes the legal basis for immigration and residency control &ndash; with a modern code of immigration and residence law.</P>
      <P>In so far as migration for the purposes of employment is concerned, with the exception of a number of clearly defined categories, non-European Economic Area (EEA) nationals require a work permit prior to taking unemployment in Ireland. (The EEA consists of the EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway.) The work permit scheme is administered by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and decisions in respect of applications are taken by that Department having regard to,<i> inter alia,</i> the skills or qualifications of the person(s) concerned. My Department's primary function in relation to this scheme is in respect of the issuance of visas where required and I can assure the Deputy that these are issued in the overwhelming majority of cases where a work permit has been approved by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. Further details regarding the process and the criteria applied are set out in an information note available from that Department.</P>
      <P>As I have indicated in the past, I am prepared to consider new arrangements, including the establishment of a quota system, to facilitate immigration to Ireland to alleviate labour shortages. The press statement which was issued to announce the Government's decision allowing a certain group of asylum seekers to work also stated that we would issue visas on a limited basis to persons from non-EU countries to enable them to take up unfilled employment opportunities in Ireland and that the interdepartmental committee on immigration matters would be reconvened to decide the precise methodology to apply to the new arrangements. However, when the matter was discussed at the interdepartmental committee, I understand that the prevailing view was that the existing work permit system was operating well and responding satisfactorily to the emerging labour market needs of the economy. My position continues to be that I am open to considering any proposed change in present arrangements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department is responsible for the monitoring of the 3 per cent quota for employment of people with disabilities in the <Col N="1565" /> public sector, other than the Civil Service. Earlier this year, I set up a monitoring committee, chaired by my Department and composed of representatives of each Department, of the social partners under Partnership 2000 and of the relevant interest groups, to progress the attainment of this target.</P>
      <P>Provisional figures for 31 December 1998, compiled by the monitoring committee from returns submitted by the various Departments in relation to the public sector bodies/agencies under their aegis, indicate that the percentage of people with disabilities employed in the broader public sector stands at 1.7 per cent. This represents 3,050 persons out of a total staff of 178,980.</P>
      <P>The monitoring committee noted that a small number of the bodies have increased the number of people with disabilities they employ to the extent that they have achieved or exceeded the quota. The committee is seeking to determine the reasons for success by these bodies as well as ascertaining why the quota has not been met in other areas. Among factors contributing to the non-attainment of the quota are that jobs in some bodies, e.g., those which require certain physical skills or which involve policing type or other security type duties, may not be suited to persons with certain disabilities, that there are insufficient people with disabilities who have achieved third level qualifications where the job has such entry requirements and that in some bodies there has been no intake of new staff in recent years.</P>
      <P>As regards the steps taken to improve the situation, it is recognised that the putting in place of codes of practice will make a important contribution to the objective of increasing the employment of people with disabilities in the public sector bodies. My colleague, Deputy Dempsey, Minister for the Environment and Local Government, recently launched a code of practice on the employment of people with disabilities in the local authority service. The monitoring committee has endorsed this code as the model which might be suitable for adoption or modification by each body or agency under the aegis of Departments. Deputy Mary Wallace, Minister of State at my Department, who has special responsibility for equality and disabilities, has communicated this view to each Minister. She has requested their active support in progressing the adoption of codes of practice in relation to the public sector bodies/agencies under each Department.</P>

    <P>It can be seen from these figures that the detection rate is increasing. The Garda authorities also inform me that they are satisfied that the above crime figures do not justify having a full-time detective allocated to Baltinglass &ndash; however, when the need arises uniform members can be employed in plain clothes for crime investigation.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities further inform me that they are satisfied with the present policing arrangements in place in Baltinglass and that the present personnel strength is adequate to meet the demands placed upon it. However, I am also assured that the policing situation will be monitored and reviewed with a view to ensuring that a satisfactory policing service is maintained.</P>

      <P>The building and major refurbishment of Garda stations is carried out in conformity with a priority list compiled in consultation with the Garda authorities, Garda staff associations and Office of Public Works. There are 16 stations on this list with a priority higher than Ballinrobe that have yet to be addressed.</P>
      <P>It should be noted, however, that works are not always undertaken in strict numerical sequence as, for instance, the commencement of a project may first be dependent upon the successful acquisition of a greenfield site for the development.</P>

However, the Deputy can be assured that there will be no avoidable delay in starting work on this development, including the preparation of a sketch scheme by the Office of Public Works, subject to satisfactory progression on higher priority projects.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Registrar of Deeds and Titles that it is not possible to compare the average length of time taken for the issuing of a copy folio or file plan on an area by area basis as the length of time taken would depend on the number of similar applications lodged in respect of the areas concerned, whether the folio details are computerised or not for the areas concerned, whether the folios have a file plan prepared or not and whether the folios have any dealings or applications pending or not. It should also be borne in mind that the figures for County Mayo come within the collective averages for the Western Region.</P>
      <P>However, as a guide to the service provided by the Land Registry, I can inform the Deputy that the average output for the Dublin region is approximately 75 copy folios per day. ln the case of the western region the average output is approximately 118 copy folios per day. Approximately 25% of the applications in the region are for County Mayo.</P>
      <P>The main reason for ease of output of copy folios and file plans is the computerisation of folio details. Approximately 99% of all Dublin folios are computerised in comparison with 20% of those in County Mayo. In that regard, I am pleased to inform the Deputy that there is a research project already under way in my Department to develop the computerisation of the Land Registry on an ongoing basis.</P>

      <P>Finglas is one of six locations that have been prioritised for the installation of Garda CCTV systems as an aid to policing by the CCTV advisory committee. As I have stated previously, a shortage of technicians in the telecommunications section of the Garda Síochána &ndash; who are responsible for the planning and implementation of town centre Garda CCTV systems &ndash; has impacted on the progress in implementing <Col N="1571" /> CCTV systems in each of the six prioritised locations, including Finglas. I am having this problem addressed as a matter of urgency through the recruitment of 27 additional technicians. The recruitment process is now almost complete and 18 new technicians have been appointed. However, given training needs and so forth, it will be some months before the new technicians will be available to commence work on new projects in the telecommunications area, including CCTV.</P>
      <P>In all cases private contractors are used for the installation of Garda CCTV systems. However, the input of Garda telecommunications section is required at the initial stages of a project, to evaluate proposals and manage contracts. Accordingly, telecommunications section must develop technical specifications and issue those specifications to all interested contractors. A review of Garda CCTV systems is also under way at this time and consideration is being given to the feasibility of employing private contractors at other stages in the planning and installation of Garda CCTV systems.</P>
      <P>The extension of the Garda CCTV system in Dublin to include Grafton Street and its surrounding streets and the provision of a CCTV system in Cork city are the CCTV projects currently being undertaken. It is not, therefore, possible at this time to give an indication of exactly when a Garda CCTV system will be installed in Finglas as this is dependent on a number of factors including the availability of technical personnel, financial resources, the tendering requirements and, of course, the need for such systems to be integrated into Garda operational procedures. I can, however, confirm that it is intended to commence the planning and implementation of Garda CCTV systems in each of the prioritised locations, including Finglas, as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The allocation of Garda personnel and resources to individual areas is a matter for the Garda authorities who have advised me that the current personnel strength of Finglas Garda station, as of 31 October 1999, is 86 &ndash; all ranks &ndash; and that in recent times a policing initiative has been implemented in the Finglas area to try and address public order issues. A public order vehicle consisting of one sergeant and three gardai patrol the Finglas area, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Sunday from 7 p.m. &ndash; 6 a.m. On Thursday, Friday and Saturday an additional public order vehicle which consists of two gardaí is deployed in the Finglas area from 7 p.m. to 3 a.m. This is in addition to normal routine patrols i.e., uniform task force, detective and drug unit patrols.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities have also informed me that they are satisfied that the initiative is sufficient to cater for the current policing needs of Finglas. However, the situation will be monitored and reviewed with a view to ensuring that a satisfactory policing service is maintained.</P>

      <Quest>if he will make a statement on his recent meeting with the Japanese Association of Travel Agents; and if he has satisfied himself that Bord Fáilte's increased levels of promotional activity in Japan is bringing about increased levels of tourism from Japan to Ireland.</Quest>
      <QRef>[23353/99]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <P>(Dr. McDaid): On 17 September 1999, I hosted a welcome reception and dinner for the Board of the Japanese Association of Travel Agents (JATA) in Dublin Castle. The delegation was made up of 38 members of the Japanese travel trade who were on a week long familiarisation trip to Ireland which was organised by Bord Fáilte and included meetings with members of the Irish trade. In addressing the board, I described the event as an important occasion for Irish tourism. The first ever visit to Ireland of the JATA presented a unique opportunity for the Irish tourist trade to get involved in an initiative for the Japanese market. Over 40 Irish companies were involved in the JATA visit and this showed their commitment to developing the Japanese market in Ireland.</P>
    <P>At the dinner, I stressed the importance of the Japanese market to Irish tourism. The Japanese are high yield visitors who tend to spread their visits throughout the year thus aiding my objective of sustainable tourism development by ensuring a broader seasonal spread of visitors. I also took the opportunity to emphasise the attractions of Ireland to the potential Japanese holidaymaker, citing the warmth of our people, our green environment, our cultural richness and heritage, our food, drink and music as well as the variety of activities on offer. In particular I highlighted our attraction as a golfing holiday destination to a country where demand for golf facilities way outstrips supply.  On his return to Japan, the chairman of JATA wrote to me to thank me for the hospitality extended to the JATA Board and expressed confidence that their experience in Ireland would encourage the members of JATA to positively promote Ireland and contribute to an increase in numbers of Japanese visitors to Ireland.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1573" /> The number of Japanese visitors to Ireland has more than doubled in the past five years from 18,000 in 1993 to 38,000 in 1998. While the level and range of tourism promotion activity in individual overseas markets is an operational matter for Bord Fáilte, I am confident that Bord Fáilte's increased level of promotional activity in respect of the Japanese market, which started with the JATA visit in September, will result in further increases in tourism revenues and visitor numbers in years to come.</P>

Financial support is provided for pilot programmes/actions that are demonstrable in nature and will become sustainable. Under the terms of the programme, all funds must be committed by 31 December 1999.</P>
      <P>The three URBAN Steering Groups in Ireland (north Dublin, south Dublin and Cork city), who are fully responsible for the evaluation, selection and approval of projects within the context of approved local action plans and the URBAN budget available to them, had a clear mandate to support only projects which addressed the issue of sustainability.</P>
      <P>The sponsors of the full day care facility for children project at Newbury House, at the time of their approval for grant assistance of £76,000 from the Cork URBAN steering group, were fully aware of the time limits which applied to the URBAN operational programme and specifically indicated their intention to seek alternative sources of funding after 31 December 1999. It was on this basis that the grant was approved.</P>
      <P>As all funding available to the Cork City Urban Steering Group has been fully committed, there is no provision available under the URBAN programme from which additional funds can be provided.</P>
      <P>Assistance from social inclusion measures has been provided for in the new National Development Plan, 2000-2006, further details of which will be available on completion of the regional operational programmes under which these moneys will be expected.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 385 and 386 together.</P>
      <P>My Department sanctions teacher allocations for each primary school based on a staffing schedule which issues each year. However, the appointment of teachers is a matter for each individual board of management. My Department does not maintain records, therefore, of any vacancies which individual schools may have at any given time.</P>
      <P>I am aware that there is a shortage of trained teachers at present, and that some boards of management are having difficulty in appointing qualified teachers to schools. For this reason, I have introduced a range of measures designed to boost substantially the supply of trained teachers. Specifically, I have ensured that there are over 1,000 places available in the colleges of education during the current academic year. This includes 730 students who are pursuing the three year B. Ed degree programme while 280 degree holders are pursuing an 18 month full time post graduate course.</P>
      <P>Additionally, B. Ed graduates of St. Mary's College, Belfast who have studied Irish to honours level as an academic subject as part of their teaching qualification will be recognised as fully trained.</P>
      <P>I am also examining the possibility of the University of Limerick providing a one year conversion course for degree holders, who hold the Higher Diploma in Education and who have either Irish as part of their degree or have Irish to grade C at the Leaving Certificate or its equivalent.</P>
      <P>From 1 September 1998, all primary degree holders who also hold the Higher Diploma in Education have been recognised as fully trained for the purposes of providing substitution service. In addition, from 1 September 1999, all primary degree holders who also hold the Higher Diploma in Education are recognised as fully trained for temporary teaching service provided that they have Irish to grade C at higher level leaving certificate standard or its equivalent.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, Montessori trained teachers who successfully completed the course of three years duration at St. Nicholas, Dun Laoghaire, which is recognised by the NCEA, have been recognised from 1 September 1998 as fully trained substitutes provided that they Irish to Grade C at higher level leaving certificate or its equivalent.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the claim made by the officer in County Kilkenny VEC for the payment of enhanced allowances in respect of acting-up duties.</P>
      <P>The rates of substitution and acting-up allowances are determined by agreement reached at the Conciliation Council established for VEC clerical and administrative staff and are then circulated to committees. An application for the payment of an enhanced allowance was received from County Kilkenny VEC in respect of a person who was acting up to a higher grade. My Department gave sanction for the payment of an acting up allowance in accordance with the agreed rates.</P>
      <P>Representations were received to have a higher allowance paid and a case in County Wicklow VEC was cited in support of the claim. Following consideration of the circumstances of the case referred to, my Department decided that the payment agreed in that case did not have due regard for the agreed terms governing such payments and consequently, my Department did not accept that it constituted a precedent for the sector as a whole. Accordingly, sanction for a higher allowance was refused. The payment agreed in County Wicklow is no longer in payment.</P>

      <P>The Pathways Through Education Programme referred to by the Deputy is one of a large number of projects supported under the EU EMPLOYMENT Community Initiative which provides financial support for a range of innovatory projects under four strands as follows: HORIZON, for people with disabilities, INTEGRA, for disadvantaged and socially excluded, NOW, new opportunities for women and YOUTHSTART aimed at young people up to 20 who are at risk of social exclusion.</P>
      <P>Overall, at national level, funding for these initiatives is managed by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1584" /> In this case the project promoters have recently circulated general background information and documentation to officials in a number of Departments with a view to meeting Departmental representatives for discussions in the near future. The material provided by the project does not advance any specific proposals or contain a request for funds.</P>
    <P>The aims of the EMPLOYMENT initiative are to promote social solidarity and equal opportunities, to contribute to the development of human resources and to improve access to the labour market. Overall some 132 projects were supported in 1995-1997, and a further 126 are now under way with a view to completion in early 2000. The transfer of the learning from these innovative projects to mainstream systems is also envisaged under the initiative. For example, this may involve mainstreaming good practice or policy lessons or lead to a continuation of the activities of the project.</P>
    <P>In my Department, mainstreaming of the learning from the projects is generally pursued through direct contact with some project providers, links between my Department and the national support structures established for the initiative strands, and in the Mainstreaming Forum established by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The higher education grant schemes operate under the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992. These Acts define a mature student to mean a person &ldquo;of not less than 23 years of age, or such other age as may stand specified for the time being in regulations made by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance, who have secured places in approved institutions and have reached that age on the 1st day of January, or such other date as may be prescribed from time to time by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance, in the year of entry to such institutions&rdquo;. The Acts further provide, <i>inter alia</i>, for the making of grants to mature students whose means and those of their parents, where the mature students are dependent on their parents, and the means of their spouses, if any, do not exceed prescribed limits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the terms of the higher education grants schemes, mature students are categorised as either independent mature students or mature <Col N="1585" /> students dependent on parents. An independent mature student is defined to mean a mature student who was not ordinarily resident at home with his or her parents from the October preceding their entry to an approved course. Independent mature students are deemed to be self-supporting and are assessed without reference to either their parents' income or address.</P>
    <P>When assessing the means of students other that mature students, the Acts specify that the students' means and those of their parents or guardians must be below a prescribed limit. This provision requires that parental income be taken into account irrespective of the individual circumstances in any case where the student is not a mature student.</P>

      <P>The board of management of the school referred to submitted an application for the appointment of an additional teacher in the current school year.</P>
      <P>The staffing warranted for a particular school year is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous year. The enrolment of St. Fergal's Boys NS on 30 September 1998 was 163 pupils which warrants a staffing of principal plus five assistant teachers for the 1999-2000 school year.</P>
      <P>The application for the additional teacher was recently examined by my Department. The school is not in breach of the maximum class size guidelines for the current school year in accordance with the terms of Circular 5/99.</P>
      <P>I regret therefore that the appointment of an additional teacher cannot be sanctioned in the current school year.</P>

      <P>This is the case of a person who left second level schooling in 1992. Following a parliamentary question last year, a psychologist from my Department visited the person in the person's home. Having ascertained that the person was seeking support in relation to possible further educational opportunities which might be available, a full psychological assessment was carried out. The psychologist met with the person on four more occasions and provided appropriate information, which included names and addresses of relevant organisations, as well as advice on a range of available options. He also met with the person's mother on three occasions. No information is available as to whether the advice given was acted upon by the person in question or the by person's mother.</P>

      <P>Funding at the disposal of the youth affairs section of my Department is designated principally to ensure the provision of non-formal educational opportunities for young people. To do this, grant-aid is provided to youth organisations at national level, to special youth work projects that assist disadvantaged young people and to a network of youth information centres throughout the country.</P>
      <P>The youth affairs section provides financial support to the youth arts programme, a partnership between the Department of Education and Science, the Arts Council, and the National Youth Council of Ireland. It also provides funding to the National Association of Youth Drama.</P>
      <P>A request for information on grants available from the youth affairs section was received in March 1999 from the young Irish film makers. It was indicated to them that it might be more appropriate for them to forward their enquiry to the Arts Council.</P>

      <P>In considering any such request for a change in status, my Department would have to take various matters into account such as the suitability of the schools buildings to accommodate a co-educational approach and the impact that a change of status may have on the enrolments of other schools in the locality.</P>

      <P>The European social fund aided third level course maintenance grants scheme is administered by the Vocational Education Committees. Under the terms of the scheme, grants are tenable for the normal duration of the approved course and are renewable annually subject to satisfactory attainment and the approval of the VEC. Grants are provisional for the year in which they are first awarded and are only continued in subsequent academic years where the VEC is satisfied that the provisions of the scheme continue to be complied with fully. Where a candidate is being re-assessed the current reckonable income limits are applied.</P>
      <P>I understand from County Waterford Vocational Education Committee that the reckonable income in his case exceeds the current income limits for the award of a grant in respect of the 1999-2000 academic year and therefore the candidate to whom the Deputy refers is ineligible for grant assistance in respect of the current year.</P>
      <P>The assessment of means under the third level student support schemes is based on gross income with certain deductions for specified social welfare and health board payments. Any proposal to move to a means assessment system based on net income would have significant financial implications in addition to equity issues which would have to be addressed. These means test arrangements have been in operation since 1983 and are applied nationally.</P>
