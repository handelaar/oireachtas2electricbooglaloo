      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, a Chathaoirligh an tSeanaid agus a Chomhaltaí na Dála agus an tSeanaid, is mór liom an phribhléid bhunreachtúil labhairt le baill Dhá Theach an Oireachtais cruinnithe le chéile. Agus muid i mbéal na mílaoise is fóirstineach an ócáid í <Col N="1882" /><Col N="1883" /> chun an deis seo a thapú. Míle bliain ó shin scríobh manach Éireannach na línte seo agus é ag smaoineamh ar an chéad mhíleaois:</P>
      <P>Ní mhaireann glún den ghinealach</P>
      <P>a chuaigh romhainn siar go hÁdhamh;</P>
      <P>mise féin ní feasach mé</P>
      <P>an liom an lá amárach.</P>
      <P>Is cuí agus is tairbheach dúinn, agus muid ar chuspa ócáide móire, súil a chaitheamh siar ar a bhfuil caite agus caillte, ar a bhfuil déanta agus thart. Murach sin is beag a bheadh foghlamtha againn mar chine. Ach ní miste dúinn fosta aghaidh a thabhairt ar an todhchaí; agus, murab ionann is an manach bocht tinneallach, is cóir dúinn é a dhéanamh go hurrúsach, lán dóchais agus dánachta, lán mórtais agus cinnteachta, muid múnlaithe ag a bhfuil imithe ach gan a bheith faoi chuing ag an stair.</P>
      <P>Fifteen days from now a page of history will turn and the world will mark the beginning of the third millennium. We know that in the natural world where things change over millions of years, not a thing will change on that date. However, we human beings measure our brief lives in years rather than centuries and for us the beginning of the year 2000 is an occasion of great symbolic importance. Because of this I think it is right to avail &ndash; as the National Millennium Committee suggested &ndash; of the privilege which the Constitution accords the President of delivering an address to both Houses of the Oireachtas meeting in Joint Session.</P>
      <P>On the eve of this new millennium, as one age yields place to another, it seems timely to take a backward glance at the journey we and our ancestors have come and to reflect together on the new destinies open to us as a people. For what marks us off most from those who preceded us is the capacity we now have to control our world and to shape our future. More than that, unlike the natural world, we human beings can change ourselves. In his poem <i>Celebration, </i>Micheál Ó Siadhail talks of:</P>
      <P>Lines with loops of days or months or years</P>
      <P>We don't know how to begin to think of time:</P>
      <P>A first reflection must surely bring us back to the beginning of these two thousand years and to the significance for the Christian world of this otherwise arbitrary calendar date.</P>
      <P>Throughout history, women and men have sought to make sense of the world, of the transience of human life and the inevitability of death. That quest has led many people in many cultures and many ages to a search for the divine, the transcendent, a search for God. Christians believe that at a moment in time that search was reversed. God sought out humanity; the divine took human form in a child born in Bethlehem: God's gift of his son to help us understand the transformative power of love. Many people on this island are Christian and for them it is this momentous event 2000 years that we now celebrate.</P>
      <P>There are many among us who are people of deep faith and who are not Christians. There are those who have no faith and those who have no time for religion. They will, I hope, understand and patiently respect the importance which Christians, in particular, attach to this great jubilee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We can, however, every one of us, join together in celebrating the secular significance of this particular new year, for when we add the new political dispensation in Northern Ireland to our recent economic success and our remarkable cultural confidence, it is evident that for Ireland <Col N="1884" /><Col N="1885" /> this millennial moment is not just an important anniversary but a time of genuine and profound change. It is a time of hope, of celebration and joy. The shadows of the past are lifting.</P>
    <P>So often we have felt the heavy weight of that past. As the poet Brendan Kennelly put it:</P>
    <P>My dark fathers lived the intolerable day</P>
    <P>Committed always to the night of wrong.</P>
    <P>So accustomed have we become to seeing ourselves as the objects and not the subjects of our own history that perhaps we do not yet fully understand the extent to which the weight of the past is now lifting and opening up new possibilities to us.</P>
    <P>The decisions we make now and in the years ahead, the values which imbue those decisions and the use we make of today's opportunities, these will give our future its shape and its depth. They will determine the kind of Ireland we hand on to future generations for while, thankfully, we have come a long way, we still have a distance to travel before our star stops over an Ireland where the shadows have lifted for all our people. The choices are ours. Will the old iniquities and inequalities lurk beneath the veneer? Will idealism be dulled by selfish materialism, shrill begrudgery and apathy or will we bequeath to our children a land of peace, prosperity, equal opportunity and respect for difference?</P>
    <P>There was a time in our history in the middle part of the first millennium when we came pretty close to such an Ireland. We speak of it as our golden age. St. Patrick, who came to our shores as a stranger, bringing with him a new way of looking at God, connected in an imaginative way with the Irish people. As Thomas Cahill says, &ldquo;Patrick's gift to the Irish was his Christianity &ndash; the first de-Romanized Christianity in human history&rdquo;. It was a Christianity that fused, that melted easily into Irish life, growing side by side with the old pagan culture, with no anxiety to obliterate it.</P>
    <P>As a result Ireland was transformed into something new, a place with a distinctive psychological identity, capable of seamless yet radical change. Respect for difference became enshrined in the rule books of our convents and monasteries. St. Bridget declared: &ldquo;Different is the condition of everyone&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The rule of St. Carthage said: &ldquo;And different the nature of each place&rdquo;. I am fairly sure Columbanus, our first great ambassador to France, must have raised a few eyebrows when he asserted, <i>&ldquo;Amor non tenet ordinem&rdquo;</i>&ndash; Love has nothing to do with order. Love and respect for difference are the natural precursors of peace and its younger sibling, prosperity. Many of the conditions that facilitated that former glorious period of our history are now once again falling into place on our island.</P>
    <P>That golden age did not last. It fell victim to the Viking invasion and indeed much of our subsequent history through the centuries up to very recent times is a litany of hopes raised and then dashed, one lament after another. Little wonder that we gained a reputation as a nation of romantic dreamers whose dreams seemed unlikely ever to come to pass.</P>
    <P>It is true that the reality of Irish life for many people was often more nightmare than dream; most of our ancestors lived on brinks very different from the one that we are privileged to be on. The wars, invasions, rebellions, plantations and plagues they endured brought awful suffering, culminating in the Ocras Mór, the unbearable tragedy of the Famine which ravaged Ireland in the last century.</P>
    <P>Many of our senior citizens will remember their own childhoods in the early years of this century when poverty and deprivation of an awful order stalked this land. Children died in their thousands. A swelling stream of emigrants, many of them young women, flowed out of Ireland on every vessel from every port. In the words of an American journalist writing in 1909: &ldquo;The Irish in Ireland are kept alive by the Irish who have been driven to other lands.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1886" />
      <Col N="1887" /> There was still more grief to come, more cause to lament as a new generation's bid for freedom from the grip of colonialism gave us the Easter Rising, the War of Independence and a bitter civil war. Along with the forgotten dead in Flanders, each left behind a legacy of success and failure, of pride and contempt, the scarring inheritance, the unfinished business of the next generation.</P>
    <P>Yet even in the darkest days of our chequered past our unique Irish psychological identity shone through. Edmund Campion, the English Jesuit martyred at Tyburn in 1581, said of the Irish:</P>
    <P>The people are thus inclined.. Franke.. Sufferable of paines infinite. great almes-givers, surpassing in hospitalitie. they are sharp-witted, lovers of learning, capable of any studie whereunto they bend themselves, constant in travaile, adventurous, intractable, kinde-hearted, secret in displeasure.</P>
    <P>These were the qualities which kept and still keep so many of our people going through the good times and the bad &ndash; and of the bad times there have many.</P>
    <P>The difficult birth of the new State did not create a magic wand with which it could wave away its many problems. With hindsight we see the faults and failings of our infant State &ndash; its introspection, its economic instability, the limits it imposed on women, its confessionalism, its dark side where vulnerable children suffered dreadfully and in silence, its failure to adequately address the consequences of Partition and much more.</P>
    <P>Yet we also need to acknowledge the good that was done. Many people worked tirelessly to build that fledgling State out of the chaos of empire. They gave us a democracy, something which had never existed before on this island. They stitched together the tattered and scattered fragments of our cultural heritage, breathed new life into our weary, collective Irish psyche and kick-started what was a Third World country. We owe so much to those men and women from every walk of life, lay and clerical. A great many never saw their dreams realised in their own lifetimes, but in very difficult times they used the meagre tools at their disposal to lay the foundations of this Ireland of today.</P>
    <P>We owe a debt of gratitude too to those who left this island. Some went as missionaries or as volunteers in health care and education, some went simply in search of adventure. Most emigrants, however, left reluctantly, driven out by hardship and lack of opportunity in circumstances no different from those which bring refugees from other parts of the world to our shores today. These were not the celebrated Wild Geese or political refugees of previous centuries. They were poor men and women who ploughed very lonely furrows in strange lands.</P>
    <P>It was our emigrants who globalised the name of Ireland. They brought our culture with them, refreshed and enriched it with the new energy it absorbed from the varied cultures into which they transplanted it. Many of them kept faith with our island's destiny through the generations. They gave us that huge multicultural Irish family now proudly celebrated and acknowledged in the new Article 2 of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>Who could have predicted even a decade ago this Ireland of the lifting shadows? The economic landscape has been transformed, the tide of emigration reversed, a new and more self-confident generation neither docile nor xenophobic has made, as St. Patrick did, a new, imaginative connection with the wider world. Our great literary tradition has been built on making Ireland a centre of gravity for arts and culture; urban and rural communities the length and breadth of the country have found a high achieving new empowerment based on partnership; old enemies have become friendly neighbours; peace is no longer a rumour, it is real.</P>
    <P>Today, where the name of Ireland is spoken, the word success is very close behind. We really <Col N="1888" /><Col N="1889" /> have taken our place among the nations of the world. Part of our success we undoubtedly owe to our membership of the European Union. Part of our success we owe to ourselves, to the spirit of enterprise, of partnership and common purpose among our people, to the genius and initiative which was unlocked by widening educational opportunity, to the visionary leadership and public endeavour which together pushed Ireland into a new gear.</P>
    <P>Along with the manifest benefits of success have come new challenges. We are the first generation to have the eradication of poverty within our grasp, the first generation to experience Ireland as a land of fresh starts and new opportunity for people from other cultures. We are the first generation to be seriously tested on the bona fides of our legendary hospitality, our &ldquo;Céad Míle Fáilte&rdquo;. We are the first generation for centuries to have the opportunity to build and consolidate a lasting peace between this island's two traditions. And so, as the shadows lift, the world looks very different. The world is very different.</P>
    <P>Nowhere, of course, is that more obvious than in Northern Ireland. Seamus Heaney's poem, <i>Cure at Troy,</i> reminds us:</P>
    <P>Human beings suffer.</P>
    <P>They torture one another.</P>
    <P>They get hurt and get hard.</P>
    <P>We know just how hurt, we know just how hard &ndash; so hard that only a short few years ago the Ulster poet, John Hewitt, was lamenting that the future could find no crevice to enter by. Miraculously that crevice has been found, or more correctly, crafted, and with immense difficulty by people who are deserving of our deepest gratitude.</P>
    <P>We are mindful of the hurt caused to so many, hurts which may never heal, but we take heart from the forgiveness, the generosity, the love and compassion, the willingness to take risks even in the absence of trust, of so many ordinary everyday people who are the very heart and soul of this phenomenon we call the peace process. Their story tells us why it is worth dreaming, to keep on dreaming, even when the cynics say it is impossible and the naysayers threaten to make it impossible.</P>
    <P>I take great pride in these people who have committed themselves to overcoming deep divisions and building a humanly decent society, respectful of difference, rooted in human rights, at ease with all who share this island. The structures which will allow us to build healthy relationships on this island and between these islands are now, of course, up and running. We are today actively harnessing our collective energies to build an Ireland where divisions, whether in the mind or on the map, will be transcended by shared prosperity, a spirit of co-operative endeavour and, importantly, a new language, much kinder, much softer than before. The peacemakers followed a star of hope, at times no more than a glimmer, and now, like the Magi, they have given us this precious Christmas gift of peace.</P>
    <P>Earlier this century other peacemakers followed a star which led from the wild carnage of a world war to the creation of the European Union, a remarkable partnership of once bitter enemies. Many thought it a fanciful and very unlikely dream. Today, of course, it is real, so real that a long queue has formed to join us in the most exciting adventure in peace, democracy and partnership which Europe has ever known. Enlargement will bring us many benefits and it will, of course, bring a shift of kilter. Just as we were helped in Ireland on our journey to prosperity, soon we in turn will be expected to help others. When that day comes, I hope we see it as a badge of honour.</P>
    <P>Today's Ireland is a first world country but with a third world memory, a memory to keep us humble, to remind us of the fragility of it all, a memory to remind us that too many people <Col N="1890" /><Col N="1891" /> across the world waken up each day to lives of sheer terror and dread. They too need dreamers to imagine a day when their shadows will lift. They too need friends to help make those dreams happen. We have a long and proud history of being just such a friend, a champion of the poor, the oppressed, the ignored and the neglected. And for all our success, we have them too on our own doorstep.</P>
    <P>We have our own dark side, the people who watch today's fastmoving, self-assured Ireland from our own margins. The Constitution acknowledges the equality of each and every one of us and recent Irish history has shown the extraordinary benefits of widening, of equalising, the embrace of opportunity. The evidence is all around us, the evidence is in. Just look what a radical transformation has already been accomplished and still we have not unlocked anything like our full potential. How much talent, how much energy is still waiting to be nurtured and developed into fulfilled lives instead of frittered away in the frustrations and the many social problems of exclusion and under-achievement?</P>
    <P>We get to write a chapter of our country's history, just a chapter. What story will the 21st century tell of us? Will it tell of a sophisticated and intuitive age, rich in imagination, rooted deeply in community, grateful for its prosperity but aware of its frailty, an age which protected our environment and sustained the economic miracle, cherished our past but opened our future up to new perspectives, to other cultures? Will it tell how we used our resources generously and well, sharing them equitably at home and abroad? Will it tell how we in this generation consigned poverty to history, how we created a society that was all centre and no margins, where opportunity was a birthright? Will it tell that we vindicated the rights of others to such a world? Will it tell how a generation, freed from the wastefulness of conflict and the burdens of the past, galvanised its energy, its talents, its resources in a determined effort to make Ireland the best, the most egalitarian, it has ever been in its history?</P>
    <P>All that may sound, of course, impossible, implausible, perhaps out of tune with the scepticism, the supposed &ldquo;realism&rdquo; of today. We live, as you know, in times when windows open more easily on the unpleasant side of human nature. This is an age of righteous accountability which should serve to make us wiser and warier, but may indeed, if we are not careful, instead feed an uncaring indifference, a cynicism which will erode our capacity to dream and to deliver dreams. Just as in this Chamber today are gathered our political leaders to whom we are grateful for their fidelity to public service and indeed their role &ndash; your role &ndash; in today's success story, so for tomorrow we all need to encourage and nurture an unselfish vocation to public service among all our young men and especially among our young women.</P>
    <P>As Sr. Stanislaus Kennedy has said:</P>
    <P>We can all be sowers of our time, people who sow the seeds that will be reaped by the next generation. When we sow, we must not expect instant success, but sow we must if a new world is ever to come to fruit. The purpose of our generation is to make a better world possible in the future and to prepare for it.</P>
    <P>Together we will sow, we will write a new chapter for Ireland. Let it begin with a sigh of relief at the weight that has lifted from us, with joyful gratitude for the hope we have and with determination to use well and with integrity the tools we have been given.</P>
    <P>These past two thousand years have taught us a lot about human life and human nature. Life of its own accord can bring the tragedy of illness, accident, disability, death, whatever, to any one of our doors. Life itself can be very, very cruel. But human beings have themselves added greatly and gratuitously to the cruelty which nature visits upon us. No child comes into <Col N="1892" /><Col N="1893" /> the world distrustful and unloving, bigoted and uncaring. These things adults teach, and these things adults have to stop teaching.</P>
    <P>This century has created many incredible images and stories from holocaust to moon landing, from women's suffrage to the world wide web, but one recent image struck me as powerfully symbolic at this jubilee time. It was the picture on the front page of an Irish newspaper of an unborn child's tiny hand reaching out from the womb and wrapping itself around the finger of the surgeon who was operating to save its life. Another moving nativity, another reminder of how much we need each other, how much we have to offer each other. We have had all the lessons we could ever need in hatred, in neglect and in hurt. We know deeply that human beings need to be respected and loved, that we blossom in giving and in receiving love and that its withholding, its absence, shrivels us. We get hard, as the poet said.</P>
    <P>Every Christmas, Christians gather around the crib, drawn again and again to its innocence. We gather in a world which has long since lost its innocence, but we gather in hope that maybe in this future that we are about to live the story of Bethlehem, so often badly misused, might at last prove true, peace on earth, goodwill to all. As the sun goes down on this millennium, just as that page of history turns, are we aware at all of the awesome power each one of us holds in our own hearts and in our own hands? We cannot change the past, but we can create a much better future.</P>
    <P>In his poem, <i>Cure at Troy</i>, Seamus Heaney says:</P>
    <P>So hope for a great sea-change</P>
    <P>On the far side of revenge.</P>
    <P>Believe that a farther shore</P>
    <P>Is reachable from here.</P>
    <P>Believe in miracles</P>
    <P>And cures and healing wells.</P>
    <P>So one could say it has come to pass. The great sea-change we hoped for is here. We are nearer that farther shore. We who can change can cure. We who have hope can heal. This is the age of miracles. This is the age of lifting shadows.</P>
    <P>Go raibh míle maith agaibh. May I thank you and wish you well in all you do on behalf of the Irish people. A very happy Christmas and a very peaceful new year to each and every one of you.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since antiquity, human beings have set milestones by which to chart through time, their progress and that of their civilisation. We mark the seasons &ndash; the cycle of death and rebirth. We mark our birthdays and attach particular significance to certain big ones as being times for celebration and reflection. In this spirit it is appropriate that we mark the passing of one millennium and the start of another by trying to rise above our mundane day to day concerns and reflect on the lessons we can draw from progress to date and how we might do better in the future.</P>
      <P>In political terms the past millennium could be characterised by the rise of liberty and the triumph of democratic politics, certainly as an ideal everywhere but, alas, only as a reality in part of the world. However, we should also reflect that the triumph was not inevitable and required constant struggle. In this century alone it was seriously threatened, on one hand, by the forces of barbarism and, on the other, by a monstrous conception of progress through social engineering orchestrated by a self appointed elite.</P>
      <P>The memory of the fascist threat and actual threat from communism provided an impetus to democratic politics in the post-war era and made people more amenable to, and tolerant of the compromises, sometimes messy, that are the essence of making progress in a free society. As that memory fades we must guard against the dangers of impatience and cynicism towards the democratic process particularly on the part of young people. In order to do so we must restate and examine our core values, record what progress has been achieved in relation to them and consider how we can best continue to promote them in the future both in Ireland and throughout the world.</P>
      <P>In my view the hallmarks against which the success of a truly liberal democratic society can be judged are the degree to which it protects and fosters the freedom and dignity of the individual, promotes tolerance of differences, ensures the security of its citizens and provides genuine economic and social opportunity. Ireland has made considerable progress against these criteria in the past century and in very important respects the pace of progress has quickened in recent decades.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this State, having achieved self-determination, and despite a disastrous civil war we rapidly established the primacy of democratic politics and adopted a Constitution which protected the basic rights of the individual. While not perfect, <Col N="1898" /> it provided within itself the mechanism to achieve further rights through the Oireachtas, the courts and referenda. The achievement of these extra rights is in no small measure the result of the struggle of brave people who were prepared to push for social progress and who are the unsung heroes of the march of liberty.</P>
    <P>At the beginning of the century the group in society most deprived of legal rights were women. In most of the world they were deprived of the right to vote and were, by and large, regarded as chattels of their husbands, if married, or of some other male relative, if not. While the franchise for women was introduced for the election of 1918 &ndash; Countess Markievicz was the first woman elected to the House of Commons &ndash; progress in other areas was slower.</P>
    <P>Although the Constitution provides that all citizens shall be equal before the law, it was only in the 1970s that certain rights were obtained. For example, in 1973 the marriage bar in the public service was abolished but even then it allowed only widows or married women not supported by their husbands to apply for reinstatement. Equal pay became an obligation under the Employment Act, 1977. Maternity leave was introduced in 1981 and extended to part-time workers in 1991.</P>
    <P>In the area of reproductive rights it was only under pressure from the McGee case that limited access to contraception was made available in 1979. In terms of representation in Dáil Éireann, 20 women were elected to the 28th Dáil as against three in 1969. While this is progress it is far from proportional with women's share of the population and suggests that, on the equality agenda, there is a long way to go in the next millennium.</P>

      <P>Since the great famine of the 1840s economic failure in Ireland has always manifested itself in emigration with the consequent social disruption and personal tragedy. When, having ebbed in the 1960s and reversed in the 1970s, the outflow recommenced in the 1980s, it was similar to a hammer blow to the hopes and aspirations of our generation. It was little comfort that we were providing a better educated generation of emigrants. However, it was the availability of well educated people which provided the basis for solving our problems. When the key ingredient of education was combined with fiscal and industrial stability based on partnership, access to EU markets and EU Structural Funds support, fiscal incentives, and our ability to turn our strong cultural links with the US into strong investment links, it provided the basis for our current economic prosperity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1899" /> Membership of the European Union provided not just an underpinning for economic growth but also for the new Ireland emerging from the Good Friday Agreement. Tolerance is a function of knowledge and understanding other points of view. For much of this century the two great traditions on this island lived in mutual ignorance of each other, remembered ancient wrongs and perceived developments through the prism of anglo-lrish history. Membership of the EU opened our mind to other cultures, provided a model for the reconciliation of ancient enemies and a new context within which we could build relationships in these islands.</P>
    <P>This opening of the mind, combined with the active support of both the EU and the United States, made possible the remarkable events that are unfolding as we speak. The Good Friday Agreement, enshrining the principles of power sharing, consent and progress only by peaceful means, is being implemented with the overwhelming support of the people, North and South; I stress peaceful means. We must never forget the hideous violence of the last 30 years and its victims. Their memorial must be a determination on our part to prevent it happening again on this island.</P>
    <P>Thus, we stand at the edge of the new millennium with the prospect before us of a peaceful more prosperous Ireland where our people no longer have to emigrate to earn a living but can choose to do so successfully if they wish. However, these achievements are neither inevitable nor irreversible and prosperity brings its own challenges and obligations. It is essential that we work to foster tolerances and mutual respect between all the traditions on the island. This must extend beyond the historical traditions to embrace recent immigrants who have the potential to enrich our cultural heritage and increase our understanding of the world in which we live.</P>
    <P>The social progress made in recent years must be built on in terms of respect for minority rights and, in the case of women, majority rights. With regard to the handicapped, we must facilitate their independence and full participation in the community. It must be recognised that the majority of people, male and female, will increasingly work outside the home and ensure the resources are available to them to integrate all aspects of their lives successfully. We must recognise that a productive dynamic economy is the essential bedrock for social progress. We will enter a new century of even more rapid change and it is essential that we remain flexible and adaptive to these changes. The key to this, as <Col N="1900" /> ever, remains education. We must be prepared to concentrate more educational resources on disadvantaged groups and be prepared to use innovative approaches.</P>
    <P>Finally and most importantly we must recognise our obligations in the wider world and provide all the help we can to countries struggling to develop in the same way as others helped us in the past. Ireland must play an active role in assisting the candidates for membership of the EU to make the transition and we must place our voice and resources at the disposal of developing countries so as to tackle world poverty effectively in the next millennium.</P>
    <P>The lasting and worthwhile achievements of the last millennium were achieved by people who believed in the freedom of the individual and the primacy of democratic politics. In the new millennium we can honour their struggle and achievements by rededicating ourselves to sustaining and advancing their ideals.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to thank the Minister of State, Deputy Brennan, for the outstanding work he has done on the millennium committee. All his colleagues in Government were disappointed when he told us he will not chair the next millennium committee. I thank him and his committee for the many innovative suggestions they have come up with and for choosing some priorities. I hope we all have special memories of this millennium because none of us will live through another one.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to wish all my colleagues, particularly the leaders of the Opposition, members of the Government, Members of the House and you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, and your staff a happy and peaceful Christmas and, hopefully, a prosperous millennium.</P>

      <P>Go raibh míle maith agat, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle. Tá áthas orm seans a fháil labhairt ar an ócáid seo roimh an bhliain 2000 ach tá eagla orm chomh maith. Mar Chríostaí is ábhar ceiliúrtha go mbeidh breithlá Chríost romhainn agus an bhliain 2000 romhainn ag an am chéanna. Nuair a fhéachann tú siar, sa chéad mhílaois mhéadaigh líon an chine daonna ó 250 milliún go dtI 350 milliún, sé sin méadú 100 milliún. Sa dara mhílaois mhéadaigh an cine daonna ó 350 milliún sa bhliain 1000 go dtí breis agus 6,000 milliún inniu. Sin fás timpeall 5,650 milliún.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Cúpla bliain ó shin bhí daoine ag caint mar gheall ar &ldquo;breeding like rabbits&rdquo; ach mar chine daonna níl aon dabht anois ná go mbeidh daoine amach anseo ag caint mar gheall ar &ldquo;breeding like humans&rdquo;. Beidh an-bhrú ar an domhan agus <Col N="1901" /> caithfimid machnamh a dhéanamh ar sin ag an ócáid thábhachtach seo.</P>
    <P>Tá prionsabal ag Glasaigh a iarrann orainn go léir a bheith ar an airdeall go domhanda ach gníomhú go háitiúil. Tá prionsabal a deir nach linne an domhan is cuma cé mhéid scaireanna i gcomhlachtaí a bhíonn againn. Tá sé ar iasacht ó na glúnta atá romhainn. Fágann sé sin go bhfuil fáilte roimh an díospóireacht seo agus roimh chuairt an Uachtaráin anseo. Bhí sé an-mhaith éisteacht léi ag caint mar gheall ar cheisteanna na mbocht agus ar cheisteanna domhanda.</P>
    <P>Le linn na mílaoise, tháinig forbairt sa chóras daonlathach agus caithfimid fáilte a chur roimhe sin. Ar dtús ní raibh guth agus cumhacht ach ag na tiarnaí talún ar mhaithe leo féin. Níos déanaí san 19ú aois leathnaigh an cumhacht sin in áiteanna chun guth a thabhairt don lucht oibre.</P>
    <P>Ba cheart dúinn machnamh a dhéanamh ar 1913 sa tír seo nuair a bhí sé sin i mbéal an phobail.</P>
    <P>Ag an bpointe seo is gá agus an bhliain 2000 romhainn éisteacht le guth na farraige, le guth ainmhithe, le guth na n-éan agus le guth na foraoiseacha atá fágtha.</P>
    <P>Is léir anois go ndéanfaimis neamhaird orainn féin má déanaimis neamhaird ar an saol nádúrtha. Muna bhfuil uisce glan ann, muna bhfuil cré ann is iad na daoine is boichte a bhuailtear ar dtús, ach taréis tamaill buaileann sé gach duine againn.</P>
    <P>Éiríonn leis na daoine saibhre teacht ar bhia de bharr rialacha &ldquo;free trade&rdquo;. B'fhearr liomsa gan an téarma &ldquo;free trade&rdquo; a úsáid mar níl sé &ldquo;fair&rdquo;. Cuireann free trade isteach ar chothrom na Féinne do dhaoine, go mór mhór na daoine is boichte.</P>

      <P>Ó thaobh bia de, de bharr go mbíonn iompar earraí thar na mílte míle i gceist le globalisation bíonn ceimicí á n-úsáid níos minicí san fheirmeoireacht dhomhanda. Tuigtear nach féidir linn mar chine daona leanúint ar aghaidh ag cur isteach orainn féin agus is í an timpeallacht cuid den saol sin againn.</P>
      <P>Le déanaí, chonacamar agóidí fíochmhara i Seattle i gcoinne an World Trade Organisation. Má tá todhchaí in ann dúinn caithfimid cumhacht éigin a bhaint den WTO.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1902" /> Tá sé scríobhta in <i>Ethical Consumer Magazine</i>:</P>
    <P>Under WTO rules, bans on the grounds of health risks are allowed only in the case of &lsquo;scientific certainty'. The onus is no longer on the company to prove its goods are safe, but on governments to prove otherwise.</P>
    <P>Chuir an WTO i gcoinne neart rudaí a chuireann isteach orainn anseo, genetic modefied labelling, ísliú truailliú ó pheitreal, cosaint do dheilfeanna agus do dhúlra na mara, cosaint do dhaoine bochta a fhásann earraí ar nós bananaí agus mar sin. Tá sé sin déanta cheana féin.</P>
    <P>Deireann an iris <i>Ethical Consumer Magazine</i> December 1999/January 2000 comh maith:</P>
    <P>It is thought that other ethical purchasing policies could be challenged in this way &ndash; such as policies in favour of recycled paper, sustainably produced timber, or buying services from locally-owned businesses.</P>
    <P>Is iad na comhlachtaí a bhíonn i mbéal an phobail mar lucht tacaíochta WTO ná na cinn a bhíonn i mbéal an phobail go minic sa tír seo. Is iad sin American Express, AT&amp;T, Bayer, Citibank/Citicorp, Daimler Benz, Federal Express, Mitsubishi Electric, Nestlé, Philips, Toyota, Warner Lambert, Arthur Andersen &amp; Co, BAT Industries, British Petroleum, Chiquita, Eastman Kodak, IBM, Monsanto, Nissan, Shell agus Unilever.</P>
    <P>Is iad sin na comhlachtaí is mó a bhíonn ag iarraidh ar an WTO brú a chur orainn go léir.</P>
    <P>Go bunúsach, ní bheidh saol againn agus ní bheidh cumhacht ag aon pharlaimint nó ag aon phobal amach anseo go dtí go n-iarrfaimid ar phobail áitiúla saol a chruthú dóibh féin chomh maith. Tugadh an vóta do dhaoine agus tá saoirse éigin acu anois ach caithfimid ceachtanna a thabhairt ar conas saol a chruthú dóibh féin. Níl aon locht agamsa ar thrádáil domhanda ach is gá cur leis an trádáil áitiúil.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom ag an bpointe seo píosa a scríobh fear ón 19ú aois Chief Seattle nuair a bhí sé ag caint i mBearla le rialtas Mheiriceá, a léamh. He asked for this to be remembered and on the eve of this millennium it is a sentiment on which we would do well to reflect. He said:</P>
    <P>Will you teach your children . [as] we have taught our children . [that] the earth is our mother? What befalls the earth befalls all the sons and daughters of the earth. This we know. The earth does not belong to man. Man belongs to the earth.</P>
    <P>All things are connected like the blood that unites us all. Man did not weave the web of life, he is merely a strand in it. Whatever he <Col N="1903" /> does to the web, he does to himself. One thing we know, our God is also your God. The earth is precious to him, and to harm the earth is to heap contempt on its Creator.</P>
    <P>We love this earth as a new-born loves its mother's heartbeat. So, if we sell you our land, love it as we have loved it. Care for it as we have cared for it. Hold in your mind the memory of the land as it is when you receive it. Preserve the land for all children and love it as God loves us.</P>
    <P>As we are part of the land, you too are part of the land. This earth is precious to us. It is also precious to you. One thing we know, there is only one God. No man, be he red man or white man, can be apart. We are all brothers and sisters after all.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom críochnú mar sin leis an ábhar machnaimh mar is léir go bhfuil an-chuid oibre le déanamh sa chéad Mhilaois eile má tá cothrom na Féinne le bheith ann dúinn go léir. Ba mhaith liom Nollaig shona a ghuí ortsa, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, ar an Cheann Comhairle, ar fhoireann an Tí, ar na ceannairí anseo agus ar gach ball den Dáil agus den Seanad. Ba mhaith liom chomh maith buíochas a ghabháil leis an Taoiseach agus leis an rialtas as an méid maitheasa atá déanta go dtí seo. Nuair a bheidh síocháin ó thuaidh i ndiaidh na mílaoise seo ceapaim gur féidir linn an-chuid a bhaint amach má tá an cur chuige ann.</P>

      <P>The end of the year is usually an opportunity to take stock of what has happened and to prepare for the future. New year resolutions are built upon a desire to progress, to move forward and to improve upon the achievements and performance of the past. The end of a century, not to mention a millennium, reinforces that process. It obliges us to look at how far we have come together, but more, it also requires us to examine the direction we wish to pursue as we face the future.</P>
      <P>Ireland today is truly at a crossroads. For the first time in our history, we are a rich and prosperous country. The good news is that we will remain so into the next decade and beyond according to the economic forecasts of the ESRI and other independent economists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After 30 years of terrible violence in the North a new political agreement has been put together and is being carefully implemented. It resolves, perhaps finally, the conflict of identities which has dominated the political landscape of this island <Col N="1904" /> for centuries. It has not been an easy process for some people on all sides. It has involved a redefinition of concepts like sovereignty and territory, concepts fundamental to both nationalisms and dearly held by many people. They are at the centre of this island's understanding of itself and its history. Ironically, we have best expressed our sovereignty by pooling it with others within the European Union. In so doing, we transformed the relationship with our sister island and broke free from the divisions of the past.</P>

      <P>We now work together side by side as equals, and our joint membership of the European Union has been at the heart of that process that has brought about the wonderful transformation in Northern Ireland. On another side, there has been quite substantial change. Since independence we have moved, slowly and often reluctantly, from a society that was introverted and authoritarian to one that is both pluralist and tolerant. We are moving too from an Ireland dominated by the ethos of one religious denomination to an Ireland open to all religions and none.</P>
      <P>We recognise the damage done to our fellow citizens by the prejudices of the past. We have some way to go, but we have also come a very long way. The journey is ongoing. The Ireland of the 21st century will be multi-ethnic and multi-cultural.</P>
      <P>To truly learn from the errors of the past, we would do well to recognise and welcome that fact now and prepare properly for it. Our grandparents might not recognise the modern Ireland, but the Ireland of our grandchildren will bear little resemblance to ours.</P>
      <P>However, our recent advances must not blind us to the many problems which remain and the new problems which are increasing. For example, inequality in modern Ireland is increasing. The gap between the rich and poor has widened substantially in the past few years as a result of our economic growth. Poverty has been the defining experience of our independence, but its obscenity has been compounded in an Ireland of plenty.</P>
      <P>Proper housing, health and education still remain out of reach for far too many people. Travelling to and from work has become a nightmare for all in our major cities. Finding a place of care for an elderly parent who can no longer live at home on his or her own is increasingly difficult for those who can afford it, and simply impossible for those who cannot.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Rural Ireland, so long the embodiment of the <Col N="1905" /> traditional way of life of this country, is in crisis. Changes in agriculture, uncertainty regarding the future and pressures of urbanisation are transforming the face of Ireland. It is, sadly, no longer a clean face. Our lakes and rivers, once a byword for purity, are now polluted by a combination of intensive farming methods and untreated urban sewage. The physical waste we now generate is growing faster than our ability to dispose of it. Proposals for new dumps, recycling methods or incineration increasingly meet with local opposition, effectively paralysing national decisions.</P>
    <P>However, there is more. In a land of increasing material prosperity there is a growing spiritual impoverishment. Rates of suicide, particularly among young men &ndash; which is impossible for someone of my age and from where I come to comprehend &ndash; and the incidence of violence and abuse in the home against women and children are rising.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The sense of community, which we once took for granted, is diminishing as individuals are encouraged to do their own thing. Enhanced personal freedom is becoming synonymous with indifference to the needs of others. Volunteers who once provided the backbone of so many of our sporting clubs, social services and community associations are available in smaller numbers. That will resonate with all of us who are active in party politics. Pressures of time at home and work have taken first place with many. The pace of life and its demand for individualisation in so many of its aspects, is changing the nature of our lifestyle at a frightening speed.</P>
      <P>Never have the Irish people at home been so well off, and yet so uneasy with the prospects for the future.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The fundamental paradox we face at the turn of the century is how to integrate our new found material wealth into a socially prosperous community and create a new society from a wealthy economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For myself, the Labour Party and all of us on the left, the choice now is clear. We reject what is being offered consciously by the Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party as the &ldquo;low tax, high enterprise&rdquo; model for future development. It amounts to embracing the American, Anglo-Saxon model of individual responsibility. It promotes a low tax regime to encourage individual effort. It sees a minimal <Col N="1906" /> role for the State in the daily affairs of the community. It is the stuff of trickle down economics.</P>
    <P>It intends that the share of public wealth invested in our communities would decline dramatically. It is a vision of the future imprisoned by the poverty of the past. This view contends that taxation and public spending are heavy burdens to be, at best, reluctantly borne. There is no sense that a contrary view might exist and that, perhaps, taxation and public spending are how we express our solidarity as a community. This view contends that they may be the instruments we use to invest in our children and their education, to provide for our sick and care for our infirm. It also contends they may be the resources for protecting our environment, conserving our future and, perhaps, that taxation and public spending are the way a mature and vibrant economy can transform itself into a thriving and successful society.</P>
    <P>I am one of those people whom the Taoiseach called &ldquo;well meaning&rdquo; who believes that the &ldquo;social cart is as important as the economic horse&rdquo;. I believe the social agenda should drive the economic engine. I believe it is surely right, now more than ever, to concentrate on how we distribute our new-found wealth. That is, for me and my party, the social democratic agenda for Ireland in the next century &ndash; the creation of a real republic in accordance with the values expressed by the first Dáil in the democratic programme. It is a view of a community that at last we can now begin to build.</P>
    <P>I will outline the Ireland that we can build on this island. I will outline the ten pillars of the new Republic which we can now construct for our society as we move into the future. Every citizen should have a constitutional guarantee of fundamental social and economic rights. There will be full employment in a vibrant and enterprising economy. We will ensure the elimination of poverty and homelessness. The physical infrastructure of the island of Ireland will be transformed by a sustained programme of public investment in public and private transportation, building the environmental needs of all our people. Adult illiteracy and educational disadvantage, which leads to adult illiteracy, will be eliminated. The State will guarantee every disabled and elderly citizen a place of appropriate care and shelter within our society so no one will have the nightmare of wondering what will happen to their disabled children when they pass on.</P>
    <P>We will put in place a constitutional recognition of the rights of children and a guarantee of their protection and care. Recent sad revelations behove us to do so, as a minimum. We must have and we can now afford a universal health service open to all on an equal basis, where access is determined by medical need and not ability to <Col N="1907" /> pay. In other words, why can we not just become like normal northern Europeans? There will be the promotion of a tolerant and pluralist civic culture, respectful of minorities, old and new. Finally, the island of Ireland, at peace with itself and its neighbours, will play an active and positive role in the European Union and in the rest of the world promoting peace, tolerance, justice and international solidarity.</P>
    <P>Economic vibrancy and flexibility are desirable if not essential components in any modern economy. However, they are not impediments to the creation of a compassionate and just society based on citizens' rights. At the centre of a vibrant economy and a caring society is the Government and the State. Its role is to act as a guarantor of citizens' rights, either through direct provision or support for voluntary activity. It must promote the bond of solidarity between the citizen and the community.</P>
    <P>We cannot construct the type of society described in the ten pillars unless we are prepared to significantly invest in our people, our community and our environment. We should be consciously aware of our need to make up ground lost in decades of economic under-performance. Its legacy can be seen in how we treated people in the past, particularly minorities and the underprivileged.</P>
    <P>There is no consensus in this House on how to proceed on this issue. My party does not support the vision of Ireland contained in the Government's stability programme prepared for submission to Brussels. We reject the philosophy which underpins that document and we vigorously contest the economic and social rationale which informs it. There is a radically different alternative. Labour wants to see Ireland redefine the European social model and transform it so that it meets the needs of our people in the 21st century. We want an Ireland that will mobilise all our energy to create a new bond between the State and its citizens &ndash; a society committed to using its resources to eliminate poverty and homelessness; a society committed to rooting out public squalor; a society that takes equality seriously and does not attach it to a Government Department. We can do this &ndash; it is not a wish list.</P>
    <P>Coming from the tradition of the left, we must ensure that we avoid the mistakes of paternalism and bureaucracy. The days when self-appointed social engineers could ride roughshod over the lives and rights of individual citizens are happily a thing of the past. I am not calling for their return. However, the mistakes of the past &ndash; bad as they were &ndash; should not limit our ambitions for the future. Success in creating a more equal society will not only transform our quality of life, but &ndash;<Col N="1908" /> as I passionately believe and as the President echoed earlier &ndash; will set an example for the rest of Europe and the world.</P>
    <P>We are entering the final days of a century that has seen extraordinary change throughout the world.  It has not been a century in which the human race and Europeans in particular have covered themselves in glory &ndash; or perhaps not. We should focus on both World Wars which were European civil wars. The carnage of those wars stands as a stark reminder of the worst side of human nature. We know from recent bitter experience that in certain conditions, human beings remain more than capable of acts of barbarity. The second half of the century, in western Europe at least, has been somewhat better, thanks in large part to those who inspired the fledgling European Union. However, the concepts of rights and welfare established in this era need not only to be protected but to be expanded to areas of the world where their writ clearly does not run, which includes Seattle. Today, we can face into a new century and new decade with genuine hope and optimism. We need to build on what has been achieved, both in relation to political developments in Northern Ireland and our economic successes in the South. Let me put it another way. We should no longer accept second best. The opportunity we now have to build a new Ireland may never return if we do not embrace it fully. We should think about how different Irish society was 15 years ago and how different Europe was 15 years ago when it was divided by the Iron Curtain. We should then think forward and imagine the scale of change we in this House will witness over the next 15 years. The challenge is ours to determine the nature of that change, to make our country, our continent and our world a place where all human beings can live with basic dignity.</P>
    <P>A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I wish to take this opportunity, on behalf of myself and my party, to thank you and the staff of the Ceann Comhairle's office for your help and assistance over the year and to express my support for our collective endeavours in this House, regardless of our differing views.

    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to refer briefly to the words spoken in this House by Uachtarán na hÉireann. I would describe the President's speech as a celebration <Col N="1909" /> of humility and vulnerability. In recalling the birth of a Jewish baby in a stable in southern Palestine 2000 years ago, the President celebrated the ultimate in humility. She also celebrated vulnerability in recalling the work of a doctor saving the life of an unborn child, the most vulnerable of all humankind. The President, in recalling the humility and vulnerability of humankind in the face of history, put all our struggle and strife in this House and in all other places where human beings contest in its proper perspective. I thank her on my own behalf and on behalf of all the other Members of this House for an inspiring address.</P>
    <P>At the end of December 1899, life for most people in Ireland was dark, boring, cold, insecure and impoverished. It was much the same at the turn of every previous century. This time, for the first time, it is different. On a widespread scale, we enjoy prosperity, security and peace. In the last decade of this century we have seen momentous steps taken to develop our society and our relations with each other on this island.</P>
    <P>One hundred years ago, an emigrant leaving Ireland &ndash; and there were many &ndash; for the United States of America almost certainly did so in the certain knowledge that he or she would not see their native land again. Today they can pick up the telephone and call home, even when they are in mid-air, send an e-mail when they arrive, and can be home again in a shorter period than it takes me to drive by motorcar from one end of the country to the other.</P>
    <P>We are no longer an insular people &ndash; inward looking and self-obsessed. We are now an integral part of a wider European and global family. Our young people travel and see the world. After that, most of them choose to come home again, something that is very unusual in previous Irish history. We have created an Ireland in which our young people want to stay, and to which many people from other countries wish to come. This is a great positive. Our prospects are brighter now than they ever have been.</P>
    <P>In 1899, the aim was that the Irish people be free to determine their own affairs, independently certainly, but also in harmony with one another &ndash; orange and green, Unionist and Nationalist working together. It has taken a full century. It was only in this year of 1999, 100 years later, that it can be said that goal was fully achieved. It was achieved by peaceful politics and constitutional agitation, not by violence. Violence throughout this century slowed down the process towards independence and harmony much more than it accelerated it.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to all who helped to contain violence, and who helped constitutionalise politics. I pay tribute to the Irish Parliamentary Party in Westminster, and to all the parties who have <Col N="1910" /> taken their seats in this House. All are part of the Irish constitutional tradition that has brought us such an achievement as we enter a new millennium.</P>
    <P>Politics and politicians on all sides in this House, and our predecessors in all parties, can take pride in the contribution they have made to this century. They have helped build Europe's fourth oldest democracy. This is a legacy we politicians should pass on with care and pride to succeeding generations. At a time when there is so much cynicism about politics, these are the successes of Irish democratic politics, and we should proclaim them. I sometimes wonder if cynicism about politics arises because cynics have lost a sense of history, lost a sense of where we have come from as distinct from the sense that we have arrived.</P>
    <P>When we look around the Ireland of late 1999, there is much of which we can be proud, and yet many people in Ireland live lives that are more stressed than ever before. We work longer hours. We spend more time in cars or buses or trains getting around. The working week gets longer and compresses more and more so-called leisure time into weekends which even now are becoming times of work as well as leisure.</P>
    <P>Is there any space left in our lives for really living? That is the major underlying problem we face as a nation as the millennium turns. Our lives are more crowded than ever, but are the things that are being crowded in more important than those that are being crowded out? Is our quality of life increasing as fast as our gross domestic product? The fundamental desires of many people are not being met in the modern world. Jean Vanier said: &ldquo;Man's primal cry is to be loved&rdquo;. He was speaking in the broadest meaning of the term. He could have said that people's basic need is to be accepted and valued for what they are and what they see themselves as being. In the modern, pressurised world we are not giving ourselves the time we need, to give enough of ourselves to others, so that that answer to our basic needs can be given. We live life in compartments. The work compartment is getting larger and larger, while all the other compartments of life are getting smaller. This is a legitimate topic for political debate at the turn of the century because it is politics that shapes the context in which people are forced to live these compartmentalised lives and that is a challenge all of us as legislators must address.</P>
    <P>As Professor Joe Lee recently put it, children and the elderly get in the way of economic man and economic woman. The way people treat their elderly is one of the surest guides to the level of a civilisation and against that background, there must be concern about growing evidence of physical abuse of elderly people in caring insti<Col N="1911" /> tutions and also by their own families. This is one of the least reported forms of abuse and yet it is quite prevalent.</P>
    <P>The pressure in our daily lives is created by four factors: the shopping culture, globalisation, the disproportionately large home building obligation imposed on one generation &ndash; the young &ndash; and the traffic problem caused by disjoined planning of the location of homes, workplace and transport links. It is said that teenagers are victims of peer pressure and, as the father of three of them, I can observe that closely. However, are older people any different? The newness of cars, whether the registration is 95 or 99, the exoticism of holiday locations and the size of houses and number of bathrooms one has are consumer choices that are driven, to some degree at least, by peer pressure.</P>
    <P>Another pressure is the globalisation of our economy. We now have a global market in which an Irish worker is in direct competition with a worker in India and<i> vice versa</i>. The resultant insecurity makes people acquisitive as well as anxious. Globalisation is happening because the cost of air transport per revenue mile has fallen from 40p in 1930 to 8p in 1990 and is probably much less now; because the cost of a three minute phone call between Dublin and New York has fallen from several hundred pounds in 1930 to a few pence today and because the cost of computing information has declined by over 99% since 1930.</P>
    <P>The world is shrinking because these technologies are allowing it to shrink and that is why globalisation is inevitable. Global trade now represents 15% of all goods and services produced in the world. Globalisation brings efficiency and can thus help overcome needs that are not met, such as needs for food, medicines and other requisites of a decent life &ndash; here I reflect what Deputy Sargent said. Globalisation makes people depend on one another and it thus builds a structure of peace. The challenge is not to turn away from globalisation but to harness it for these socially valuable ends. Globalisation can be reversed, but the consequences would be unpleasant. During the closing decades of the 19th century there was also a massive increase  in global trade. By 1913 global trade had reached 9% of global income, not far from the 15% of global income today. That process of globalisation was reversed by the imperatives of militaristic nationalism which ignited the First World War. This led in turn to the Depression, to high tariffs in the 1930s and to the Second World War. We do not want to go back to that, therefore, we must manage globalisation politically so that human values get at least as much importance as financial ones.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1912" /> The failures of the World Trade Organisation summit in Seattle is a warning about the lack of political legitimacy of globalisation. The public is not willing to allow issues like food safety, environmental degradation or the right balance between the protection of copyright and the public good, to be left to a small coterie of top officials meeting behind closed doors. It wants a say in how the world is governed. That is the lesson of Seattle. Unless it is learned, the process of globalisation will be reversed, with potentially dire consequences of the kind that were unleashed in 1914 at Sarajevo, a place we have again become mournfully familiar with. The reform of the United Nations that creates popular legitimacy of worldwide decision-making is a key issue for the next century.</P>
    <P>The pressure on people's lives in Ireland today is aggravated by a special factor &ndash; housing &ndash; that will affect this generation of young people far more severely than any previous generation or any future one. There is the need in the next 25 years to build 40 new homes for every 100 homes in the State today. That is the scale of the construction project that this one generation &ndash; a small segment of our total current population &ndash; must undertake. The building of these houses is a national task that we are asking a minority in our society to finance out of their private means. That is not fair.</P>
    <P>The minority being asked to finance this massive building project are people between 20 and 40 years of age. Older people are enjoying tax free capital gains as house prices rise, while those between 20 and 40 years of age are sometimes being forced to work inhuman hours and sacrifice other aspects of their lives, perhaps more important aspects, to service the mortgages they have undertaken to build or buy houses for their families. This is the pressure that is being placed on people that forces some of them into a two-income lifestyle, even though that may not be their preference nor what they necessarily believe is best for their children.</P>
    <P>There is a fundamental issue of inter-generational fairness here. Is it right that one generation of young people, those between 20 and 40 years of age, should be asked to bear this one-off construction cost on behalf of previous generations and future generations? The homes now being built will last for three or four generations and they will be inherited cheaply by the children of today's children.</P>
    <P>We must also remember the effect of housing policy on crime. Most of the calls in the media for ever harsher penalties for criminals come from people who exonerate themselves from any responsibility for the social conditions that lead to crime. Criminals are seen as objects, not people.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1913" /> If we push all people of a socially excluded class together into one housing estate, where doctors, teachers, social workers and all other carers are visitors who come in from outside, is it any wonder that crime will result? Zero tolerance makes little sense if ghettos are deliberately created by public policy, which has been the case for the past 25 years. We do not want to follow the example of the United States where the number of people in prison has risen in the past 25 years from 380,000 to 2 million. This represents a sixfold increase in the numbers of people in prison in the land of zero tolerance.</P>

      <P>The land of zero tolerance is not an advertisement or signpost for the future.</P>
      <P>Crime is encouraged by a design of urban Ireland that prevents natural communities being created across class lines and crowds those who are well off into one part of a city and those who are less well off into another, so that never the twain shall meet. It is in respect of that division, that lack of &ldquo;united Irelandism&rdquo; and that unwillingness to create a society that is whole in itself that we must show zero tolerance. We must not have zero tolerance of the criminal but of the cause of the crime.</P>
      <P>We also have a design of urban Ireland which makes people commute such long distances that they have no time or energy left for building a community in their own locality. How can we ensure that our civilisation is enhanced and not diminished by the opportunities and choices offered by globalisation?</P>
      <P>The anthropologist Margaret Mead said:</P>
      <P>If you look closely you will see that almost anything that embodies our deepest commitment to the way human lives should be lived and cared for depends on some form &ndash; often many forms &ndash; of voluntarism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Voluntarism means doing good things for free &ndash; not for paid work, not to qualify for individualisation, but for no reward. Volunteers are people who help others because of the intrinsic value of what they are doing, not because they are paid for it. Every Saturday morning and afternoon, for example, clusters of small children congregate on public parks and playing pitches all over the country to compete in under-age football leagues. These leagues, which offer joy, excitement and physical well-being to so many children, only exist because a small army of volunteer mothers and fathers organise clubs, drive teams to away matches, referee matches and coach teams. This is work of immense value &ndash; thousands of person hours per year &ndash; account of which is never taken by statisticians in the Central Statistics Office. <Col N="1914" /> They do not even attempt to evaluate the value of this work. Nobody attempts to count effort once it is not paid for.</P>
    <P>Night after night in this city and other cities throughout the country volunteers with the Simon Community bring soup and food to children who sleep rough on the streets. They are the last ropes of hope for young people who have already been neglected at multiple levels of society and have gradually fallen down from an initial loving birth to an ultimately lonely death. The work of these volunteers can, in the most extreme cases, be a matter of life or death. However, this work, because it is not paid for, is not part of what counts for the Central Statistics Office, no account of it is taken in the GDP and it does not exist as far as stockbrokers reports on or economists assessments of the economy. If you are not paid, you do not count. In Ireland we evaluate a person's contribution to society in terms of the statement &ldquo;unless it is paid for it does not count&rdquo;. That is wrong. The work of volunteers is ignored in calculations of the gross domestic product. It counts only what is paid for in cash. The voluntary unpaid work of a parent who cares for a child in the home is not counted in the GDP. Being there to listen, to encourage is not counted in the GDP. The voluntary unpaid work of a person who helps the St. Vincent De Paul Society is not counted in the GDP. Yet this work is, by any standard, part of the nation's social capital. Social capital is a network of relationships of trust and co-operation between people.</P>
    <P>Ireland suffers from a cash illusion. We appear to have an increased GDP only because so much work in Ireland is paid for, where it was previously done for free, and it appears as though we have more than we had previously. The enhancement of social capital should be a key national objective and measure of success. If we try to measure social capital &ndash; unpaid work &ndash; we will go some way towards devising a language of political discussion that will lead us to the right conclusions. As long as we continue to use the language of GDP, we will be drawn inexorably to the wrong conclusions and a world of private affluence and public squalor.</P>

      <P>A Cheann Comhairle agus a chomh-Theachtaí, teachtaí tofa mhuintir na hÉireann, ní fada uainn críoch na mílaoise seo, mílaois a bhí rí-chorraithe do mhuintir an oileáin iath-ghlais seo. Tá muid ag druidim freisin i dtreo deireadh céid a bhí cinniúnach i stair ár dtíre. Agus muid ar bhruach mílaoise nua, cuimhním ar theitheadh na nIarlaí, agus na línte a scríobh an file, Fearflatha Ó Gnímh:</P>
      <P>A Thríonóid ag atá an chumhacht</P>
      <P>an mbeidh an dream seo ar</P>
      <P>deoraíocht......</P>
      <P>nó an mbeidh an t-athaoibhneas againn?</P>
      <P>Those lines were forced out of the pain and the despair of a people defeated after the flight of the Earls, people from whom government of their affairs had been torn away. However, in that last line of the verse, one can detect the indomitable hope of the Irish nation, the expectation that a bright new era of freedom and prosperity could yet dawn, the expectation of a second flowering, a second period of happiness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank President Mary McAleese for her inspi<Col N="1916" /> rational address this morning, that took a sweeping look back across the millennium, as well as being a review of where we now stand as a nation at the end of a remarkable but also difficult century.</P>
    <P>The millennium has a Christian as well as a secular significance. I would like to see our religious traditions continue to be cherished in the years to come. In their diversity and faithful witness, they represent a priceless expression of the human spirit as it has evolved on this island. Our Christian heritage is a bedrock of idealism as well as an antidote to selfish materialism. Between Church and State, we should encourage maximum co-operation and partnership in a totally open and transparent way, welcoming the enduring contribution of religious values.</P>
    <P>The coming year of jubilee provides an opportunity for reflection on where we are as a people, especially in the light of the teaching of the Christian faith. It is an opportunity to step back and take stock of our relations with each other, and with the wider world.</P>
    <P>The people are living through an extraordinary period of transformation, which has no precedent in our history. The achievement of peace and the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement brings to a close, a conflict in these islands that has lasted not just for the past 30 years, but intermittently for centuries. Never before has Ireland been so prosperous or faced a brighter economic future. There is hope, optimism and self-confidence among our people in place of the doubts, and often despair of earlier years. As we approach the millennium, so many new possibilities are opening up before us. However, we have to recognise that progress in solving old problems will often reveal new ones. The management of prosperity brings with it great responsibility. We need to ensure that our society adapts to rapid change in a harmonious, cohesive and inclusive manner, and that we do not leave behind any section of our population.</P>
    <P>Economically, we have moved from being a poor, primarily agricultural economy which was totally dependent on the British market, to the cutting edge of the world economy. Socially, we have moved from being a country with high levels of poverty, poor education, low tolerance of diversity and low levels of self-confidence due to the haemorrhage of emigration, to a society with decreasing poverty levels, a highly educated young population, a wide range of political, cultural and religious diversity and a strong confidence in our ability to make our way in the world. We now live in a more open and more equal society, which has far more opportunities than our parents and grandparents would have dreamt of. We can be modestly proud of the progress we <Col N="1917" /> have made, while maintaining our distinct sense of national identity.</P>
    <P>The quality of our democracy and our institutions is fundamental to everything else, and must be safeguarded. At the beginning of this century, we were not in any sense self-governing. The struggle for national independence was successful, but came at a price. That included partition, and a lingering reluctance on the part of some to accept the full constitutional legitimacy of the democracy we had established on this part of the island.</P>
    <P>Creating a viable independence did not come easily or quickly, but great credit is due to the first generation of nation builders who set up institutions to serve all the people impartially and with integrity, Eamon de Valera, Michael Collins, W.T. Cosgrave and Seán Lemass. I also pay tribute to the vital contribution of the labour movement founded by James Connolly and Jim Larkin. My party, Fianna Fáil, played an important role in completing our independence, in giving us our Constitution and in the early economic and social development of the country. All parties should be generous in the credit they are prepared to give to the contribution in good faith of their political opponents.</P>

      <P>The vast majority of politicians work hard, emulating each other, to do the best for our country and for our constituents, whilst critically scrutinising the best course ahead.</P>
      <P>As a result of the efforts of thousands of Irish men and women since independence, we have today, among those countries that achieved independence this century, an enviably resilient and accountable democracy, with lively national debates on public policy issues. Irish public representatives have remained close to the people. We encourage a high degree of participation in consultation and decision-making through social partnership.</P>
      <P>Our democracy is underpinned by a free media. We have a police force that is trusted, a loyal defence force that contributes to internal security and international peacekeeping, and a public service of great integrity. Civil society is strong and the role of voluntary, community and non-governmental bodies is vital to the tapestry of our political and social life. Faced with a declining interest in public participation in elections in recent years, it is our duty to try to renew Irish democracy. A core challenge as we move forward is to build faith among our people in politics as public service &ndash; politics makes a positive difference and politicians are committed to honesty, transparency and accountability in public affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1918" /> Today gives me a welcome opportunity to acknowledge the recent ground-breaking work of the Oireachtas and other public bodies. This year for the first time since the State was established powers of compellability and privilege have been used by a parliamentary committee of this House to investigate matters of current and serious public concern by the Legislature and it has done a good job.</P>
    <P>A cornerstone of accountability in the future for those in public life will be a standards in public office commission. The Government proposals have received a strong welcome from the committees of the Oireachtas, and we will now press on to prepare and enact the legislation. The tribunals' findings and recommendations also have a central part to play in this vital work.</P>
    <P>No one can deny that there have been instances of untoward aberrations in the high standards of public conduct which we wish to see upheld, but we are establishing in both letter and spirit firm ground rules, making absolutely clear what is acceptable. I want to see the strong ethos of unselfish public service, as lived by our founders, rigorously maintained, especially in the vastly different economic conditions of today. Over the coming years, we can expect to see further constitutional and institutional reform, to respond to the changing needs of society.</P>
    <P>Our democracy and our national progress rests on, and has been greatly strengthened by, the participation by women at home, in the workplace, in voluntary bodies and in political, social and cultural life. This century has seen historic and welcome advances in equal participation by women. Much more remains to be done to promote equality of opportunity for women in formal decision-making structures, be they in politics, the public service, trade unions or business life.</P>
    <P>From my perspective as Taoiseach I remain concerned about the political under-representation of women &ndash; only 13% of Deputies and 15% of local elected representatives are women. This imbalance must be changed for the sake of the future of representative democracy in Ireland.</P>

      <P>We have now only begun a new journey as we set out to work with an inclusive system of government in Northern Ireland. Devolved government there, reflecting the special needs of a divided society, will be conducted on a partnership basis. A prosperous and violence-free Ireland, where people can work together on everyday economic and social issues, notwithstanding deep-seated and unresolved political differences, represents a huge advance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1919" /> It is difficult to think of any other development which is more vital to our country's future than stable and permanent peace. Irish Governments have been involved in the peace process from the beginning, in preparing the ground for the two IRA ceasefires and in the negotiation and implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, working with other parties, North and South, and the British and US Governments. Since the 1920s, we have collectively been the standard bearers of the values and principles of constitutional republicanism and we have been proved correct in our shared conviction all along that force would never solve the problems of a divided society or country, or substitute for agreement.</P>
    <P>The Good Friday accord provides a magnificent opportunity for a new beginning in democratic politics in Northern Ireland, backed by a strong public mandate. No tolerance will be shown for any group which seeks violently to challenge or overturn the will of the people.</P>
    <P>We can look forward to real co-operation and common action across many areas in the North-South Ministerial Council, which met in Armagh for the first time on Monday, and in the implementation bodies. We wish efforts to create an inclusive prosperity in Northern Ireland every success. We look forward to working with the Unionist tradition, which we respect, and to fruitful interaction with devolved regions of the UK, such as Scotland and Wales, in the British-Irish Council, whose first meeting takes place in London tomorrow.</P>
    <P>The nation is changing rapidly. The population is growing fast and will probably reach four million within the next ten years. It is not beyond the bounds of possibility that by the middle of the 21st century the population on the island will recover to close to pre-famine levels.</P>
    <P>The buoyant state of the economy is not merely leading towards full employment but to the attraction of both EU and non-EU nationals to work in Ireland to fill some of the many vacancies that now exist. We need to deal with the problem of refugees and immigrants in an organised, structured and humane way. The Ireland of the future will not just be a pluralist but a multi-racial society, with our inherited political and cultural traditions being enriched and diversified from outside.</P>
    <P>The buoyant state of the economy gives us the resources to tackle long-standing as well as newer problems. For several years, Ireland has been at the top of every OECD growth chart. Annual exports, which ten years ago amounted to some £15 billion, are now close to £50 billion in circumstances of modest inflation. The numbers of long-term unemployed have fallen from 138,000 more than 11 years ago to 38,000 today and that is with <Col N="1920" /> a rising population every year through the 1990s. Social partnership, the political achievement of which my party is exceptionally proud, has underpinned our success and means that we can tackle problems together coherently and effectively. I am confident that we can renew it because of overall improvements in the quality of life and the social wage that everyone can gain out of it.</P>
    <P>The national development plan sees development spreading out from all of our cities and a number of important regional towns. We will tackle remaining employment blackspots and areas of deprivation, both urban and rural. We will improve transport and communications across the country. We are committed to maintaining a viable family farm structure combined, where necessary, with other livelihoods.</P>
    <P>We can be proud that we are able now to fund a major national development plan without recourse to borrowing. We no longer have to mortgage the future. On the contrary, we are able to set money aside to cover part of our future pension liabilities, so that the problem other European countries call the pensions time-bomb can, in our case, be defused.</P>
    <P>We want a competitive tax system that will fund the public services we need, but that encourages both individuals and enterprises to work hard and invest. That Ireland is now one of the best centres in which to do business is not empty rhetoric, but proved by every conceivable indicator. No other country has followed such a coherent corporate tax policy. This Government has followed a steady and consistent policy of lowering the tax burden substantially each year to reward workers and underpin wage moderation. We are committed to greater fairness in the tax system, as well as taking the low-paid out of the net.</P>
    <P>We must have a caring society as well as a prosperous one. We are improving and expanding educational opportunity and facilities. We are investing heavily in health care. Our housing production is running at 50,000 a year, way beyond any previous peaks, and we are determined to maintain a high supply in order to slow down the price increases which would put affordable housing beyond reach. Social welfare payments are being reoriented towards earnings increases and we are trying to improve the income levels of pensioners, while encouraging people to provide for their retirement.</P>
    <P>Our social philosophy is to improve steadily the general standard of living and quality of life for all our citizens, with special regard for the excluded. While we have a great deal still to do, <Col N="1921" /> employment opportunities, housing conditions, health care and educational standards have all been raised enormously. The agenda for the future also includes the eradication of homelessness, the housing of travellers and improvement of their life chances and life expectancy, the reduction of hospital waiting lists, improving community services for child care, the elderly, and more facilities for the handicapped.</P>
    <P>This is a very exciting period. We are making substantial progress on all fronts. We are developing our own economic and social model, which seeks to combine the virtues of a dynamic enterprise society with the virtues of social solidarity. I pay a special tribute to the National Millennium Committee, to its Chairman, the Minister of State, Deputy Séamus Brennan, and all its members who have given so much of their time over the past year. They have devised a comprehensive and exciting programme. They have selected hundreds of projects all over the country with money going to almost every parish and community. The committee's five flagship projects are the people's millennium forests, the last light ceremony on the final day of this millennium, the children's hour, the presentation of the Battle of the Boyne site, and the restoration of lightkeeper's houses. There are many other worthwhile social, cultural and environmental projects, and in particular, projects with special Christian themes. Through its awards initiatives, the committee has reached out to every corner of the country to make the millennium relevant to the lives of the people. I thank the committee members for the work they have done and will continue to do throughout next year.</P>
    <P>The Ireland of the 21st century will be an Ireland of cultural opportunities. For years now we have been able to fund more ambitious arts development plans. The next major project will be the setting up of the Irish Academy of the Performing Arts. Our commitment to the Irish language will be maintained and developed. World standard sport facilities are also on our agenda, while providing facilities in each area that make sport accessible to all.</P>
    <P>We are blessed with a remarkably beautiful and attractive country. Much investment will be needed in maintaining and improving environmental quality, with the farming as well as the industrial sector having a particular role to play in that, as well as each individual and family exercising personal responsibility. Increasingly, in recent years <Col N="1922" /> Ireland has sought to place itself at the cutting edge of technology, with plants from Silicon Valley to be found in the Liffey valley and elsewhere. We have mustered substantial new resources for third level research and technology and helped to provide the infrastructure and training necessary to develop the information society. We have put ourselves on the international financial services map in a major and distinctive way also. The Government has decided to establish a European branch of the world renowned Massachusetts Institute of Technology Media Lab in Dublin, which will place Ireland at the leading edge of global Internet and e-commerce applications. We can make ourselves one of the most prosperous countries in Europe. Those who live and work here can enjoy both high living standards and a high quality of life, provided we plan our strategy carefully and give workers a real stake in the workplace.</P>
    <P>The Irish success story, including the peace process, gives us a new international audience and helps win access to new markets. Being the only English speaking country to belong to the single currency has already brought risk-free trading from the point of view of currency fluctuations within the zone and we remain exceptionally competitive with the UK. There will be even bigger advantages when the currency comes into circulation, from both a trading and tourist point of view, from 2002.</P>
    <P>We will continue to be an active and responsible partner in the European Union and will work constructively with all our neighbours, in keeping with our best independent foreign policy traditions. Our development aid contribution is rising along with our wealth, and that should be an active dimension of our foreign policy, extending to new parts of the world. We will continue to support the campaign to reduce the burden of debt relief on poorer countries and to encourage voluntary assistance.</P>
    <P>In the 20th century, Ireland was put back on the map as a country in its own right. It has been, in many ways, a long, hard journey to where we are today. The opportunity facing us now is, in a relatively short space of time, to go out in front, setting no limits to the onward march of a nation while catching up in areas where we are still behind.</P>
    <P>President John F. Kennedy addressed the Oireachtas 36 years ago. In his final remarks on 28 June 1963, he made an appeal to the House thus:</P>
    <P>Great powers have their responsibilities and their burdens, but the smaller nations must fulfil their obligations as well ... My friends, Ireland's hour has come. You have something <Col N="1923" /> to give to the world, and that is a future of peace with freedom.</P>
    <P>A Cheann Comhairle, you are the only serving Member of these Houses to have heard those prophetic words in person. President Kennedy's remarks ring truer with each passing day. His words echo with great faith in the Irish people, in our destiny to be a nation which plays its full and active part in international political and economic affairs.</P>
    <P>I wish you, a Cheann Comhairle, the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, your staff, the staff of the Houses, the political staff, journalists, the gardaí and all those who work with us during the year, my colleagues in Government, particularly the Tánaiste&mdash;</P>

      <P>FÁS's general training allowances were increased by 4.3% with effect from 26 May 1999, in line with general increases in social welfare payments. Part-time trainees received a flat rate increase of £2.00 per week, representing a 5% increase. These increases were applied to all trainees on mainstream FÁS training courses, including people who were signing on for credits before their training commenced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the general increases in training allowances, a training bonus of £25 per week was introduced on a pilot basis, with effect from 19 <Col N="1927" /> April 1999, for long-term unemployed people on FÁS training courses. This bonus is payable to trainees who were in receipt of unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance for 12 months or more before commencing training with FÁS. People who progress to FÁS training from community employment or the job initiative programme are also eligible for the bonus if they completed a minimum of 12 months on community employment or job initiative prior to commencing training. Consecutive periods on unemployment benefit, unemployment assistance, community employment or job initiative can be combined to satisfy the minimum 12 month requirement.</P>
    <P>The training bonus does not apply to people who were signing on for credits immediately before their training commenced.</P>
    <P>The training bonus is an integral part of my Department's approach to improving employment opportunities for the long-term unemployed through participation on mainstream FÁS training courses. There is clear evidence that people who participate on such courses, which have close links to the labour market, significantly improve their chances of getting a job. The introduction of the training bonus has ensured that people moving to FÁS training from community employment or the job initiative do not suffer a reduction in their standard allowances.</P>

      <P>The development of the aquaculture sector, has been underpinned by the Government and EU funding support from the start. <Col N="1928" /> Since 1994 under the current operational programme for fisheries, some £11 million has been invested in the development and modernisation of aquaculture and more than £7 million has been invested in the development of the farmed salmon sector.</P>
      <P>As the sector moves into the new critical phase of expanding to critical mass over the period of the National Development Plan 2000-2006, £25 million of EU and Exchequer funding has been allocated under the regional programmes to ensuring strategic objectives and targets to be set for the sector will be met. This exceptional investment support, over double the support provided in the current OP, underlines the Government's recognition of and commitment to the sector as a sustainable, natural resource based industry able to secure much needed quality jobs in rural, coastal and peripheral areas. As the national development plan points out, aquaculture production in both the BMW and S &amp; E regions has significant further potential for sustainable development.</P>
      <P>Together with the State agencies directly involved, BIM and Údarás na Gaeltachta, the Department will have an important role to play in ensuring the objective of balanced regional development is delivered in aquaculture<i> via </i>the management role assigned to it in the inter-regional operational programmes. Given the lead role for the regional operational programmes assigned to the proposed new regional assemblies for the BMW and S &amp; E regions, I look forward to co-operating fully with those bodies in taking forward a new framework strategic plan which will be developed in partnership with the industry.</P>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that with grant aid of £25 million available to the aquaculture industry under the National Development Plan 2000-2006 the fish farming sector is well placed to deliver on the goals of critical mass, quality, sustainability diversification, technology and cost competitiveness.</P>

In accordance with EU regulations the high rate of payment under the extensification premium scheme is only payable where the stocking density on the holding is less than 1.00 livestock units per hectare. As the stocking density of the person named is not less than 1.00 Lu's per hectare he has no entitlement to the high rate of extensification. He has however been paid the low rate of extensification amounting to £134.68 and £776.36 on special beef animals and suckler cows respectively.</P>

No payments can issue until all outstanding problems with this application have been resolved.</P>
      <P>The herd and land of the person named were inspected in relation to his 1999 cattle headage scheme, 1999 suckler cow premium scheme, 1999 special beef premium scheme and the 1999 area aid applications on 9 August 1999 and it was discovered that the holding of the person named was managed jointly with the holding of another person.</P>
      <P>Where two or more applicants under the livestock schemes are associated my Department must be satisfied, in accordance with EU regulations, that their farming enterprises are operated as separate individual economic units before individual grants can be paid. Where there is evidence that this is not the case they are treated as a joint application and their herds as one joint herd for the purposes of payment of grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department wrote to the person named on 25 August 1999 advising him that his herd and the herd associated with his, will be amalgamated under the 1999 cattle headage scheme and the 1999 suckler cow premium scheme for grant purposes and that a joint payment under each of the <Col N="1934" /> schemes will issue under the herd number of the person named. He was given the opportunity to appeal this decision but no reply was received from him.</P>
    <P>The person named was also advised by letters of 25 August and 29 October 1999 that his herd and the herd associated with his will be amalgamated under the 1999 special beef premium scheme.</P>
    <P>In the case of special beef premium scheme a number of animals were found to be non-compliant with tagging regulations. The person named was informed that the amalgamated herd was deemed ineligible to qualify for special beef premium on the 17 animals on 30 June 1999 applications and consequently no payment will issue.</P>
    <P>The person named was given an opportunity to appeal this decision but no reply has been received to date.</P>

      <P>No area aid application was received from the person named for 1994, 1995 or 1996 and consequently no area aid related payments, including headage, can be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1998 the person named submitted an area aid application which included a parcel in respect of which a dual claim was determined. My Department contacted both herdowners to clarify <Col N="1936" /> the matter. The person named indicated that he had no entitlement to the parcel in question while the other herdowner claimed entitlement to this parcel . The person named applied for 22.51 hectares on his 1998 area aid application form. Following the deduction of the parcel subject to the dual claim an area of only 0.05 hectares was determined. Under Article 9 of EU Regulation 3887/92, when the difference between the area determined and that applied for is over 20%, a 100% penalty must be applied and consequently no area aid related payments can be made. In any event, the headage schemes are open only to herdowners who farm and occupy at least three hectares of agricultural land.</P>
    <P>The person named also submitted an incomplete 1999 area aid application form. He did not indicate the areas of parcels of land included in his application. The area aid unit contacted him on 31 August 1999 enclosing a copy of his application for completion. No reply has been received to date and therefore this application cannot be further processed.</P>

      <P>As stated in my reply of 16 November 1999 to Parliamentary Question No. 164, a representative of the person named arranged a meeting with the area aid unit in order to discuss other outstanding matters relating to this application. This meeting has now taken place, and the representative of the person named was supplied with a map of a parcel which is sub<Col N="1939" /> ject to an overclaim. Neither the herdowner nor his representative have made further contact with the area aid unit, so his application has now been finalised. The person named applied for a total of 40.89 hectares on his 1999 area aid application form. Following processing of his application an area of 37.66 hectares was determined. This represents a difference of 3.23 hectares or 8.58% between the area claimed and that determined.</P>
      <P>Under Article 9 of EU Regulation 3887/92, no penalty is applied when the difference is less than 3%, the penalty is based on double the difference when it is between 3% and 20% and when the difference is over 20%, a 100% penalty must be applied.</P>
      <P>Therefore in this case a penalty of 6.46 hectares has to be applied leaving the area determined for payment at 31.20 hectares. Any payments due will issue as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Under the 1999 ewe premium scheme the person named was paid the first instalment of £665.89 on 11 June 1999 and the second instalment of £340.94 on 20 October 1999. He was paid his full entitlement of £640.00 under the 1999 sheep headage scheme on 17 November 1999.</P>
      <P>He submitted two applications under the 1999 special beef premium ten months scheme and was paid the 60% advances of £102.73 and £154.09 in respect of each of these applications on the 16 November 1999.</P>
      <P>He was paid £1,333.50 under the 1999 cattle headage scheme on 17 November 1999. This grant was calculated on the basis of 22.02 forage hectares. A supplementary payment will now issue to him on the basis of the revised forage area of 31.20 hectares.</P>
      <P>The person named was paid £2,511.55 under the 1999 suckler cow premium scheme on 18 November 1999. A supplementary payment will now issue to him which, when combined with the amount already paid, will represent the 60% advance under this scheme.</P>
      <P>An application for payment under the REPS scheme was received on 26 November 1999 and is currently receiving attention.</P>

      <P>Formal approval to pay compensation for this reduction to participants in the scheme was received from the European Commission on 8 December. My Department is now making arrangements for payment to be made by the end of January 2000 to current scheme participants.

      <P>Income supplement is payable in cases where disease breakdown results in the removal of more than 10% of animals in a herd and where depopulation is not deemed appropriate. Due to the size of the breakdown in this herd, a depopulation offer was made to the person concerned which was accepted on 23 November 1999. The depopulation took place on 7 December 1999. The person concerned does not therefore qualify for income supplement. However, appropriate reactor and depopulation grants, which are in addition to the salvage price paid directly by the factory to the person concerned, will be processed for payment when disinfection has been certified.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The report of the independent working group, which I established to examine the issue of the taxation of credit union savings, was presented to me in <Col N="1943" /> October of last year. Earlier this year I made the report publicly available. The group, which comprised officials from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Finance, representatives of the Irish League of Credit Unions, the Registrar of Friendly Societies and an independent chairman, failed to agree on a set of findings. However, the chairman recommended that a certain amount of tax free savings for credit union members be allowed. I have received written representations from the Irish League of Credit Unions and its members, in support of the recommendations made by the chairman of the working group and requesting meeting on the issue.</P>
      <P>When considering how best to proceed with the demands for tax free savings, including DIRT, for credit union members, one must be sensitive to the EU dimension. The EU Commission decided not to regard the corporation tax exemption enjoyed by credit unions as a State aid. I believe a key consideration, which influenced its decision, is that the dividends paid out of such income are liable to income tax in the hands of the credit union members themselves. This benign attitude of the Commission to the corporation to exemption could change if dividends were exempted from income tax up to a certain limit, as recommended by the chairman of the working group. This is a point which complicates the issue and should not be overlooked by those now seeking an exemption of credit union dividends from income tax.</P>
      <P>I am fully conversant with the views of the league as they were contained in the report of the working group. Consequently, at this stage, I have no plans to meet the Irish League of Credit Unions. The differing views within the working group reflect the complexity of this issue. I am giving this matter ongoing consideration and as yet have no proposals to amend the law in this regard.</P>

      <Quest>whether, under his proposal for deduction at source of mortgage and VHI tax allowances, the consumer will pay a net sum each month or have to pay gross and get a refund from the relevant institution at the end of the tax year, thereby requiring the taxpayer to carry the cost of funding this amount until the refund comes through.</Quest>

      <P>In my Budget Statement on 1 December 1999, I indicated that I was proposing to move, with effect <Col N="1946" /> from 6 April 2001, to a system of tax relief at source in respect of both medical insurance premiums and mortgage interest payments.</P>
      <P>Deduction at source under these new arrangements will mean that the consumer will pay a net amount &ndash; after relief at the standard rate of income tax &ndash; to a medical insurer or a mortgage provider as the case may be. For example, if a premium of £100 is payable to a medical insurer such as the VHI or BUPA, the taxpayer will, from April 2001, obtain tax relief on that premium at source by making a payment of £78 instead of £100. The medical insurer will then claim a refund of £22 &ndash; representing the amount of the tax relief &ndash; from Revenue. The position will be similar for mortgage interest </P>
      <P>The proposed arrangement will simplify the tax system by minimising paperwork and form-filling for taxpayers &ndash; while maintaining the full tax value of the relief. In the context of changing over to the new tax credits system, a reduction in the number of reliefs that appear on a tax-free allowance certificate will make it easier for taxpayers to comprehend the new system. Above all, relief at source will provide the relevant relief to the taxpayer as and when he or she makes a premium or mortgage interest payment.</P>

      <P>The report of the independent working group, which I established to examine the issue of the taxation of credit union savings, was presented to me in October of last year. Earlier this year I made the report publicly available. The group, which comprised officials from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Finance, representatives of the Irish League of Credit Unions, the Registrar of Friendly Societies and an independent chairman, failed to agree on a set of findings. However, the chairman recommended that a certain amount of tax free savings for credit union members be allowed. I have received written representations from the Irish League of Credit Unions and its members, in support of the recommendations made by the chairman of the working group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When considering how best to proceed with the demands for tax free savings, including DIRT, for credit union members, one must be sensitive to the EU dimension. The EU Commission decided not to regard the corporation tax exemption enjoyed by credit unions as a State aid. I believe a key consideration, which influenced their decision, is the fact that the dividends paid out of such income are liable to income tax in the hands of the credit union members themselves. This <Col N="1947" /> benign attitude of the Commission to the corporation tax exemption could change if dividends were exempted from income tax up to a certain limit, as recommended by the chairman of the working group. This is a point which complicates the issue and should not be overlooked by those now seeking an exemption of credit union dividends from income tax.</P>
    <P>I am fully conversant with the views of the League as they were contained in the report of the working group. Consequently, at this stage, I have no plans to meet with the Irish League of Credit Unions. The differing views within the working group reflect the complexity of this issue. I am giving this matter ongoing consideration and as yet have no proposals to amend the law in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the recent budget only a small number of asset types remained subject to the 40% rate of capital gains tax. These included disposals of residential development land to connected parties and disposals of non-residential development land. The application of the 20% rate to non-residential development land is expected to lead to an earlier release of land for development of necessary infrastructure such as roads, as well as factories, offices and other social and public amenities appropriate in the context of the rapidly expanding economy. In this regard the budget measures on capital gains tax, by incentivising a more rapid development of land, complement the provisions of the national development plan which was published recently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Representations were made to me by the Construction Industry Federation, the Irish Farmers Association and a number of private individuals. <Col N="1948" /> These highlighted some inconsistencies and anomalies, arising from the previous dual rate structure, with respect to both wider economic policy and the structure of the capital gains tax system.</P>
    <P>It is expected that the cost impact will be neutral as the reduction in rate will be offset by increased market activity. It is worth noting that the halving of the general capital gains tax rate has been followed by a 78% increase in the revenue yield to £343 million in 1999, the first full year's receipts under the new regime.</P>

      <P>The establishment of an independent living fund has been proposed by the Centre for Independent Living as a means of funding a personal assistance service.</P>
      <P>The personal assistance service is part of a range of support services for people with physical and sensory disabilities designed to enable them to live in the community with the maximum possible degree of independence. My policy is to develop the range of services as a whole in accordance with the recommendations of the report of the review group on health and personal social services for people with physical and sensory disabilities, Towards an Independent Future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To date this Government has provided a total of £38.162 million for the maintenance and development of services in the sector, including capital developments. Additional revenue funding of £3 million in 1998 and £3 million in 1999, increasing to £6 million full year cost in 2000, was provided for the development of these services, including personal support and assistance services. In my recent budget speech I announced a further £7 million development funding for ser<Col N="1949" /> vices for people with physical and sensory disabilities, increasing to £14 million in the year 2001. I have decided that this funding will be primarily targeted at the provision of additional day care places and home support services. To this end, I have targeted £3 million, increasing to £6 million in the year 2001 for home support services, which includes personal assistance services.</P>
    <P>I have no plans at present to introduce an independent living fund, as proposed by the Centre for Independent Living, as a means of funding the personal assistance service. Priorities for the allocation of development funding are decided by the health boards in consultation with the regional co-ordinating committees for physical and sensory disability services. Voluntary sector service agencies, including centres for independent living and service users are represented on these committees.</P>

      <P>The Government recognises the needs of people with an intellectual disability and is committed to meeting those needs within a defined timeframe of three years, starting with a major acceleration of investment &ndash; both capital and revenue &ndash; in 2000.</P>
      <P>The additional funding being provided in 2000 is designed to support the opening of additional services, including residential, respite and day services, with an annual cost of £35 million.  Because of the timeframe involved in bringing all of the new services planned for 2000 on stream, the actual cost of these services in 2000 will be £28 million. This funding is in addition to the £10.7 million already allocated to the services in 2000 to meet the full year costs of the 1999 developments and identified needs in existing services. This brings the total additional revenue funding provided in 2000 for the services to £38.7 million, increasing to £45.7 million on 1 January 2001.</P>
      <P>I am also making available £80 million capital over the next three years to accelerate the process of putting in place the necessary infrastructure to support these services. A total of £30 million will be made available in 2000, £40 million in 2001 and the balance of £10 million in 2002. In accordance with normal practice, a revenue allocation commensurate with the capital investment in the services will also be made over this period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Additional funding amounting to £10.5 million in 2000, with a full year cost of £11.870 million in 2001, has been provided to the Eastern Health Board region specifically for the provision of new residential, respite and day services, 56 new respite places, 265 new residential and 280 new day places are to be provided from this funding.

      <P>While the option of green taxation as a means of addressing phosphorus use in agriculture has been kept under review in the light of management measures currently under way, the introduction of a tax in this regard would be a matter for the Minister for Finance. Measures taken in recent years have resulted in a 20% reduction in the use of phosphorus chemical fertiliser in the three year period 1996-99. This reduction is due in large part to the promotion of nutrient management planning as a key management tool by farmers. The aim of nutrient management planning is to prevent water pollution by achieving the correct balance between crop requirements and nutrient application rates from organic wastes and chemical fertilisers, taking account of nutrients available in the soil. Nutrient management planning is a central feature of the rural environment protection scheme, it is also a condition of the control of farmyard pollution scheme, and is being promoted extensively in the context of ongoing water quality catchment throughout the country. These measures will continue to be enhanced and developed with a view to optimising the sustainable use of organic and chemical fertilisers.</P>

      <P>The objective of the water conservation measures funded under my Department's water services investment programme is to reduce the volume of unaccounted for water in the distribution network through elimination of leakage and rehabilitation of pipework. This will improve the level of supply to consumers, lower operating costs and maximise the value of investment in capital works. Sixteen conservation projects with an estimated cost of nearly £50 million are under way nationwide. The programme does not include the provision or assessment of water saving devices.</P>
      <P>In June 1999, I published criteria for an annual sustainable building award which explicitly recognises water conservation as an important element in sustainable construction. My Department has also requested the National Standards Authority of Ireland to update the Irish standard for toilets &ndash; IS 70 of 1980 &ndash; to make provision for a flush toilet water cistern which would reduce water consumption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>More recently, on 10 December, I launched a comprehensive environmental awareness campaign which will run into next year, and is aimed at promoting a much greater appreciation of the impact of personal behaviour and consumption <Col N="1958" /> on the environment. The campaign will address key environmental themes, including water conservation, water quality, waste management, air quality and climate change and will illustrate how lifestyle changes can have significant environmental benefits.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 81 to 84, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The most recent authoritative survey of Dublin taxi services is set out in the report Review of Taxi and Hackney Carriage Service in the Dublin Area &ndash; Oscar Faber consultants, June 1998. This estimated that there was a shortfall in taxi supply equivalent to over 2,200 in 1998 and that this would increase to some 3,500 by 2008. These estimates, compounded by strong growth in the national and Dublin economies, provide a basis for the Government's recent policy decisions to address Dublin taxi needs.</P>
      <P>Regulations are being prepared by my Department as a matter of urgency to implement these decisions. It is intended that one new taxi, or wheelchair accessible taxi, licence will be offered to each individual who holds or will hold a taxi licence in Dublin by end 1999. All vehicles to be licensed in this connection will require to be inspected and certified by the gardai in line with existing regulatory provisions; a time limit will be specified for this purpose. No other limitation on the uptake of offers is envisaged.</P>
      <P>I have made it clear that when present exceptional arrangements have been completed, overall responsibility for taxi regulation will be restored to the Dublin local authorities with a view to maintaining the equilibrium of taxi supply and demand into the future.</P>
      <P>The Dublin taxi forum operated as an informal and broadly based group which addressed recommendations, by consensus, to different interests concerned in the regulation and provision of taxi services. The forum did not seek or obtain commitments from any parties, including the Government.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for the Environment and Local Government</askee>
      <Quest>his views on the opinion that local authorities in the Dublin area should encourage the use of park and ride facilities throughout the year by working in joint venture with transport providers and private enterprise and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Park and ride facilities are widely recognised as an important instrument in achieving an integrated approach to urban traffic congestion. Well located facilities of this kind can assist in encouraging commuters to leave their cars in secure parking areas and travel by public transport to the city centre thereby reducing traffic congestion.</P>
      <P>The Dublin Transportation Office will continue to promote, with the relevant local authorities and transport providers, the provision of park and ride facilities as an important means of facilitating a shift to public transport. Indeed, the Dublin Transportation Office's &ldquo;Transportation Blueprint 2000-2006&rdquo; outlines a number of locations where park and ride facilities are considered necessary. In addition, the national development plan places particular emphasis on addressing transport needs in the greater Dublin area and as part of this provides for further investment in traffic management initiatives including the provision of park and ride facilities.</P>
      <P>Tax incentives which were included in the Finance Act, 1999, were aimed at encouraging the participation of the private sector in the development of park and ride facilities in our major cities including Dublin. I issued guidelines in August 1999 on the criteria and requirements to be met by park and ride facilities and associated residential development for which tax relief is sought. Further guidelines will be issued in due course relating to tax incentives for associated commercial development when the necessary EU approval for such incentives has been obtained.</P>
      <P>In addition, a provision of £2 million was provided in the 1999 budget for the development of park and ride facilities in the Dublin area. This funding, together with the funding being provided to the Dublin Transportation Office in respect of 2000, as well as own resources expenditure by Iarnród Éireann and local authorities is, and will be, used for the development of new, and the upgrading of existing, mainly rail based, park and ride facilities by the relevant local authorities. It is expected that almost 3,300 car parking spaces will have been provided at locations in the Dublin area before the end of 2000.</P>

      <Quest>the extent to which the local authority housing waiting list has grown in the past four years; the number of houses the local authorities, through his Department, expects to build in the next four years; the number by which the local authority housing list is expected to grow in the next four years and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>Statutory assessments of local authority housing needs are generally carried out at three rather than four year intervals. The most recent statutory assessments of local authority housing needs were carried out at 29 March 1996 and 31 March 1999 and the results indicated a total of 39,176 households in need of local authority housing in March 1999, compared with 27,427 in March 1996.</P>
      <P>Local authorities have been authorised to build or acquire a total of 22,000 houses under the four year multi-annual housing programme 2000-3. The local authority housing programme is, of course, only one of a range of ways in which the needs of households on the local authority waiting lists may appropriately be met. I am confident that the enhanced multi-annual local authority housing programme, together with the output from the complementary social housing measures and vacancies occurring in the existing stock, will enable the housing needs of over 50,000 households to be catered for over the next four years.</P>
      <P>I am very conscious of the level of social housing need and it is not my expectation that the numbers on the local authority housing lists will grow over the next four years.</P>

      <P>The affordable housing scheme involves the provision by local authorities of additional new houses specifically for low income house purchasers on land provided by the local authorities. On 8 April 1999 all housing authorities were requested to assess the extent to which the new affordable housing scheme could appropriately be used in their areas and to formulate proposals for specific developments which should be brought to construction at the earliest possible date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The development of suitable sites, including, where necessary, the acquisition of land, and the planning and construction of houses does, of <Col N="1964" /> necessity, require some time to arrange. Nevertheless, the scheme is progressing satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>There will be about 40 houses completed under the scheme by the year's end, with over 100 more under construction. There are a significant number of affordable housing projects at planning stage throughout the country and it is anticipated that the target of 1,000 houses under the scheme in 2000 will be met.</P>

International experience is that per capita consumption rises on average by 0.6% per annum, due to many factors, particularly living standards.

      <P>The person concerned is in receipt of a widow's contributory pension. Many of the difficulties referred to in her letter relate to problems she has experienced in caring for her elderly mother, in particular in relation to respite care. These are issues for the Minister for Health and Children who has recently allocated funding of £1 million to the health boards, specifically targeted at carers of older people. Additional funding has also been granted by the Minister for Health and Children to the Carer's Association and funding for additional nursing and para-medical supports for the home care of older people.</P>
      <P>The primary objective of the social welfare system is to provide income support and, as a general rule, only one social welfare payment is payable to an individual.</P>
      <P>The review of the carer's allowance examined the issue of paying the carer's allowance in conjunction with another social welfare payment. As indicated, the practice of paying only one allowance is a feature, with very few exceptions, of all social welfare payments and is designed to ensure that limited resources are not used to make two income support payments to any one individual. The review concluded that this practice should continue.</P>
      <P>In the case of the person concerned, it is of more financial benefit to her to remain in receipt of her current payment.</P>
      <P>The 2000 budget provided for an increase of £7 a week for old age pensioners, including widows and widowers aged over 66 years, together with an increase of £4 a week for all other social welfare recipients aged under 66 years. These improvements will come into effect from the beginning of May 2000.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was in receipt of unemployment assistance a at the weekly rate of £65.50 based on a means assessment of £8.00 per week, derived from income from farming.</P>
      <P>To establish her entitlement under the farm assist scheme, the means of the person concerned were reviewed in June 1999. To assist in this review the social welfare inspector provided the person concerned with a list of documents she should submit in order that her means could be determined. Despite several requests from the social welfare inspector, the person concerned failed to provide the required documents and, on consideration of the inspector's report, the deciding officer disallowed her claim.</P>
      <P>The person concerned appealed the decision to the social welfare appeals office. Her case has been considered by an appeals officer who is of the opinion that an oral hearing is necessary.

      <P>The reforms to which I referred in my recent budget speech relate to the qualifying conditions for the old age contributory and retirement pensions.</P>
      <P>The qualifying conditions for the widow(er)'s contributory pension are already more flexible than those for the old age contributory pension. To satisfy the yearly average condition, a person's entitlement may be based on either the full social insurance record or the record over the previous three or five years. A widow or widower may qualify on either their own or their late spouse's insurance records. In addition, social insurance contributions paid under the National Health Insurance Acts since 1936 may already be used to satisfy the minimum requirement that 156, or three years contributions are paid and the yearly average test. Therefore, the question of introducing new provisions on the lines suggested by the Deputy does not arise.</P>

      <P>The Courts Service was established on 9 November 1999. One of the functions of the service is to provide, maintain and manage court buildings.</P>
      <P>I am informed that Monaghan County Council are acting on behalf of the Courts Service in respect of the refurbishment of Carrickmacross Courthouse.</P>
      <P>Prior to the establishment of the Courts Service, my Department gave approval on 12 July 1999 to Monaghan County Council to appoint a contractor to carry out the work.</P>
      <P>However, the project did not proceed immediately as the contractor sought an increase due to the fact that the tender was not accepted within the 90 day period as stipulated in the tender invitation. The additional sum sought reflected the increases in wages, materials and market conditions since the original tender date and fixes the price of these items up to completion date of the contract.</P>
      <P>The necessary financial approval for the additional cost has now been obtained and I am informed that Monaghan County Council have been asked to proceed with the appointment of the contractor based on the revised tender price.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 108 to 111, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I understand from the Garda authorities that one minor apparently not in the company of a parent or legal guardian was refused leave to land in the past three years and that the person in question was not provided with legal representation or the services of a social worker or translator as the person was accompanied by two friends, one of whom spoke English.</P>
      <P>No comprehensive figures are available for the number of unaccompanied non-national minors admitted to the State in each year since 1997. Indeed, many persons would be coming from within the common travel area and would not be subject to systematic immigration checks. Many of the minors admitted are either students or other young persons coming to visit relatives or friends residing here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A small number of unaccompanied minors seek asylum, generally once inside the State, rather than at point of entry. Section 8(5) of the Refugee Act, 1996 provides that the relevant health board must be notified upon the arrival of an unaccompanied minor so that the person can be given assistance. While that section of the Act will not be commenced until the new year, my Department has undertaken to operate in accordance with its procedures, where possible. Accordingly, unaccompanied minors seeking asylum are referred by the Refugee Applications Centre to the relevant health board. The processing of such applications also has a number of child-specific features and has regard to the UNHCR's Guidelines on Policies and Procedures in dealing with <Col N="1973" /> unaccompanied children seeking asylum as well as the relevant paragraphs of the UNHCR's procedures handbook and the EU Council resolution on unaccompanied minors who are nationals of Third Countries, 26 June 1997.</P>
    <P>The guidelines for immigration officers on the procedures for dealing with applicants for refugee status arriving at points of entry, prepared by my Department, state that unaccompanied minors should never be detained for immigration purposes or returned. I am considering whether separate guidelines will be necessary in the context of the coming into force of section 8(5) of the Refugee Act, 1996.</P>
    <P>I am advised by the Garda authorities that there is no evidence to suggest that non-national minors are being trafficked into the State for unlawful purposes. If Deputies are aware of any such evidence, they should make it available to the gardaí.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Registrar of Titles that there are two dealings involved in this instance. These dealings refer to two applications under section 49 &ndash; acquisition of title by virtue of long possession &ndash; of the Registration of Title Act, 1964 which were lodged on 4 October 1999 and 2 November 1999 respectively.</P>
      <P>I understand that due to their complicated nature, applications under section 49, which require detailed examination of claims for registration as owners, can take some time to process. Accordingly, it is not possible to estimate a completion date for the applications concerned at this stage.</P>
      <P>However, I can assure the Deputy that the Land Registry will deal with these applications without undue delay.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the National Development Plan &ndash; NDP &ndash; 2000-2006, was recently published. The plan is based, first and foremost, on an assessment of the development needs of the country and aims to build on the economic progress of recent years and strengthen the foundations for further strong and sustainable growth.</P>
      <P>Consultations with the tourism industry, including the Irish Tourism Industry Confederation, in the run up to the national development plan clearly established that marketing and training were the industry's two priorities for funding in the post-99 period. For this reason and also because the market has shown ample readiness to invest in accommodation without grant incentives, it is not envisaged that the provision of grant assistance for tourist accommodation will be a priority.</P>
      <P>Provision for investment in tourism under the NDP exceeds £350 million for marketing, product development and training over the seven years of the plan. Additional funding for tourism product development in the marine leisure area, in angling and in rural tourism, will bring this investment to well over £400 million. Certain developments in the arts-heritage area and also in forestry will also support the development of tourism product.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next step in giving effect to the implementation of the National Development Plan 2000-2006 is the development of the operational programmes. Preparation of the operational programmes will be based on the objectives, strategy, <Col N="1978" /> financial allocations and principles as set out in the national development plan. This process is under way.</P>

      <P>The position in relation to teaching practice is that it is not a paid activity in any institution but rather is viewed as training rather than employment. It is an integral part of the curriculum of the degree programmes in education and there is no special financial assistance available to students for this aspect of their course.</P>
      <P>I would point out that teacher education programmes provided in approved third level colleges, are approved courses for the purposes of the higher education grants scheme. Under the terms of that scheme, grantholders who are required to participate in off-campus placement as an integral part of their course may have their grant entitlement paid in the normal manner. Where the college requires a grantholder in receipt of the adjacent rate of grant to relocate from his-her residence in order to undertake a placement of not less than one academic term-semester, the non-adjacent rate of grant may be paid for the duration of such placement. Accordingly, student teachers who are eligible for grant assistance continue to receive their entitlements while undertaking teaching practice.</P>

      <Quest>if, further to Parliamentary Question No. 89 of 1 December 1999, he will provide information on the number of teachers to whom salaries are paid as compared to the number of approved posts as a way of arriving at an estimate of unfilled vacancies.</Quest>

      <P>As the Deputy may be aware the appointment of primary teachers is a matter for the board of management of each individual school. My Department is not aware that there are unfilled posts in primary schools. However, there are 673 temporary teachers employed in primary schools being paid at the untrained rate in December 1999. The total number of untrained days taught in primary schools in the current school year to date is 70,207.</P>
      <P>There are a number of teachers currently classified as untrained whose qualifications are being assessed that may be deemed qualified following assessment.</P>
      <P>I would take this opportunity to remind the Deputy that I have introduced a range of measures to boost substantially the supply of trained primary teachers. The intake of trainee primary teachers to the colleges of education in the 1998-99 session was 1,028 and the projected intake in the 1999-2000 academic year is 1,000.</P>
      <P>Between the 1999 and 2000 academic years a total of 1,380 newly trained teachers are due to graduate from the colleges of education. This includes 180 persons who will graduate prior to the end of the current school year. This represents a huge increase in the number of trained graduates as compared with 1995 when 291 graduated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that I have approved a number of other initiatives to reduce the number of untrained personnel. B.Ed graduates of St. Mary's College, Belfast who have studied Irish to honours level as an academic subject <Col N="1981" /> as part of their teaching qualification are now recognised as fully qualified.</P>
    <P>Since September 1998, all primary degree holders who hold the higher diploma in education are paid as fully trained substitute teachers. Primary degree holders who hold the higher diploma in education and have grade C or higher in the honours leaving certificate are paid the trained rate if appointed in a temporary capacity at primary level.</P>
    <P>Montessori trained teachers who successfully completed the course of three years duration at St. Nicholas, Dún Laoghaire, and the AMI which is recognised by the National Council for Educational Awards are also recognised as being fully qualified substitute teachers.</P>
    <P>My decision to recognise fully qualified teachers who trained outside the State to teach in certain categories of schools and classes without the necessity to hold an Irish language qualification will also contribute to an improvement in the supply of trained primary teachers.</P>

      <Quest>if, in view of the lack of information in his Department on the number of children who do not have English as their first language, he will make contact with schools where significant numbers of such children are attending to identify the numbers and the resources available and the sort of gaps that need to be filled; and if he will put in place a task force to develop concrete proposals to tackle the issue effectively.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">

      <P>My Department did identify the number of non-national children, not having English as their first language, in primary schools in September 1998. The number then was 1641. Since then the number of these children would have increased, including the addition of significant numbers of Kosovan children. As a result of the September 1998 audit some significant additional teaching resources have been sanctioned for primary schools earlier this year, including 15 additional teaching posts at primary school level and 15 additional primary teacher posts in respect of Kosovan students. Individual post-primary schools or vocational education committees may apply for additional teaching hours in respect of non-national students who may have particular English language deficits.</P>
      <P>However, the number of children in all schools, in the category referred to, changes regularly because of changes in the overall numbers seeking asylum and refuge in the State. My Department will maintain a liaison with the newly established directorate of services for asylum seekers in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and with bodies such as the refugee language support unit and with schools in order to begin a process of establishing an appropriate and ongoing database of non-national students who do not have English as their first language in both primary and post-primary schools. These data will assist in targeting the additional resources which may be required to make provision for these students.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 134 and 135 together.</P>
      <P>A unit cost system of allocating funds to institutes of technology has not yet been developed.</P>
      <P>The annual budget for each Institute is allocated on the basis of its total pay and non-pay requirements following consideration of its annual programmes and budget submission which is required under section 13 of the Regional Technical Colleges Act, 1992. The allocation takes into account the complexity of each institute, the range of courses and facilities offered to students, the total number of students, both full-time and part-time, and the nature of the infrastructure. Decisions on the allocations also have regard to Government policy and the Department's priorities.</P>
      <P>Unit cost figures are not used for project planning purposes. Instead, indicative costs per student place are derived by using a square meter cost limit per institution and the average square meter space per student. Taking into account that space norms naturally vary from discipline to discipline an indicative cost of approximately £15,000 per student place is used in the technological sector.</P>

      <P>Under section 2 of the Education Act, 1998, the term &ldquo;parent&rdquo; is interpreted as including a foster parent, a guardian appointed under the Guardianship of Children Acts, 1964 to 1997, or other person acting in <i>loco parentis</i> who has a child in his or her care subject to any statutory power or order of a court.</P>
      <P>Section 9 of the Act provides that schools shall ensure that parents of a student have access to records kept by a school relating to the progress of that student in his or her education.</P>
      <P>In general, parents should be encouraged to take an active interest in their children's education and it is to the benefit of the children and the school when they do. Circumstances that would justify departure from this general approach would rarely occur and would usually arise only in the context of a court order relating to matters of access and custody.</P>
      <P>While the issue of access to records in a school is essentially the function of the school authorities, my Department's position would be that schools should make all reasonable efforts to ensure that the interests and wishes of parents should at all times be respected and their rights given meaningful expression.</P>

      <P>The National Centre for Technology in Education, NCTE, is developing a central support service to assist schools in operating and maintaining their computer resources. A schools help-line has been put in place at 1850 70 40 40 and a team of 20 IT advisers has also been put in place in the 20 full-time education centres. In addition, the NCTE is currently developing models for support at local level. These include SIP and other pilot projects specifically examining models to assist schools in operating and maintaining their ICT resources.</P>
      <P>My Department has recently commissioned an expert study to examine future development of ICT in education and the potential implications for learning and teaching. This study will also provide information which will help in the further development of ICT support services for schools.</P>

      <P>Only fully qualified teachers may be considered for appointment as remedial teachers. Remedial teachers may, as part of their work, be required to teach the full primary curriculum to the pupils to whom they are assigned, and it is, therefore, necessary that they be competent to teach each aspect of it. In addition, remedial teachers may be redeployed to positions in mainstream classes. Holders of Montessori qualifications alone would not therefore be considered eligible for appointment as remedial teachers.</P>
      <P>My Department does however grant certain categories of teachers, who are not fully qualified to teach in mainstream national schools, restricted recognition to teach in certain special schools and classes. Teachers with the Montessori qualification which is awarded on completion of the three year full-time course in the Association Montessori Internationale, AMI, College, Mount St. Mary's, Milltown, Dublin 14, and teachers trained in St. Nicholas, Dún Laoghaire, Montessori, who have successfully completed the full-time course of at least three years duration which is recognised by the National Council for Educational Awards may be granted such recognition.</P>
      <P>The person referred to by the Deputy is entitled to restricted recognition to teach in special schools and classes and would be receive full salary entitlements if she were to take up such a post.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 142 and 144 together.</P>
      <P>The issues raised by the Deputies regarding principals in primary schools were discussed when I met with the INTO recently.</P>
      <P>Officials of my Department held further discussions with the INTO to examine the issues and the cost implications of implementing proposals in the report of the working group established to examine the rights roles, duties and responsibilities of principals.</P>
      <P>It is planned to have further discussions in the near future with the representatives of the managerial authorities of primary schools and the INTO.</P>
      <P>There is of course already a range of supports in place to assist principals in carrying out their functions. The middle management structures in schools which have been developed in recent years enable the principal to delegate a number of functions to other teachers. In particular, many schools have access to secretarial and caretaking services, and I have recently announced substantial improvements in the level of assistance in these areas.</P>
      <P>In recognition of the need to improve the funding of secretaries and caretakers I have recently announced that an additional £2.7 million has been made available to extend support to another 650 schools with a total enrolment of 90,000 children in the coming year.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will also be aware that I have secured an additional £9 million in the recent budget which will enable me to extend and improve the supports available to all primary schools. Details of the implementation of this will be worked out in the near future following consultations and will, when taken together with the earlier move, make a major contribution to assisting schools and principals.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department provides funding towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services in primary schools under two separate schemes. One scheme is the 1978-79 scheme for the employment of school secretaries and caretakers under which my Department meets the full cost of salary and employer's PRSI. This scheme is, however, being phased out as posts become vacant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Arising from the Programme for Economic and Social Progress &ndash; PESP &ndash; a second scheme was introduced in 1992 whereby my Department provides additional capitation grants for primary <Col N="1988" /> schools towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services. Under the PESP scheme, schools receive grants of £30 per pupil, based on their enrolments, which are paid as additions to the standard <i>per capita </i>grant.</P>
    <P>Since its introduction in 1992, the scheme has been expanded in line with undertakings given in the PESP. The scheme has been extended to include more schools by reducing the qualifying enrolment threshold to its current figure of 195 pupils, with an ultimate target of providing additional capitation grants to all primary schools with 100 pupils or more.</P>
    <P>In recognition of the need to improve the funding of secretaries and caretakers I have recently announced that an additional £2.7 million has been made available to extend support to another 650 schools with a total enrolment of 90,000 children in the coming year. The Deputy will also be aware that I have secured an additional £9 million in the recent budget which will enable me to extend and improve the supports available to all primary schools. Details of the implementation of this will be worked out in the near future following consultations and will, when taken together with the earlier move, make a major contribution to assisting schools.</P>
    <P>The position in relation to second-level is as follows: the allocation of caretaking and secretarial posts in the vocational education sector is made on a scheme wide basis and it is a matter for each committee to deploy the staff as it sees fit. Most schools in this sector have the services of a full-time caretaker and a secretary; community and comprehensive schools have a full-time secretary and caretaker and schools with an enrolment in excess of 500 pupils have two full-time secretaries; secondary schools with enrolments of 200 or more pupils and not covered by the 1978 scheme, for school secretaries, are in receipt of additional <i>per capita</i> grants towards the provision of caretaking and secretarial services, subject to maximum of £8,750 for caretaking and £10,500 in the case of secretarial services.</P>
    <P>The question of increasing the level of grant payable to schools, which I increased by £5 per student in 1997 in respect of the secondary school secretarial grant, will be examined in the budgetary context and in light of available resources. I wish to assure the Deputy that I remain committed to improvements in the provision of additional assistance to schools for caretaking and clerical services.</P>
