      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>No. Does the Minister agree that the debacle concerning the Government's withdrawal of the Intoxicating Liquor Bill, 1999, shows that rushing legislation through the House in the last week of the session is a mistake and that the Government should not repeat that mistake in regard to the human rights of immigrants?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>No. The Immigration Bill, 1999, which deals with fundamental human rights issues should not be the subject of a guillotine. It was carried by only one vote at the select committee and should not be rushed through before the end of the session.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Immigration Bill, 1999, was discussed for 16 hours by the select committee. There were 120 amendments. I congratulate the select committee on its excellent work in pursuing them. The discussion on all but five was completed by 9 p.m. when the vote brought Committee Stage to a conclusion. The amendments can be discussed again on Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>My party is deeply perturbed at the way in which the legislation is being ramrodded through the House. The attitude of the Minister and members on the Government side of the House to immigration, their steamrolling of this legislation and their refusal to allow asylum seekers to work is fostering a spirit and attitude of racism in this country which is unbecoming to all. Shame on this Administration that after two years of asking it to bring forward legislation to deal with the operation of the Refugee Act, 1996, it is forcing through legislation which is ill considered and will undoubtedly create problems in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, it is offensive of the leader of the Labour Party to say the committee is somehow fostering racism. It is most offensive. That is not the case.</P>

The committee discussed 120 amendments and only five remained, which is not unusual. The committee ought to be commended. If anybody wishes to discuss the remaining five amendments further, there is an opportunity to do so on Report Stage because they were put down on Committee Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>While the amendments were discussed on Committee Stage, the substantive sections were not. All the time was taken up with amendments. The Minister has invited the exchanges which have occurred this morning by steamrolling this legislation. There was no need for that. The House could have sat next week to deal with it, if necessary. The Opposition wants to have this legislation passed, but it wants it passed in a manner which permits rational discussion and gives reassurance to people. That has not happened because of the Government's steamroller tactics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I appeal again to the Fianna Fáil Party. Irish people appear to believe they have a right to settle in any country in the world and be treated with respect. There were many debates in this House previously about the so-called undocumented Irish emigrants in other countries. For Deputy Eoin Ryan's information, I am referring to a newspaper report about &ldquo;fears of racism if permits are withheld&rdquo;, not a comment by me. This country is treating immigrants and asylum seekers in the most disgraceful way possible. Every Member has relatives who were forced to emigrate from this country in the past and who were treated outrageously. We are now doing the same thing. I beg the Government to allocate extra time so this matter can be dealt with in a humane and compassionate way. There is not one member of the Fianna Fáil Party who does not have relatives who were forced to leave&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I must put the question. The question is: &ldquo;That the proposal for dealing with item b33 be agreed to.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It is grossly unfair of the Deputy to talk about racism. He knows what he is doing by fuelling this debate. What is written in the newspapers does not matter. What is said by the Deputy is far more important and he should not forget that.</P>
      <P>Question put: &ldquo;That the proposal for dealing with No. b33 be agreed to.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>There are many Members in larger parties who are not Front Bench spokespersons on this topic and who might like to speak. The commitment we are making to Kosovo could <Col N="772" /> be a very long one considering the length of time Irish troops have been in the Lebanon and in Cyprus &ndash; one must bear that in mind. It is important that there should be a discussion before such a commitment is made, a commitment in which the lives of Irish soldiers will be put at risk, perhaps over a long period. While I have every sympathy for smaller parties, I hope those parties also recognise there are Deputies in larger parties who want to speak too.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister perhaps does not realise that when the postponement of the elections was proposed in the House, a solemn promise was made that the Bill would be processed prior to the elections. This cannot now be done because it will not be introduced to the House until after the summer recess. The elections are due to be held in October. How will this be dealt with?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister answer the question put by Deputy Donal Carey? Is it not the case that an undertaking was given that this legislation would be passed by the House well in advance of the elections? Given that the House will not reconvene until the month of the elections, is it not the case that this commitment will not be fulfilled?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the case that this legislation deals with the allocation of constituencies? The legislation will not be considered by the House until perhaps two or three weeks before the elections. This will mean people will declare for constituencies which do not exist. Surely that is an inappropriate way to deal with a democratic election, or is the Government assuming that no amendments to the legislation will be made by the House? If so, it is treating the House as a rubber stamp.</P>

      <P>I understand the legislation is necessary for the holding of the elections. The Bill must be introduced to the House and, when passed, it must go to the President for signature. In addition the regulations associated with the legislation have to be drafted. It would be a courtesy if the House was told about the entire procedure before it consents to the withdrawal of the Bill.</P>

      <P>Standing Order 120, which allows the House to recommit a Bill either wholly or in respect of certain amendments, is a rarely used provision. However, it is appropriate on this occasion. Due to the guillotine imposed by the Government, not only was the committee unable to consider all the amendments, but it had to rush through entire sections to ensure that it got through as much of the Bill as possible in the limited time available. During the debate in the committee, Opposition Deputies who tabled amendments had to decide&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday we had to decide whether to progress through the amendments or deal with the Bill in the detail deserved by such complex legislation on which lives will depend. We decided to progress as quickly as we could because we wanted the Minister's comments on the record, not necessarily because a court would heed them but because much of this legislation will be operated by officials of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and immigration officers and we wanted the Minister's comments taken into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, this is a most unsatisfactory way to deal with legislation as important as this, with serious implications for the human rights of asylum seekers. Organisations concerned with human rights, including Amnesty International, Comhlámh and the UN High Commission for Human Rights, have expressed concern about the implications of certain sections of the Bill, and even yesterday we received submissions in this <Col N="784" /> regard. Every section of and amendment to the Bill deserves careful consideration by the Dáil. If ever a Bill was totally inappropriate for parliamentary guillotine, this is it. It is unacceptable that the Government should seek to deny the committee its right to consider the provisions in detail and effectively reduce its role to that of a rubber stamp for the Department.</P>
    <P>The Bill was originally introduced to deal with a High Court judgment which restricted the Minister's right to deport people but the Minister changed its nature by introducing on Committee Stage a 16 page-long amendment to the Refugee Act, 1996. That is the equivalent of an entire Bill and this major amendment to the 1996 Act was not discussed on Second Stage, as it had not been tabled at that time. It is therefore more important than ever that it be properly considered by the Dáil.</P>
    <P>The Refugee Act, 1996 was passed by the Rainbow Government. This Minister has now been in office for more than two years and has had plenty of time to introduce amendments, if he so wished. Why has it been left to the last minute and why is it being rushed through in this way? This is no way to conduct the legislative process. Although the Immigration Bill was published on 3 February, the Minister's 16 page amendment to the Refugee Act was only circulated on 24 June. The Dáil must have an opportunity to properly consider legislation before it &ndash; the past shows that rushed legislation is often flawed legislation. Our concern about the way in which the Bill was handled during the Committee Stage has been compounded by the decision of the government to allocate less than three hours for consideration of Report Stage. I received the list of Report Stage amendments only two minutes ago and I do not yet know how many there are.</P>
    <P>More than 14 months after the signing of the Good Friday Agreement this State has yet to fulfil its commitment to introduce legislation to establish the promised human rights commission. That delay and the manner in which the Government has processed this Bill suggests that the human and civil rights of Irish citizens or foreign nationals here do not rank highly on the Government's priority list. I protest most strongly at the way the Bill is being taken. There is time to recommit it and if necessary we could make time to deal with it properly. This is a most unacceptable way to handle a Bill on which human lives could depend.</P>

      <P>(<i>Mayo</i>)<b>:</b> I wholeheartedly support Deputy O'Sullivan's motion to recommit the Bill. The purpose of establishing committees of the House was to have a full and comprehensive debate of all aspects of legislation and to remove once and for all the spectre of the guillotine which has aborted and thwarted debate on major legislative issues over the years, and which invariably was the practice towards the end of a term when legislation was front-loaded and bludgeoned through the House.</P>
      <P>This is one of the most sensitive and far reaching human rights Bills to come before the House. When it was published on 13 February we sought an assurance that there would be a full and comprehensive debate. The level of input on Second Stage showed the high level of interest on the part of Deputies representing the public interest in the matter. On 13 April the Bill came before the committee. We were in full flow when we were notified of a major change of Government policy and told an amendment would be introduced which included large tranches of the unenacted portions of the Refugee Act, 1996. We did not have an indication of the Government's intentions until 24 June, when we were presented with a 16 and a half page amendment to introduce a new section 75A, which was effectively a new Bill. We are now expected to give effect to far-reaching legislation which was not debated on Second Stage but parachuted on to us, and which we are expected to allow through virtually without debate and without the opportunity to consult the organisations mentioned by Deputy O'Sullivan or to make our own decisions on the matter.</P>
      <P>After 16 hours we have debated some but not all of the amendments and none of the sections of the Bill. On Committee Stage we are supposed to debate not only amendments but the substance of each section, yet we have not had an opportunity to do so. We are now bulldozing through a far-reaching human rights Bill without sufficient dialogue or debate. This is absolutely unacceptable and I therefore wholeheartedly support Deputy O'Sullivan's motion. In the interest of an informed debate and producing satisfactory legislation to meet the requirements of refugees who have not been legislated for until now, and whose human rights have not been met because of inadequate procedures, I ask the Minister to reflect before guillotining the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Miss M. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>The judgment of the High Court in the case of Laurentiu <i>v</i>. Ireland, the Attorney General and <Col N="786" /> the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform found that the way in which the Aliens Act, 1935 had conferred on the Minister the power to make secondary legislation dealing with deportation was inconsistent with the 1937 Constitution. The appeal to the Supreme Court in that case was unsuccessful. Thus at present, the State has no power to deport non-nationals whose presence in the State was not or is no longer legal. This Bill provides principles, practices and procedures regarding the power of the Minister to make deportation orders, including, for the first time in Irish law, statutory safeguard procedures for potential deportees. These include notice to the person of the reasons on which a decision is to be based, the right to make representations and a requirement that they be considered before a decision is made.</P>
      <P>The Bill also proposes to give the force of an Act of the Oireachtas to Aliens Orders made under the Aliens Act 1935.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>We can arrange that. The purpose of this is to safeguard, as far as possible, the legal validity of those Orders in the event of future legal challenge where the arguments which succeeded in the Laurentiu case might equally be applied to other provisions of the Aliens Act, 1935 with potentially serious consequences for the ability of the State to exercise normal immigration controls. This would have potentially serious consequences for the ability of the State to exercise normal immigration controls would expose Irish society to inflows of criminal elements, threaten the safety and good order of society and jeopardise the continued existence of the common travel arrangements between here and the UK. Accordingly, it is absolutely essential that the Bill be enacted before the summer recess.</P>
      <P>The Bill is an interim measure intended to maintain the validity of immigration controls and restore a power to deport, both regarded by the High Court and Supreme Court as essential for the protection of society, e.g. Gannon J in <i>Osheku</i>. As already announced, the Minister is in the course of development of a set of legislative proposals for a comprehensive code of immigration and residence law, the aim of which is to replace the Aliens Act, 1935, with a modern law which will provide a framework for the development and implementation of fair and sensible immigration policies better suited to the needs both of the State and of the individuals who may be affected by its operation. Publication is expected early next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, the Minister, by way of this Bill, has brought forward a comprehensive and detailed set of amendments on the Refugee Act, 1996, for the purpose of making it workable. That was called for on a number of occasions in the <Col N="787" /> House. Everybody knows the principal features with regard to that, including the fact that we have increased applications and, therefore, we have to make all the important decisions to make it workable.</P>
    <P>If the Bill is passed before the summer recess, the work of recruiting a refugee applications commissioner and of putting in place the detailed procedural regulations can start immediately and the Act can be fully operational by the end of this year. If the Bill is not passed now, the Act cannot be in effect until well into 2000. For all these reasons, the motion for recommittal is opposed.</P>
    <P>I wondered about the points made by the <Col N="788" /> Opposition yesterday but it is important to reiterate what the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Woods, said on the Order of Business. Sixteen hours have been spent on Committee Stage. There were 120 amendments and when we finished at 9 o'clock last night only five amendments remained to be dealt with. The Bill has had a detailed hearing and it is essential that it be enacted before the summer recess because the State currently has no power to deport non-nationals whose presence in the State is no longer required.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, between lines 9 and 10, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;1.&ndash;This Act shall not apply to an unaccompanied non-national under the age of 18 years.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>On a point not related to this amendment, I submitted a substantial number of amendments for Report Stage.</P>
      <P>It was necessary to submit Report Stage amendments before last evening's Committee Stage debate. Therefore, some of the Report Stage amendments I submitted may have been dealt with on Committee Stage. The time constraint which has been imposed on the debate of this Bill has caused some difficulties, including this one. Today again, we are faced with the dilemma of deciding whether to give amendments the attention they deserve or proceed quickly to complete the passage of the Bill.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 44 also deals with the question of children and provides that a child shall not be refused leave to land in the State and shall not be made the subject of a deportation or exclusion order for as long as the child is not in the custody of any person.</P>
      <P>Other amendments relating to children were discussed on Committee Stage but I have resubmitted these two because I want the Minister to give an assurance that children, particularly unaccompanied children, who come into the State are given the due process and protection of the law. I want to be sure the Minister cannot deport children without a legal consideration of the reasons for their being in the country and without providing them with the protection of the law.</P>
      <P>The Minister indicated that implementation of the Refugee Act would ensure unaccompanied children would automatically be placed under the protection of a health board and would, therefore, have the protection of the Child Care Act. When will this provision be enacted? Will the Minister give an assurance that children who come to this country, accompanied or unaccompanied, will have the full protection of the law and that they will not be sent back to a country where they may be in danger. I include situations covered by the Dublin Convention. This matter is of major concern to NGOs who have made representations to us. I have resubmitted these amendments so that the Minister may give us a guarantee that children who arrive in a strange country with very complicated immigration legislation are afforded the protection of the law.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Mayo)</i>
        <b>:</b> I support this amendment. The case made by Deputy O'Sullivan, that people under the age of 18 who come from a foreign jurisdiction are particularly vulnerable, is valid. We have an obligation to provide the maximum possible protection for such people and to ensure they have access to all legal procedures. Although translation and interpretation facilities are made available in certain cases, asylum seekers may have difficulty in presenting their cases cogently and coherently and in underlining the strength of their cases. An immature person is particularly vulnerable in such circumstances. I ask the Minister to assure the House that the full process of the law will be made available to such young people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Opposition has made the point that the Title of the Bill is a misnomer. This is a deportation Bill, not an immigration Bill. The Bill would not have been introduced had the Supreme Court not declared a section of the 1935 Act unconstitutional. Because of that decision, various segments of the Refugee Act, 1996 and amendments to the Aliens Act, 1935 have been brought together. It is important that we recognise this is <Col N="791" /> a deportation Bill. This was underlined very forcefully on Committee Stage when the Opposition sought to insert an amendment giving the advisory board the right to advise on immigration policy as well as on asylum policy. This amendment was trenchantly rejected by the Minister of State on the grounds that it might be dangerous to include immigration matters in the remit of the board and because of the Minister's long-term intention to establish a body to deal with immigration. We do not have an immigration policy or any body dealing with immigration. An immigration policy is necessary because thankfully, after many years, we are experiencing a net inflow of people into the country.</P>
    <P>The Minister may cite section 6 of the Refugee Act which provides that children be placed in the care of a health board. The Child Care Act, 1991 is also important in this regard. We must be assured that a person under the age of 18 will automatically be placed in the care of a health board as soon as he or she makes an application for asylum.</P>

      <P>I acknowledge the great work which has been done on this Bill by Deputies O'Sullivan, Howlin and Jim Higgins. The value of their work is reflected in the fact that the Minister has accepted many of their amendments. I acknowledge the right of the Opposition to criticise the Government for the short amount of time which has been provided for this debate and I understand the frustration of the Opposition in this regard. Were I in Opposition, I would raise similar objections. However, it is unacceptable, under privilege, to criticise public servants. On 29 June, the Leader of Fine Gael said, &ldquo;I do not wish to cause disorder, but the Government has produced a raft of amendments, the equivalent of a new Bill, at the last minute and this amounts to laziness in the public service. They could have been introduced weeks ago&rdquo;. Later, when he was ruled out of order, the Leader of Fine Gael went on to say, &ldquo;I have no doubt that the Minister has nothing to do with this&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The subject of these amendments was dealt <Col N="792" /> with in great detail on Committee Stage. There is much overlap between the Refugee Act and the Immigration Bill and this is indicative of what this Bill is intended to achieve. The two pieces of legislation are complementary.</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Miss M. Wallace): We see no reason in principle why an unaccompanied minor should be immune from deportation and exempted from all other provisions of immigration law in all circumstances as is proposed in amendments Nos. 1 and 44.</P>
    <P>We cited some examples in this context. For example a 17 year old non-national convicted of drug smuggling, by virtue of these amendments, would be exempt from deportation by virtue of his or her age. Another example could be of a young child sent to Rosslare by his parents who will wait in Cherbourg to see how things develop in the hope that if the child is allowed stay the parents will have to be allowed enter the country. In such a case the health board might decide that the interests of the child would be best served by reuniting the child with his family in Cherbourg. Members will not suggest that a 17 year old non-national convicted of smuggling should be exempt in any way.</P>
    <P>Protection for unaccompanied non-national minors entering the State is set out in section 8(5) of the Refugee Act, 1996. That provision ensures that in every case where such a person arrives in the State the local health board is informed and the provisions of the Child Care Act, 1991, come into play. The role of the health board includes determining on behalf of the child whether an asylum application should be made and the pursuit of such application as necessary. The role of the health board is much wider, extending to every aspect of the child's welfare.</P>
    <P>Among the positive amendments to the Refugee Act, 1996, agreed on Committee Stage is a provision to deal with unaccompanied non-national children who are in the State when they come to notice. Another amendment accepted on Committee Stage had the effect of inserting a provision into section 5 exempting minors from detention pending deportation and also ensuring that the local health board will be able to play its role under the Child Care Act, 1991 where a minor's guardians are in custody. This is modelled on a similar provision in the Refugee Act and I am satisfied it is an appropriate way in which to meet the concerns of Deputies.</P>
    <P>As was made clear on Committee Stage, pending the main provisions of the Refugee Act coming into operation, the procedure envisaged by section 8(5) and the proposed amendment is already operating in practice on an administrative basis. The usual circumstances in which such children come to notice is that they present themselves at the Refugee Application Centre, Lower Mount Street, Dublin. This one-stop-shop for asylum seekers, established by an initiative of my Department, also houses an Eastern Health <Col N="793" /> Board centre. It is important that when a child turns up in the offices in Mount Street, he or she is immediately brought to the Eastern Health Board centre which is in the same building. The phenomenon of unaccompanied children is a small but growing one, and did not feature at all until 1996. Yesterday Members asked for statistics concerning the numbers in question and it may be of interest to note that since the beginning of 1996, 33 unaccompanied minors have applied for asylum, all but five of whom came to the notice of the Refugee Application Centre or, before it opened, the head office of my Department. Only five came to notice at the ports of entry.</P>
    <P>I do not accept the logic underlying amendment No. 1 which assumes there will never be circumstances where a person who has been refused asylum or has not applied for asylum should be returned either to his or her country of origin or the country where his or her parents, guardians or other relatives are living. Every decision on whether to remove such a child from the State must be taken carefully and all relevant factors taken into account, including the situation in the country to which it is proposed to send them. This is what the list of factors set out in section 3(6) will achieve. These factors include the age of the person under paragraph (a), humanitarian considerations under paragraph (h) and in particular domestic and family circumstances under paragraph (c). These provisions secure the interests of the child in each case. The decision in any one case should not be dictated by an assumption that merely because the economic climate in the country of return is not as healthy as that in the western world the return should not take place. Social workers dealing, for example, with intercountry adoption are at pains to decry this sort of West-centred assumption which seeks to justify the flow of children from developing countries to developed countries without regard to cultural, social and other equally important factors in the upbringing of a child and which should not be overridden by economic considerations. In this context it is noteworthy that the Hague convention on intercountry adoptions, ratification of which is being worked upon by my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, is based among other things on the premise that intercountry adoption should represent a subsidiary means of child care to be resorted to only where a child cannot be cared for in a family of his or her country.</P>
    <P>Yesterday on Committee Stage we dealt in detail with whether immigration matters are dealt with here. There is no doubt that immigration matters in regard to refugee and asylum interests are dealt with here. It is general immigration interests which we do not wish to enshrine in regard to establishment of the advisory group.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not had a chance to study the Government amendments which have been <Col N="794" /> tabled, but I thank the Minister's officials and the Minister for tabling a number of amendments.</P>
      <P>The Minister indicated that if a child presents at the Refugee Application Centre in Mount Street he or she is transferred to the Eastern Health Board centre. I presume this relates to children who enter the country in the Eastern Health Board area or who are living in the Eastern Health Board area. What happens to a child who enters the country <i>via</i> Rosslare in terms of the role of the South Eastern Health Board or a child who enters <i>via</i> Shannon in relation to the role of the Mid Western Health Board? Are the same arrangements in place whereby the Child Care Act is automatically referred to? The Minister said that reference to the Child Care Act takes place in terms of administrative practice, but will it be provided for legislatively as soon as the relevant sections of the Refugee Act are in place? Specifically will the measures in section 1 of the Immigration Bill, namely, the part which is new, also safeguard minors with a view to their being properly looked after and given the protection of the State when then they come to the country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, is probably the answer to most of the questions raised by Deputy O'Sullivan. A child who turns up in Rosslare will become involved with the South Eastern Health Board. As we see from the statistics, 33 unaccompanied non-national minors turned up at the Refugee Application Centre in Dublin and were therefore brought across the lobby to the Eastern Health Board centre in the same building. If the other five had turned up in Rosslare they would have been in contact with the South Eastern Health Board or if they turned up at Shannon with the Mid Western Health Board.</P>
      <P>Under section 8(5) of the Refugee Act legislative support is given to the provisions of the Child Care Act, 1991.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 3, line 31, after &ldquo;made&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;prior to the 3rd day of February, 1999 and&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 3 is directly connected to this. This section retrospectively validates the orders under the Aliens Act, 1935, which were found to <Col N="795" /> be unconstitutional and struck down by the High Court. It is wrong that we should have retrospective validation of what was in effect considered wrong by the High Court. When Mr. Justice Geoghegan summed up in relation to the Aliens Act he said Parliament rather than the Minister should set down policy and principles and that in the case referred to, the Minister was effectively taking upon himself the duties of Parliament. If we do not amend the Bill as I am proposing in amendments Nos. 2 and 3 we will in effect be allowing the Minister take upon himself the duties of Parliament in cases which arise retrospectively. This is not the right thing to do. My party's two related amendments, Nos. 2 and 3, will allow the Minister to proceed but will not involve engaging in retrospective legislation. They will not be in contravention of the opinions expressed by Mr. Justice Geoghegan in the Laurentiu case. That is the purpose of these amendments. The other amendment is obviously related also.</P>

        <i>(Mayo)</i>
        <b>:</b> The High Court struck down as unconstitutional section 5(1)(e) of the Aliens Act, 1935, for good reason, as Deputy O'Sullivan stated, from the point of view of an absence of policy and principles. The Bill seems to be an attempt to validate orders made prior to that. Will the Minister say whether she is satisfied that one can make retrospective validation in respect of orders, the legislation governing which has been found to be unconstitutional? Has she received legal advice to confirm that there is, as has been said on Second and Committee Stages, no constitutional frailty here?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This arose on Committee Stage. I certainly hope the Minister is able to reassure the House in regard to Deputy Higgins's question. If not, the situation is serious for everybody's sake because it would effectively mean that we have no control whatsoever. I gather, for example, that if that was the case the State could not have prevented the arrival of the Yugoslav football team. Basically, the State would have no immigration controls at the port of entry. If there was another successful challenge, it would leave the State in a serious situation from the point of view of security and other matters. I hope the Minister will reassure us that that cannot happen and that the measures taken are correct.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 2, 3 and 82 are opposed. The effect of these amendments would be to remove the Aliens (Amendment) (No. 2) Order, 1999, from the provisions of section 2 which provides that every order made prior to the passing of the Act will, with the exception of those orders specified in the Schedule to the Act, have statutory effect. I am aware that Deputies Howlin and O'Sullivan tabled a resolution seeking to annul the order but have not pursued this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="796" /> The provision in section 2 is a precautionary measure taken in the wake of the High Court judgment in the Laurentiu case which was subsequently upheld in the Supreme Court. The purpose of the measure is to offset any possibility that the finding of the court could, in another case, be extended by analogy to powers of the Minister under the Aliens Act, 1935, to make orders relating to other aspects of immigration and residence of non-nationals. This would have very serious and immediate consequences for the State in the operation of controls at ports of entry and within the State. The Attorney General has advised that such a provision is prudent and appropriate.</P>
    <P>A successful challenge along the lines of the Laurentiu case could effectively end all entry controls to the State. In terms of public policy and national security this is an occurrence which any Government would be reckless not to guard against. The recent example of the Ireland-Yugoslavia football game, to which Deputy Ryan referred, is appropriate in that had the situation arisen at the time, the State would have been powerless to prevent the arrival of the Yugoslav team here to fulfil that fixture. An important executive function of the State, used on that occasion to take a principled stand on an issue of international significance, would no longer be available. On a wider scale, the absence of controls would expose our community to the prospect of the most undesirable persons passing unhindered into the State. It would also spell the end of the common travel area arrangements which have for long been an important feature of relations between the State and its nearest neighbour. The duty to protect those arrangements in the interests of the common good of the people of Ireland has been recognised by the courts and is of such significance that Ireland, in the context of the Amsterdam Treaty, negotiated a special protocol in order for us to be able to continue those arrangements.</P>
    <P>As I have pointed out, this is an interim measure. As already announced, the Minister has in the course of development a set of legislative proposals for a comprehensive code of immigration and residence law, the aim of which is to replace the Aliens Act, 1935, with a modern law which will provide a framework for the development and implementation of fair and sensible immigration policies better suited to the needs of the State and the individuals who may be affected by its operation. Its publication is expected early next year.</P>
    <P>Work is advancing on these proposals and the intention is to have them before the Government before the end of the year, but it cannot be predicted with any degree of accuracy when a Bill on the considerable scale required will become law. There are questions of other legislative priorities that may arise in the meantime to place demands on the resources of the parliamentary draftsman or the Oireachtas. It would be wrong, therefore, to impose a six month lifespan on section 2, as <Col N="797" /> proposed by amendment No. 3 because the process of introducing a further Bill to extend that lifespan would itself delay further the bringing forward of the comprehensive proposals.</P>
    <P>I think it is safe to say that while it is all we have at the moment, the Act is not in this day and age a particularly satisfactory basis for a modern immigration and residence policy. As indicated on Second Stage, I want a legislative framework which facilitates the implementation of sensible and fair-minded policies in this area, where all concerned know what to expect from the law and what the law expects from them. My aim is to put in place a comprehensive code of immigration law which pays clear and obvious respect both to the protections which society requires and to the human rights of the individuals whose lives are touched by the law. This Bill is a first, interim step on that road.</P>
    <P>Subsection (1) gives all aliens orders, except those listed in the Schedule to the Bill, made before the passing of this legislation the force of law as if the orders had been enacted by an Act of the Oireachtas. The exceptions include, of course, Article 13 of the 1946 order, the provision impugned by the High Court in the Laurentiu case &ndash; to have included that in this provision would have been inappropriate.</P>
    <P>The other aliens order excluded from the scope of subsection (1), and thus not given the force of an Act of the Oireachtas, is the Aliens (Visas) Order, 1999, which was made on 3 February last. The reason for this exception is to allow for flexibility to make further orders under the 1935 Act making changes from time to time in the lists of countries whose nationals do not require visas and whose nationals are required to have transit visas. This power to make amending orders will not exist in relation to the aliens orders which are given the effect of an Act of the Oireachtas by subsection (1). I regard that subsection as, in effect, fixing the Aliens Order, 1946, and its amending orders in their present form until a new legislative base for immigration law is put in place.</P>
    <P>It is desirable that the Minister should retain the power to decide by order who should require a visa to enter the State. A visa requirement is brought in usually in circumstances designed to curb the flow of illegal immigrants or potential such flows. It can be done quickly and effectively by making an order as is the case at present. In addition, to ensure the protection of the common travel area with the UK and conformity with our EU partners in relation to the common visa list, it is necessary to have an expeditious procedure for doing this. Any additions or deletions to the visa list are, of course, carried out in consultation with the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>
    <P>In the meantime it is vital that the immigration controls of the State are protected. To include the Aliens (No. 2) Order, 1999, in the Schedule, as amendment No. 82 proposes, would completely undermine the protection proposed in section 2 because that order restates with some minor <Col N="798" /> amendments the provisions dealing with entry controls.</P>
    <P>I emphasise that the court decision did not relate to any other part of the immigration law except deportation. It is wrong for Deputy O'Sullivan to describe all the orders as having been found to be unconstitutional. The aim of this Bill is to ensure that the same arguments which succeeded in the Laurentiu case will not be used to wipe away our current immigration controls.</P>

      <P>The Minister gave us a long and detailed reply. We must concur with her that we need substantial legislation as quickly as possible, particularly in light of the way in which we have to deal with this legislation. I am not too sure what will be the result of the complications which we have to deal with in this legislation. I would urge the Government to work on that substantial legislation as soon as possible. On the Order of Business the Minister indicated that it will probably be next year before it will be published, and that is disappointing. I hope the Minister of State's timeframe is the more accurate one and that the legislation will be published this year.</P>
      <P>On amendment No. 3, the Minister indicated that a six month period might not be long enough and that it might be necessary to make further changes in order to encompass cases which might arise in regard to deportation between now and the time the legislation comes into effect. Surely, the Minister could have tabled a Report Stage amendment which would have extended the time period beyond six months if necessary. Nothing the Minister has said counteracts the principle underlying our amendments, namely, that it is not desirable that we should have this kind of retrospective validation which, in effect, goes against the principle of Mr. Justice Geoghegan's judgment on the right and duty of the Oireachtas to define legal principles. In effect, a retrospective ministerial decision has been made on this section of the Bill.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 4, line 10, to delete &ldquo;and to remain <Col N="799" /> thereafter out of the State&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;for such a period as may be specified in the order and without prejudice to the right to re-apply for permission to re-enter the State&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment refers to deportation orders. Section 3(1) states: &ldquo;Subject to the subsequent provisions of this section, the Minister may by order (in this Act referred to as &ldquo;a deportation order&ldquo;) require any non-national specified in the order to leave the State within such period as may be specified in the order to and to remain thereafter out of the State.&rdquo;  I am seeking the deletion of &ldquo;and to remain thereafter out of the State&rdquo; and the substitution of &ldquo;for such a period as may be specified in the order and without prejudice to the right to re-apply for permission to re-enter the State&rdquo;. The legislation is sufficiently draconian without specifying that a person must remain thereafter out of the State and conveying the impression of finality. That is too absolute and far-reaching.</P>
    <P>The order should be open at some stage to allow a person to reapply for admission to the State. That is why I am seeking the deletion of &ldquo;and to remain thereafter out of the State&rdquo; which clearly conveys the impression that a person does not have recourse to a further right of entry or access to the State. I am seeking the insertion in the Bill of a provision that, in certain eventualities, a person can be enabled to reapply to enter the State and have his or her application considered on its merits.</P>

      <P>This amendment, which was discussed on Committee Stage, surprises me. If a person is asked to leave the State without being told not to come back, he or she can turn around and come straight back in. That makes the whole process a sham. I understand that people who have been deported may apply from abroad to re-enter the State. If we do not specify that people cannot come back into the country, we will be faced with a revolving door syndrome which will make a farce of the entire process. I appreciate what Deputy Higgins is saying, but the Minister stated on Committee Stage that cases could be re-examined and that people could reapply to re-enter the State.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">

      <P>Amendment No. 4 is opposed. When we discussed this matter on Committee Stage I stressed that a deportation order is not a temporary removal from the State with the option to return whenever a person so wishes as that would be to defeat the whole purpose of the order. A person is deported from the State on the basis that his or her presence here is clearly invalid or undesirable. The intention, therefore, clearly is that the person so deported should remain outside the State. The order must, in each case, state that the person is to go away and stay away. If it simply said &ldquo;leave the State&rdquo;, there would be nothing to stop an immediate re-entry. Furthermore, an order made in respect of a per<Col N="800" /> son already outside the State would make no sense unless it included the requirement to remain outside the State.</P>
      <P>Section 3(11) provides that an order may be amended or revoked. It is open to a person who has been deported to apply from abroad to seek to have an order amended or revoked, in the context of a visa application if the person is subject, under our law, to a visa requirement. Any such person would have his or her case re-examined and the order lifted in circumstances where it was so merited. In this sense, therefore, an order is not necessarily permanent, although it must be said that deportation orders are not lightly made and are rarely revoked, to our recollection. There have been two cases in the past 18 months in which persons, the subject of deportation orders, were readmitted because circumstances had changed in both instances. These points were made on Committee Stage. We also made it plain that a person, the subject of a deportation order, who is removed from the State on foot of that order but who subsequently returns to the State by whatever means and applies for asylum cannot be prevented from making such an application and will have it dealt with to a proper conclusion. This is the position under our existing asylum determination procedures and will remain the position when the Refugee Act, 1996, becomes fully operational later this year.</P>

        <b>:</b> I am not in any way trying to create a revolving door syndrome where someone banished from the State on foot of a legitimate deportation order can return here immediately. I am merely seeking that such a person would not be precluded from reapplying. The terminology of the Minister's argument seems to be somewhat contradictory. On the one hand, she stated that a deportation order is not a temporary move and that the clear message is &ldquo;go away and stay away&rdquo;. On the other hand, she stated that a deportation order would not necessarily be permanent. As far as the deportation order, as enshrined in this legislation, is concerned, it is a case of &ldquo;go away, stay away and do not even consider reapplying&rdquo;. The legislation contains no reference whatsoever to the right to reapply.</P>
      <P>Deportation orders are made on serious grounds, with the legitimacy of a person's application to remain in this jurisdiction rejected in the courts and orders duly made by the Minister. Where a case has been evaluated in detail, it is obvious that an order must be invoked. I am simply saying that circumstances can change. Our attitude in this country could change. Someone might be banished from the State on grounds that he or she is an economic refugee rather than someone seeking asylum on humanitarian grounds. It could happen, in the context of the Celtic tiger economy, that the person's skills or talents, which he or she hoped would be recognised, might at some stage be in short supply here and the person might be welcomed into the country on the basis of economic requirement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="801" /> The attitude of the Government partners to the question of whether work visas should be granted appears fluid. The position internationally may also change. Certain countries are categorised as safe. While Pakistan may appear safe, within it there are different minority ethnic groups which are not being provided with the necessary human rights protection. Should the position change, a person, the subject of a deportation order, may become the victim of a humanitarian atrocity. He or she should be able to make a further application to re-enter the country. The Bill should not be so explicit, definitive, absolute or final.</P>

      <P>There are many grounds on which a person may be deported. Section 3(2)(b) reads:</P>
      <P>a person whose deportation has been recommended by a court in the State before which such person was indicted for or charged with any crime or offence</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment is opposed. Section 3(2) lists categories of non-nationals who are liable to deportation. The provision at paragraph (b) to make recommendations of deportation in criminal cases is of long standing. It is important for the courts to have this power which is often exercised in the interests of the person concerned. For example, a court may, as an alternative to arriving at a guilty verdict and imposing a custodial sentence, recommend deportation, thus sparing the individual concerned from having a conviction on his or her record and the possibility of a stretch in custody which is not a pleasant prospect at the best of times but known to be particularly difficult for non-nationals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Persons charged with offences in recent cases have been glad to avail of this provision and include persons charged with prostitution <Col N="802" /> offences and breaches of immigration law. A person in this category is liable to deportation. This does not imply that all such persons should be deported. It depends on the circumstances of each case. For example, a tourist who becomes involved in a serious brawl may be a suitable candidate for deportation whereas a non-national settled here for a number of years may not. The factors to be taken into account are listed in subsection (6) and are designed to ensure the decision is proportionate to the facts of a particular case.</P>
    <P>The State should be in a position to deport a person in the circumstances set out in paragraph (b). To delete that paragraph would be to seriously curtail the court's discretion in this area to the possible detriment, not necessarily of the community but in many cases of the individual concerned. These provisions can be exercised in their favour.</P>
    <P>As agreed at the select committee, section 3(5)(b) has been amended to ensure the notification procedures will apply to persons where the court makes a recommendation on the basis of criminal charges.</P>

      <P>I have no difficulty with a person who has been indicted or, after due process, convicted being the subject of a deportation order depending on the gravity of the offence. I do have a difficulty, however, with the insertion of the words &ldquo;or charged with&rdquo;. While the Minister of State said there will be no obligation to enforce this provision, the option will be available. As Deputy O'Sullivan said, a person is deemed innocent until proved guilty. If a person is charged with an offence, the courts should be afforded the opportunity of dealing with it and making a determination as to whether the person concerned is innocent or guilty. To deport a person, irrespective of the gravity of the offence, with no right to reapply, is extraordinary. I sought to have the words &ldquo;or charged with&rdquo; deleted on Committee Stage to ensure a person would be brought before the courts, charged and convicted. To convict a person without following due process is fundamentally wrong, flawed and unfair.</P>

If one of them comes from another country, without following due process, he or she may be deported on the recommendation of the court. Some of the other nine may be found guilty. It may well be the case that the person deported may have been found innocent of the particular charge on the grounds that it was difficult to prove who had <Col N="803" /> taken part in the wrongdoing.

      <P>In page 4, to delete lines 24 to 26.</P>
      <P>This amendment relates to deportation orders and seeks to remove paragraph (e) which states: &ldquo;a person whose application for asylum has been transferred to a convention country for examination pursuant to section 22 of the Refugee Act, 1996&rdquo;. I want to ensure that where people are deported to a Dublin Convention country, they will have the appeals mechanism of the Refugee Act at their disposal. There is a great deal of concern about this.</P>
      <P>I referred this morning to another representation I received yesterday in relation to some aspects of this legislation, particularly this paragraph. There are fears about certain relationships between convention countries and other countries and what might happen if a person is deported to those convention countries. There is concern that a person might end up in Algeria, for example, if they are sent to Germany or Britain. People sent to Germany might also be returned to eastern European countries as Germany has certain arrangements with those countries.</P>
      <P>A person sent back to a Dublin Convention country should have the benefit of section 22 of the Refugee Act and the legislation should be clear on that. This would ensure that people would not be sent back to a convention country and subsequently be deported to a country where their lives and safety would be in danger.</P>

      <P>The Dublin Convention is a sensible means of trying to bring order to the situations of people seeking refugee status in countries throughout Europe. It is ludicrous that a person should apply for refugee status in a variety of countries within Europe so the concept of the convention, where the person applies in just one country, is good.</P>
      <P>However, the point raised by Deputy O'Sullivan is interesting. Members have received letters about the situation of people who might be sent to Germany. There have also been letters in the newspapers about this. We also received correspondence on the relationship that might exist between Germany and Algeria. I do not know if this information is correct but it would be strange if the situation were as it is outlined and if there were such a close connection between the German and Algerian authorities. Most people would be concerned about that, given the seriousness of the political situation in Algeria. There has been huge abuse of human rights there, particularly in the case of people being pursued by the state.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate. If this amendment is accepted, the Minister will not have any means of removing a person who is not entitled to be here in the first place and who should be removed under the Dublin Convention to the appropriate EU state from which he or she travelled. An illegal immigrant or asylum seeker might travel from one country, such as France or Germany, where the person might have applied for asylum and decide, for whatever reason, to move on to Dublin and apply for asylum in Ireland. On making an application it will be discovered that the person has travelled from a signatory country to the Dublin Convention and should be returned to that country.</P>
      <P>There would be genuine concern and fear for the person if he or she were to be returned to a country which had not signed up to the Dublin Convention and in which the person would not be afforded appropriate protection. If that was the case, I could understand the necessity for the amendment. However, given that the person would be returned to a country which is a signatory of the Dublin Convention and would, therefore, afford the individual appropriate protection and accommodation, there is no need for the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">

      <P>The amendment is opposed. It proposes, in effect, that there should not be any means of removing to another Dublin Convention country a person whose application has been transferred there under the convention. This situation would be unacceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Dublin Convention sets out sensible criteria for determining which of the member states of the EU should deal with an application made <Col N="805" /> in one of them. It has been operating among member states since 1 September, 1997 and since that time Ireland has transferred 33 cases to other convention countries and has accepted 104 asylum applicants back into the State. That accounts for more that 2 per cent of all applications. These are the latest figures available.</P>
    <P>I have seen and heard the Dublin Convention described as a means for the State to avoid dealing with asylum claims with which it should be obliged to deal. The figures do not bear this out. However, I cannot accept that it is reasonable for an asylum applicant to be able to shop around, as it were, going from country to country as the claim is rejected in each place. I also cannot accept that it is reasonable that Ireland should be obliged to consider an asylum claim from somebody who already has a claim under consideration in France or Germany, nor should France or Germany be obliged to consider a claim from somebody whose claim has already been dealt with here. That is, nonetheless, the logic behind the Deputy's argument for this amendment.</P>
    <P>Each state that is a party to the Dublin Convention reaffirmed its obligations under the 1951 Geneva Convention and related protocol by virtue of article 2 of the Dublin Convention. I am satisfied that the convention is operating fairly and that the deportation power is essential for persons whose applications are transferred under the convention in order to ensure that it continues to operate fairly in the Irish context. Paragraph (e) is, accordingly, an essential part of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Under amendments to the Bill agreed on Committee State, the Refugee Applications Commissioner will be responsible for dealing with Dublin Convention cases and the independent Appeals Tribunal will be responsible for all appeals in these cases. With regard to the concerns expressed by Deputy O'Sullivan and Deputy Ryan about relations between EU states and third countries, these are always subject to the international obligations under the 1951 convention. These obligations include the provisions of article 33 of the 1951 Convention Against Refoulement, reaffirmed by article 2 of the convention.</P>

In other words, they should not consider that since someone came in through Germany they must go back the same way. They should also consider the human rights concerns that have been expressed by reputable organisations about people being sent back from countries like Germany to places where they may well be in danger.</P>

      <P>In page 4, line 36, after &ldquo;good&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;for serious reasons related to the personal misconduct of the person concerned&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We debated this amendment on Committee Stage in some detail. The common good provision should only be invoked against a specific wrong-doer. In other words, it should concern only the activities of a particular person and should not be invoked in a generalised way. This is in line with EU law and I am concerned that it should be included in the Bill.</P>

        <i>(Mayo)</i>
        <b>:</b> I support the amendment on the basis that it would seem too much of a blanket provision to leave it entirely to the definition of the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, or a subsequent Minister, as to what constitutes the common good. Up to now we have tried to be explicit. We have tried to build in safeguards, particularly for deportation orders where people can simply be deported from the country on the basis of being charged without having been convicted of an offence. We feel that is excessive.</P>
      <P>This section seems to be a catch-all provision which depends on the mood and mentality of the Minister of the day who can decide what, in his opinion, is the common good. The wording states: &ldquo;A person whose deportation would, in the opinion of the Minister, be conducive to the common good.&rdquo;  I do not like the lack of specificity in this sweeping provision which is so general and broad-ranging. The inclusion of such a provision leaves great grounds for suspicion about what the intention is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards deportation orders, we should be clear, definitive and specific. We should set down in clear detail the conditions, qualifications and <Col N="807" /> other necessary detail concerning the set of circumstances that will merit the issuance of a deportation order. Inserting a catch-all provision like this is potentially very dangerous.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the previous two speakers. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has a disgraceful reputation in dealing with refugees and deportation issues. It is most unfortunate that the legislation in this area that I published in 1993, before Deputy O'Sullivan was a Member of this House, was voted down by the then Fianna Fáil-Labour Government. Many of the difficulties that are being experienced in this area, including putting together correct procedures, and ensuring that people are dealt with on a humanitarian and common-sense basis and are treated with dignity, would have been put to bed six years ago had the Fianna Fáil-Labour Government not voted down the measure.</P>
      <P>I refer specifically to the section we are dealing with, but I am not doing so to create conflict with Deputy O'Sullivan who was not a Member of the House at the time I introduced that measure. I feel extremely strongly about this issue. I personally find that the political games played in the House with this whole area, by the Fianna Fáil and Labour parties, are sickening. I stayed out of the debate for fear of generating unnecessary controversy. I regret that we will not have the time to consider the Bill in full detail on Report Stage.</P>
      <P>I do not believe that the Minister or his Department should be given this power to deport non-nationals in circumstances where, in the opinion of the Minister, it would be conducive to the common good. That is the criterion, but it means whatever the Minister wants it to mean at any particular time. On the basis that the Minister will act generally on the advice of his civil servants, it means whatever the section of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has to say on this issue when a deportation order is being considered.</P>
      <P>Historically, the Department has a disgraceful record in these areas, and it is time this was understood. People have been treated appallingly. They have been deported in circumstances under which they should not have been. People have been deported back to countries to which they should not have been deported. This broad discretion should not remain in the Bill. The amendment proposed by Deputy O'Sullivan is as good as any other amendment, although one could use different forms of wording. However, if there is to be a catch-all provision to cover some areas that are not already covered, Deputy O'Sullivan's amendment is worthy of support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this provision remains in the Bill as it stands, the legislation will not have the same reforming impact as is intended. I am concerned that this provision will run into serious difficulties with the courts if the Department tries to rely upon it. I would be interested to hear from the Minister a <Col N="808" /> definition of what is envisaged as being an appropriate deportation of a person where the Minister believes such a deportation is conducive to the common good. I am asking the Minister to give me three or four specific examples of circumstances which fall outside all the other provisions that exist, which would indicate that someone's deportation is conducive to the common good. Are we talking about the personality, political views or behaviour of the individual? Are we talking about a situation where the individual may be meritorious but the State might benefit from his or her deportation? What are we talking about? What does the phrase actually mean, beyond giving the Department a broad sweeping provision which allows it to set aside all the other criteria because the deportation &ldquo;is conducive to the common good&ldquo;?</P>
    <P>I want specific examples of circumstances in which the Minister may rely on this provision. Let us see from the examples whether we know what we are doing or whether the Minister will simply say that &ldquo;not conducive to the common good&rdquo; means just that. As this is Report Stage, I will not be able to contribute on this section again and I am sorry for dwelling on this matter at great length. However, if the Minister is not able to provide three or four examples in which this phrase appropriately applies, Deputy O'Sullivan's amendment should be accepted.</P>

      <P>I have listened with interest to the contributions concerning this section. I am somewhat satisfied with the line as it currently reads, which is &ldquo;to be conducive to the common good&rdquo;. I would be very happy if I could foresee the appropriate line or lines to put in its place. Unfortunately, however, we are not in the happy position of knowing what might occur in future and, therefore, what should be in legislation to deal with it. We have all seen this in the past. Some time after legislation has been enacted we realise we have faltered and do not have the appropriate mechanisms. The phrase &ldquo;conducive to the common good&rdquo;  may be somewhat bland but it covers a wide remit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. Perhaps the Minister of State will clarify on what basis a Minister would be in a position to make a deportation order which, in the opinion of the Minister, would be conducive to the common good? It has been said that the Minister could do so at a whim. It would be appreciated if the Minister would clarify this, using the quote &ldquo;at a whim&rdquo; from the opposite side. I would like to think the Minister would have had a number of recommendations and reports before making such an order, and that the case would have gone through a fairly lengthy procedure involving the Garda, the Department of Foreign Affairs or the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, and that there would <Col N="809" /> be adequate supporting evidence for such a decision.</P>
      <P>Where a Minister has made a deportation order or has refused a visa application, the applicant is advised by the Department that the decision is final. In light of the Freedom of Information Act, will these papers be available if requested?</P>
      <P>I caution the Oppositon, although I see the merit in inserting after &ldquo;good&rdquo;  the words &ldquo;for serious reasons related to the personal misconduct of the person concerned&rdquo;. An example could easily be quoted on that basis. We have recently witnessed very serious criminals totally misleading the Garda Síochána while under investigation. They appeared innocent while serious criminal activity was taking place. They were not personally involved in misconduct but were seriously involved in the overall scam which was not in the best interests of the common good. I think all sides will acknowledge that what I am saying is fact. Given that I had been asked for an example, that is an example of the sort of thing that happens.</P>
      <P>Surely we should leave it with the relevant Departments of Foreign Affairs and Justice, Equality and Law Reform to carry out the normal investigation of whatever reports come through the system and if there is sufficient and satisfactory evidence that a deportation order should be made in the interests of the common good, so be it. In that way we would cover ourselves from the type of thing we have witnessed among our own citizens who have been participating in crime at arm's length and have got away with it for a considerable period, much to the annoyance of the public. That is a good example of a person not misconducting himself but orchestrating misconduct that would not be in the common good. That is the reason I do not support the amendment.</P>

      <P>The amendments are opposed. These amendments limit unnecessarily the power of the Minister in a situation where it is not possible to predict what set of circumstances might arise which might give rise to the need to deport or exclude a person. Under Section 3 (2) (i), it is important to note that persons in this category and the other categories in subsection (2) must have their cases considered in combination with subsection (6) of this section. The criteria in that subsection already captured most, if not all, of the circumstances where serious reasons related to the personal misconduct of the person concerned would lead to the conclusion that deportation was conducive to the common good. As I stated on Committee Stage, the purpose of paragraph (i) is to provide a residual scope to cater for circumstances not foreseen by the preceding paragraphs. This is precisely in line with the approach suggested by Mr. Justice Geoghegan in his judgment in the Laurentiu case; the case from which the Bill arose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy's amendment could be held to rule out the removal of family members of a person <Col N="810" /> being deported on the basis of one of the preceding paragraphs, even though that might be in the best interest of particular minor dependants of the person, although unrelated to their personal conduct.</P>
    <P>This residual provision is, as Mr. Justice Geoghegan indicated, necessary so that the common good can be protected against situations which may threaten it even though not specifically foreseen by other provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>This issue was discussed at some length on Committee Stage in relation to exclusion orders. In relation to amendment No. 19, I am satisfied that the words used in the section 4 as it stands are sufficiently restrictive to ensure appropriate use only of an exclusion order, but at the same time are flexible enough to encompass appropriate use of the provision which is not confined to the personal conduct of the individual and were it to do so would fail to protect us from some very notorious individuals who although not directly involved in atrocities are the masterminds behind them or are so closely associated with such persons that their presence in the State might provide a form of hook on which to hang efforts to pull the undesirable person into the State.</P>
    <P>I am including a Report Stage amendment to section 12, amendment No. 80, a provision for parliamentary review of exclusion orders. This will require that all orders made under this section will be laid before both Houses, and gives Deputies or Senators the opportunity, within 21 sitting days, to overturn such an order by motion. This proposal underlines the serious and very exceptional nature of the exclusion order and of its intended use, and acts as a proper parliamentary review of the process which guards against its inappropriate use.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter's assertion that effectively the Minister can make decisions on a whim is unwarranted and unsustainable. It is all the more odd coming from a Deputy who is a lawyer and is familiar with the doctrines of administrative law and is adept at the judicial review mechanism which acts as a proper check on all administrative decisions, including these. The words clearly do not need any further clarification. Examples of people we are talking about would be people who work illegally in the State, people who violate the common travel area, people who no longer comply with the conditions of the Commission, for example if they came to set up a business and have since given up that activity. It cannot be used arbitrarily and is judicially reviewable. Once a decision is taken by the Minister of the day, the case would be debated by both Houses of the Oireachtas. For all these reasons I am concerned and annoyed at the comments made by Deputy Shatter with regard to the Department and that he said he stayed out of the debate in order not to generate unnecessary controversy. Yet he comes in here with a sledge hammer and makes disgraceful remarks with regard to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform which are incorrect. I am surprised at him availing of an <Col N="811" /> opportunity such as this to take a swipe at the Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to express my concern where the Minister refers to &ldquo;circumstances that might arise in the future&rdquo;. That very much underlines our concerns about this section. In effect the Minister has broadranging powers in regard to deportation orders. I accept there are good benevolent Ministers who would not deport a person unless they had sound reasons for doing so. The protection of an individual has to rest in law not in the benevolence of Ministers. That is the underlying point. The Minister is being given broadranging powers in subsection (2). That is why we are seeking to define those powers more specifically in relation to the personal misconduct of an individual.</P>
      <P>I am not convinced by the Minister's argument that it is necessary to include such a broad ranging section in the Bill. It could be abused by a Minister with strong personal views who may not take the advice of the Department, the commission or the refugee board to be established by the legislation. It gives too much power to the Minister and I will, therefore, press the amendment.</P>
      <P>I reject what Deputy Shatter said about the Labour Party. When Joan Burton was Minister of State she gave a great deal of consideration to the drafting of the Refugee Bill, which is now the Refugee Act, and to what the NGOs had to say. I reject the suggestion that we are playing games with this issue. We are treating it very seriously. I do not see why the Deputy made his point. He attended the debate for only a short time. However, I welcome his support for the amendment. I am not satisfied such wide ranging powers should be given to a Minister in the serious business of expelling a person from the country.</P>

        <b>:</b> I plead with the Minister of State not to reject the very reasonable amendment in the name of Deputy O'Sullivan. She is seeking to include a safeguard by inserting into the Bill a requirement in respect of the definition of what is conducive to the common good. Subsection (2) lists the categories of persons. We have problems with that. For example, subsection (2)(a) specifies that an order under subsection (1) may be made in respect of &ldquo;a person who has served or is serving a term of imprisonment imposed on him or her by a court in the State.&rdquo;  A person can be imprisoned in this country for the non-payment of a parking fine. Subsection (2)(b) specifies that an order under subsection (1) may be made in respect of &ldquo;a person whose deportation has been recommended by a court in the State before which such person was indicted for or charged with any crime or offence.&rdquo;  The subsection lists various other such categories.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having been challenged by Deputy Shatter, the Minster of State offered some so-called definitions on what could be regarded as coming within <Col N="812" /> her opinion of what is conducive to the common good. These include working illegally here, contravening travel area regulations, etc. Such criteria should be specifically included in the Bill. To allow the Minister decide at whim and depending on his mood, mentality or condition, or in what direction the wind is blowing in County Kerry, is to give too much authority to any Minister, despite the intention that such powers would not be abused. In view of this, I ask the Minister of State to accept this reasonable amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>The Leader of the Opposition at one time referred to the word &ldquo;untouchables&rdquo;. There were people operating in this country who were seen to be untouchable. Their crimes were notorious and they got away with them for far too long, as many young grieving widows of drug addicts will testify. They were not only involved in the drug culture, but also in serious armed raids and cash robberies. They were always at arms length from the horrible tragedies they perpetrated.</P>
      <P>Of course we would like to pin down every aspect of legislation. I have no doubt that is the purpose of amendment No. 7 when it seeks to insert the words &ldquo;for serious reasons related to the personal misconduct of the person concerned&rdquo;. However, given what we have experienced and witnessed, how can we address the untouchables, who carried on their crimes for far too long? </P>

No sensible Minister will make a decision without adequate evidential support. The Minister of State referred to a new parliamentary procedure that will be available to the House if there is any grievance over a ministerial order. Could she clarify this?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I make no apologies for the comments I made. The Bill is before us simply because the courts have finally forced the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to produce legislation to deal with deportation issues of a detailed nature. Hitherto the Aliens Act has allowed the Department to exercise a broad discretion, which resulted in a large number of cases before the courts. The Department and different Ministers treated people disgracefully and the courts had to intervene to stop the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also make no apology to Deputy O'Sullivan. Had the legislation I published in 1993 been enacted, it would have addressed many of the issues we are still struggling to address. When Joan Burton was Minister of State she cogitated <Col N="813" /> on the issue from 1993-95, produced a Bill, but was then incapable of bringing it into operation.</P>
    <P>The examples provided by Deputy Callely relate to EU nationals who were untouchable in this State because we did not have the Criminal Assets Bureau. They could not be deported under this legislation. We do not have a group of South American gunslingers sitting in the hills of Counties Dublin, Cork or elsewhere, directing criminal activities that others are conducting. That problem is being solved by the Criminal Assets Bureau. The people to which the Deputy referred have nothing to do with deportation orders. They were EU nationals who were entitled to live in this State and they will continue to be entitled to live here. If they engage in criminal activity there is now a mechanism to ensure they are taken to the courts and dealt with properly. None of that is a reason for giving the Department yet another broad discretion to deport people in certain circumstances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">

      <P>I cannot understand Deputy Shatter's interventions. He says the High Court judgment is the reason for the Bill. At the same time, he seeks to depart totally from the judge's recommendations. The legislation seeks to be in line with the High Court ruling. The judge set out in clear terms what the legislation should contain, including the residual provision covering the common good.</P>
      <P>Deputy Higgins spoke about the wind blowing in from County Kerry. Some wind blew in to the Chamber when Deputy Shatter arrived with a sledge hammer and clobbered the Labour Party, my Department and everybody else. Such comments are not helpful when dealing with legislation.</P>
      <P>In response to Deputy Callely, I again confirm that we have included a Report Stage amendment to section 12 to deal with a parliamentary review of exclusion orders. When the Minister makes an exclusion order decision, both Houses will be in a position to debate it within 21 sitting days, regardless of what way the wind is blowing.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 4, between lines 36 and 37, to insert the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(3) Pending the making of a deportation order any person who has applied for asylum and who has been in the State for over 3 months may apply for and be granted a work permit by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment notwithstanding any con<Col N="814" /> dition imposed by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
    <P>Asylum seekers who have been in the State for more than three months should be entitled to apply to the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment for a work permit. I welcome the fact that many members of both Government parties support the right to work for people who seek asylum. There is a strong argument in favour of granting the right to work to such people.</P>
    <P>Arguments have been put forward on the basis that there are jobs to spare and it is difficult to recruit people to fill them. Many asylum seekers who await the hearing of their cases have the skills required to take up available jobs. On Committee Stage, the Minister of State said that it would be racist to give them jobs because some might not be skilled enough. It was the most convoluted argument I have ever heard against granting the right to work.</P>
    <P>People who wait for long periods for their cases to be heard cannot work and it creates the impression that they are living off the State. This contributes to racist attitudes, but they want to live and work here. They have skills and are capable of taking up many of the jobs that are available and they should be granted the right to work. As long as they do not have that right, the racist attitude of certain people will continue, given that they regularly encounter asylum seekers in health board supplied accommodation or bed and breakfast accommodation and see them walking the streets because, naturally, they have time on their hands since they cannot work.</P>
    <P>Asylum seekers should be granted the right to work and no argument can be made against it. Last Tuesday there was a demonstration outside the gates of Leinster House to grant the right to work to asylum seekers and that should be supported. There are plenty of jobs here, yet FÁS is recruiting people in other European countries to fill jobs here that could be filled by asylum seekers.</P>
    <P>However, we must ensure that our unemployed people who may not have the necessary skills, training or education are given the attention they need. It is not an either-or situation. We need to deal with our own unemployed but we also need to give an opportunity to asylum seekers who have the necessary skills to take up the wide range of jobs that are available. A mix of low skilled and high skilled jobs is available. Many asylum seekers have computer skills, for example, and could take up IT positions while others have different skills. They should be granted the right to work.</P>

        <b>:</b> You have made the case <Col N="815" /> most eloquently, a Chathaoirligh, in terms of the damning denunciation that everybody has heaped on the Government for the manner in which it has handled this legislation. Deputy O'Sullivan has made the case well in regard to the amendments. The policy of not allowing skilled people, who genuinely want to work and make a positive contribution to the economy, pending the determination of their asylum applications, to join the workforce is calculated to whip up hysteria, xenophobia and racism .</P>
      <P>Headlines have been printed about refugee spongers and wild hysteria has been generated by irresponsible comments regarding so-called criminal activity by these people. There has been little evidence of that apart from the odd case where some refugees were hauled before the courts for committing a crime or two. IBEC, which represents big industry, and ICTU, which represents the welfare of workers, were unanimous in urging the Government to introduce a policy which would allow these people to work and contribute to the economy on the basis that there is a skills shortage and their skills are needed. There is clear evidence that the majority of asylum seekers who enter Ireland have qualifications, skills and talents and would be able to make a much needed contribution to the economy while at the same time, as Deputy O'Sullivan stated, saving the Exchequer considerable money in terms of the resources which must be found, particularly by the Eastern Health Board, to assist them during their stay here.</P>
      <P>When will the political ping-pong stop between the two Government partners on this issue? On the one hand, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs said, &ldquo;yes, we will&rdquo; while, on the other, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform said, &ldquo;no, we will not&rdquo;. The right of asylum seekers to work should be granted in order to end the current prevarication once and for all. Different intentions have been enunciated by the two senior Ministers.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, stated that a decision would be made in due course while the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform was more forthcoming yesterday evening. However, at the same time there is no clear indication that a long overdue and sensible provision to enable these people to work and dignify their existence will be implemented .</P>
      <P>I cannot understand, given the huge consensus among employer and employee representatives and indeed the positive attitude of the public, why there is intransigence on the part of the Government in dealing with this fundamental human right.</P>

        <b>:</b> The opposition by the Government to this amendment demonstrates <Col N="816" /> a continuation of the mean spirit with which it has approached the question of the rights of people seeking refuge in this State. The denial of the right to work, a basic human right, to asylum seekers is mean and offensive. If one put oneself in the shoes of any asylum seeker going through the application process and forced to languish on the dole, depend on hand outs from the State and endure taunts from certain elements that they are spongers, one can imagine that their human rights and dignity are grievously offended.</P>
      <P>The Government is sitting firmly in the trenches and refusing to budge despite the huge support for the few thousand people involved to have the right to work. Can anyone imagine how those people &ndash; many of whom have qualifications although that is irrelevant because all humans have talents &ndash; must have felt recently when FÁS announced that it intended to trawl through EU countries, seeking people it could lure back home to fill jobs which cannot be filled at present? This is happening while people with many talents who could fill some of the job vacancies are sitting in enforced idleness. One can imagine the offence to people's dignity.</P>
      <P>It is particularly offensive for the Government to take this stance in view of the history of our emigrants. They left Ireland but they were immigrants, looking for work, in every country to which they went. Hundreds of thousands were provided with employment and befriended by people in a position to give them jobs. They were given work and a start on their new lives. Yet this Government wanted to introduce legislation to provide for ten year jail sentences for people who gave jobs to individuals who were not in the country legally. This is incredible and flies in the face of the history of our people.</P>
      <P>In the 1980s colleagues of the Minister crossed the Atlantic and went on bended knees to the United States Administration, asking it to legalise the status of the thousands of young people who were working there illegally. That happened, but this is how a few thousand people who have been cast at our mercy are treated. In view of the humanitarian arguments and the human rights and dignities involved, perhaps the Government will change its mind at the last minute.</P>

      <P>I support amendment No. 8. It is most regrettable that the Government has once again set its face against the just demand of asylum seekers for the right to work. Hundreds of asylum seekers are ready and able to work, but they are denied this right and many of them protested outside the gates of Leinster House in recent weeks. This reasonable amendment would ease the financial and social burden of asylum seekers. It would allow many, including highly qualified and diligent people who can contribute to the economy, to come off social welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I deplore the manner in which the Government has dealt with the issue of asylum and particularly the right to work. It is running scared of the wider issue of immigration which, as other Deputies <Col N="817" /> pointed out, is not properly legislated for at present. This legislation, which should be called the deportation Bill, is the latest manifestation of the uncaring attitude to asylum seekers, refugees and immigrants. This attitude is in the ascendancy on the Government benches. If the Bill concerned the import and export of cattle, it would have received more consideration from the Government and would have received more time for it to be properly and thoroughly debated in the House.</P>

      <P>I will come to a conclusion quickly to accommodate your concerns. I am opposed to the disgraceful manner in which the Bill is being rushed through the Dáil before the summer recess. This point is worthy of note because the obvious purpose is to allow deportations to proceed. Will they start tomorrow and continue throughout the summer recess? If so, it would be most convenient that the Minister and his colleagues would not have to face the ire and awkward questions of Deputies.</P>
      <P>There is only one appeal I can make in support of the amendment. I wanted to interject on several other occasions during the debate but I was cognisant of the fact that the House is heavily restricted in relation to time. I did not contribute to that situation and I strongly resent it. I urge the Minister of State to accept this important amendment which would help ease the misery of many asylum seekers and at least give them back their dignity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>The only sad reflection on the necessity to table the amendment is that genuine asylum seekers must wait many months and years for a decision to be made on their applications. I hope the House will send a clear message to the Department in that. My main wish is for asylum applications to be processed as rapidly as possible. This would filter out of the system illegal immigrants who have no right to be in Ireland in the first place and benefit genuine applicants. It would be in everybody's interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The argument which is always put forward in press releases from various organisations is that <Col N="818" /> this change is necessary in light of the current skills shortages. However, it would not be fair to fill a vacuum for the country's benefit by grabbing a group of people and giving them work permits in the short-term. I am also concerned that if individuals were offered work permits, they would be given false hope. They might feel that they had climbed another rung on the ladder and were in a position to set up home properly because they had jobs and incomes. This would appear practical but it is in everybody's interest to have a revolving door in asylum applications. They should be addressed and adjudicated upon rapidly. I favour due process and appeal procedures, but the current long delays are unacceptable. I would prefer the matter to be addressed from that angle.</P>
    <P>It is important to acknowledge that a large number of non-nationals are contributing to the economy and participating in the workforce. We benefit from the participation of these non-nationals, but they do it through the appropriate channels and obtain appropriate work visas. Such mechanisms are in place.</P>
    <P>I have a particular interest in people with disabilities and it was brought to my attention that 80 per cent of people with disabilities are unable to find employment. I do not hear people shouting on their behalf or saying they should be given an opportunity to work.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately I cannot support the amendment because it would give an asylum <Col N="819" /> seeker false hope if, after going through due process, his or her application was unsuccessful. It would create a lot of difficulties and would be unfair. It is also unfair that asylum seekers must rely on benefit from community welfare officers or the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs for a considerable period. Asylum applicants come here because they need the protection of the State, not necessarily to make themselves available for work.</P>

      <P>I spoke earlier about the Department's approach. We need to deal with people coming to the State with a degree of humanity and common sense in the manner we would like our people to be treated when they seek work outside the EU.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>We have an obligation to ensure that people coming to this State as refugees, which is a small number compared to those going to other EU countries and exceedingly small compared to the number who emigrated from this State, are treated with decency and common sense. That common sense requires that people who have come here seeking safety and asking to be allowed to stay should be allowed, within a reasonable period of coming here, to work while awaiting a decision to be made. People seeking refugee status and refugees seeking asylum in the State have waited for up to four years. Deputy Callely does not want them on social welfare, nor does he want them to work, he wants them to starve pending the Department's decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>We should do as the amendment proposes. Anyone seeking asylum who has been here for more than three months should be allowed to work in the State. To suggest that allowing them to work gives them a &ldquo;false hope&rdquo; is an extraordinarily asinine argument. Allowing them to work allows them the dignity of earning a living while awaiting a decision about their future, no more and no less than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know how many refugees Deputy Callely has spoken to but I have talked to quite a number. We are fortunate in this country to have hundreds of well qualified refugees who could <Col N="820" /> make a substantial contribution to our economy and who, rather than living off the State, want to be allowed to work here. The vast majority of them do not want to live off handouts, they want the dignity and self-respect of being allowed to work and earn a living. This antediluvian, recalcitrant, conservative Department is denying them that right because of a policy which has been part of the State's approach to refugees since its foundation. This runs counter to a policy which the Tánaiste wants to implement. The Minister and Minister of State are sticking rigidly to their policy, but it is wrong. It is being exacerbated, in humanitarian terms, by what Deputy Callely rightly complained of, namely, the scandalous delays in processing applications, for which there is no defence.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister reconsiders the Government's approach to this amendment. I regret that the Bill is being rushed through. The Minister of State has presumably received her instructions from the Minister, who is doing other important work elsewhere, and she probably does not have the discretion to consider what is said by Members or to take amendments on board. If she accepted amendments which her senior colleague had not sanctioned she might be in serious political difficulties. We are merely going through the form of a debate on these issues. We are not really discussing them or engaging in dialogue but in serial monologues with no possibility that what the Opposition proposes will be accepted. I am used to this form of debate in the House and it has made me equally as cynical as the vast majority of the public. However, we are getting this issue tragically and disgracefully wrong. This has been aired in public debate for over three years and the people have a view on it, as do the major unions and employer organisations. Even if there was no consensus on this we would have a political obligation to do the right thing, which is to allow people seeking asylum to work.</P>
    <P>Given the new economic climate in which we operate, it is time this country had a green card system to allow a number of people per year from outside the EU to come here to obtain jobs. It is time we gave others the same measures which we have begged the United States to provide to our emigrants to that country. We are now in a different world but sadly the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has not yet entered it and has not come to terms with the realities of Ireland in the second half of the 1990s.</P>
    <P>This amendment should be taken on board and should not be guillotined, and the Minister of State should have the discretion to accept it. That this is to be voted down by the Government casts a spotlight on the political impotence of the Progressive Democrats in making a serious impact on human rights policy issues. Last Saturday saw a one day conference on human rights, organised by the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs. It considered human rights issues across the globe, but we will have no credibility in such matters until we recognise that to be allowed to work is a human right in this State for people who have sought sanctuary here and are seeking the right to stay here permanently. <Col N="821" /> Allowing them to work would give them some of the dignity they are seeking.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not go over the debate already gone over during the other Stages of the Bill, and which was articulated again today. I make one final plea, however, for some explanation why this measure is not being allowed. It makes sense. It has been said repeatedly by all of us, and it is the experience of many of us, that the Irish people left this country to seek work. We may not have been refugees but certainly after the famine people left here to seek a life free from disease and death. We have a history of emigrating, both legally and illegally, to other countries and, in more recent years, our young people had to emigrate and remain illegally in other countries because we could not employ them here.</P>
      <P>Now that we have a vibrant economy it is important that we do not deny people the right we were denied to emigrate to another country. People who emigrated from this country were afraid to go to a doctor or a hospital because they were in the country illegally. I am not talking about the 1930s or the 1940s but the 1980s and many of those people now have an opportunity to come home. We have an opportunity to recognise that morally, politically and economically.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Shatter said, we can ensure that people with skills and qualifications who seek sanctuary in this country feel valued. These people have been damaged and we all know that the greatest boost we can give to their self-esteem is to allow them work for remuneration and contribute to the society in which they live. Not being allowed to work is an enormous disadvantage. We have now reached the ludicrous stage where we cannot even recruit people with translation skills, which many of the people seeking refuge need.</P>
      <P>We have been an insular nation on the edge of the Atlantic for too long. We have sought our own fortunes, legally and illegally, over the centuries. This is the first time in our history, economically, that we can open our doors to desperate people with whom we can share a need and a value system. I ask, even at this late stage, that this Bill be allowed to go through the House before the summer recess. Guillotining the Bill is unacceptable and the Minister of State should at least accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>The right of asylum seekers to work is under consideration by the Government, and its decision will be announced in due course in the normal way. This was indicated recently in an Adjournment debate in response to a matter raised by Deputy Howlin and again on Committee Stage. It is a matter of public knowledge that the question of whether asylum seekers should be granted permission to work is being considered by the Government. All of the factors which need to be taken into account are being considered in assessing whether the existing position, which is that asylum seekers are not allowed to work, should be changed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that a spectrum of views <Col N="822" /> exists in any Government on issues of this nature. At the end of the day, the Government will conclude deliberations on this important policy issue and will observe collective Cabinet responsibility for the matter when it is decided upon.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter referred to the small number of asylum seekers here but I advise him that we are the third highest in the European Union in <i>per capita </i>terms.</P>
    <P>In relation to Deputy Callelly's point, the Minister's declared aim is to ensure that every non-national who is genuinely in need of the protection of the State is recognised as such as soon as possible after arrival here so that they can take up the rights to which they are entitled. The Government has put in place more than 140 staff to deal with asylum applications. The majority of that staff has been in place since May 1998 and, on the basis of current numbers, the backlog will be eliminated by July of next year. In 1998, 168 people were granted refugee status and by 31 May 1999, 184 people had been granted status which is an improvement in terms of the numbers being dealt with. The aim is that by July of next year, 95 per cent of new case will be fully decided upon within six months of application. That might put in context the debate we are having here today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to remind Deputy Shatter in particular that those who have applied for asylum in the State are seeking to remain here on the basis that they are in need of the protection of the State, and not on the basis that they are available to work. The only relevant criteria, accordingly, are those set out in section 2 of the Refugee Act. It does not matter whether the applicant is a brain surgeon or a road sweeper. What matters is whether the person has a well-founded fear of persecution.</P>
      <P>On the green card system of immigration to fill available jobs, the Minister is on record as saying he favours examination of this system to facilitate immigration of some kind. Already there have been changes in this regard but that is a separate issue to the question of asylum seekers being allowed to work.</P>

      <Quest>the reason the export of live cattle has slowed down; the efforts he has made to keep open the existing live trade with Spain; if the Libyan, Egyptian or any other markets for live cattle will re-open in autumn 1999; and his views on the low prices farmers are taking for store cattle.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the live trade so far this year, total exports have amounted to 182,528, a threefold increase compared to the same period in 1998. Indeed, when compared with 1997 when only 22,000 cattle were exported in the first six months of that year, the scale of the increase is enormous.</P>
      <P>The trade to the EU continent has underpinned weanling market prices over the past year while exports to the Lebanon, which have amounted to some 36,800 head so far this year, have impacted positively at the finishing end of the market. It is quite clear therefore that there is a massive increase in the level of the live trade this year. The trade continues to remain strong and the most recent returns for the week ending 21 June show that a total of 7,192 cattle were exported, at a time of the year when the trade usually eases.</P>
      <P>Looking at the individual markets in turn, the Spanish Ministry for Health recently introduced a unilateral decree applying specific conditions to imported beef and live animals from a number of countries which have had native cases of BSE, including Ireland. So far as live animals are concerned, the decree lays down specified risk material rules beyond those which are currently required in the other member states, apart from the United Kingdom, and are not in line with Ireland's SRM rules.</P>
      <P>Since the introduction of the decree, I have taken action on a number of fronts to resolve the matter. I raised the issue directly with the Spanish Minister for Agriculture on two occasions and I have formally written to him and to the Spanish Health Minister outlining the potential difficulties and suggesting alternative approaches. Contact is being maintained on a continuing basis with the Spanish authorities to bring about a resolution of this matter in a way which would not adversely affect Irish trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Agreement was reached with a Libyan Government delegation last July providing for the re-opening of the Libyan market for Irish cattle and beef on the basis of agreed veterinary health conditions and terms of contracts. This agreement <Col N="825" /><Col N="826" /> was the culmination of extensive contacts with the Libyan authorities since early 1997. The Libyan Government, through the general peoples committees, formally cleared the agreement before the end of September and written confirmation to this effect was received.</P>
    <P>Although the Libyan authorities indicated their wishes to have the agreement implemented immediately, there had been delays in the conclusion of contracts for Irish cattle. These delays are of serious concern to myself and the Government. Ongoing contact is being maintained with the Libyan authorities through every appropriate channel with a view to ensuring that the July agreement is implemented in practice.</P>

      </P>
      <P>
        <i>
        </i>The Libyan authorities have indicated the current economic conditions in that country have resulted in the postponement of the implementation of the agreement but pointed out that they had never failed in the past to honour any agreement reached with another state. I am hopeful, therefore, that the agreement will be honoured and will take every appropriate step to ensure this outcome.</P>
      <P>The only other traditional third country market for live cattle is Egypt and while it is my objective that all markets should be open to Irish cattle, it should be noted that the nature of that market has changed for Ireland. Egypt has now become the largest market for Irish beef, importing 120,000 tonnes of beef in 1998, the equivalent of 350,000 head of cattle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The price of store cattle, particularly of finished cattle, is generally a function of market forces &ndash; supply and demand. Poorer grass growth in spring, in conjunction with the fodder scarcity carried over from last year and the lower prices for finished cattle, has impacted on the demand for store animals. Since the beginning of the year, store cattle prices have improved considerably. <Col N="827" /> Although still down on this time last year, the trend has been in the right direction and there is some movement towards paying better differentials for quality cattle.</P>

      <P>Farmers are extraordinarily annoyed at what has been happening in Spain for the past three weeks. Some people have a sneaking suspicion that, because of the success of the live trade, vested interests here think we are exporting too many cattle. I hope the Minister will allay that suspicion. The export of live cattle is our only hope in a year when there is no other market for cattle.</P>
      <P>Is the Spanish policy with regard to veterinary restrictions different from that of other countries? Are the Spanish authorities allowed to impose such restrictions? What does free trade mean if a country can unilaterally impose an unreasonable restriction on the importation of Irish cattle? </P>
      <P>Does the Minister intend to go to Spain? If this question is not solved, huge problems will arise in a couple of weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I totally support the live trade, as the figures for the past two and a half years show. There has been an eightfold increase in the trade since I returned to office. I have facilitated the trade in every possible way. When I came into office there was no ferry for cattle transportation and the Government allocated £500,000 to put the <i>M.V. Purbeck</i> on the high seas. Since then I have approved 16 vessels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a difficulty in Spain. I met the Spanish Minister on two occasions regarding this matter. Officials and veterinary personnel from the Department of Agriculture and Food, through our embassy in Madrid, are in constant contact with the Spanish authorities. The very difficult situation in Belgium brought down the Government and created chaos for their agriculture and food industry. At about the same time and although not related the Ministry of Health in Spain introduced the new regulation. The Spanish Minister for Agriculture has told me that there is an internal Spanish difficulty between the Ministries of Health and Agriculture. His advice is that the matter would be more easily solved by adopting a diplomatic approach rather than by adding to the controversy. I would go to Spain if I thought such a visit would be helpful. We have a considerable market for calves and weanlings in Spain. It is terribly important to us and I want to ensure it is maintained. In addition, I have been informed that there is a slaughter house strike in Spain and that major pressure is being placed on the Spanish Ministry of Health to find a resolution. Given the sensitivity of food safety throughout Europe and the world, it is an extremely delicate matter. However, I wish to assure the House and the industry that every appropriate step is being taken and every possible avenue is being pursued <Col N="828" /> to ensure the matter is resolved satisfactorily and in the interests of the continuation of the trade.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Spanish Ministry for Health recently introduced a unilateral decree applying specific conditions to imported beef and live animals from a number of countries who have had native cases of BSE. In so far as live animals are concerned, the decree lays down specified risk material &ndash; SRM &ndash; rules beyond those which are currently required in the other member states, apart from the United Kingdom, and are not in line with Ireland's SRM rules.</P>
      <P>Since the introduction of the decree I have taken action on a number of fronts to resolve the matter. I raised the issue directly with the Spanish Minister for Agriculture on two occasions and have formally written both to him and the Spanish health minister outlining the potential alternative approaches.</P>
      <P>I am continuing to give this matter my full attention and contact is being maintained on a continuing basis with the Spanish authorities to bring about a resolution in a way which would not adversely affect what is a very important trade for Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that commonality and a level playing pitch is only an aspiration in European terms. We seem to be the most compliant in terms of EU regulations. Despite exhortations from this side of the House we rarely if ever implement unilateral action to protect our trade at any level. We implement EU regulations fulsomely without equivocation. We should take note of what is happening in Spain in relation to our industries.</P>
      <P>What impact does the restriction by the Spanish authorities on the slaughter of imported cattle have on us? Does it go beyond the regulations imposed on other EU member states? Last year 75,000 young cattle were exported by Ireland: how will that trade be affected? Did the Minister contact the EU Commission to seek the removal of these restrictions because of the manner in which they have been imposed? Is the action by the Spanish Government unworkable in any way? We know the restriction is health based, but surely our product is clearly defined and there is no connection with Belgium in terms of our weanling trade. Will the Minister seek an assurance at EU Commission level that the level playing pitch will be preserved as an integral and fundamental part of EU free trade?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe the Spanish approach is excessive and goes beyond what the Irish authorities feel is required. Nonetheless in my dis<Col N="829" /> cussions with the Spanish authorities it was pointed out that Spain has the right to introduce these measures in the interests of public and animal health. The trade is important, Ireland having exported 18,000 calves and 66,000 weanlings to Spain in 1998. Up to mid-May 1999 Ireland exported 30,000 calves and 41,000 weanlings to Spain. The trade is continuing and further contact is taking place. Later this afternoon another meeting will take place in the embassy in Madrid.</P>
      <P>We have received some support from France as it is in a similar situation. I wish to put on record my assurance that everything which can be done is being done in order to resolve this matter satisfactorily from our trade point of view.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Davern)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no requirements of the nature outlined by the Deputy for area aid participants. However, farmers are required to provide evidence of their entitlement to use all commonage lands claimed for area aid purposes.</P>
      <P>There are, however, controls on the use of commonages under the REP scheme. A new supplementary measure &ndash; supplementary measure A &ndash; has been introduced under the REP scheme to address, among other things, the problem of overgrazing of commonages. Under this measure farmers are given enhanced compensation to follow an agri-environmental plan which may include a reduction in the stocking levels on some commonages.</P>
      <P>In the discussions leading up to the approval of supplementary measure A the European Commission insisted that commonage shareholders could not use other shareholders' commonage rights. This precluded the use of leased commonage as eligible land under the scheme. However, as a concession to existing participants in the scheme who receive REP scheme payments in respect of leased commonage, these farmers may continue with their current agreement subject to amending their REPS plans to comply with the stocking provisions of supplementary measure A.</P>
      <P>In recognition of the fact that the REP scheme might not be appropriate to cover all cases where farmers require compensation following an agri-environmental plan, another scheme of compensation from national funds is being drafted by my colleague the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I put it to the Minister that bureaucracy has gone mad and that the EU, the Government and the various Departments have placed so many restrictions on farmers who use mountains for sheep grazing that all we are doing is ensuring there will be less people living in disadvantaged areas than ever before. If somebody put a restriction on the use of gardens owned by people outside farming who know nothing about SACs or mountain grazing there would be uproar. However, a restriction is being put on the land worked for generations by farmers. This is being done unnecessarily and without adequate compensation or consultation.</P>
      <P>What is happening is nothing short of a disaster. What is the Government approach to this matter? I think the Government is hiding behind the EU directive. Shareholders' rights cannot be used for all eternity because the land cannot be rented to someone else. Does the Minister accept the measure, which concerns the most disadvantaged areas, is draconian and that it is time for somebody to act?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>Concerning the analogy used, there is a restriction on private gardens. For example, it is no longer possible in Dublin to keep a horse in one's back garden under the Control of Horses Act.</P>
      <P>In 1998 many commonages were over claimed, in other words the same people claimed for the same commonage without definition of rights. As a consequence in 1999 we had no option but to apply this control measure to all area aid applicants claiming commonage in order that commonage could be processed efficiently. The onus rested with the applicant to ensure that documentation submitted as proof was adequate to support a claim. I appreciate what the Deputy said. There are areas where there are problems and where there is no proof of right to graze. An area could have been grazed for 200 years but documentation may not exist because the landlord or other person did not grant it. Any evidence, such as a copy of a Land Registry map, a land vesting order, a certificate of relevant estate papers, a grant from the free legal hold owner, grazing, trust or grant deed, or a deed by the original estate landlord or any such acceptable documentary evidence may do in terms of establishing rights. Where ownership or other entitlement cannot be established for a precise land area in a commonage in respect of grazing rights, sworn affidavits from shareholders will be accepted where they all agree to their respective shares. The problem arises because many people cannot get agreement regarding shares. We recognise that there is overgrazing while over claiming caused terrible problems in terms of administration.</P>

Paradoxically, the greatest challenge facing the Oireachtas in the midst of economic success is the preservation of rural Ireland. This process <Col N="832" /> is under the Minister of State's chairmanship and he received 170 submissions. It is two years since publication of the report of the Rural Development Policy Group, which was the first stage of the consultation process. What is wrong?

Does he see that as a fairly important ingredient of the White Paper? Should that be included, particularly since it is being sought by other areas? Is the Minister committed to regional economic development to ensure that the lopsided development, which sees increased growth, congestion and gridlock in some parts, will not be at the expense of continued depopulation and decline in other areas? The Minister of States knows well to what I refer. Will the desired policy of the White Paper be to address rural development in a broad multi-functional capacity?

      <P>Devices used for the synchronisation of oestrus in bovines are animal remedies that contain hormones and that may be marketed in Ireland and elsewhere in the EU under a specific exception to the EU hormone ban. The relevant EU legislation, however, attaches strict conditions to the availability of these animal remedies. As a result, they are designated as prescription only medicines by the Irish Medicines Board which is the licensing authority for Ireland.</P>
      <P>The Animal Remedies Regulations, 1996, which govern, <i>inter alia</i>, how medicines are prescribed, have been in operation for nearly three years. My Department has been engaged in reviewing the operation of the legislation generally, including in relation to this type of animal remedy. In doing so, account is being taken of the various views expressed on the practical impact of the legislation and of the need to ensure that efforts aimed at improving the quality of the national herd are not unduly hampered.</P>
      <P>There has been wide-ranging consultation and it is hoped that the review will be completed shortly. I should, however, emphasise that it is not intended to fundamentally alter the thrust of the legislation. Any adjustments must be consistent with the relevant EU legislation and with the maintenance of the highest possible standards of public and animal health protection.</P>

What is the Government doing about that? In the early 1990s 40 per cent of the national kill would have qualified for the European market. Therefore, this is a major decline. If the percentage falls below 17 per cent there will be no beef sector. What is the Government doing about this?</P>

We are trying to be as sympathetic as possible to the needs of the farmers who have suckler herds and the AI centres. I will have two meetings with those organisations to see how we can work around it. I appreciate what the Deputy said because we will improve the animal breeding area in the suckler herds if we can get it sorted out.

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The expansion of export markets for Irish food products is primarily the responsibility of the food industry itself, working in conjunction with my Department and An Bord Bia. I see the removal of obstacles to the development of export markets as my function.</P>
      <P>The Bord Bia Plan for the period 1999-2006 envisages Irish beef exports to EU markets increasing from 215,000 tonnes in 1998 to 282,000 tonnes by 2006. Implicit in this plan is the recovery of lost trade to the UK and French multiples and the expansion of existing trade to countries like Holland, Italy, Sweden, Belgium, Spain and Germany.</P>
      <P>Progress has been achieved in the UK multiple sector and a strong campaign, highlighting the benefits of Irish beef, is being planned by An Bord Bia for later this year to take advantage of the lower beef supplies forecast at that time. Intensive presentations are continuing with the French retail sector but progress there is likely to be slower due to an oversupplied market and strong promotion of domestic French beef. Good progress is taking place in Holland, Italy and Sweden where Irish beef commands a strong position in both retail and food service sectors.</P>
      <P>One of the key recommendations in the report of the beef task force is the implementation of An Bord Bia's strategy for export market development and promotion, supported by adequate funding, particularly by way of contribution from producers and processors. I expect this recommendation to be implemented over the coming months. There is a three month time scale for the implementation of the task force recommendations.</P>
      <P>As far as the pig meat sector is concerned, it is my objective that the industry should continue to develop by ongoing improvement in standards, further development of its product portfolio and consolidation and increase of its share of the domestic and export market. The support of An Bord Bia through market promotion and through the operation of its quality assurance scheme will contribute to this endeavour. The recently published report of the Food Industry Development Group also outlines the priorities for future investment in the sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the sheep meat sector, the main focus will continue to be on the EU market, which is our main lamb export outlet, and particularly, France, which accounts for almost three quarters of our export sales. Market research in relation to the sale of light lamb will focus on southern European countries including Spain, Portugal and Italy. An Bord Bia will continue to undertake research into the market opportunities in Germany and the Nordic countries, where <Col N="836" /> there would appear to be real possibilities for increasing our sales.</P>
    <P>The Department of Agriculture and Food and An Bord Bia will continue to work with the meat industry to identify and exploit opportunities on EU and international markets and I believe that considerable progress can be made in achieving the targets set out in the An Bord Bia plan over the next few years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I put it to the Minister that the best possible opportunity we have lies in regaining our market share in Europe. Does the Minister agree that the country of origin labelling system, as adopted by some of the continental countries, is working against Ireland to an extreme degree? If so, what has he done at the Council of Ministers to level the playing pitch? I put it to the Minister that some European governments are using the country of origin label to sell their own domestic products as against imported products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The real difficulties in this regard were created by the 1996 BSE crisis. We are attempting to recover from those difficulties but it is not an easy task and the labelling system is not helping us. We must help ourselves. Deputy Ring hit the nail on the head when he said that perhaps only 20 per cent of our beef is suited to higher retail return from the European market. We need more outlets and better prices for better quality cattle. Price differentials are being introduced; the better the quality of the meat, the better the price we will get for it.</P>
      <P>The recent report of the task force pointed to the need for improvement in production methods, AI services and the quality of the national herd. My colleagues and I have visited the UK, France and Germany in an attempt to boost the beef industry. If we can develop the right products for the right markets, we will make inroads into the current difficulties. We need a supply of better quality cattle to be marketed in European outlets which offer a higher return.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the beef produced from less than one in five Irish cattle is capable of penetrating the lucrative EU market, has the Minister given any consideration to a proposal I made in this House on a number of occasions, namely, that one of the best ways of ensuring the production of well bred, high quality beef progeny lies in an examination of the construction of the current premia system? The system should be changed in order that suckler cow farmers and beef producers would be paid premia to breed from top quality beef breed bulls which would be significantly greater that those for Holstein or Holstein-crossbred beef progeny? Is that not the way forward? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Following the very successful outcome of the recent negotiations on CAP reform, we are now negotiating detailed rules for the <Col N="837" /> reform. Senior departmental officials are participating in special committees in Europe for that purpose. We also have a national envelope and will be able to make some discretionary payments. I will be meeting with the social partners between now and the end of the year to ensure that the best use is made of those payments. Many people are of the opinion that if payments are made on a headage basis, people will receive the same amounts irrespective of quality.</P>
      <P>The recommendations emanating from the task force on payment on quality, payment on grading and transparency on the part of factories in order that farmers can have confidence in them is the way forward. That is why I imposed a three month time limit on the implementation of the recommendations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The present position is that Eurotags, Mullinahone Co-op, was appointed as the sole supplier of approved cattle ear tags in respect of 1999 on foot of an open tendering competition conducted under national and EU procurement rules. In accordance with the terms and conditions specified in the tendering documentation issued by my Department, the contract with Eurotags covers the period 1 January 1999 to 31 December 1999 with the possibility of an extension for a maximum of two further years.</P>
      <P>The supply arrangements for cattle ear tags to apply in respect of the post 1 January 2000 period is currently under review. The matter was recently discussed with the main farming organisations, the views of which will be taken into account in deciding the approach to be taken. On the issue of the open tendering process under EU rules, people are welcome to examine the entire documentation relating to the process under the Freedom of Information Act. All departmental tender processes are operated in a fair, equitable, open and transparent manner.</P>

      <P>The new tags must appear on both ears and I have heard more complaints than ever from farmers in regard to tags falling off. Surely, we can do better than that in view of the technology which is available. Will the Minister look into the matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's point is a valid one. As a result of the number of complaints received in the Department, a survey was carried out on the matter. The survey revealed that 3.7 per cent of cattle had lost one of the large tags, 5.2 per cent had lost one of the button tags and 0.7 per <Col N="838" /> cent had lost both tags. People experience difficulties in regard to premia payments and getting animals into factories if tags are lost. We are constantly seeking to improve the tagging system, particularly in regard to the application of tags which should be properly secured. The loss rate for the brass ear tags was in the region of 4 per cent and resulted in that percentage of animals having to be reidentified which caused a great deal of trouble to farmers. We are working on the matter and, hopefully, there will be a breakthrough in the technology.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not doubt that the company in question was awarded the contract on fair grounds. Would it be possible to have two or three agencies throughout the country rather than having one agent dealing with the entire system? I have met farmers who have had to wait for many weeks to get tags. Would it be possible to divide the country into regions &ndash; along the lines of the European election constituencies &ndash; in order that farmers would not have to wait so long?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter is being reviewed. I believe Mullinahone is doing a good job. Nine tenders were received in the first period. In 1998 under national and EU procurement rules eight firms submitted tenders. The Mullinahone tender was the most competitive. From the Department's perspective, there are advantages in a single supplier arrangement which is easier to control from an administrative point of view. There have been control problems in the past. There have also been problems in other member states. There was a time when one only had to open the boot of a car in certain locations to obtain as many tags as one wanted. We do not want to return to that position. The Mullinahone firm is doing an excellent job in this regard. The matter is being reviewed with the social partners.</P>

      <Quest>if the measures introduced to prevent the spread of bovine tuberculosis and brucellosis are proving effective; if the time has come for an in-depth review of the causes of the disease and the methods of prevention; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>While considerable progress has been made in reducing the incidence of TB and brucellosis, it has not been possible to eradicate either disease from the national herd. Less than 0.5 per cent of animals are deemed TB reactors and 0.2 per cent of herds are affected by brucellosis each year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards TB, the disease level tends to be cyclical. The 1997 level was the lowest recorded for many years. The rate of disclosure of TB reactors was higher in 1998 than in recent years. This higher incidence has continued this year. Similar <Col N="839" /> levels of increase occurred in Northern Ireland and parts of Britain. A detailed review of the causes for the increased level of the disease here is being undertaken. Review discussions have taken place with the farming bodies and veterinary groups in the scientific sub-group of the animal health forum. Proposals for additional measures which emanate from the scientific subgroup will be considered by the full animal health forum which will be convened shortly.</P>
    <P>As regards research, a number of projects, including the specialised work of the TB investigation unit, are continuing with the aim of providing new technologies required to eradicate TB. The research is focused in particular on the role of wildlife and the possible development of a vaccine for use in wildlife as well as establishing the best possible information on the causes of the disease spread. Research projects are also under way in the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>Regarding brucellosis, following a period when the incidence of the disease was relatively stable, the situation deteriorated in 1996. In view of this, it became necessary to introduce additional measures to control the disease. While it is still too early to evaluate the success of these measures, the report of a mission by the EU Food and Veterinary Office, FVO, experts which was recently published endorses the current programme arrangements which should significantly reduce the prevalence of the disease over a period of two calving cycles.</P>
    <P>The scientific sub-group of the animal health forum has concluded in principle that substantive changes in the existing brucellosis programme should not be made. The Department recently added a number of initiatives to this programme designed to complement existing measures and to close off any loopholes that may exist. Among the measures and pilot projects introduced are the screening of culled cows at meat factories to identify possible unreported abortions in clear herds and the use of a whey elisa test to confirm the presence of brucellosis in cases of positive milk ring test results.</P>
    <P>The operation of the schemes is overseen by the animal health forum which was established in 1996 as part of the new arrangements agreed for the administration of the disease eradication schemes. The central focus of the forum is to discuss and make recommendations on the operation of the eradication schemes and to review progress in regard to the existing arrangements.</P>
    <P>The arrangements being applied for TB and brucellosis for 1999 will be kept under examination in consultation with the animal health forum. In this regard the arrangements for TB and brucellosis from 1996 are due to be comprehensively reviewed this year.</P>

      <P>My Department provides support to the organic farm sector in a number of different ways. Financial support is provided under the rural environment protection scheme &ndash; REPS &ndash; and the scheme of grant aid under the Operational Programme for Agriculture, Rural Development and Forestry &ndash; OPARDF &ndash; 1994-99. Under the REP scheme, farmers who convert to and subsequently engage in organic farming are eligible to receive additional payments on top of the basic REPS payment of 151 per hectare per annum. The rates of additional payment vary depending on the size of holding and the stage of organic status reached. The annual additional rates for applicants with more than three hectares of utilisable agricultural area are 181 per hectare for a maximum of 40 hectares for a two year period while converting to full organic status and 91 per hectare for a maximum of 40 hectares for a further three years when they reach that status. For applicants farming up to three hectares with at least one hectare under fruit or vegetables, the rates are 242 per hectare up to a maximum of three hectares for farmers in conversion and 121 per hectare up to a maximum of three hectares for those at full organic status.</P>
      <P>The scheme of grant aid for the development of the organic farming sector under the Operational Programme for Agriculture, Rural Development and Forestry provides financial assistance to farmers, groups, companies or co-operatives for the provision of facilities for the grading, packing, storage and distribution of organic produce. Grant aid is at the rate of 50 per cent subject to a maximum investment of £70,000.</P>

The number of producers on the register is in excess of 800.</P>
    <P>The measures which I have outlined have encouraged more farmers to convert to organic farming practices and assisted the marketing of organic produce. I expect demand for organically produced food will continue to grow in the future and I am confident that, with the supports available, Irish producers will be well placed to meet the increasing demand.</P>

After official assurances were given by my Department in relation to the non-import of Belgian feed and on the basis of results of laboratory analysis on pork, provided by my Department, the US authorities have lifted the restriction on Irish products.

      <P>At the time this question was sub<Col N="845" /> mitted Ireland's £5 million pigmeat export trade was disrupted as a result of the US ban imposed after the Belgian food scare. I compliment An Bord Bia which has worked hard in recent days to inform customers in the USA and other markets that Irish pork is in no way associated with the Belgian food scare. Does the Minister of State know the cost to the Irish economy of this temporary ban on pigmeat or if the ban had any impact on farmers and beef exporters? Are there plans for the Department on its own account or in partnership with An Bord Bia to expand the promotion of quality assured Irish food abroad? In that way, if there is a food scare in other EU countries, Ireland will not suffer. That is the kernel of the problem that has arisen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy asked if I could quantify the loss to Irish pig producers and to the economy. It is not possible to do so now, however, because pigmeat prices are rising and a scarcity has arisen from the depression of last year. As regards quality, the Deputy can be assured that Bord Bia's work in guaranteeing products is second to none. People are confident of Irish products which are well known abroad for their safety and quality. We have a substantial market in the United States. In 1996 we exported approximately 1,700 tonnes at a value of £4.5 million, and last year we exported approximately 3,000 tonnes, worth close to £6.5 million. The food market represents a growth area and our products are very acceptable in North America where they are regarded as being even better than the indigenous ones.</P>

      <P>It is a difficult question to answer. With the over-supply of bacon and pork around the world, and the fact that America has been to the forefront in increasing production, the United States was probably looking to its own markets where imports were causing difficulties. There has been a major expansion of pig numbers internationally and we are suffering from the depression in the market which that has caused. There has been a temporary lift, however, and I hope it will be more than temporary.</P>

      <P>In so far as my Department is concerned, a range of measures were adopted to protect consumers on foot of decisions taken at EU level in the context of the recent contamination of Belgian agricultural products with dioxins. In particular, the general authorisations arrangements for imports were replaced by a requirement to obtain specific import licences in advance, regulations were adopted to ban the import from Belgium of specific agricultural products, specified agricultural products imported from Belgium were traced and detained, and animals imported from Belgium in the relevant period were traced and detained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The products involved include fresh poultry meat, pork and beef and products thereof, eggs and egg products, milk based products, rendered fats, processed animal proteins and raw material from cattle, and pigs or poultry for inclusion in <Col N="847" /> animal feedstuffs unless they were accompanied by agreed certification.</P>
    <P>The ban applied to animals or products therefrom which were reared in Belgium since 15 January 1999. It has been established that they were no imports of eggs, rendered fats, processed animal protein or compound feedstuffs from Belgium in the relevant period. The remaining products still on the market, and animals, have been detained to be destroyed or returned to Belgium if certification requirements agreed at EU level on 11 June 1999 cannot be met.</P>
    <P>Regulations adopted by the Minister for Health and Children banned the sale of suspect produce while the Department of Health and Children issued various alerts through the food alert system to retailers and health boards on withdrawal and detention of potentially contaminated products from retail outlets.</P>
    <P>In addition, my Department has carried out analysis of pork fat for PCB residues and has arranged for dioxin tests on samples of a range of products.</P>

      <P>The issues raised by the Irish Wildlife Trust and Badgerwatch with the standing committee of the Berne convention are being dealt with by the national parks and wildlife service of the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands.</P>
      <P>The policies on the bovine tuberculosis eradication programme are finalised following consultation with the national animal health forum. Two meetings of the scientific sub-group of this forum were held recently. Among the items discussed were the current research projects into the role of the badger in the spread of bovine tuberculosis. The results of the east Offaly project indicate that this role is significant. The research is being continued in four other areas of the country with a view to quantifying more precisely the contribution of the badger in this respect, and thereby to develop policies which would help in the eventual eradication of tuberculosis in both species. This work is being complemented by research into the development of a vaccine for possible use in wildlife. Research work along similar lines is also being undertaken in the UK.</P>
      <P>The declaration in 1965 that Ireland was free of TB signified the attainment of a reduced level of disease which was important from a trading perspective. The wildlife reservoir has been a major contributor to our inability to progress beyond this limit. Badgers and bovines share the same environment and feed on the same pastures. Various pathways exist for the transmission of disease between these species and modern DNA strain typing techniques have clearly shown that both species share the same disease in localised areas. The extent to which the various pathways of infection are contributing to inter-species transmission is currently the subject of research, but at this point the involvement of such pathways is beyond doubt.</P>

In the past there were 12 or 13 movements but that has been reduced to six or seven movements.

This research has shown that up to 20 per cent of the badger population is infected with bovine tuberculosis. This causes major havoc in both the badger and cattle populations. The objective of the Department is to find solutions that will provide protection for both species. In particular, significant efforts are being made in the area of vaccine research. I hope that will be perfected shortly. The TB investigation unit at University College Dublin, which has experts in mycology, microbiology, pathology and zoology, has recently issued a major badger vaccine development project. This project is taking place at Little Island, County Waterford. Its prime objective is to evaluate the immune response of badgers vaccinated with BCG and to compare the responses over one year.</P>

      <P>The beef task force which I established last November has now concluded its deliberations and submitted its report to me. This report sets out a plan of action for the beef industry covering the complete range of activity from production through to marketing. To deliver this action plan the task force has agreed a series of recommendations to be implemented within a three month timefame. Implementation of the recommendations of the task force is now the responsibility of the relevant parties operating in the sector, including the Department of Agriculture and Food and the State agencies. The Department will work with these bodies with a view to implementing the individual recommendations within the three month timeframe.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>Will sanction be taken against those who do not comply with the implementation of the task force report? Has a commitment been given by the task force that technologies, which are moving fast in regard to food processing, particularly beef, will be used by the Irish industry? I understand our food processing industry is way behind that in some of the countries with which we are competing, as some of us saw in the past six months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>There was consensus on the outcome of this report. The group which looked into the beef industry was broadly based. That industry has been examined extensively over the past 20 years. If reports would sort out the problem, there are plenty of them. That is the reason I <Col N="851" /> insisted on a three month timeframe for implementation of the various recommendations, which are both sensible and radical. Modern technology, including mechanisms for grading of cattle, is important. Paying a flat price has proved to be negative for the industry. I expect better quality breeding, given that the Irish Cattle Breeders Federation will be supported under this scheme, and better quality production and processing. I expect also better quality marketing through the marketing fund which will be contributed to by producers and processors as well as receiving additional support from the Exchequer.</P>

      <P>The Minister wants the report implemented within three months, but farmers are seeking something that will guarantee a market in the autumn. The previous question which was transferred for written answer deals with fodder. The real problem regarding fodder is how the cattle can be marketed. In this report little attention is devoted to that crucial issue. Is the Minister satisfied that markets can be found to ensure cattle will be moved before the autumn?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. The position is that we have to export 90 per cent of our produce. An export outlet has to be found for nine out of ten steers. An outlet is available, but the Department of Agriculture and Food, An Bord Bia and the industry want to find the most remunerative outlet. With high quality production, we can get into the high return markets. Given the marketing fund and that a substantial part of the report has recommendations on marketing, the industry has signed up to a pound per head, both at production and processing level, to be supported by the Exchequer for intensive marketing. That marketing has already commenced. The Minister of State and I &ndash; and indeed my colleague, the Minister for Defence &ndash; visited the Lebanon about 18 months ago. That market is now taking 38,000 head of cattle, which is on a par with our exports to Libya in the past. It has developed into a very worthwhile market so all members of the Government, the State agencies and the industry realise we have to continue to get the best return in the interest of supporting farmers in this particularly difficult environment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who is at the talks in Stormont, I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the dispatch, pursuant to section 2 of the Defence (Amendment) (No. 2) Act, 1960, as applied by the Defence (Amendment) Act, 1993, of a contingent of the Permanent Defence Force for service with the international security presence in Kosovo, known as KFOR, established under the authority of the UN Security Council Resolution 1244, and that it further approves the terms of the exchanges of letters with the Secretary-General of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation on Ireland's financial responsibility arising from participation in KFOR, a copy of which was laid before Dáil Éireann on 29th June, 1999.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>At the outset, I am sure the House will join me in fully supporting the efforts of the Taoiseach, the British Prime Minister and other Ministers involved in their work at Stormont today to bring the negotiations to a successful conclusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this motion, which is required under section 2 of the Defence Act, 1960, as applied by the Defence Act, 1993, is to enable the dispatch of an Irish contingent for service with the UN-authorised international security presence in Kosovo, which was established under the authority of UN Security Council Resolution 1244 of 10 June 1999. The motion also provides for approval of the terms of an exchange of let<Col N="853" /> ters with the Secretary General of NATO clarifying Ireland's financial position arising from participation in KFOR. Copies of the proposed exchange have been laid before the House. This exchange clarifies that Ireland, like all other non-NATO troop contributing nations to KFOR, will be responsible for its own costs. A similar procedure was followed in relation to Ireland's participation in SFOR, in Bosnia and Herzegovina.</P>
    <P>In commending the motion to the House, I wish to underline a number of key points at the outset. First, KFOR's presence is central to the international community's co-ordinated efforts to restore security and normalisation in Kosovo, to protect the civilian population in Kosovo, whether Serb or Albanian, and to facilitate the safe return of refugees to their homes. Second, KFOR was established under the authority of the UN Security Council, through Security Council Resolution 1244. Third, Irish participation in KFOR is in keeping with our foreign policy traditions and objectives. It is particularly in keeping with our long and respected tradition of peacekeeping that Ireland should participate in this UN authorised force.</P>
    <P>I wish to set out the background to KFOR. The UN Security Council, acting under Chapter VII of the UN Charter, adopted Resolution 1244 on 10 June 1999, which among other things, authorised the establishment and deployment of an international security presence in Kosovo, known as KFOR, with all necessary means to fulfil its responsibilities. The Security Council envisages that KFOR, with substantial North Atlantic Treaty Organisation participation, must be deployed under a unified command and control with the aim of establishing a safe environment for all people in Kosovo and facilitating the safe return to their homes of all displaced persons and refugees. KFOR is thus structured around a substantial NATO core and is commanded by a NATO General, Lt. General Jackson of the British Army, on a basis broadly similar to the Stabilisation Force &ndash; SFOR &ndash; in Bosnia and Herzegovina in which Ireland already participates. KFOR's deployment is accepted by the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The UN Security Council Resolution established KFOR for an initial period of 12 months from June 1999, to continue thereafter unless the Security Council decides otherwise.</P>
    <P>KFOR will work closely with the international civil presence in Kosovo whose establishment was authorised by the same Security Council resolution. The international civil presence will draw on the assistance of relevant international organisations to provide an interim administration for Kosovo. Many international organisations and institutions, including the UN, the European Union, the OSCE, NATO, the World Bank, and the Council of Europe will have parts to play in the stabilisation of Kosovo and indeed the whole south-eastern Europe region. This process will entail democratisation, full respect for human rights, economic reconstruction and effective security. The Security Council has specifically <Col N="854" /> welcomed the work in hand in the EU and other international organisations in this connection.</P>
    <P>KFOR is in the process of being fully deployed in Kosovo. Present strength is approximately 30,000 of the currently envisaged total of 55,000. Agreement has been reached with Russia on deployment of Russian troops with KFOR and on the sharing of Pristina Airport. Russia will supply a Deputy to the Force Commander with responsibility for Russian affairs and Russian deployment of between 3,500 and 4,000 troops is well under way.</P>
    <P>On the basis of a separate agreement drawn up with the Belgrade authorities, KFOR has overseen the withdrawal within the deadline of all Belgrade's security forces from the province of Kosovo. A further agreement has been reached between KFOR and the Kosovo Liberation Army, KLA, on the latter's demilitarisation and partial disarmament within a 90 day period. This agreement foresees a political role for the KLA.</P>
    <P>The responsibilities of KFOR under Security Council Resolution 1244 include deterring renewed hostilities, maintaining and where necessary enforcing a ceasefire, and ensuring the withdrawal and preventing the return into Kosovo of Serbian and FRY forces, except for very limited and agreed purposes; demilitarising the Kosovo Liberation Army, KLA, and other armed Kosovo Albanian groups; establishing a secure environment in which refugees and displaced persons can return home in safety, the international civil presence operate, a transitional administration can be established and humanitarian aid can be delivered; ensuring public safety and order until the international civil presence can take responsibility for this task; supervising de-mining until the international civil presence can take over responsibility for this task; supporting and co-ordinating closely with the work of the international civil presence, whose establishment was also authorised by Resolution 1244; and conducting border monitoring duties; ensuring protection and freedom of movement for itself and for the international civil presence and other international organisations. Countries which are contributing, or which plan to contribute, to KFOR include all our EU partners, allied and non-allied, as well as a broad range of NATO and non-NATO nations.</P>
    <P>The Kosovo crisis is a major challenge for all European democracies, including Ireland, and is a key foreign and security policy issue for the European Union. It is likely to be a central element of the EU's agenda for the foreseeable future. Irish participation in KFOR would be in line with Ireland's commitment to play an active role in the new approach to UN-mandated peacekeeping and in promoting peace and stability in Europe. Participation would also be in line with the Government's underlying and constant approach to the Kosovo crisis, namely, that it should be resolved in accordance with the principles set out by the international community and with the <Col N="855" /> active engagement of the UN Security Council, and that the refugees must have the right of full and safe return.</P>
    <P>The situation in Kosovo remains complex. Thousands of Kosovo Albanian refugees in FYROM &ndash; Macedonia &ndash; and Albania have been returning to Kosovo spontaneously. The UN agencies are now co-ordinating the return of refugees, assisted by the stabilising presence of KFOR. On the other hand, many Kosovo Serbs are leaving. Estimates are that up to 120,000 out of 200,000 Kosovo Serbs may have fled in the wake of the withdrawal of Serbian forces from Kosovo. Evidence of appalling war crimes against Kosovar Albanians has been unearthed. There are also well documented reports of Albanian revenge attacks on Serb and Roma Gypsy houses and villages. While these persist, it is unlikely that many of those Serbs who have already left will return and more may leave. It is regarded as important by the international community that Kosovo should remain multi-ethnic. The full and speedy deployment of KFOR is crucial to engendering a sense of security for the entire civilian population.</P>
    <P>On 21 June agreement was reached between the KFOR force commander, General Jackson, and Hashim Thaci, the head of the KLA &ldquo;Provisional Government&rdquo; of Kosovo on the &ldquo;demilitarisation /disarming&rdquo; of the KLA in compliance with UN Security Council Resolution 1244. The KLA is to renounce all provocation and reprisals against Serbs in Kosovo and hand over its heavy weapons at central collection points. The agreement contains clauses which will allow the KLA to propose its members for an anticipated police and civil administration. It is recognised that securing effective KLA compliance with the resolution is important if Kosovo's Serbs are to return.</P>
    <P>Following discussions between the Department of Foreign Affairs and my Department, and in anticipation of the adoption of Resolution 1244, NATO was informed on 9 June of Ireland's general interest in participation in KFOR, subject to approval by the Government and the Dáil. The NATO secretariat had identified a KFOR requirement for a transport element, in line with what Ireland could contemplate providing to the force. A formal invitation to participate in KFOR will be received in the next few days.</P>
    <P>It is envisaged that the proposed Irish contingent will comprise a transport company of between 80 and 100 personnel, equipped with 32 vehicles. The proposed contingent is based on experience gained from the contribution of a similar unit to the multinational operation in Somalia in the early 1990s. Current indications from the KFOR planning staff are that the transport company will form part of a larger group of battalion strength &ndash; 400 personnel &ndash; which will in turn form part of a KFOR support service element, possibly with Norway as lead nation. The company will be based in Pristina, and respond to the headquarters of KFOR. The Pris<Col N="856" /> tina area, as well as being the location for the headquarters of KFOR, is part of the British brigade area.</P>
    <P>The transport company, given its role as a support element for the force as a whole, is expected to be mobile throughout the KFOR area of operations. It is envisaged that a small number of staff appointments within the headquarters of KFOR will, if requested, be filled by officers of the Defence Forces. A military fact finding mission to the Supreme Headquarters of Allied Powers in Europe &ndash; SHAPE &ndash; Mons, Belgium, took place yesterday to seek clarification on a number of matters in order to expedite deployment. It will be necessary to send a reconnaissance party to the mission area prior to deployment and before a final decision is made on the composition of the transport company.</P>
    <P>The initial indications are that it will perform the following range of duties &ndash; carry out humanitarian resupply tasks initially to villages and towns, deliver equipment and material to facilitate the completion of essential infrastructure improvements to alleviate human suffering, as part of an international transport battalion and carry out general resupply and transport tasks for the KFOR mission.</P>
    <P>It is estimated by Irish military authorities that deployment to the area of operations could commence a minimum of six weeks after Dáil approval. The Irish commitment to KFOR will initially be until June 2000. Rotation will be at six monthly intervals. The Government will review the question of continued participation in light of developments on the ground as well as other factors, such as security requirements at home and other overseas commitments.</P>
    <P>KFOR operates under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter. It is entitled to use force to implement its mandate and to protect itself and the international civil presence, established in accordance with Resolution 1244. The protective element of the chapter mandate has become the norm in UN authorised operations in recent years, such as those in Somalia and eastern Slavonia and the SFOR operation in Bosnia.</P>
    <P>Troop contributing countries are increasingly unwilling to commit troops to operations unless there is a Chapter VII authorisation to enable the peacekeeping force to take all necessary measures to protect itself. Implementation of the provisions of UN Security Council Resolution 1244 by KFOR is a challenging and complex undertaking. However, normalisation of the security situation is a priority for the currently deployed elements of KFOR.</P>
    <P>Based on information from SHAPE, the current situation in Kosovo is assessed as fragile but stable with sporadic incidents of low level violence threatening that stability. Full and rapid deployment of KFOR will be a stabilising and confidence building act. The conclusion of the Irish military authorities is that the mission area remains volatile, but the current overall security situation is considered satisfactory. A serious <Col N="857" /> threat lies in the numbers of landmines and unexploded ordnance that remain throughout Kosovo. Our experience in SFOR also testifies to the threat posed by mines in conflict zones of the former Yugoslavia. Dealing with this problem will be a major task for KFOR.</P>
    <P>The Irish contingent will be fully trained in mine awareness techniques and measures. Ongoing risk assessments will take account of developments as the situation in the region stabilises. The safety of Defence Forces personnel serving on overseas missions is always a matter of serious concern and I assure the House that this aspect was fully taken into account by the Government in making its decision. In this connection, I refer to the UN Convention on the Safety and Security of UN and Associated Personnel which was adopted by the Sixth Committee of the UN on 9 December 1994. Ireland intends to accede to the convention, which came into force on 15 January 1999.</P>
    <P>As the Irish contingent to KFOR will exceed 12 in number and will be armed, Dáil approval of the dispatch of the contingent is required under the terms of the Defence Acts. As with SFOR, all contributors to KFOR are responsible for all their own costs and this is set out in the terms of the financial exchange of letters with NATO. The terms of the financial exchange must be approved by Dáil Éireann under Article 29 of the Constitution, and this motion incorporates these terms. I estimate that the additional costs to the Defence Vote arising out of Defence Forces participation in KFOR until June 2000 as proposed on the basis of commencement on, for example, 1 September, will total £2.8 million.</P>
    <P>For Ireland, as a non-NATO member contributing a contingent to KFOR, the KFOR command and control arrangements are analogous to those which currently apply to our participation in SFOR in Bosnia-Herzegovina. KFOR is an important expression, not only of the international community's commitment to peace in Kosovo, but also of the mutually reinforcing and co-operative approach to ensuring international peace and security, which Ireland advocates. Participation in KFOR would be a further concrete example of our commitment to inclusive co-operative security in Europe in general and to helping the people of Kosovo in their search for peace and normal political life.</P>
    <P>Ireland has a long standing reputation in UN peacekeeping which is a legitimate source of pride for all of us. I attach great importance to our involvement in the mainstream of peacekeeping and our participation in KFOR is important in this regard. The Government's approach to the Kosovo crisis has been clear, consistent and unwavering. The prompt and proactive decision by the Government, in proposing that the Dáil approve participation in the UN authorised KFOR, is further evidence of its readiness to play a full part in addressing the humanitarian, political and security challenges posed by the crisis in Kosovo and neighbouring areas in a way which is <Col N="858" /> consistent with our own traditions, capabilities and objectives. I commend the motion to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the motion. The international peacekeeping force faces an onerous task in Kosovo and this will be a long and arduous mission for the Defence Forces. Given its high risk nature it is essential that our troops receive all the back up and resources they need to carry out the mission effectively and, above all, safely. I ask the Minister to ensure that the UN Convention on the Safety and Security of UN and Associated Personnel is adhered to by Ireland and the legislation governing it is introduced in the House as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The need highlighted by the Kosovo crisis puts into sharp relief the tasks demanded of our Defence Forces. The recent Department of Defence memorandum encouraging cutbacks in the Defence Forces must be seen against our current unpreparedness in some ways to send other than a transport group to Kosovo. Fine Gael has no difficulty supporting the Minister in his decision to commit Irish troops to KFOR. All of us are rightly proud of the splendid record which the men and women of our Defence Forces have earned over the past 40 years. They have been the unheralded heroes of the international community. However, the cost of their heroism has been high, with 80 young lives lost in the cause of peace. Just one month ago the most recent casualty, Private Billy Kedian, was laid to rest in his native Ballyhaunis.</P>
      <P>The question, of course, immediately arises as to whether we are prepared for the Kosovo mission. Are sufficient numbers, resources, training, and equipment available to our troops to ensure that they can participate in the mission in safety? I am glad the Minister addressed these issues in detail. It will be a dangerous mission and the range of tasks and the scale of the job to be undertaken will be daunting and demanding for all the forces involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My difficulty with the motion is not the Minister's willingness to commit our troops to KFOR but the limited scale of the commitment. In effect, the Minister is saying that faced with one of the most appalling humanitarian disasters to befall Europe in the past 50 years, a disaster which has driven 850,000 Kosovars from their country and displaced a further 600,000 within that province, often in the most primitive conditions, the best response we as a nation can make is to offer the services of a single transport company, numbering 100 men and women. This is despite the fact that there was a warning period. There is a need to make more personnel with specific military skills rather than a duplication of civilian <Col N="859" /> capabilities available for this mission. In addition, there is a need for people in credible numbers on the ground as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>There is no need to remind the House of the extraordinary scale of societal breakdown that characterises Kosovo today. Speaking at Polje yesterday, Mrs. Mary Robinson drew our attention to the ongoing violence against ethnic minorities which remains a sad feature of everyday life in Kosovo. The most elementary institutions of civil society are lacking. Hygiene, sanitation, basic health care, even burial facilities, are unavailable over vast areas of the unfortunate province.</P>
    <P>Extensive mining, unexploded ordnance and polluted water supplies render much of the countryside uninhabitable in the short-term. Even at this early stage, mine casualties are averaging five per day. Public transport is non-existent and private transport is accessible only at prices above the means of the average person. Roads and bridges have been destroyed, schools demolished and hospitals desolated. The destitute are to be counted in their hundreds and thousands.</P>
    <P>Everybody is aware that the people of Kosovo have suffered enough. The UN has committed itself to help but the calls on its resources are many. Mr. de Mello, an able official with extensive experience of humanitarian crises in Cambodia and Bosnia, has temporarily taken charge of the UN's operations in Kosovo. However, even he was staggered at the sheer scale of the task he, and his eventual successor, face. His team of 40 officials has been overwhelmed by the sheer enormity of their assignment.</P>
    <P>He frankly admits that the UN lacks the resources, financially, managerially and logistically, to meet this challenge. UN operations in the Balkans to date have been hindered by weak inter-agency co-operation and the flow of supplies has been sporadic. Many problems face the UN at present and the attempts of KFOR's 28,000 troops to prevent the worst excesses do not always succeed. I am reiterating these problems, which are well known, because I want to highlight the support from Ireland which is needed and which they can reasonably expect to receive.</P>
    <P>Ireland has provided a military police company to aid SFOR, but the task of ensuring even minimal security and public order in Kosovo causes the challenge we faced in Bosnia to almost pale into significance. I hope further personnel can be found and despatched without further delay because the longer we wait, the more intractable the problem is likely to become. The UN and NATO have appealed particularly for assistance from smaller European nations. They highlighted their deficits in policing, engineering and mine clearance operations. KFOR, in particular, has made no secret of its wish to avail of Irish expertise in these areas. I hope these needs can be met in the coming weeks and months. The danger is <Col N="860" /> that the crisis in Kosovo retains the potential to ignite a much larger problem in south eastern Europe. It is not a minor disturbance in a far away place of which little is known. It remains a very real threat to peace and stability in Europe and must be treated as such.</P>
    <P>Time is not on the side of the UN or KFOR. The Balkan winter sets in early and is unrelentingly harsh. A basic protective structure needs to be in place by early October. Much more is required than what Ireland is offering at present, although I welcome the measures put in place. We hope it will be a safe and secure mission in Kosovo.</P>
    <P>Some months ago I drew up, on behalf of Fine Gael, a document in which I reviewed our experience of peacekeeping and made some suggestions as to how we might address our responsibilities. We have responsibilities to the larger international community in this domain. I drew up the document in the context of the new security architecture in Europe and the new security environment in the world. My definition of security in the document is broader and more inclusive than that traditionally adopted. I addressed an environment in which intra-state rather than inter-state conflict would be the rule and in which humanitarian principles would be salient.</P>
    <P>In the document I argued that we in Ireland must end our splendid isolation and play our part in a joint endeavour with our partners in the EU to make our continent a safer and more secure place. To do that, we must consider how the Defence Forces are prepared and equipped to contribute to initiatives, such as that in Kosovo, and to develop our peacekeeping capability in the light of the requirements posed by a fundamentally altered security environment in Europe and elsewhere, which is obvious in the Kosovo crisis. We must update our policies and prepare for this type of crisis. We must develop further capabilities which respond to the totality of a conflict or potential conflict.</P>
    <P>We must recognise that today regional organisations have a key role to play in preventing and containing conflict in their areas. Ireland, because of its extensive United Nations experience is obviously well placed to contribute to initiatives and to the possible development of peacekeeping capabilities in Europe. However, this will not happen on its own; it must be planned. I hope the Minister will review our position on future peacekeeping demands which will be made on us and consider the resources currently available. There is a need to develop the Defence Forces capability in crisis management techniques and to critically review our expenditure on training, equipment and capital development so that the Defence Forces can meet the challenges and fulfil the changing roles they will face in the years ahead. We need to pay greater attention to the humanitarian and human rights dimensions of conflicts and to draw the appropriate lessons in terms of revised training courses.</P>
    <P>I hope Ireland will be able to provide a more <Col N="861" /> elaborate response to the crisis in Kosovo than that contained in the motion. I hope it will be possible to find more specialist personnel to enable Ireland to face up to its international responsibilities in a manner worthy of its traditions and aspirations. If we intend to play our part and show a commitment to securing peace and stability in Europe, we must be prepared to have the resources in place. I welcome the motion and Fine Gael supports it. It is indicative of the Defence Forces's commitment to playing a strong role in international peacekeeping.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" hpid="Mr. Timmins Mr. Timmins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the motion. Although Ireland is an island nation, the people have always had a keen interest in international affairs. This is probably due to the fact that most families have been affected by emigration. In contrast to our stated neutrality, we have strong ties with Great Britain, the USA and, to a lesser extent, some European countries. As a result, many Irish men and women fought in the First and Second World Wars. When the Western world expressed its revulsion at the activities of Milosevic, we were only too happy to join the chorus. To us, the ethnic violence in the former Yugoslavia was horrific. Yet, it is a scene which could have visited our doorstep but for the courage and commitment of some people in Northern Ireland who were prepared to step outside their own support boundary.</P>
      <P>As slaughter and rape took place in Kosovo, the civilised world had to take a stand. This was not pleasant but it was necessary. It was best captured by the heading: &ldquo;We must kill 100 hundred babies today to save 1,000 tomorrow.&rdquo;  Some commentators called for the United Nations to intervene, but realists knew that the UN could not do anything. As the EU has no semblance or sign of a military structure, it was once again left to the USA to play the role of Europe's policeman. Many people objected to this and vehemently condemned some of NATO's actions. While the bombing of a television station was not welcome, as a means to an end, where does it stand in comparison to the atrocities the Serbs inflicted on the Kosovars?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This conflict needed more than gestures and philosophers. It needed tough stands, hard actions and the making of unpopular choices. For that, we must express our thanks to NATO. Without its actions, where would the Kosovars stand today? Thanks to NATO, Dáil approval is being sought to permit Irish troops to serve in Kosovo as part of a United Nations international security force. This is a welcome development. However, although it is a step in the right direction, it is merely a &ldquo;toe in the water&rdquo; exercise. We have contributed more than 500 troops to UNIFIL in Lebanon on a continuous basis for over 21 years. The time has come to move on. We should aim to supply a full battalion to KFOR within the next 18 months. Our only obstacle is the political will. I believe that the Minister wants to take this step and I encourage him to do so. He should <Col N="862" /> condense our APC purchasing programme into a 12 to 18 month period and signal our intent to play a greater role in KFOR. I extend good wishes to the personnel who will participate in the force and wish their families well. I hope their time is safe and fruitful.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this motion and express the Labour Party's support for the decision to send a contingent of Irish troops to serve with KFOR in Kosovo. As was the case when the previous Government approved the participation of Irish troops with SFOR in Bosnia, while the force on the ground will be under the day to day control of NATO, the operation is subject to the mandate given by the Security Council of the United Nations. In this regard I do not believe the motion has implications for Irish foreign policy or for our military neutrality, rather it is in keeping with the active role Irish troops have played in peacekeeping operations throughout the world for almost 40 years.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt Irish troops will face a difficult task in Kosovo, where the situation remains fraught with danger. Armed groups are still active, ethnic hatred is still evident, tens of thousands of refugees are returning to villages and homes destroyed by months of conflict and an unknown number of unexploded bombs and mines still pose a huge danger. The conflict in Kosovo was one of the greatest tragedies Europe has experienced since the end of the Second World War. Details of the full extent of the appalling ethnic cleansing carried out by the Serbian forces is still emerging. We still do not know how many people died during that campaign, but it is clear that many people were killed and brutalised, hundreds of thousands of people were driven out of their homes and enormous damage was done to the infrastructure. It is also clear that at least some of those Kosovar Albanians who were driven out and have now returned are intent on exacting their revenge on those Serbs who remain in Kosovo. Gypsies are coming under threat from both sides.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Undoubtedly the appropriate response of the international community to the crisis in Kosovo raised moral and political questions of the utmost seriousness, to which there were and are no easy answers. The NATO decision to launch a military campaign against Yugoslavia provoked strong views for and against, which were genuinely held and vigorously expressed on both sides. What is beyond dispute is that Yugoslavia in general and Kosovo in particular endured a bombing campaign of an intensity never before experienced in Europe. Enormous damage was caused to the infrastructure and a huge rebuilding, reconstruction and regeneration programme is now required. This will require a great financial com<Col N="863" /> mitment, but before it can commence there must be peace and stability within Kosovo.</P>
    <P>It was always clear that in the aftermath of the withdrawal of Serbian forces, an international peacekeeping force would be required. It would have to be a peacekeeping force that not only had the necessary expertise but would also be capable of winning the confidence of all ethnic groups within Kosovo, acceptable both to Serbs and Kosovar Albanians. In this regard it was essential that the peacekeeping force would be under the UN mandate. An exclusively NATO force might have been acceptable to the Kosovar Albanians but would hardly have won the confidence of the Serbs. The fact that KFOR is under UN mandate opened the way to the participation of Russian troops, which was an important consideration in persuading President Milosevic to accept the deal brokered by the Finnish President. It also opened up the way to participation by troops from other non-NATO countries such as Ireland.</P>
    <P>The role of KFOR will not be limited to ensuring peace, it will also have a major role in providing food and humanitarian aid for the people of Kosovo. While the Irish contribution will be small in numerical terms &ndash; a transport unit of around 100 personnel &ndash; it is important in political and symbolic terms. We should not, however, underestimate the difficulties to be faced by our troops. As I said earlier, the situation is still fraught with danger. A number of KFOR soldiers have already died from unexploded devices. If we send troops into areas of intense danger like this, we must accept the possibility that some of them will die or be injured.</P>
    <P>At the same time, there is an obligation on the Government to ensure that our troops are not unnecessarily exposed to risk and have the equipment and training necessary to guarantee the maximum possible level of safety and security. Training will not be a problem as Irish troops have always been well prepared for operations abroad, and this is acknowledged in the respect in which they are held by other contingents with whom they have served. However, the position regarding equipment is much less satisfactory. The long delay in providing the Army with modern armoured personnel carriers is particularly unfortunate. Troops in an area like this cannot rely on trucks and jeeps alone. The troops going to Kosovo will have to depend to some extent on other contingents for protection, which is neither operationally desirable nor good for morale. If we want our troops to be able to play an active role in peacekeeping operations throughout the world, we will have to provide them with the resources and equipment to enable them to do so. Money is available for this and, in particular, I urge the Government to expedite the delivery of the long promised armoured personnel carriers.</P>
    <P>The recent death of Private William Kedian in the Lebanon while serving with UNIFIL illustrates the dangers our troops serving abroad face on a daily basis. We owe them a debt of gratitude <Col N="864" /> for their willingness to put themselves in danger in the interests of bringing peace to the trouble spots of the world. The least we can do to repay that debt is ensure that they have the best possible equipment.</P>
    <P>I note from the exchange of letters with the Secretary General of NATO, which were laid before the House, that the financial arrangements for KFOR will be quite different from those operations under direct UN control, as with UNIFIL, where part of the cost is reimbursed by the United Nations. It seems from the documents laid before the House that NATO will make no financial contribution whatsoever and the Irish Government will have to bear the entire cost, including wages, transport, equipment, food, lodging, utilities and medical care. According to the documents: &ldquo;NATO shall provide no payments or reimbursement to the Government of Ireland for the provision of forces for KFOR&rdquo;. I do not object to this and believe Ireland should be prepared to pay its fair share of the cost of this operation, but I ask the Minister to let us know the anticipated cost and whether the allowances the troops will receive for serving in KFOR have been agreed with PDFORRA and RACO.</P>
    <P>I hope Ireland will also be generous in the contribution it makes to the reconstruction effort in Kosovo. Given the scale of the damage, unless a major humanitarian programme is rapidly undertaken, many of those returning will face the winter without adequate food or shelter.</P>
    <P>The lesson of the conflict in Kosovo and the other conflicts that have taken such a toll since the disintegration of Yugoslavia is that we ought to look at new security arrangements for Europe to ensure that neither ethnic cleansing nor mass bombing are ever experienced on our continent again. My hope for the Irish contingent to KFOR is a successful and safe operation. My hope for the people of Kosovo and Yugoslavia is an end to all ethnic cleansing and violence, that they will find a way to live together in peace and harmony, putting the terrible events of the past few years behind them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>At Rambouillet, the Serbs agreed to an international peacekeeping force, which we now have. It includes the Russians and that makes a big difference.</P>
      <P>Much destruction was caused and many lives were lost. Was it all worth it? I recall saying on the Vincent Browne radio show on the night of the bombing that this will lead to genocide and that is precisely what has happened. We see the horrific pictures on our television screens every night.</P>
      <P>The question we must ask is could this conflict have been avoided? It could, and the way to have done it would have been through action under the United Nations. That did not happen because the UN's role has been usurped by NATO. That is something about which we, as a democracy, should be concerned.</P>
      <P>There are those who will argue that this would be an ideal opportunity for PfP members to engage in peacekeeping. We are constantly told that PfP is primarily about peacekeeping but one of the great proponents of Partnership for Peace, Lieutenant General McMahon, made an extraordinary statement in an article in <i>The Irish Times </i>on 14 May. He contends that in Bosnia, Irish troops now under NATO command are under a &ldquo;serious and potentially dangerous disadvantage because we are not privy to intelligence only given to PfP members&rdquo;. Is NATO willing to put the lives of Irish soldiers at risk because we have not joined the PfP? If this is true, the Government should withdraw our soldiers immediately.</P>
      <P>Irish soldiers have never been put at such risk under UN command, and if the lieutenant general's logic is followed through, we should surely join NATO for only then will we get detailed information to ensure the safety of our soldiers. That is the reason we need a referendum on Partnership for Peace. We need to dismiss the distorted argument we are getting constantly from the proponents. The fact that we are now going into Kosovo, not as members of PfP but under a UN mandate, shows that all the arguments in favour of PfP are completely baseless.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Green Party believes the UN should be the only partnership for peace of which Ireland is a member. Over 140 UN countries are not members of PfP, and if we truly believe in international and democratic peacekeeping we should strengthen the UN and not allow NATO, <i>via</i> the PfP, to usurp the UN's role. There are those who will argue, perhaps with some legitimacy, that the UN is not the force it ought to be. That strengthens the argument for reform of the UN, something for which the Green Party has argued for some time. The question of the veto is delimiting <Col N="866" /> for the whole UN operation and it needs to be removed.</P>
    <P>Since 1945, more than one UN Secretary General and a number of governments have proposed creating a permanent international force to help prevent war, genocide and major human rights violations. In 1995, the international Commission on Global Governance, co-chaired by the then Swedish Prime Minister, Ingvar Carlsson, once again raised the idea of this UN force. We need a two-tier UN; one tier involved in peacekeeping and the other a standby force that can enforce the peace. That is the way forward.</P>

        <b>: </b>I find it incredible that the Government can come into this House and in the space of 55 minutes ask the Dáil to approve a serious decision to send Irish troops to Kosovo, effectively under the command of NATO, with a fig leaf motion from the United Nations. NATO created an incredible disaster in Kosovo and compounded the barbarity of Milosevic. It was under the cover of NATO's air war that one million people were brutally uprooted which gave Milosevic an excuse to intensify the barbarism. Now NATO expects this country to pick up the pieces. It is incredible that nine of the 11 paragraphs of the letter from NATO to this country concern finance, that NATO will not accept a penny of the cost but that it will all come to the Irish taxpayer. It is an incredibly insulting letter to this country and we have no description in detail of the role of Irish soldiers or the political strategy in relation to Kosovo. I cannot support the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion to enable the Irish Army participate in the peacekeeping mission which will soon begin operations in Kosovo. The international community was shocked and horrified by the tragedy in Kosovo in the past few months. It was hoped that the discussions which took place early in the conflict would result in a resolution being found. As chairman of the Irish parliamentary delegation at the Council of Europe, I want to put on record the work done by the Council of Europe to prevent the conflict that was developing during last year and the beginning of this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It cannot be denied that the main culprit for the tragedy in Kosovo is Slobodan Milosevic. When the negotiation team was prepared to reach a settlement, it was on the direction of Slobodan Milosevic that the talks broke down, which ultimately led to the tragedy continuing. I do not believe we have yet been exposed to the full tragedy of what has taken place in Kosovo. That will only be determined when there has been a full investigation into the various atrocities carried out in the past few months. Nevertheless, the Irish Army will show a high level of courage and commitment, as it did in Lebanon and elsewhere, and I wish the personnel well in this mission and hope they remain safe in what has already been described as a dangerous mission. Tragedies have <Col N="867" /> occurred already in Kosovo involving some peacekeeping personnel.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the various departmental agencies and the public in general for the way they responded to this crisis. Young boys and girls throughout Ireland collected money at church gates and other public places to help the refugee crisis in Kosovo. The voluntary effort made in Ireland is an indication that not only is there a commitment on the part of the Government to ensure we play a full part in peacekeeping and supporting humanitarian missions, but the public is willing to support it financially also. In every village throughout the country, small committees organised events to raise money. The local radio station in Clare collected approximately £50,000 for the relief effort.</P>
    <P>It is important that this mission is successful and that stability is created in Kosovo because unless that is done quickly, the tragedy of Kosovo might be repeated throughout the entire Balkans region. What we have seen is just the tip of the iceberg and the conflict can escalate if this mission is not put in place. The Irish soldiers will play a full role, with their Norwegian colleagues, in putting in place part of an overall system that will see peace restored to this part of Europe which has gone through a horrific time in the past few months.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate to point out also that peace could not have been restored in Kosovo were it not for the efforts made by the German government and the Russian President and his Minister for Foreign Affairs, who personally intervened to bring about a situation in which this peace formula could be put in place. It must be underlined, however, that the main culprit of this tragedy has been Slobodan Milosevic, and he must face international sanction for his part in it. In establishing peace it is imperative that we also ensure that those who are responsible for this horrific tragedy are brought before the courts to face those charges.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland's participation in KFOR is a further element in the wide ranging contribution Ireland is making to addressing and resolving the humanitarian, political and security crises in Kosovo and neighbouring areas. UN Security Council Resolution 1244 marks a welcome re-engagement by the UN with the Kosovo issue and is the result of diplomacy and negotiations which Ireland has constantly seen as essential to finding a solution to the Kosovo problem. The UN resolution is only the beginning of a long and complex process aimed at a just and lasting settlement of the Kosovo issue.</P>
      <P>Ireland and our EU partners will have an important role to play in this process. The stability pact for south-eastern Europe and the EU initiative seeks to harness the contribution which all relevant organisations can make to the long &ndash; term stabilisation process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding our peacekeeping role, Ireland has <Col N="868" /> committed a maximum of 850 military personnel for service with the UN at any one time under the UN standby arrangement system &ndash; UNSAS. With the proposed dispatch of 80 to 100 Defence Forces personnel to KFOR, Ireland will have almost reached the 850 limit specified under the UNSAS agreement. I think we will probably be in the top five for the last 20 years in the number we have deployed with the UN in different parts of the world.</P>
    <P>I previously indicated in the House that Ireland must give whatever assistance it can to the Kosovo population, given the appalling tragedy which has beset their region. My earlier efforts as Minister for Defence were focussed on measures to assist in the humanitarian crisis by contributing the services of experienced Defence Forces personnel and providing facilities for the accommodation of refugees on their arrival in Ireland. I also indicated I would give favourable consideration to any request to send members of the Defence Forces to Kosovo under the UN mandate in the event of a political settlement. I am pleased to see this intention being brought to fruition today and I thank all Deputies who have broadly supported this measure.</P>
    <P>In the light of Dáil approval, the practical aspects of the proposed participation in the mission may be pursued. The safety of Defence Forces personnel serving on overseas missions is always a matter of serious concern. In recommending that Ireland contribute a transport group to KFOR, I am cognisant of the current assessment of risk attaching to the KFOR mission as advised by SHAPE and the Defence Forces and will take full account of the ongoing risk assessment.</P>
    <P>While no absolute guarantees can be given with regard to the safety of the troops serving on missions such as KFOR, it is my policy to ensure the Defence Forces personnel are adequately trained and equipped to carry out their missions. The transport group will be equipped with 32 vehicles, 20 of which will be troop carrying vehicles within the existing complement of Defence Forces vehicles. It is envisage that these DVCs, which were purchased between 1980 and 1989, will be replaced early next year by 12 new demountable rack off-load pick-up system vehicles called DROPs. These are being purchased by my Department as part of an ongoing five year plan to purchase 20 such vehicles.</P>
    <P>The exchange of letters on financial matters is misconstrued by Deputy Higgins. The same procedure was followed for SFOR and recognises countries which are not members of NATO but which are participating in the force. I believe we should go with all the resources available to us to help and we should not expect other countries to pay for what we are doing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I raise the issue of a language unit for Roscommon because Roscommon is the only county in the Western Health Board area which does not have a language unit. There are language units in every county in the Midland Health Board and North-Eastern Health Board regions. County Westmeath has three units, County Meath has three and County Louth has two.</P>
      <P>Approximately 70 children of school age in County Roscommon are known to have a specific language disorder, or dyspraxia. Some pre-school children also have these disorders. Many of these children are in mainstream schools and receive speech and language therapy in community service clinics. Most are seen approximately once a fortnight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of children from the southern half of County Roscommon attend St. Mary's national school in Athlone. These children receive speech therapy through the language unit in the school, which is in the Midland Health Board area. The children have been told that the Midland Health Board will no longer provide this service because the board receives no funding from the Western Health Board. The Western Health Board is not prepared to provide the necessary funding and the children have been told that the service will not resume next September. These children are placed in an impossible position and their parents are now presented with a very big problem. I ask the Minister to ensure that funding is provided in <Col N="870" /> the short-term so that this service can continue in St. Mary's national school in Athlone.</P>
    <P>In the longer term, funding must be provided in the next 12 months to provide a proper language unit in County Roscommon. The geography of County Roscommon makes it imperative that two language units be provided, one for the southern half of the county and one for the northern half. We know of 70 children who require speech and language therapy and there may be others who are being catered for by other services. Children are receiving speech therapy in the language units in County Galway and County Mayo.</P>
    <P>The lack of resources for speech therapy is creating a great problem in County Roscommon. The available therapists are required to travel unacceptable distances to various clinics and children suffer as a result. We need resources for an additional speech therapist. We need two language units and we must guarantee that a service will be provided for the children in St. Mary's national school, Athlone, in September next. Otherwise parents will be obliged to take their children out of school to attend speech and language therapy sessions elsewhere. Parents throughout the county are obliged to do this at present. The provision of a language centre in the county would allow children to receive therapy as part of their mainstream education.</P>
    <P>Language units have been successful in many parts of the country. Roscommon is one of only three or four counties which do not have a language unit. It is unacceptable that children should be taken out of their own schools to receive speech and language therapy. I hope the Minister can clarify the position with regard to St. Mary's national school.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Naughten for giving me the opportunity to outline the position concerning this matter.</P>
      <P>The thrust of the Government's policy regarding people with disabilities is to provide the supports necessary to enable each individual to live in the community with the maximum possible degree of independence. I assure the Deputy that there is no lack of commitment to ensuring that the health services for people with disabilities are developed in a comprehensive manner. Since coming to office, the Government has underscored this commitment by the investment of additional funding totalling almost £38 million for services in the sensory and physical disability sector and £53 million for services in the mental handicap sector.</P>
      <P>Within months of coming to office, the Government provided £10 million by way of once off grants and Supplementary Estimates to the physical and sensory disability sector for the elimination of deficits accumulated by voluntary agencies and for the provision of aids and appliances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1998 a total of £8.4 million was allocated to <Col N="871" /> the maintenance and development of services in the sector. Of this, £2.4 million was devoted to eliminating core underfunding of existing services, £3 million was for capital projects, of which £1 million was for aids and appliances and the remaining £3 million was allocated to health boards for the development of services.</P>
    <P>Of the £3 million for the development of services, almost half was used to create 50 new posts in health boards, such as speech and language therapists, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, social workers and public health nurses.</P>
    <P>This year a total of £13.4 million, rising to £16.4 million in the year 2000, has been allocated to the maintenance and development of services for people with physical and sensory disabilities. Of this, £6.4 million is for the elimination of underfunding of existing services, £3 million, which increases to £6 million full year cost in the year 2000, is for development and £4 million is for capital developments. In addition, £2 million has been committed this year to a major building project by one of the main voluntary sector service providers.</P>
    <P>In the two years since taking office, my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, has provided almost £91 million by way of additional funding for the maintenance and development of health services in these two sectors providing services to people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>This year the Western Health Board received an additional £670,000 to help eliminate the underfunding of existing physical and sensory disability services in its area. A further £300,000 was provided towards the development of these services and £300,000 was provided for capital developments in support of service developments.</P>
    <P>With regard to the matter raised by the Deputy, the development of services in County Roscommon is a matter for the Western Health Board in consultation with its regional co-ordinating committee for physical and sensory disability services. I understand that the Western Health Board is currently examining a proposal for the development of language unit facilities in Roscommon and early indications are that two units would be required, one in the north of the county and one in the south.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, I understand that speech and language therapy services are provided by the Midland Health Board to four children from the Roscommon area at its facilities in Athlone. I am advised that a further two children from Roscommon are seeking these services in Athlone and it is expected that arrangements to provide these services will be agreed between the Midland Health Board and the Western Health Board by the end of July.</P>
    <P>Health boards are experiencing difficulties in recruiting paramedical staff including speech and language therapists. Following a Labour Court recommendation in 1997, an expert group was established to examine and report on various issues relating to paramedical grades. It is antici<Col N="872" /> pated that the report of this group will be completed later this year. Health service employers have given a commitment to establish formal links with colleges and the professions involved. My Department, together with the Health Services Employers Agency, is examining how best to approach the issues to ensure that the views of all concerned are heard.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, the commitment of the Government and the Miniser for Health and Children to developing services for people with disabilities has been demonstrated by the investment of more than £91 million in the past two years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>It never ceases to amaze me how indifferent we are to the preservation of wildlife, in particular of endangered species, and of wildlife habitats. This is why I am raising this matter on the Adjournment. It is necessary to have more evaluation of REPS which is operated under the Department of Agriculture and Food to see how environmentally effective it is. No environmental impact study was done on measure five of the scheme before it was introduced by the Department and no such study has been carried out since in spite of the huge damage being done to natural habitats, wildlife and the landscape in general. It is amazing that we are paying people to destroy our heritage. Hedgerows in particular are as important a part of our heritage as listed buildings. We have so much wildlife that we have a very careless and indifferent attitude to it. Much of what we have is being destroyed through pure indifference. On Question Time I have repeatedly asked the Minister to do something about this before it is too late. I am sure we have lost quite a number of wildlife species which are irreplaceable. We do not have the means of tracing what we have saved and what we have lost. In time to come we will deeply regret the loss.</P>
      <P>Hedgerows are the most obvious habitats. I have been told that quite a number of hedgerows date to the 18th, 17th and even 16th centuries. Under measure five of REPS, for example, people are encouraged to destroy hedgerows. It seems absolutely preposterous, but this is what I have been told. I ask the Minister to do something to stop this from happening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Currently hedgerows are being cut and destroyed. I drive from Waterford to Dublin and back each week and see hedgerows being cut in May and June. Hedgerows are the habitats for birds which are nesting and breeding. They are being cut along the roads and elsewhere. For years I have been campaigning and I thought I was quite successful in getting local authorities to desist from cutting hedgerows during the nesting season. By and large most local authorities are desisting, but in last Friday's newspapers I read that Birdwatch in Limerick reported that hedgerows in County Limerick were being cut, partic<Col N="873" /> ularly on the R512 from Limerick to Kilmallock. This report was dated 25 June.</P>
    <P>I am not an expert on the matter, but from my observation birds such as pigeons nest from February while pheasants and migrant birds such as sand martins nest until the end of July. It is not good enough that these birds are not being protected. I specifically raise this issue so the Minister can do something about it. I see nesting activity still taking place in my garden, therefore, it must be taking place throughout the country. Perhaps the Minister will tell us of her intentions in this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Deasy for raising this matter. In the absence of native woodlands, hedgerows form important features in maintaining wildlife diversity, particularly for birds. The commonest nesting birds found in hedgerows, such as wrens, bunnocks, robins and willow warblers, depend almost entirely on insects during the summer months. In general untrimmed thorned hedgerows containing species such as blackthorn, whitethorn and holly are favoured by birds as they serve as a protection against predators.</P>
      <P>Many of Ireland's important wildlife species are associated with traditional low intensity, mixed farming. This, combined with the retention of semi-natural habitats, provides a wide range of niches and food resources. Modern farming threatens these micro-habitats. I am hopeful that my programme for the designation of natural heritage areas &ndash; NHAs &ndash; together with the rural environment protection scheme &ndash; REPS &ndash; to which the Deputy referred and which is administered by my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture and Food, will go a long way towards protecting these types of habitats. Measures are provided in both of these programmes to maintain existing features which make up farmland habitat &ldquo;mosaics&rdquo;, such as hedgerows, field edges, areas of scrub and unmanaged vegetation, drainage ditches etc., which are so valuable to farmland birds and animals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We need public education and encouragement to shoulder responsibility in these matters. As to the legal position, measures preventing the burning and destruction of vegetation are covered under the Wildlife Act, 1976. The Deputy will be aware that at present, section 40 of the Wildlife Act, 1976, provides protection against the cutting, grubbing and burning of hedgerows on uncultivated land during the nesting season from 15 April to 31 August, subject to certain exceptions. In the forthcoming Wildlife Bill, these restrictions will apply from 1 April rather than 15 April and will remove any doubt that the destruction of vegetation growing in hedges or ditches during this specified period is prohibited. It also stipulates that works, other than on roads or construction works, done under the authority of any Minister or body established by statute, such as a public <Col N="874" /> body or local authority, that lead to the destruction of vegetation may only be carried out during the specified period for reasons of public health and safety. There is a new provision to enable me to request from the relevant Minister or body details of any such works, together with a statement of the public health and safety factors involved. An exemption is provided for the destruction of vegetation in order to stop the spread of fires or for other emergency purposes.</P>
    <P>This year, as in previous years, Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department, has written to all local authorities requesting that works to hedgerows be undertaken outside that crucial nesting period. Provisions are made within these sections for certain exceptions necessary for agriculture, forestry and other developments. In addition, under article 10 of the habitats directive member states are obliged in their land use development policies to encourage the management of features of the landscape which are of major importance for wildlife. An example of this are hedgerows which act as ecological corridors for the movement of wildlife.</P>
    <P>It is widely accepted that the most effective way to conserve wildlife is through habitat protection and management. There are limited resources available and it is necessary to be highly selective when determining priorities and managing resources for wildlife conservation. The main actions being undertaken by me and my colleagues are as follows: research and monitoring of priority habitats and species; proposed designation of natural heritage areas; designation of special protection areas for wild birds under the birds directive; and specific protection measures, for example, the corncrake grant scheme.</P>
    <P>The Department of the Environment and Local Government has underlined in its guidance notes to local authorities on the Roads Act, 1993, and its road grants memorandum the importance of carrying out roadside trimming during the winter season and that the timing of trimming work and the manner of its execution should minimise damage to the ecology of hedgerows.</P>
    <P>In relation to agriculture, the REP scheme, administered by my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture and Food, also promotes the conservation and maintenance of existing features which make up farmland habitats such as hedgerows. Under measure four of REPS farmers must not remove habitats such as field boundaries, margins, woodlands, wetlands, natural and semi-natural vegetation, or damage any of these features on their farms. Under measure five farmers have to carry out specified maintenance or repair work on hedgerows in the interest of wildlife.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, under the national biodiversity plan I am preparing some possible measures to improve the conservation of hedgerows. I intend to afford further consideration to those measures in the context of the finalisation of the plan. In addition, the Deputy will be aware that I published today the Wildlife (Amendment) Bill, <Col N="875" /> 1999, which includes provision to strengthen the protective regime relating to the cutting of hedgerows during the critical bird nesting period. The Bill includes a requirement that hedgerows may only be cut during that period by public bodies, including local authorities, for reasons of public health or safety. I look forward to debating these provisions of the Wildlife (Amendment) Bill, 1999, with the Deputy and other Members when the matter comes before the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The future of community-led local development efforts across the country hangs in the balance due to the continuing Government indecision over funding after the end of this year. I seek a clear commitment from the Government for the continuation of the Local Development Programme from 2000 to 2006, with a focus on social exclusion and a financial bridging mechanism to enable partnership companies to function during the year 2000. Without such an unequivocal assurance from the Government the current situation is untenable, both from the point of view of programme continuity and the retention of experienced professional staff.</P>
      <P>Nationally the Local Development Programme has achieved the following: a total of 13,100 long-term unemployed set up their own businesses with partnership assistance; 13,500 unemployed were placed in employment and a further 10,000, who availed of partnership supports, left the live register through making applications on their own behalf; more than 17,000 children from disadvantaged backgrounds participated in partnership funded preventative education projects; and partnerships initiated more than 1,400 community, environmental and infrastructural projects and assisted more than 13,000 adults on low incomes to participate in education and training programmes.</P>
      <P>In County Kerry, the combined activities of Partnership Trá Lí Limited and South Kerry Development Partnership Limited include: support for the creation of more than 1,000 self-employment jobs, the majority of the people involved would otherwise be unemployed; support for more than 850 people re-entering the workforce through the local employment services; and access to education and training courses for more than 600 disadvantaged individuals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, both partnerships have been engaged in supporting an enormous range of initiatives to develop their localities from the point of view of enterprise, human resources and the environment. Together the two partnerships <Col N="876" /> have brought more than £13 million of European and State funds into the county since 1995. The majority of this has been effectively targeted at disadvantaged sectors of the community and this fact has been recognised in numerous reports, including an independent mid-term review of the partnership groups by A &amp; L Goodbody and the European Social Fund.</P>
    <P>I add to the development of the two partnerships, the achievements of the local partnerships in my home town, Listowel, and in Castleisland. Both these partnership groups have been very effective, especially in helping the marginalised, the socially excluded, the unemployed and people who are disadvantaged generally. These people are worried that their employment will not be continued and that all their hard work and the progress they have made will have been futile.</P>
    <P>As regards County Kerry, the loss of Objective One status, coupled with the apparent apathetic view of the Government towards those disadvantaged sectors of County Kerry which are dependent on the local partnership groups, presents a potentially bleak picture for future local development in the county. Perhaps the Minister can convince me otherwise.</P>
    <P>I, and I am sure Deputy Broughan, want the Minister to make a clear statement of the Government's policy regarding the continuation of the partnership boards. The Minister has acknowledged their great work on several occasions. The Taoiseach has acknowledged publicly their contribution. Why then is there indecision about continuing their funding? What is the problem?</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>One cannot deny that since 1991, a key element in the regeneration of many of the most deprived communities, such as those in Dublin, has been the existence of the 38 partnership companies and the wide range of activities which they have undertaken on behalf of these communities. Some of the current wealth of the Celtic tiger economy is down to the fact that the educational side of those companies helped to provide many of the young high-tech workers who staff the cutting edge of modern industry.</P>
      <P>The partnership concept originated with the general secretary of the ICTU, Mr. Peter Cassells, in the mid-1980s, when I was heavily involved in community enterprise and unemployed groups on the northside. When he sold the idea to the Government in the early 1990s, the development of the first 12 companies certainly provided a headline for economic development of the areas of deprivation. I am proud to have played a role before I entered politics in advancing those developments in the Coolock and Kilbarrack areas in particular.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my area the Northside Partnership, under chairperson Mr. Padraic White and director Ms Marian Vickers, has often been regarded as a model partnership and provided some of the trail blazing ideas which many other partnerships have pursued. The major achievements of the North<Col N="877" /> side Partnership included the famous contact point development with intensive mentoring of the unemployed, the development of job clubs, small enterprise advice and small business support, for which there is a network in Coolock, Baldoyle, Darndale and Donnycarney on the northside, and an educational programme in which we developed third level access and helped students from some of the most deprived areas to qualify as high-tech engineers and for other important jobs for the economy. Recently, under Ms Noreen Byrne, we launched one of the first major child care programmes throughout the partnership companies. Northside Partnership also has its own factories which enable us to give unemployed people essential training for the world of work. The Minister will agree that most of all the Northside Partnership, Ballymun Partnership Ltd., Finglas/Cabra Partnership, and partnerships as far away as those in County Kerry, to which my colleague, Deputy Deenihan, referred, have raised the morale of all of those communities.</P>
    <P>Against that background it seems inconceivable that, within six months of the funding running out, the Minister and his colleagues, particularly the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, have left us in limbo regarding the jobs of the key people who run these sources of mighty economic and educational regeneration for our areas. It seems inconceivable that the Government does not have a clear national development plan for 2000-06 and that it has not already clearly indicated the role and funding of the partnership companies on the basis of the plan. My colleague, Padraic White, recently criticised the Government's failure to do that within six months in <i>The Irish Independent.</i> Many of our talented workers must, as Deputy Deenihan stated, look to their own futures. They need to know what they must do over the next six months in order to keep a roof over their heads. We must clearly inform them of what their role will be and the manner in which the partnership companies will be funded after 1 January 2000.</P>
    <P>The situation is compounded in the Dublin area as the Government reduced the area to the status of Objective One in transition. Therefore, we do not have access to core funding; only the fortunate western and midland counties have full Objective One status. Key urban areas in Ireland are now faced with the fact that the Exchequer and the Minister for Finance must come up with funding. I know the Acting Chairman has as much interest in what happens on the southside of Dublin as I have in the northside in this regard.</P>
    <P>We are one day away from the end of this Dáil session and the Taoiseach, with whom ultimate responsibility lies in this regard, must specifically inform the Kerry and Northside partnerships and others of how he intends to put a funding and support framework in place for the partnership companies until 2006. That will give some kind of security to the workers who have done the nation proud in the past decade and who are essential to <Col N="878" /> the continuance of bedrock development, particularly in areas of great deprivation. The Minister will be aware that levels of between 25 and 40 per cent unemployment still exist in some areas in spite of the Celtic tiger economy. I urge him to take action without delay.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Mr. Flood)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to give a combined response to the matters raised by Deputies Broughan and Deenihan as they essentially deal with the same issue.</P>
      <P>It is widely acknowledged that the ADM supported area based partnerships and community groups have been successful in developing a new and innovative area based approach to the needs of disadvantaged areas, urban and rural.</P>
      <P>The European Council recently agreed a funding package of Community support for the 2000-6 period. While the outcome for Ireland was good, given the extreme difficulty of the negotiations, the level of EU Structural Funds available over that period will be approximately half that available to Ireland under the current Community support framework.</P>
      <P>Work has already commenced on agreeing priorities for EU co-funding under Ireland's next national development plan and on clarifying the Commission's new procedures for the next round of Structural Funds. A separate national consultation process, inclusive of the social partners, must also be undergone. Until such time as this overall process is completed, it is difficult to give any indication of likely levels of EU financial commitments and programme support.</P>
      <P>It is natural that there will be a degree of uncertainty pending the completion of the national development plan and the position to be taken by the European Commission as to its funding commitments to certain elements of this plan. The Government is, however, fully committed to the fundamentally important task of tackling social exclusion in deprived areas and of ensuring that the overall objectives of current programmes remain a priority.</P>
      <P>The report of the task force on the integration of the local government and local development systems clearly also envisages the continuation of area based local development structures within a more sustainable framework. The future will require the consideration and implementation of a number of recommendations in the task force report and those are by now well known to the groups concerned. Issues arising from previous performance, changes in deprivation rankings and the need to ensure that the needs of the real blackspot areas are being addressed also require consideration when planning for the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am fully aware of the concerns of the area partnerships and ADM supported community groups. In May, I held formal meetings with two groups from PLANET &ndash; one representing rural partnerships and one representing the chairs of partnerships &ndash; to discuss their concerns. My Department has also met with representatives of <Col N="879" /> the ADM community groups to discuss post-1999 issues. I recognise the tremendous work being done by the staff of area partnerships and ADM community groups throughout the country. Many of them show a great commitment to helping those who are often forgotten by the more affluent majority.</P>
    <P>I understand the uncertainty that exists but, as I have said on several occasions recently, until such time as the overall package of funding for Ireland is agreed, we are all constrained by that uncertainty. The Government has made it plain that it appreciates the positive contribution of partnership at national level. It also recognises the contribution of partnership at local level. My Department sees the advantages of area based approaches to tackling disadvantage as, indeed, does the EU Commission.</P>
    <P>The funding for local development initiatives will depend on the financial envelopes available <Col N="880" /> post-1999 under the new national development plan. I hope we can achieve clarity on these as soon as possible. In my discussions with the various groups I signalled that the situation should become clearer in July when the Government has had an opportunity to reflect on the various proposals and options.</P>
    <P>Although I cannot pre-empt the national development plan, I can say that the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation has made a comprehensive case for local development funding in the context of the drafting of the plan. The submission recognises the fundamental role of area-based strategies in tackling disadvantage. I can say, however, that, on the basis of discussions to date, I am more than confident that the tackling of social disadvantage at both national and local level will be a major priority under the plan and will have substantial resources devoted to it.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Friday, 2 July 1999.</P>

      <P>Last year's difficult summer weather conditions and the long winter resulted in fodder shortages and the depletion of fodder stocks on many farms. The tight fodder situation was exacerbated by the fact that many farmers were forced to carry excess stock over the winter because of the collapse of the Russian market last year. The relative improvement in the weather this year resulted in the satisfactory completion of the first cut of silage.</P>
      <P>On 31 May 1999 I pointed out that we were entering a critical phase in planning the winters forage supply. I urged farmers to take careful stock of their fodder needs and plan accordingly. While the Government provided a considerable level of assistance last winter to farmers in greatest need there is no substitute for prudent planning at this stage of the year.</P>
      <P>Teagasc has an extensive programme of advice at which the provision of winter fodder is a top priority.</P>

      <P>Arising out of the poor weather conditions and market difficulties which farmers experienced in 1998, I initiated a range of measures to improve their situation. Included in these were: increases in export refunds for beef and pigmeat; introducing aids to private storage <Col N="883" /> for sheep and pigmeat; improving access to intervention for heavier cattle; increasing the rate of advance payment of suckler cow and special beef premia; speeding up payments to farmers; approval of additional shipping capacity for export of livestock; a special fodder package of over £40 million.</P>
      <P>In addition, a farm assist scheme has been put in place for farmers with particular income difficulties.</P>
      <P>While cattle prices are down this year on 1998 levels, steer prices have increased by 10 per cent in recent months and are now within 4 per cent of the levels recorded this time last year. Given the expected decline in beef production in the EU this year, I am confident that cattle prices should remain close to or above 1998 levels for the remainder of the year.</P>
      <P>After a slow start lamb prices this year have been generally satisfactory with lamb sales up 13 per cent on last year's levels. Following unusually high prices for May prices are now at the more usual level of previous years. Pigmeat prices have increased by 9 per cent over 1998 levels and there are signs of a recovery from the difficulties which the sector experienced.</P>
      <P>In addition, direct payments to farmers reached a record level in 1998 with total payments of £1,038 million, which means that the average direct income per farmer was £7,200.</P>
      <P>Therefore, that is strong evidence to suggest that an income recovery is well under way.</P>

These regulations set out the specifications of battery cages and include a recommended code of practice for the care and welfare of laying hens in battery and other intensive systems. The regulations set out requirements for cage area per bird, feed troughs, cage height and floors. They will remain in force until 1 January 2003 when new rules recently agreed by the Council of Ministers will apply throughout the European Union. The new rules will be transposed into national law in due course.</P>

      <P>The remit of this beef task force, which I established last November, was to prepare a strategic plan for the beef industry covering all levels from primary production right through to processing and marketing with a view to putting the beef industry on a firm footing. The report which has now been submitted to me contains a list of recommendations on how these objectives can be achieved.</P>
      <P>The development and promotion of the live export trade was not specifically included in the remit of the task force or its terms of reference. This trade is, however, a very important feature of the Irish cattle industry. Every effort will continue to be made to ensure that Irish producers have access to all export markets and that adequate facilities are available to allow the trade to function properly. So far this year over 175,000 cattle have been exported to EU and third country markets. This represents a threefold increase on 1998 levels and is almost nine times the level exported in 1997.</P>
      <P>The buoyant live export trade to EU markets has underpinned weanling market prices over this past year, while the export of finished cattle to the Lebanon has also had a major impact on this end of the market.</P>

The interdepartmental committee which was established to prepare the White Paper on Rural Development has been engaged in wide ranging consultations with individuals, groups and organisations, including the social partners, with an interest in rural development and in co-ordinating the contributions of the various Departments. This has been a time consuming process. The preparations are now almost complete and it is intended to submit a draft White Paper to Government for approval shortly with a view to publication this month. Publication will be in advance of the National Development Plan, 2000-2006, so that commitments in the White Paper can be reflected in the plan.</P>

      <P>Council regulation (EC) No. 820/97, as expanded by commission regulation (EC) No. 1141/97, requires that all labels, containing anything other than very basic information, used for the marketing of beef must be approved by a competent authority. My Department is the competent authority for the purpose of implementing the regulations. The labelling system is optional until 31 December 1999. A compulsory labelling system, which will apply to the traceability code and origin of beef, is due to be introduced on 1 January 2000.</P>
      <P>While Ireland has embraced the system in full we have, nevertheless, serious reservations about the underlying concept in relation to the labelling of beef as laid down in the regulations. It is our experience that the regulations, with their emphasis on country of origin, have underpinned consumers natural reluctance to purchase beef other than that domestically produced, leading to a move towards market re-nationalisation within the EU. In the context of the Single Market and the accompanying harmonisation of veterinary standards, regulations which rely on country of origin as a basis for assessing the safety of beef are inappropriate. I have made my views clear to the European Commission on this point.</P>
      <P>The Commission is due to report to the council in the autumn with proposals regarding the future of compulsory labelling.</P>

      <Quest>the market outlook for pigmeat; the lessons, if any, learned from the recent crisis which has had a profound effect on profitability, especially for small and medium sized producers; the measures, if any, which will be put into place at EU and national level to prevent a recurrence; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the beginning of this year, pigmeat prices throughout the EU have increased. Irish pigmeat prices increased by almost 9 per cent. The EU Commission has recently indicated that production is likely to be back to 1998 levels by the end of this month, which should further help the market. The market difficulties in the sector were worldwide and were caused by a combination of factors which led essentially to excess supply over demand. These factors included overproduction in certain countries, inside and outside the EU, the weakness in the Far Eastern market and the financial collapse in Russia.</P>
      <P>In response, and from the outset, I took a number of measures. Last year I, together with my colleagues from other member states, succeeded in getting the EU Commission to increase export refunds and to introduce an aids to private storage scheme for pigmeat. The rates of export refunds were increased on a number of occasions in 1998 and also in 1999. These increases ranged from 33 per cent to 80 per cent. The aids to private storage scheme is still running and to date, over 328,000 tonnes have been removed from the EU market and placed in storage.</P>
      <P>At the request of the Council of Agriculture Ministers, the Commission introduced a food aid programme for Russia which included 100,000 tonnes of pigmeat. To date 22,000 tonnes have been sent to Russia, and the Commission is making arrangements with the Russian authorities for the supply of the second tranche of 40,000 tonnes. The removal of this quantity of pigmeat from the EU will, no doubt, help market prices.</P>
      <P>Throughout the period of difficulty for the sector, I have been in regular contact with the producer and processing sides of the industry. I have also had meetings with the banking and feed provision sectors to urge them to be as understanding as possible of producers' special difficulties and to give them maximum support.</P>
      <P>Despite the continuing improvement in the pigmeat market, I will continue to press the EU Commission to maximize the use of export refunds and aids to private storage, and to introduce additional measures, with the aim of further improving prices for Irish producers and providing greater stability to the pig sector generally.</P>

      <P>REP plans set out in detail the existing habitats on each farm when the agri-environmental plan is drawn up. The plan also sets out the course of action to be taken by the REPS participant over the five year period of the plan to maintain and develop such habitats.</P>
      <P>In relation to the effects of the reduction in sheep numbers the position is that one of the main purposes of the new supplementary measure A of the REP scheme is to address the problems of overgrazing in commonages. Under the measure, framework plans have to be drawn up for all commonages and these plans will set out the sustainable stocking levels of sheep on each commonage. Pending the completion of these plans an interim national framework plan has been drawn up. In six western counties where commonages were deemed to be overgrazed, the interim framework plan provides for the destocking of mountain ewes equivalent to 30 per cent of quota.</P>
      <P>As the destocking took place only in December 1998, it is too early to ascertain the regenerative effect on the habitat and the growth in the number of gamebirds.</P>
      <P>It is expected that the evaluation of the REP scheme which is nearing completion will provide some indicators on the benefits of the scheme to the environment. It is proposed to put in place a plan for the ongoing monitoring of the scheme in the period 2000-06 and for periodic evaluations of the scheme during that period.</P>

      <P>The administrative requirements on farmers resulting from the implementation of CAP schemes are normally set out in the implementing rules adopted by the European Commission within the framework of each of the relevant Council regulations. The implementing rules arising from the Council regulations governing Agenda 2000 have not yet been adopted, except in the case of the regulation on support for rural development from the European agricultural guidance and guarantee fund. However, in that case further transitional arrangements for the major rural development schemes have still <Col N="889" /> to be worked out. It is expected that most of the implementing rules, including transitional arrangements, will be finalised by the end of July 1999. My Department's input at EU level into the various implementation arrangements is based on the principle that administrative requirements should be kept to the minimum consistent with proper controls. The national arrangements for implementation can be determined only when the implementing rules are finalised at EU level. It is my intention that the administrative requirements, when decided, will be fully explained to farmers. With that objective in mind, I am arranging for my Department to carry out an information campaign for the benefit of farmers in the autumn.</P>

      <P>The future of agriculture and the food industry is, of course, my key overall concern as Minister for Agriculture and Food, and is, therefore, something that I keep under constant review.</P>
      <P>The Agenda 2000 agreement has set the European policy context for the agriculture sector over the next five and more years. The outcome of the negotiations on Agenda 2000 was successful for this country, and converted a potential loss to farmers of £1,386 million over the period 2000 to 2006 inclusive, under the original Commission proposals, into an estimated gain of £395 million. An important key to the success in these negotiations was a careful and professional evaluation of the impacts upon the Irish agri-food sector of the various proposals made in the negotiations.</P>
      <P>The National Development Plan will set out the agreed structural policy of the Government and the EU in relation to both agriculture and the food industry for 2000 to 2006. This plan will be based upon our evaluation of the structural needs of the sector. Work is well advanced on this plan and my Department is fully involved in its preparation.</P>

      <P>There has been a long-running dispute between the EU and the US arising from the Union's ban on imports of hormone treated beef, which was imposed in 1988. Following protracted proceedings, which included an appeal under the WTO mechanisms, the EU was allowed up to 13 May last to bring the import ban fully into line with WTO rules on risk assessment.</P>
      <P>Arising from its efforts to comply fully with the WTO requirements, the EU released, at the beginning of May, the results available thus far of seventeen scientific studies into the six hormones in question. The US announced a list of retaliatory measures and therefore the dispute has become more difficult and complex. I fully support the European Commission's position that there can be no question of lifting the ban at this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 14 May the US announced that they will seek authority from the WTO to suspend <Col N="892" /> trade concessions to the EU covering trade of about $202 million. The EU has formally requested that a WTO panel arbitrate on this figure.</P>

    <P>Average Irish cattle prices are lower than in all other member states. The reason for this difference relates to our distance from the major markets and the associated transport costs, the suitability of the Irish product for EU markets and a preference for domestically produced beef in those markets.</P>
    <P>One of the main recommendations of the beef task force, which has now submitted its report to me, is to narrow the gap between EU and Irish prices. This will involve the development of a market led industry based on high quality primary production and increased penetration of high value EU retail markets. The Bord Bia marketing strategy is to increase the level of exports to the EU from 195,000 tonnes in 1998 to 280,000 tonnes by 2002. The introduction of proper price differentials for cattle by the processing industry, combined with the adoption of better breeding practices by producers, should help to improve the quality of Irish cattle and, in that way, narrow the gap between Irish and EU cattle prices.</P>

      <P>The new national scheme for the control of farm pollution has been approved by the European Commission and is now in operation. The scheme provides for grant aid at the rate of 40 per cent in the less favoured areas and 35 per cent in the other areas subject to a grant ceiling of £10,000 for the construction of waste storage facilities, silage storage facilities, animal housing  &ndash; bovines and sheep &ndash; and associated farmyard facilities.</P>
      <P>The maximum grant of £10,000 will be reduced by the amount of grant aid taken up since 1994 on pollution control investments under the control of farm pollution scheme, dairy hygiene scheme and the farm improvement programme operated under the operational programme for agriculture, rural development and forestry.</P>
      <P>The scheme is open to farmers with not more than 100 income units. Calculation of the income units takes account of all the enterprises on the farm and of any off &ndash; farm income of the applicant at the rate of £200 gross off-farm income per unit. In addition, at least 25 per cent of the income units must be derived from farming. It is a prerequisite to participation in the scheme that applicants are either participants in the rural environment protection scheme or have a nutrient management plan approved by my Department.</P>
      <P>The scheme, as introduced, will provide farmers with the necessary support to improve pollution control on their farms, engage in more sustainable farming practices and protect the environment.</P>

The farming organisations and Birdwatch Ireland are also represented on <Col N="894" /> that committee. Conditions have already been drawn up for the Burren, for blanket bogs, heaths and upland grasslands and for sand dunes and machair areas. The committee is, at present, very close to finalising farming conditions for wet grasslands and corncrake habitats. When that is completed the committee will examine conditions for other habitats. In addition to the chairman, my Department is also represented on the committee by an agricultural inspector while a higher executive officer of my Department acts as secretary to the committee.</P>

      <P>Since the beginning of the year, my Department has approved four additional dedicated cattle ships. All of these have been approved for transporting cattle to the Continent while two are approved for markets further afield such as the Lebanon.</P>
      <P>This brings the total number of dedicated ships approved for the transport of cattle to 16 and gives a capacity on such vessels of more than 22,000 heads of cattle at 500 kg weight.</P>
      <P>In addition, there is the capacity for up to 30 livestock units to be carried each week on roll-on/roll-off services currently operating out of Rosslare. My Department has recently approved another vessel, the <i>M.V. Venus</i> for a roll-on/roll-off service between Cork and St. Malo. This new service which has a capacity to carry nine to ten livestock units on each voyage and which is expected to operate three times a week is planned to commence shortly and is in addition to the existing two roll-on/roll-off services available from Rosslare to the Continent for livestock exporters. I am satisfied that sufficient capacity exists to meet demand to both continental and third country destinations.</P>
      <P>In 1997, there were nine dedicated vessels for the transport of cattle from Ireland while for part of that year, there was no roll-on/roll-off service available. There has been a further dramatic surge in live exports this year with total exports to mid June 1999 amounting to 175,642, compared with 56,490 in the same period last year. Exports to the Continent thus far this year amount to 136,135, compared with 44,214 in the same period last year.</P>
      <P>My Department will continue to respond without delay to all reasonable requests for inspection of vessels and will be inspecting additional ships within the next two months, which may result in a further increase in available shipping capacity.</P>

      <P>There has never been any known problem with dioxin levels in agricultural products produced in Ireland. In this regard the Environmental Protection Agency undertook a survey into dioxin levels in June 1995 by way of having milk samples from representative regional dairies analysed. This indicated that dioxin levels in milk were uniformly low by international standards.</P>
      <P>In addition, the pesticides control laboratory of my Department has monitored samples of beef and pork for PCB residues since 1982 and such residues have never been detected in any of the samples analysed. Given that there is a significant correlation between the contents of dioxins and PCB in animal foodstuffs and products and as there have not been any imports of contaminated feed from Belgium, there is no reason to believe that Irish food is contaminated with dioxins. However, further PCB testing on pork and other products is continuing and a programme of monitoring for dioxins on an on-going basis is being developed and will be implemented in the period ahead.</P>

      <P>My Department has been actively involved in recent years in simplifying, as far as possible, the application forms used in connection with the various schemes for direct payments to farmers. Helpsheets and checklists to assist in correct completion accompany all application forms. The application forms and information leaflets are reviewed annually prior to issue in consultation with the main farming organisations under the auspices of the Charter of Rights for Farmers review group. The review has concentrated on simplifying the forms and reducing to a minimum the amount of information required to support an application. This approach is consistent with the commitment in my Department's customer service action plan not to ask unnecessary questions. The review and amendment of helpsheets and checklists concentrates on addressing matters that gave rise to errors or confusion in the previous years scheme. Our success in simplifying the process has been recognised by a senior official of the EU Commission who, in a recent presentation to the All Party Oireachtas Committee on the Strategic Management Initiative, confirmed that the forms used in Ireland are among the simplest in the EU. Simplification of forms and targeting information more specifically at customer and client requirements are key elements of our customer service action plan and I am committed to making further improvements in this area.</P>
      <P>Officials of my Department are becoming increasingly involved in participating in information meetings and seminars in conjunction with the farming organisations to improve farmer awareness and understanding of the scheme requirements. This process will be continued and developed further as the detailed rules for implementing the Agenda 2000 package become available.</P>

      <P>On-farm inspections form an integral part of the administration of the schemes of direct payments to farmers. Such checks are to be made in such a way as to ensure effective verification of compliance with the terms under which the payments are granted.</P>
      <P>In so far as the headage and premium schemes are concerned, EU regulations governing the schemes require that on-farm checks must be made in a minimum of 10 per cent of applications. Cases to be so checked are to be selected on the basis of computerised risk analysis. At least 50 per cent of the checks are to be made inside the relevant retention period. The regulation also provides that, in general, on-farm checks shall be unannounced and cover all of the agricultural parcels and animals submitted on an application. However, an advance notification of inspection may be given in certain circumstances provided such advance notice does not exceed 48 hours.</P>
      <P>In view of the fact that bovine animals are individually identified by eartags my Department normally gives a 48 hour advance notification of cattle inspections.  In the case of the sheep inspections, where no individual identification of animals is in place, advance notification is given only in cases involving mountain or commonage land where it would be unrealistic to expect sheep to be gathered for inspection at short notice.</P>
      <P>I should point out that in circumstances where the applicant is unable to be present at an on-farm inspection it is open to him or her to be represented at the inspection by an agent. This situation is most likely to arise in the case of part-time farmers who are engaged in off-farm employment.</P>

    <P>Since the requirements regarding notification of inspections are laid down in EU regulations my Department has no discretion in the approach to be taken. I am satisfied, however, that the current approach is reasonable particularly in view of the fact that my Department allows the <Col N="899" /> maximum 48 hour notification in the case of cattle inspections.</P>
    <P>In relation to the REP scheme, there is no specific provision in EU regulations in relation to the notice to be given of inspections. Depending on circumstances, farmers are given up to three days notice of such inspections. However, the REPS agreement between my Department and each farmer provides that inspections may be carried out without prior notice. Under this provision unannounced inspections are carried out where they are deemed necessary. I consider these arrangements to be working satisfactorily.  </P>

      <P>Last year was a record year of exports in the food and drinks industry, with export earnings exceeding the £5 billion mark for the first time. This is a notable achievement given the adverse trading conditions experienced by some sectors such as beef, sheepmeat and pigmeat.</P>
      <P>Exports of prepared consumer foods increased by 22 per cent in 1998 accounting for IR £894 million in export earnings, while dairy exports (including food ingredients) were valued at IR £1.66 billion. Exports of sheepmeat increased from 51,000 tonnes in 1997 to 58,000 tonnes in 1998, although the value fell slightly due to weaker returns from France, our principal export market. While the pigmeat industry had a difficult year arising from a combination of increased production world-wide and weaker demand in international markets, exports, nevertheless, increased from 115,000 tonnes in 1997 to 130,000 tonnes in 1998. The value of beverage exports increased by 12 per cent to IR £616 million while exports of edible horticulture rose by 8 per cent in value to IR £122 million.</P>
      <P>Last year was also a record year for beef exports which increased by 10 per cent in volume to approximately 510,000 tonnes and by 4 per cent in value to £1 billion. Sales of Irish beef to continental EU markets increased by over 45 per cent, while exports to international markets increased by 5 per cent to 294,000 tonnes.</P>
      <P>The export performance by the beef sector was extremely creditable in view of the renationalisation of the EU market since the 1996 BSE crisis. Exports to France increased by 40 per cent to just over 35,000 tonnes. Beef exports to Italy were 35 per cent higher at 27,000 tonnes while sales to Holland increased by almost 50 per cent to 25,000 tonnes. Scandinavia remained a key market for Irish beef during 1998 with exports increasing by 10 per cent to 23,000 tonnes. As a result of the preference for domestic product in the UK for most of the year, which saw some of the leading retailers stock only British beef, Irish exports to the UK fell by 18 per cent to 85,000 tonnes. The decline in our beef exports to the United Kingdom is disappointing and a reversal of that decline is one of the main objectives of the An Bord Bia promotional strategy for 1999. A strong campaign, highlighting the benefits of Irish beef, is being planned by An Bord Bia for later in the year in the UK to take advantage of the lower beef supplies forecast at that time. This in line with the conclusions of the beef task force which recommended that processors and producers should fund a promotion campaign on the French and UK markets.</P>

      <P>There has been improvement in pig producer incomes since the beginning of the year, with Irish pigmeat prices increasing by nearly 9 per cent. This increase has also been reflected throughout the Community, and the EU Commission has indicated recently that it expects this trend to continue. This forecast is based on decreasing pig slaughterings for the rest of the year, which will help to drive up pigmeat prices, given the cutback on supplies.</P>
      <P>Since the market difficulties first began to have effect, I have taken action on a number of fronts. With regard to export refunds, I, along with my colleagues from other member states, secured substantial increases, ranging from 33 per cent to 80 per cent, from the EU Commission on four occasions last year and again in February of this year.</P>
      <P>I also secured agreement from the EU Commission for the introduction of a scheme of aids to private storage, under which EU funding is provided for the storage of pigmeat for a maximum period of six months. The scheme is still running and to date over 328,000 tonnes of pigmeat have been temporarily taken off the Community market.</P>
      <P>At the end of last year, the Council of Agriculture Ministers decided on a food-aid package for Russia, which includes 100,000 tonnes of pigmeat. This package, which is still ongoing, will, when concluded, have a positive effect on the market.</P>
      <P>An Bord Bia launched an extensive promotional campaign for bacon earlier this year. This campaign was aimed at the consumer who was encouraged to buy quality assured bacon. The campaign helped sales thus improving the market.</P>
      <P>Since the start of the problems in the pigmeat sector, I have been in regular contact with the organisations representing both the production and processing side of the industry. In addition, towards the end of last year I called in representatives of the banking organisations and the pigfeed providers who gave an assurance that every possible support would be given to their clients operating in the pig sector. The banking organisations repeated this assurance once again following a further meeting which took place earlier this year.</P>
      <P>Nothwithstanding the present upward trend in pigmeat prices, I will continue to ensure that the EU Commission makes maximum use of export refunds and aids to private storage to assist the pigmeat market. I will also continue to press the EU Commission to introduce additional measures aimed at creating a better balance in the sector and thus a more stable environment for pig producers.</P>

      <P>A range of controls is in place across the food chain in order to ensure the safety of food products.</P>
      <P>Over recent years, a range of initiatives have been taken at EU level and national levels to underpin food safety and to address problems that may arise from time to time. At EU level, the Commission reorganised and expanded its control and inspection services in the food, veterinary and plant health sectors. These functions are discharged by the food and veterinary office which is located in Ireland. The Commission has also established various scientific and advisory committees to assist in the formulation of policies to be pursued at EU level. In addition, a rapid food alert system has been put in place to provide early warning of food safety alerts to wholesalers and retailers.</P>
      <P>The Government has established the Food Safety Authority of Ireland which has been given overall responsibility for the enforcement of legislative provisions in the area of food safety and hygiene and for the promotion of standards of good practice throughout all stages of food production, distribution and sale. Arrangements for the discharge of functions by the various agencies under contract to the authority have recently been concluded.</P>
      <P>The Government has recently approved the text of a Bill to provide a statutory basis for a national beef assurance scheme. This initiative is further evidence of our commitment to apply the highest food safety standards starting with the beef sector. Notwithstanding the various safeguards in place, problems of the type recently experienced with some Belgian products can arise from time to time, and it is important that there are adequate and rapid response systems in place with such situations. At its most recent meeting, the Council of Agriculture Ministers considered the position in the light of the recent experience with Belgian products and decided <i>inter alia </i>to prioritise a comprehensive review of feedingstuffs regulations and to examine the area of feedstuffs control.</P>
      <P>I understand the FSAI has commenced a review of the Irish response to the Belgian episode and the further action, if any, that needs to be taken to deal with any recurrence in similar or other products.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the transposition into Irish law of the EU Third Framework Insurance Directive under Statutory Instrument No. 359 of 1994 (European Communities (Non-Life Insurance) Framework Regulations, 1994), authorised insurance companies may provide motor insurance throughout the EU/EEA on the basis of their home country authorisation.</P>
      <P>In general, motor insurance companies will seek to attract safer low risk policyholders and a keen level of competition exists in this sector as a result. Currently there are 29 insurers &ndash; 17 companies with their headquarters in Ireland, 11 based in other EU member states and one non-EU insurer &ndash; authorised to underwrite motor insurance in Ireland. The Deloitte &amp; Touche report on an economic evaluation of insurance costs referred to the competitive nature of the Irish motor insurance market in terms of numbers of companies per head of population compared with, for example, the UK insurance market. Deloitte &amp; Touche's survey of motor insurance premiums as presented in its report indicated that there was no uniform market price for motor insurance due to factors such as differing assessments of claims histories by insurers, strategies towards niche markets, specialisation and segmentation of the market. Its survey showed that the key factors affecting the premium rates applied to the Irish motorist were the individual driver's maturity and safety record. Within these parameters, motor insurers quoted widely different premiums for similar risks. This fact has also been borne out by successive automobile association surveys on motor insurance premium quotations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The level of competition among suppliers of insurance in the young driver motor insurance market depends on the willingness of insurance companies, established here or abroad, to provide motor insurance cover in Ireland having regard to the poor safety record and high claims costs associated with the young driver category of insurance business. The experience in Ireland is <Col N="906" /> that this is a particularly unattractive segment of the motor insurance market and supply of insurance is limited and, therefore, high-priced.</P>
    <P>Insurers worldwide classify young inexperienced drivers as a high insurance risk relative to the more mature, experienced driver. The degree of risk decreases with age and maturity and the level of premiums charged reduces over the life cycle. As a general rule, therefore, young drivers will pay higher premiums for insurance cover at the outset but individual drivers have the incentive to earn premium discounts through safe driving performance.</P>
    <P>In analysing young motorists risk profile, the Deloitte &amp; Touche report on insurance costs in Ireland confirmed that, in a European context, young drivers as a group and individuals with poor safety records will have limited choice of insurers and face high premium costs throughout the EU. While the underwriting criteria used by insurers throughout Europe, such as type and make of motor vehicle, driver's age, experience, use of motor vehicle, geographical area and driving record are similar, other relevant factors, such as demographic profile, accident and claims frequency and cost of claims under different compensation regimes differ between member states.</P>

      <P>The Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act, 1996, is administered by the employment rights division of my Department and is enforced by the labour inspectorate within that division. The inspectorate is comprised of 11 inspectors, two of whom are job-sharing. Their basic hours of work are from 9.15 a.m. to 5.30 p.m. As well as the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act, the labour inspectorate of my Department is responsible for the enforcement of worker rights set down in a variety of labour legislation and of statutory minimum rates of pay and conditions of employment of workers employed in sectors covered by employment regulation orders and registered employment agreements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Inspections of employers records are carried out based on complaints received about specific breaches of the Act and as a matter of routine. Breaches of the Act can be detected by close examination of these records. Inspections take place during normal office hours as the majority <Col N="907" /> of employers carry on business during these hours. It is possible to identify most breaches of the Act by close examination of these records and to take necessary action to have the position regularised.</P>
    <P>Enforcement experience has shown that the majority of employers found to be in breach of the Act are willing to adjust their practices to conform with the legal requirements. To ensure that corrective measures are taken by employers in such instances and that further breaches do not occur a follow-up inspection is usually carried out after a suitable lapse of time. There have been no prosecutions taken to date in 1999. In 1998, a total of 872 inspections were carried out under the Act. These inspections revealed non-compliance in 44 instances. In 1998, the employment rights section received 60 complaints.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the methodology adopted in relation to inspection work in relation to the Protection of Young Persons Act, 1996, is reasonable and that inspections are organised and targeted in a way that makes most efficient use of the enforcement resources available to me. A comprehensive, six month long, enforcement campaign commenced by the labour inspectorate in April and focusing on the catering sector nationwide is continuing. It is expected that 1,000 cross legislation inspections will be carried out in the course of this campaign, particular attention being paid to compliance with the Protection of Young Persons Act, 1996.</P>
    <P>I welcome the recent submission by the protection of young persons monitoring group, which contains certain measures designed to improve the enforcement of the legislation and the operation of the Act generally. I am at present examining these.</P>
    <P>I accept that the labour inspectorate is under resourced at present. However, plans to upgrade and strengthen my Department's labour enforcement staff are well advanced. I am hopeful that their present numbers can be significantly expanded in the not too distant future in the context of the new and expanded responsibilities foreseen for them (in the context of enforcement of the national minimum wage). I am also looking at possibilities for my inspectorate to engage in nightwork as a regular feature of their operations. Inspections of working times regularly take place with breaches being identified and pursued on the basis of the employment and payroll records maintained.</P>
    <P>I am conscious of the concerns expressed by various groups in relation to the exploitation by less scrupulous employers of young persons and would urge anyone with information in relation to breaches of the Act to notify the employment rights division of such breaches. I am confident that all such reported breaches will be dealt with expediently and that every effort will be made by the officials of my Department to eradicate non-compliance with this and indeed any other employment rights legislation.</P>

      <P>The matters relating to the development of the Irish Marine Emergency Service as a national coastguard service are being considered at present. Work is in progress on the preparation of legislation, a marine emergency service Bill, which would give the service a firm legislative base and statutory duty of responsibility for all activities associated with the discharge of its remit.  This includes search and rescue in maritime and inland waters, responding to oil pollution, monitoring and control of threats to the marine environment, salvage and wreck response and safety awareness. I will make a further statement in due course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My colleague, the Minister for Defence has said in this House that he felt the proposed new <Col N="910" /> coastguard service will give greater public recognition to all personnel involved in marine emergency response. The Air Corps, Naval Service and lately the Civil Defence are declared facilities to IMES in support of its responsibilities. Aerial surveillance for detection of pollution offences and emergency towing to prevent pollution are two subjects currently under study.</P>
    <P>I will be looking for the support of the State's military and civil powers by means of memoranda of agreement or liaison agreements to support the statutory authority of the coastguard when it is established as a civil authority. Indeed, two of the recommendations of the recent expenditure review of IMES deal specifically with the strengthening of memoranda of understanding and liaison agreements with the Air Corps and the Naval Service, in particular in relation to the pollution front. A memorandum of understanding with the Garda is in the process of completion at present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>Asia is a vast continent with enormous physical and human resources whose potential as a trading partner has long been recognised by the European Union. Although comparatively recent, the European Union's institutional engagement with Asia has been comprehensive and imaginative. It is a relationship which both sides want to see further strengthened and deepened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>EU trade relations with Asian countries are conducted through multilateral frameworks and bilateral agreements. The Asia-Europe or ASEM process is representative of the first model. ASEM comprises the 15 EU member states, seven of the ASEAN members (Thailand, Brunei, Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and Vietnam), as well as Japan, China and South Korea. The first ASEM summit meeting was held in Bangkok on 1-2 March 1996. The chairman's statement from that summit identified a number of follow-up activities in areas such as trade and investment promotion which have constituted the basis for ongoing work. A priority has been to <Col N="911" /> strengthen mutually beneficial economic and commercial ties between the two regions.</P>
    <P>One of the concrete results of ASEM I was the establishment of the ASEM Business Forum. The forum has as its purpose the fostering of closer cooperation between the business and private sectors of the two regions. The forum has already held two meetings and is scheduled to meet again in Seoul at the end of September 1999.</P>
    <P>It is well known that much of east and southeastern Asia has been undergoing a very difficult period over the past two years, as a result of the Asian financial crisis which has had serious consequences for the economies of a number of countries in the region. As part of the response to the crisis, a special ASEM trust fund was established under the aegis of the World Bank at the ASEM II Meeting in London in April 1999. The fund supports technical cooperation for financial sector restructuring and poverty assessment.</P>
    <P>On the bilateral front, the EU has entered into agreements with individual countries of the region. Typical of these is the framework agreement for trade and co-operation with the Republic of Korea, the terms of which were approved by the Dáil on 23 June 1999. Broadly speaking, such agreements incorporate wide ranging provisions for the progressive development of trade relations and other forms of cooperation between the European Union and the partner country in question. The agreements are comprehensive in scope and include provisions for cooperation in areas as diverse as transport, culture, agriculture, science and technology and the environment. These agreements, which are approved by the Council, are the outcome of detailed negotiations between the EU and each partner country and therefore reflect, and are sensitive to, the needs of both parties. They are, in other words, fair and balanced.</P>
    <P>Ireland's economic relations with Asia are substantial and continue to develop. In 1998, the region accounted for 12.2 per cent of Irelands total trade. Irish exports amounted to IR £2.886 billion, constituting some 6.4 per cent of our total exports. Imports from the region amounted to IR£6.356 billion or 20.4 per cent of our total imports. It is the Government's firm intention to further promote and develop Irelands trade ties with partner countries in this important region.</P>

      <P>Since the start of the crisis there, Kosovo has invariably figured high on the agenda of all discussions I have had with my European counterparts. This is particularly so in the case of discussions within the framework of the EU. I refer the Deputy to the extensive report which I made to the House on 15 June in respect of the discussions which took place at the Cologne European Council.</P>
      <P>Following the adoption by the United Nations Security Council of resolution 1244 on 10 June setting out in detail the way in which a political solution in Kosovo can be found, the focus of the international community is now on seeing that its provisions are implemented in full.</P>
      <P>The General Affairs Council on 21 June had detailed discussions on the contribution which the Union will be making to this process. Under the arrangements for civil implementation, which will be under the overall control of the United Nations, the European Union will have the lead role in reconstruction and economic affairs. The Council's discussions also covered in depth the wider regional context, including the stability pact for South Eastern Europe. We are convinced that a durable solution to Kosovo can only be assured if the problems of the wider region are also addressed.</P>
      <P>Subsequently I had detailed discussions on 23 June with my Finnish counterpart, Mrs. Halonen, on her plans for their forthcoming Presidency of the EU, and I am pleased at the priority and attention that Finland will be giving to the subject of Kosovo and the wider region over the next six months.</P>
      <P>In my discussions on the situation in Kosovo, the question of the contribution that Ireland is making to address the immediate humanitarian needs and also the longer term requirements for reconstruction and the maintenance of peace has also arisen. Information about this contribution, which is a substantial one, has been communicated to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>The UN Security Council adopted Resolution 1244 on 10 June 1999 which, among other things, authorised the establishment and deployment of an international security presence in Kosovo (KFOR) with all necessary means to fulfil its responsibilities under the Security Council Resolution. The Security Council envisages that KFOR, with substantial North Atlantic Treaty Organisation participation, must be deployed under unified command and control with the aim of establishing a safe environment for all people in Kosovo and facilitating the safe return to their homes of all displaced persons and refugees. KFOR, like the Stabilisation Force (SFOR) in Bosnia and Herzegovina, in which Ireland is currently participating, will include a broad range of troop contributing nations, encompassing NATO members and states who are not NATO members. KFOR's deployment is accepted by the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The Security Council Resolution established KFOR for an initial period of 12 months from June 1999, to continue thereafter unless the Security Council decides otherwise.</P>
      <P>On 29 June 1999, on the basis of a proposal submitted by me, and with the agreement of the Minister for Defence, the Government decided, subject to Dáil approval, on participation by a contingent from the Permanent Defence Force in KFOR. It is proposed that the Irish contingent would comprise a transport group of some 80-100 personnel. It is envisaged that deployment could begin at a minimum approximately six or seven weeks from Dáil approval.</P>
      <P>KFOR will work closely with the international civil presence in Kosovo whose establishment was authorised by the same Security Council Resolution. The international civil presence will draw on the assistance of relevant international organisations in order to provide an interim administration for Kosovo.</P>
      <P>As the Irish contingent for KFOR will exceed 12 in number and will be armed, Dáil approval of the dispatch of the contingent is required under the terms of the Defence Acts. Troop contributors to KFOR are responsible for their own costs. Approval by the Dáil will thus also be sought for an exchange of letters with the Secretary General of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, which sets out Ireland's financial responsibility, as a non-NATO troop contributor, arising from participation in KFOR. The text of this exchange of letters has been laid before the Dáil. I have put forward the necessary motion of approval for consideration by the Dáil.</P>
      <P>Consideration is also being given to supplying a small number of officers to the UN for military liaison tasks between the international civil and security presences in Kosovo.</P>

      <P>The Government has responded to the establishment of devolved Government in Scotland, as well as to the provision in the Good Friday Agreement for a new British-Irish Council, by the establishment in September 1998 of the Consulate General in Edinburgh, which has enabled us to develop close and ongoing contacts with Scottish political and other figures.</P>
      <P>During the same period, there have been visits to Scotland by other members of the Government, including both the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste. In October 1998 the Taoiseach met both the Secretary of State Donald Dewar and SNP leader Alex Salmond.</P>
      <P>Today, 1 July, the Taoiseach is represented at the opening of the Scottish Parliament by the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs. The Ceann Comhairle and Cathaoirleach of the Seanad are also attending the ceremony. Ireland was the only country invited to attend the ceremony at Head of Government level, a fact which reflects the desire of the new Scottish Administration to build a strong relationship with Ireland. This desire is fully reciprocated by the Government.</P>

      <P>The report is about the planning of services for Irish emigrants generally, not just for those in Britain. It contains useful information, observations and conclusions which merit serious consideration by those of us with responsibilities regarding emigrants.</P>
      <P>The main considerations to which the report draws attention are that emigration is still a feature of Irish society, to the extent of about 20,000 people a year, 56 per cent of whom are in the 15 to 24 age group; that among those emigrants are a distinct stream of relatively unskilled and poorly qualified people who go to Britain and, to a lesser extent, to the US and who are in need of Irish welfare services; that Irish emigrants to Britain have been less successful and fortunate than other immigrant communities there, especially with regard to employment, housing, health and occupational and social mobility; and that the number of undocumented Irish emigrants in the US is increasing again.</P>
      <P>Criticisms in the report of the Government's role regarding emigration and emigrants include that there is a deficit of information about emigration trends and the social factors associated with it; that the Interdepartmental Committee on Emigration is not pro-active in policy-making and does not have an interface with non-governmental organisations; that policy-making is not linked to the national anti-poverty strategy; that funding of Irish voluntary organisations abroad is inadequate and originates in two different Departments; that the situation of Irish people in Britain has not yet been raised in a systematic way with the British authorities; and that Ireland is not party to some international legal instruments relevant to emigrants interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are asked to establish a task force represen<Col N="918" /> tative of Government Departments and agencies and non-governmental organisations to develop a long-term policy approach to emigration and the needs of emigrants, an approach which would address the perceived present inadequacies.</P>
    <P>I have told the IECE and ICPO that in general I accept the report's conclusions and that I will consult the Government about setting up such a task force. In the meantime I myself met with Fr. Paul Byrne, IECE on 26 May to discuss the concerns expressed in the report. There has also been a special meeting between the Interdepartmental Committee on Emigration and representatives of the two commissions to consider the report.</P>

      <P>Ireland is currently defending 16 cases before the Court of Justice of the European Communities. However, the number fluctuates as cases before the court are either settled or proceed to judgment, and also as new proceedings issue.</P>
      <P>Of the 16 cases, six relate to non-implementation of directives within the time-limits set out in those directives. In two cases, implementing regulations have been made by the relevant Minister and the proceedings will be withdrawn shortly by the European Commission. In several cases, the relevant implementing measures are either in the process of being completed or have just been completed and it is expected that the proceedings against Ireland in those cases will also be withdrawn. In respect of two other cases implementation of the necessary measures will be by primary legislation, the final draft of which has just been transmitted to the Department concerned.</P>
      <P>Six cases relate to differences of opinion between Ireland and the European Commission as to the correct interpretation to be given to the provisions of particular directives. One case involves a technical defence in relation to procedural matters. The Chief State Solicitor and the Attorney General, with appropriate assistance from the Department and other relevant Departments, are working together to ensure that Ireland's interests are fully defended in all of these proceedings.</P>

      <P>As a response to the crisis in Kosovo, the Government agreed, on 14 April, to admit 1,000 refugees of ethnic Albanian origin, from refugee camps in the FYR of Macedonia. Following this decision, Ireland participated in a humanitarian evacuation programme organized under the auspices of the UNHCR. A total of 1,031 refugees arrived here, on a phased basis, between 10 May to 17 June. These refugees have been given the full range of facilities under standard United Nation's temporary protection arrangements. This covers their entitlement to a legalised stay in Ireland, protection against forced return, subsistence, shelter, basic medical care and education. In addition, they are also entitled to seek employment.</P>
      <P>The refugees are being accommodated in various locations around the country in a combination of public and privately owned property. Nine refugee centres have been established in Dungarvan and Waterford city; Millstreet, County Cork; Cork city; Killarney (two); Tralee; Kildare and Baltinglass. Each reception centre has its own management team, seconded from the relevant health boards, headed by the Refugee Agency &ndash; the Refugee Agency is under the auspices of the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>
      <P>In general, the refugees are adapting well to living in Ireland. Activities, with the support of local communities, have been arranged for families and their children. Play groups have been established. English language classes have now commenced in a number of the centres. A number of the refugees have found employment in local industry.</P>
      <P>A certain number of the refugees has expressed an interest in returning to Kosovo as soon as possible and arrangements are now being put in place, in consultation with the UNHCR, to facilitate their return in safety and security. However, those refugees who wish to remain in Ireland until conditions in Kosovo become more stable may, of course, continue to live here.</P>

      <P>The situation regarding refugees in the neighbouring countries to Kosovo is changing on a daily basis. Large numbers of refugees are now returning spontaneously to Kosovo. In addition, the UNHCR has now begun a repatriation programme to Kosovo from the camps in FYR of Macedonia including the camps from where the refugees were evacuated to Ireland. In the light of this, it is unlikely that the UNHCR will initiate a further humanitarian evacuation programme. However, in the event of a deterioration in the circumstances of the refugees, we would be ready to admit a further number if the need arises.</P>

      <P>Telecom Éireann was established on a statutory basis as a separate entity in 1983 and staff of the former Department of Posts and Telegraphs transferred to it on vesting day. Since then, there has been no scope for such staff to return to the Civil Service and that remains the current position. The flotation of Telecom Éireann will not change this situation. I should emphasise, however, that the provisions in the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983, as amended, relating to the conditions of services and tenure of those who transferred to Telecom Éireann will remain unchanged after the flotation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>At last year's ministerial meeting of the OSPAR Commission held in Portugal, the contracting parties to the OSPAR Convention adopted a strategy on radioactive substances which has as its objective the virtual elimination of radioactive discharges to the maritime area of the North-East Atlantic by the year 2020. The strategy also requires the OSPAR Commission, by the year 2000, to show how they plan to implement the strategy.</P>
      <P>At this year's meeting of the OSPAR Commission, Ireland submitted a follow-up proposal, which was supported by Iceland and Denmark. The proposal called on member countries to intensify their efforts and to ensure that the OSPAR Commission can identify and take the necessary action for achieving further substantial reductions or elimination of radioactive discharges, in accordance with the timeframe laid down in the strategy. The purpose of the proposal was to accelerate necessary work in preparation for the key Commission meeting in 2000.</P>
      <P>The Irish proposal was approved at the Commission meeting. Furthermore, the commission agreed to pay particular attention to the principal sources of radioactive discharges including nuclear fuel reprocessing activities, and that where action by operators of such activities is required, such action would be taken without delay.</P>
      <P>I had received correspondence from Greenpeace on their own proposals for the Commission meeting which I discussed with them. However, Ireland's proposal for the meeting reflected consultation which I had undertaken with Iceland and Denmark as part of preparations for the Commission meeting in 2000 which will be a milestone in terms of the strategy. In the event, the Commission meeting noted documents submitted by Greenpeace International which included a proposal from Greenpeace which essentially called on the contracting parties to decide that, in order to comply with the strategy, all reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel and associated radioactive discharges must be terminated as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>I believe that last week's OSPAR decision is a further reinforcement of the contracting parties' commitment to the strategy. Ireland will continue to exert maximum pressure to ensure that the objectives of the strategy are met.</P>

      <P>A comparison with the levels of sub<Col N="922" /> vention in other EU capital cities is not an appropriate basis for determining the level of State subvention for Bus Átha Cliath. Such comparisons can be misleading as they do not necessarily take account of differing circumstances in individual cities.</P>
      <P>For example, Bus Átha Cliath, in addition to the State subvention, also receives payments from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs in respect of free travel schemes. In 1998 these payments amounted to £10.2 million, in addition to a State subvention of £9.244 million. This year, Bus Átha Cliath is also receiving Exchequer and EU capital grants of £28.3 million for the purchase of 150 extra double deck buses and 20 accessible midi buses, and for the leasing of seven trial low-floor buses and one LPG fuelled trial bus. The company is also receiving funding for the introduction of real time passenger information on Quality Bus Corridors.</P>
      <P>The level of subvention to Bus Átha Cliath will be kept under review. Any increase in the subvention, beyond that required to take account of inflation, could only be considered where the company was providing new or additional services which did not fully recover their costs.</P>
      <P>In that regard, I will take into account the proposal in the DTO short-term action plan regarding funding for any supplementary operational costs incurred by the 150 new buses. I will also take into account the recommendations regarding additional buses and services contained in the recently completed DTO transportation blueprint 2000 to 2006. However, it will only be possible to reach a definitive conclusion on the revenue implications for Bus Átha Cliath once any additional buses have been in service for a period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>In July 1998 I announced the details of the barracks to be closed in the first phase of barrack rationalisation. At that time, while including Clancy Barracks, I indicated that it was not in the group to be closed in 1998. It is not expected that the closure of Clancy Barracks will be completed before the middle of next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="925" /> The military authorities have been asked to prepare a detailed plan for the future of the units currently stationed in Clancy Barracks. Once this plan is available, I will ensure that personnel, both military and civilian, serving in Clancy Barracks will be fully briefed.</P>
    <P>The question of the number and locations of Defence Force barracks is not one which comes within the remit of the representative associations. It is a matter for Government to decide. However, following a decision to close a barracks there is an important role for the associations in identifying issues of concern to their members. The issues which can be considered jointly with the associations are the management of the closures and the associated personnel matters.</P>

      <P>The person named applied for an early retirement pension on 29 April 1999. Due to the <Col N="929" /> volume of work a backlog has arisen in the processing of applications. Applications are dealt with in order of receipt and this case will be processed as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>I would point out, however, that in no case does the processing time result in a financial loss to a retiring farmer. The operational procedures for the scheme specifically ensure that the date of receipt in the Department of a valid application determines the date from which payment is made.</P>

    <P>Average Irish cattle prices are lower than in all other member states. The reason for this difference relates to our distance from the major markets and the associated transport costs, the suitability of the Irish product for EU markets and a preference for domestically produced beef in those markets.</P>
    <P>One of the main recommendations of the beef task force, which has now submitted its report to me, is to narrow the gap between EU and Irish prices. This will involve the development of a market led industry based on high quality primary production and increased penetration of high value EU retail markets. An Bord Bia marketing strategy is to increase the level of exports to the EU from 195,000 tonnes in 1998 to 280,000 tonnes by 2002. The introduction of proper price differentials for cattle by the processing industry, combined with the adoption of better breeding practices by producers, should help to improve the quality of Irish cattle and, in that way, narrow the gap between Irish and EU cattle prices.</P>
    <P>With regards to consumer prices it is my view that a fall in producer prices should be reflected in a reduction in the retail price. Matters concerning consumer prices and market competition come within the remit of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>Beef, sheepmeat and pigmeat are our main food exports and as such it is vital that they are competitively placed on EU and international markets.</P>
      <P>With regard to beef exports, there has been a shift in the export profile since the BSE crisis with increased exports to third country markets. The fall in beef consumption in the EU and a preference for domestically produced beef is the main reason for this change. The aim of the beef industry, as outlined in the beef task report, is to regain and increase market share on EU markets while at the same time retaining a strong presence on third countries markets. I believe that these objectives can be achieved because of our very competitive production base and the fact that we produce beef to the very highest standards of safety and quality. The export performance of the Irish beef industry in 1998, when it increased sales to EU markets by 45 per cent over 1997 level, is evidence of its competitiveness on export markets.</P>
      <P>With regard to sheep exports, France offers the main market opportunity and accounts for three quarters of lamb export sales. However, Ireland has a market presence in almost all other EU member states. Over the past five years, a considerable effort has been made to promote lamb sales to the developing German and Nordic markets, with some success. These markets offer an alternative outlet to replace diminishing opportunities for sale to UK and Mediterranean markets.</P>
      <P>In terms of price, Ireland can compete with any EU competitor but in the lamb market, the main challenge comes from new Zealand suppliers, which operate on a cost base which is very much lower than EU supplier. In terms of quality, Irish lamb can compete with the highest standards during the spring and summer seasons but some autumn hill lamb and winter hoggets tend to fall short of top grades. However, many Irish export meat plants now operate a full grading system based on the EUROP classification system, which &ndash; by paying producers for top quality &ndash; together with a greater focus on all quality aspect, can deliver a substantial improvement in this area. In this regard, my Department is working with the sheepmeat export approved plants to secure the grading for all lambs for export.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Exports of pigmeat increased from 115,000 tonnes in 1997 to 130,000 tonnes in 1998, which is a very creditable performance in view of the major difficulties on the pigmeat market last year. The Irish pigmeat industry has developed over the past few years into an industry capable of <Col N="932" /> holding its own in a highly competitive international environment. The hygiene and quality standards at producer and processor level are such that they compare favourable with those at EU level and beyond.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the Irish meat industry is well placed to meet competition on the EU and world markets. My objective is that the industry will continue to develop by ongoing improvement in standards, further development of its product portfolio and consolidation and increase of its share of the export market. The support of An Bord Bia through market promotion and through the operation of its quality assurance schemes will contribute to this endeavour.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Agriculture and Food</askee>
      <Quest>the number of markets for Irish beef which have been restored in the past two years with particular reference to the Middle East and other countries which discontinued their contracts following the BSE scare; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>Many markets outside of the EU restricted or banned imports of beef in the aftermath of the BSE crisis in 1996. Following in some cases prolonged negotiations, all of the traditionally important markets for Irish beef are now open. We are now focusing on some of what would have been secondary markets where market access problems persist. These markets include Turkey, Jordan, Tunisia and Syria.</P>
      <P>While there was no ban placed on Irish beef by any EU member state there was a loss of market share due to an increased consumer preference on some of those markets for their own, domestically produced, beef. While there has been considerable progress made in regaining these markets, it remains one of the major priorities for the Irish beef industry to further develop its presence on EU markets. Among the recommendations of the beef task force is the establishment of a special promotion fund aimed at recovering and increasing market share on EU retail markets, particularly in France and the United Kingdom.</P>

      <Quest>the basis on which he labels one major heading of the projected investments as residential rather than commercial in respect of the rural regeneration tax incentive scheme thus avoiding the need to gain the permission of the European Commission's Directorate General on State aids and competition when the tax relief is available when the buildings are only occupied for three months of the year and is not necessarily directly tied to income from the buildings in the designated area and allows for capital costs to be written off against rental income from any source.</Quest>

      <P>My Department was informed by the State aids section of DGIV of the European Commission that tax reliefs for the provision of residential accommodation do not need to be notified as a State aid to the EU Commission. Since 1986, when the first renewal scheme was introduced, the normal reliefs for the provision of residential accommodation have been (a) the relief for owner-occupiers and (b) the relief for rented residential accommodation, generally known as the section 23 relief. Both reliefs have been included in the rural renewal scheme.</P>
      <P>The section 23 relief allows for the qualifying expenditure on the provision of the rented residential accommodation to be offset against all the Irish rental income of the owner of the accommodation. Such deductibility is considered necessary in order to encourage the investor to provide the residential property in the desired urban or rural renewal location which would otherwise not have occurred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the normal course, there is no minimum <Col N="935" /> lease period for the qualifying property for the purposes of the section 23 relief. However, in the case of the section 23 relief in the rural renewal area, there is a minimum period of three months and it is also provided in the legislation that the property in question must be used as the sole or main residence of the lessee throughout the period of the lease.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Deputy would agree that the pilot rural renewal scheme for the Upper Shannon area is targeted at an area which is seriously disadvantaged because of low income levels, population decline, poor economic prospects and poor social infrastructure. The aim of this pilot scheme is to improve the economic and social condition of this deprived rural area, an objective with which no doubt the Deputy would be in full agreement.</P>
      <P>Environmental guidelines are not a matter for my functional area of responsibility. However, I am advised that the Department of the Environment and Local Government is preparing guidelines on high amenity landscapes to assist planning authorities in carrying out their planning functions.

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that section 469 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997 allows for tax relief to be given in respect of various defined medical expenses. These include the cost of medical appliances which help prevent, diagnose, alleviate or treat an ailment, injury, infirmity, defect or disability and are used on the advice of a practitioner, for example, a medical doctor.</P>
      <P>I am further informed that the appliance referred to by the Deputy, the TENS physiotherapy machine, is not currently considered to be a medical appliance for the purposes of section 469 but, if it is shown to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners that the appliance is effective in helping to prevent, diagnose, alleviate or treat an ailment, injury, infirmity, defect or disability, tax relief would be allowed provided the appliance is used on the advice of a practitioner.</P>
      <P>As is the case with medical expenses generally, tax relief in respect of the cost of medical appliances is only allowable where the expense incurred is not recoverable from any public or local authority or under any contract of insurance.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may also wish to note that under the VAT (Refund of Tax) (No. 15) Order 1981 it is possible for individuals to obtain repayments of VAT expended on certain aids and appliances which assist persons with a disability overcome that disability. For example, walk-in baths, lifting seats and chairs, hoists and lifters and stair lifts, designed for persons with a disability, as well as iron lungs and kidney machines, can qualify for relief. The physiotherapy machine in question may, therefore, qualify for a refund of VAT. However, the operation of this scheme is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners and before the person purchases this machine he or she should contact the VAT (unregistered) refunds section, Office of the Revenue Commissioners, Government Buildings, Kilrush Road, Ennis, County Clare, telephone number 1890 202033 (local)</P>

      <Quest>the tax rates on old age pensions; if his attention has been drawn to the anger of pensioners at being taxed after their years of effort in contributing to the development of the economy; the further measures, if any, he will take to reduce tax on the elderly in the next budget by introducing a 10 per cent tax rate on all or part income, generously increasing the age allowance and improving exemption limits; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a general principle of taxation that, as far as possible, income from all sources should be subject to taxation. In line with this principle, occupational and social welfare pensions are, therefore, reckonable as income for tax purposes. Treating pension payments as income for tax purposes is essentially a matter of equity.</P>
      <P>The extent, if any, to which taxation will actually arise in a given case will essentially depend on the level of income other than the social welfare pension that a recipient has in the same tax year. If there is no other income in addition to the social welfare payment, the existing exemption limits and allowances can be expected to ensure that there is no tax to be paid on the social welfare income itself.</P>
      <P>Under the normal income tax system, an individual taxpayer is entitled to have certain allowances and reliefs taken into account in calculating their tax liability. Any income greater than the sum total of the allowances and reliefs is then taxed at 24 per cent and-or 46 per cent as appropriate. Such allowances include the personal allowances (single or married allowances, age allowance, PAYE allowance, blind allowance, etc.) and reliefs such as that for health expenses, medical insurance, qualifying rent relief etc.</P>
      <P>Alternatively, if more favourable to the taxpayer, he or she may be taxed under the exemption limits-marginal relief system. Under this system individuals are provided with exemption limits, which are higher than the normal personal allowances, and are taxed at 40 per cent on all income above the exemption limits until their level of income is such that it would be more favourable to be taxed under the normal tax system. However, the exemption limits displace the normal personal allowances and reliefs, including medical insurance relief. For historical reasons people on exemption limits-marginal relief continue to be eligible for mortgage interest relief subject to the usual conditions. It must be stressed that if you are being taxed under the marginal relief system you are in fact paying less tax than if you were being taxed under the normal tax system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will, of course, be aware that those aged 65 and over are treated more favourably under the income tax code than the generality of taxpayers. The exemption limits for those aged 65 and over are significantly higher than those which apply generally. In the last two budgets, I have implemented substantial improvements in the tax treatment of the elderly. In the 1999 budget I introduced a unified income tax exemption limit of £6,500 single-£13,000 married for all those aged 75 and over. This represents an increase of £1,500 <Col N="939" /> single, £3,000 married for those aged 65 to 74 and an increase of £1,000 single, £2,000 married for those aged 75 and over. The new age exemption limit compares favourably with the general exemption limits of £4,100 single-£8,200 married. The large increase in income exemption limits for the elderly announced in budget 1999 will remove 15,000 elderly persons from the tax net.</P>
    <P>Where pensioners aged 65 and over are taxed under the normal personal allowance tax system they are eligible for the special age allowance of £400 single-£800 married, which is in addition to the normal personal allowances. While the age allowance was not increased in budget 1999, it was not standard rated and is still allowable at the taxpayer's marginal rate of tax. As regards elderly people taxed under the normal tax system, they will benefit from the general tax improvements introduced in the last two budgets i.e the standard rating of the main personal allowances and the PAYE allowance; the increase in the personal allowances of £1,300 single-£2,600 married to £4,200 single-£8,400 married; the increase in the PAYE allowance of £200 to £1,000; the widening of the standard band by £4,100 single-£8,200 married and the 2 per cent reduction in both the standard and top income tax rates.</P>
    <P>The threshold for payment of the levies has been increased by £1,000 over the two budgets, from £10,250 to £11,250. In addition, the levies were restructured, with the abolition of the 1 per cent employment and training levy, and the increase in the 1.25 per cent health levy to 2 per cent, resulting in a reduction of 0.25 per cent in the combined levy charge.</P>
    <P>I am of course aware of the concerns of pensioners with regard to taxation and the tax position of the elderly will, of course, be borne in mind in the context of future budgets.</P>

      <Quest>the plans, if any, he has, including staff increases, to deal with the queues in the PAYE tax offices in O'Connell and Cathedral Street, Dublin, which have reached unacceptable levels particularly with summer seasonal workers; the number of callers pending; the average waiting time at each office; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the central revenue information office which is located in Cathedral Street, is the office in the O'Connell Street area which provides a service for all personal callers regarding all types of tax. PAYE taxpayers, including seasonal workers, account for approximately 87 per cent of callers. In the five month period to the end of May 1999 the CRIO dealt with approximately 90,000 callers. It is anticipated that a total of 200,000 callers will be dealt with during 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="940" /> The Revenue Commissioners have set customer service standards for dealing with personal callers to their public offices. The standard aimed for is that taxpayers will normally be attended to within ten minutes. However, they also advise that it is not always possible to provide the level of service in their busier offices and particularly at peak business periods.</P>
    <P>The following are the percentages of callers dealt with at the CRIO within ten minutes since January 1999: January 76 per cent; February 84 per cent; March 64 per cent; April 66 per cent; May 64 per cent.</P>
    <P>The following figures for the two week period ending mid-June 1999 gives details of the overall timescale within which callers were dealt with: under ten minutes 70 per cent; ten-30 minutes 20 per cent; over 30 minutes 10 per cent.</P>
    <P>The nature of the tax system, and the PAYE system in particular, is such that it creates major peaks of work within tax offices. Needless to say, tax offices cannot be permanently staffed throughout the year at the level required to deal with these peak periods. Nevertheless, every effort is made with the staff available to increase the numbers providing service during these periods. Despite this, the number of taxpayers calling to offices at peak times is such that it is inevitable that the average waiting period will be higher than at normal times.</P>
    <P>In addition, the nature of the work performed at the CRIO is also changing. More taxpayers are now calling to the CRIO in person to inquire about complex matters such as investing in BES, urban renewal schemes, holiday homes, etc. These are areas which would previously have been dealt with through correspondence and require more time to explain to taxpayers that the</P>
    <P>more routine work. Furthermore, the partial introduction of tax credits in the 1999 budget has this year added to the number of callers to all revenue offices enquiring about the effect of the changes.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners are continuously reviewing procedures with a view to ensuring that the best possible service is provided to taxpayers. They have made considerable advances in this regard over recent years. Heavy investment in technology has helped greatly in coping with the huge increase in business. The commissioners are very conscious of providing the best possible service to their customers. I understand that they are keeping the staffing position under review.</P>

Whereas previously this relief only applied to the cost of persons taking care of the taxpayer or his or her spouse, I announced in my last budget that the relief was being extended to family members who employ a carer in respect of a totally incapacitated person. This widening of the scheme was provided for in section 9 of the Finance Act, 1999. The relief is available in respect of expenditure of up to £8,500 per annum.</P>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners have informed me that in the absence of detailed information regarding the case referred to by the Deputy, it is not possible to state categorically whether they are eligible for the tax relief provided for in section 467. However, if the couple provide medical evidence to their inspector of taxes that their son is &ldquo;totally incapacitated by physical or mental infirmity&rdquo; they would be eligible for the relief.</P>
      <P>It is not a condition of eligibility for the relief that the carer must be a trained nurse or the holder of a qualification in nursing or child care.</P>

      <Quest>the steps, if any, he is taking to implement the recommendations made both by the National Ambulance Advisory Council and the review group on the ambulance service on a training syllabus for ambulance personnel; and the consideration, if any, given by him to the establishment of a national ambulance authority to ensure that the ambulance emergency medical services are developed and improved in the interests of those who require this service.</Quest>
      <QRef>[16984/99]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I consider the training of ambulance personnel to be a central and fundamental element in the delivery of an efficient and effective ambulance service. A new basic training syllabus for ambulance personnel which was recommended by the review group on the ambulance service was developed by the national ambulance advisory council. Agreement with staff interests on the implementation of the new training programmes was reached in 1997 and to date more than two thirds of all ambulance personnel have now completed the basic training course.</P>
      <P>The review group recommends that the national priority should be to provide a significant improvement in the quality of the training provided for current personnel across the eight health boards on a national basis. The basic life support training which Irish ambulance personnel receive compares very favourably with best international standards. This training covers all areas of basic life support including emergency cardiac care, emergency childbirth and head/spinal injuries. The use of a defibrillator in the training which Irish ambulance personnel receive at least equals and often exceeds the level of training provided to ambulance personnel in other countries. When an overall improvement in training is achieved, the question of advanced and paramedic training will be addressed in line with the recommendations of the review group.</P>
      <P>In relation to the establishment of a national ambulance authority the review group's recommendation on this issue was that ambulance services should continue to be managed by the statutory health agencies engaged in the provision of hospital care in order to promote close integration of the pre-hospital and hospital sectors. The national ambulance advisory council was established on foot of the recommendations of the review to ensure that uniform standards of service operate throughout the country. The council was operating under the aegis of my Department. A review of the structure and role of the council to strengthen its capacity to fulfil its remit has recently been completed and I expect to be able to make an announcement in this regard shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the publication of the report of the review group on the ambulance service approximately £23 million in addition funding has been <Col N="943" /> provided for the implementation of the report's recommendations. The additional funding has resulted in major improvements in the service including the improvements in the training of ambulance personnel; improvements in the specification and age profile of the ambulance fleet; regional command and control centres are operational in five health board areas, a joint fire and ambulance command and control centre for the Dublin area has recently been commissioned and construction and equipping of similar centres is at an advanced stage in the remaining health boards; the opening of additional ambulance stations, and the provision of training and equipment to general practitioners in remote rural areas, on a pilot basis, to enable them to deal with emergencies in advance of the arrival of an ambulance.</P>
    <P>I am firmly committed to the full implementation of all the review group's recommendations and this year's additional funding of more than £7 million represents the largest annual amount ever provided for the development of the ambulance service.</P>

This approach is in keeping with the recommendations of the report of the commission on the status of people with disabilities, A Strategy for Equality. The practical steps needed to develop services in my area of responsibility are set out in the report of the review group on health and personal social services for people with physical and sensory disabilities, Towards an Independent Future.</P>
      <P>To address the complex issues involved in developing services in the sector, Towards an Independent Future recommended the establishment of co-ordinating committees for physical and sensory disability services in each health board. These committees, which are representative of the voluntary and statutory agencies providing services in the sector and consumers, were established last year. One of their functions is to advise the chief executive officers of the health boards on priorities for the allocation of funding available for the development of these services.</P>
      <P>The funding of voluntary sector service providers, such as Brainwave, is a matter for the relevant health board in whose functional area services are being provided. Brainwave has in the past, received funding from each of the health boards for the provision of services.</P>
      <P>I have noted the declaration mentioned in the question and the Deputy can be assured that services for people with epilepsy will continue to be developed in line with the recommendations in Towards an Independent Future and in accordance with the availability of resources.</P>

      <P>As MRSA is not a notifiable disease under the infectious disease control regulations, national statistics on incidence are not routinely collected. In 1995, a survey was undertaken to ascertain the number of times MRSA was isolated in acute hospitals over a defined period of time. The objective of this survey was to obtain an indication of the MRSA problem in Ireland prior to introducing national MRSA guidelines. A survey of all microbiology laboratories in Ireland was carried out over two weeks in spring 1995. All 45 microbiology laboratories surveyed responded. MRSA was isolated from 448 patients during the two week period. The prevalence of MRSA during this period was 16.5 in every 1000 discharges.</P>
      <P>Subsequently, guidelines for acute hospitals and other facilities were developed and circulated, drawing attention to issues such as the need for education and training of staff, and for infection control committees.</P>
      <P>In order to review the situation, a repeat all-Ireland study was carried out between 1 and 14 February 1999, under the direction of the Eastern Health Board. The results of the study will be available later this year.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will also be interested to know that a national disease surveillance centre has been established under the aegis of the Eastern Health Board.

      <P>The provision of hospital services is in the first instance the statutory responsibility of the Southern Health Board. I am aware of recent interruptions in service at the radiotherapy department at Cork University Hospital. However I have been assured by the board that every effort has been made to minimise any disruption to patients.</P>
      <P>When this matter was brought to my attention in January this year I requested the health board to put proposals to me for the resolution of this problem as a matter of urgency. The health board's proposals indicated that the main problem in relation to the radiotherapy service in Cork University Hospital is the absence of backup equipment where a break in service occurs in the single linear accelerator. I am pleased to advise the Deputy that I have approved the provision of a second linear accelerator for Cork University Hospital at an estimated cost of £2 million. The provision of this second machine will ensure continuity of service for patients requiring radiotherapy and will help prevent the recurrence of interruptions to treatment in the future. Together with the development of a new chemotherapy day unit and remote afterloading facilities which are already at an advanced stage of planning, the provision of a second linear accelerator marks a major step in the development of radiotherapy services at Cork University Hospital.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the one-year full-time degree course which the National University of Ireland, Galway is offering to students who have successfully completed the nursing registration-diploma programmes, the first of which was introduced in 1994.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position is that successful completion by a student of the three-year nursing registration-diploma programme leads to registration as a <Col N="949" /> nurse with An Bord Altranais, at which point he or she will become eligible for employment as a nurse. Since a degree in nursing is not a requirement for registration as a nurse and subsequent employment, such a qualification would be an optional post-registration qualification. A student nurse who successfully completes the three-year diploma programme and who wishes to undertake a fourth year of full-time study leading to the award of a degree in nursing would, therefore, be responsible for making his or her own arrangements, including the payment of course fees. I am not in a position to provide funding for such a course.</P>
    <P>As regards the Deputy's query concerning maintenance grants for individuals who wish to undertake the state enrolled nursing course in Queen's University, Belfast, I should explain that in this country there is only one level of nurse, that of registered general nurse and that this is equivalent to the British qualification of registered general nurse. This level of general nursing is governed by EU directives which set down the minimum amount of training required to achieve this qualification or its equivalent throughout the European Union. Ireland does not have a comparable qualification to the British grade of SEN and because of the minimum training requirements laid down for general nursing in EU directives it would not be possible to allow SENs to practice as RGNs. Instead, the holder of such a qualification would have to undergo a conversion course in order to qualify for registration as an RGN in the UK. The individual would then be entitled to apply for registration in the general nurse division of the register of nurses maintained by An Bord Altranais, in accordance with the relevant EU directive relating to the recognition of nursing qualifications. I understand that An Bord Altranais has been informed by the European Commission that the Irish authorities have no obligation under EU law to create or regulate the activities of an SEN.</P>
    <P>An Bord Altranais has examined the feasibility of creating access to conversion courses in conjunction with the UK nursing authorities, to enable SEN diploma holders to become RGNs. Such courses would have UK recognition and the successful participants would be eligible to register as an RGN in Ireland. However, while researching the proposed conversion course, An Bord Altranais discovered that not more than 10 per cent of the proposed course could take place outside the UK. As it was not logistically possible to organise such a course in Ireland, the proposal was not carried through. I understand that the European Commission has stated that there is no onus on An Bord Altranais to provide such a course.</P>
    <P>The provision of conversion courses for SENs was considered by the commission on nursing. The commission noted that there is no tradition here of a registerable nursing qualification other than registered nurse. Similarly, the commission found that there is no precedent here for the pro<Col N="950" /> vision of courses of the type provided for SENs in Northern Ireland. Accordingly, the commission did not recommend any change in the rules of An Bord Altranais in relation to the recognition of the SEN qualification or the provision of conversion courses.</P>
    <P>I am not in a position, therefore, to provide funding for those individuals wishing to participate in the SEN conversion course in Queen's University, Belfast. My priority is the continued implementation of the recommendations of the report of the commission on nursing, and all available funding is being directed towards achieving that objective.</P>

      <P>The provision of services to persons with a mental handicap in the Wexford region is a matter for the South-Eastern Health Board in the first instance. I have made inquiries with the board and I understand that mental handicap services in Wexford have operated on a 49 week basis over the past 20 years. Closure for a summer period of two weeks and Christmas for one week has been the practice. Residents went home to family and relatives for these periods. In 1997, 12 places were assigned for respite during these holiday periods.</P>
      <P>In 1998 it was recognised by the board that residents' needs were changing and requiring a higher level of care, and that their relatives/carers were ageing and finding it difficult to care for them during these holiday periods. The number of places required for respite during the holidays was estimated to be 25. In the summer of 1998 an agreement was reached between staff and management in the three residential units referred to by the Deputy that each would operate on a rotational basis to provide the necessary respite during the holiday breaks. Therefore, in 1998 two of these units remained opened in the summer and Christmas periods and the other unit is to remain open for the summer break this year.</P>
      <P>Funding has been made available this year towards the provision of a continuous 52 week service in all three units referred to by the Deputy to meet the increasing needs of residents and by doing so helping to alleviate any hardship experienced by families unable to provide care at home. Discussion on the full implementation of this service is ongoing and I understand that a further meeting in relation to this matter will be held between the board and staff in July.</P>

    <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the total national number of people awaiting treatment fell during the first quarter of this year. I have undertaken important initiatives in regard to the waiting list initiative since coming into office. These include an allocation of £20 million to agencies for the treatment of patients on waiting lists; the provision of £9 million to services for older people; the provision of £2 million to selected accident and emergency services; the issuing of a new policy circular and guidelines to all relevant agencies regarding the way in which the waiting list should be operated. I am confident that these initiatives will continue to have a significant positive impact on waiting lists for the remainder of the year, and more importantly that waiting times for public patients will be reduced.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the timing for the commencement and completion of construction for the development depends on several variable factors which are difficult to assess accurately in advance and it is not possible for me, therefore, to give a precise timetable for the project.

      <P>The total number of beds formally approved under Article 8 of the Health Services (In-patient) Regulations, 1991, as at 25 January 1999, in Naas General Hospital is 94. On completion of the development Naas General Hospital will have a total bed complement of 189 beds including 25 day beds and 30 beds in the psychiatric unit provided under the phase one development at the hospital. The designation of hospital beds in medical, surgical and other categories is a matter for the management of the hospital concerned and is subject to service demand.</P>

      <P>On 29 April this year I launched an agreement which had been reached between health boards and the Association of Optometrists Ireland for the provision of eye examinations. One of the aims of this agreement is to reduce the waiting periods for such services. Under the terms of the agreement, which comes into force today, adults who are eligible for services under the general medical services scheme may attend any participating contracting optometrist from the published panel of the health board for an eye examination.</P>
      <P>While it is not expected that a person will attend for an eye examination more than once every two years, it is recognised in the agreement that different age cohorts may be subject to different frequencies, as may patients whose condition requires monitoring.</P>

      <P>The drugs payments scheme is being introduced with effect from 1 July 1999 and will replace the two existing community drugs schemes, the drug refund scheme and the drug cost subsidisation scheme. The new scheme is not means tested and is open to everyone. Under the drug payment scheme, a person will not have to pay more than £42 in any calendar month for approved prescribed drugs, medicines and appliances for use by that person or his or her dependants in that month. For the purposes of the scheme, dependants includes spouse and children under 18 years. A dependant with a physical disability or a mental handicap or illness who cannot maintain himself or herself fully, who is ordinarily resident in the family home and who does not hold a current medical card, may be included in the family expenditure under this scheme, regardless of age. Dependants over 18 years and under the age of 23 years who are in full time education are also included. The upper age limit is in keeping with recent family law legislation. A person over the age of 18 years, and who is not in full time education, or a person who is over the age of 23 years and is in full time education, can of course avail of the drug payment scheme in his or her own right or may be eligible for a medical card.</P>

      <P>The provision of services for Alzheimer patients in Dublin's northside is a matter in the first instance for the Eastern Health Board. I understand from the Eastern Health Board that there are two day centres on the northside which specially cater for those suffering from Alzheimers &ndash; St. Gabriels, Edenmore and Sybil Hill, Raheny &ndash; both of which are funded or part-funded by the Eastern Health Board.</P>
      <P>In community care areas six and seven which covers the northside of the city, the department of psychiatry of old age offers a range of services for patients who develop a functional mental illness and Alzheimers. In excess of 100 beds are available to the psychiatry of old age services and there is also access to a limited number of contract private nursing home places. There is also access to psychiatric beds to patients under 65 with a mental illness and Alzheimers through their catchment area service.</P>
      <P>At present there is no dedicated old age psychiatry services in community care area eight, which covers parts of Dublin's northside and north County Dublin. The general psychiatric service based on St. Ita's Hospital offers a range of acute and residential places to patients suffering from a mental illness and Alzheimers. Patients over 65 with Alzheimers who exhibit no behaviour disturbance are also catered for in the Eastern Health Board's hospitals and homes for older people on the northside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The health board is conscious of the need to develop services for older persons and in this regard adopted a ten year action plan for services for older persons including Alzheimers in June <Col N="958" /> 1998. Included in this action plan was a recommendation to establish two further dedicated departments of psychiatry of old age in Dublin north city and county. In addition the board has a target of providing a number of community units for older people on the northside of the city.</P>
    <P>Later this year the board will produce a five year development plan for the mental health service which will include plans for the further development of services for patients under 65 with a mental illness and Alzheimers. All service developments will be carried out in consultation with the Alzheimers Society of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Additional resources have been provided in 1999 towards the improvement of old age psychiatry services in south Dublin and the board's plans for the further development of this service, including north Dublin is being considered in the light of the availability of resources.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the concern of parents, and especially elderly parents, of adults with an intellectual disability in relation to access to the residential services. Since my appointment as Minister for Health I have allocated additional revenue and capital funding amounting to £53 million, increasing to £59 million, in 2000 to enhance the level of services, and in particular residential and respite services, available to persons with an intellectual disability and their families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the payment of a disability allowance to those who meet the eligibility criteria, the State meets the cost of both the day and residential services provided for persons with an intellectual disability. Admission to residential services is based on identified criteria of need agreed by the regional mental handicap co-ordinating committees which take account of the personal circumstances of the individuals assessed as requiring placement in those services. The financial circumstances of the individuals concerned are not a factor in this assessment. There is therefore no quota of places for persons with intellectual disability who would have personal means or a trust fund. While there may be individual cases where a contribution is made, either from a trust fund or other sources, to the cost of the provision of residential care, the principle of equality, based on assessment of need and the prioritisation of those needs, in accessing these services is one of <Col N="959" /> the key factors taken into account by all health boards and service providers in this area.</P>
    <P>I have clearly demonstrated my commitment and that of the Government, to meeting the identified needs, as set out in the Assessment of Need 1997-2001, of persons with an intellectual disability and the ongoing development of these services will remain a top priority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 153 and 158 together.</P>
      <P>On 28 May 1999, the member states of the European Union were informed by the Commission via the rapid alert system of the contamination with dioxins of certain foodstuffs produced in Belgium. Contamination had been discovered in poultry feed, poultry and egg products. Concern was then expressed about the possible contamination of other food products.</P>
      <P>On June 3 and 4 1999 respectively, the Commission adopted two decisions, 1999/363/EC and 1999/368/EC, on protective measures with regards to contamination by dioxins of (i) poultry and egg products and of (ii) products intended for human or animal consumption derived from bovine animals and pigs. These decisions require Belgium to prohibit the placing on the market of a range of listed products unless the products are not derived from holdings put under restriction by the Belgian authorities or the results of analysis indicate that the products are not contaminated with dioxin. The Belgian authorities were obliged to inform the Commission of the competent authorities to certify that produce is in compliance with these decisions.</P>
      <P>Because of the possible risk to public health and because of our legal obligation under Commission decisions, the Department of Agriculture and Food detained suspect produce throughout the country and banned further imports. The Department of Health and Children banned the sale of suspect produce and issued an alert to retailers and health boards to withdraw and detain possible contaminated products on retail shelves. Consumers were advised to avoid eating Belgian products until clearance was received from the European Union.</P>
      <P>There were certain delays in the European Commission receiving information from the Belgian authorities on certifying authorities, as required under the Commission decisions. On Friday 11 June, the Irish authorities received clarification on this issue and the information was immediately provided to Irish importers and retailers. A certification procedure is now in place for products under veterinary control, as set down in Commission Decision 1999/390/EC and products are being released onto the market as soon as the certification is cleared by the relevant Department.</P>
      <P>Products not under veterinary control and detained since the adoption of the Commission decisions are being released by this Department on production of appropriate certification. Future import controls of these products are currently being discussed at EU level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Prior to this information on certification, chocolate and chocolate fillings imported from Belgium for use by certain Irish handmade chocolate manufacturers were detained. The industry was very concerned because the short shelf life of these raw materials means that suspect product would be past its &ldquo;best-before&rdquo; date and there<Col N="961" /> fore unfit for use if certification did eventually prove that product complied with the Commission decisions. Information on certification resolved this difficulty.</P>
    <P>On 22 June 1999, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Brian Cowen, signed the Health (Prevention of Danger to Public Health) Regulations 1999 (S.I. No. 186 of 1999)<b>. </b>These regulations placed further restrictions on the import and sale of products of Belgian origin suspected of dioxin contamination.</P>
    <P>Ongoing monitoring of the situation is continuing and both Departments and the Food Safety Authority of Ireland are operating in close association. The Deputies will understand that these precautions are necessary in the interest of public health and every effort is being made by both Departments concerned to ensure that product with appropriate certification is released onto the market with the minimum of delay.</P>

Additional resources were provided to health boards this year to help improve compliance in this area.</P>
      <P>Promoting a tobacco free society is a priority for myself and my Department. I am currently conducting a fundamental review on smoking and health policy. When this is completed I will bring forward proposals for further measures to protect children. I will be looking in particular at the area of enforcement given the reported prevalence of smoking among school children.</P>

      <P>The pay award for workshop instructors referred to by the Deputy provided for maintenance of the pay linkage with craftsmen &ndash; craftsman rate plus 12.5 per cent and craftsman rate plus 25 per cent. I deeply regret that the initial salary scales which issued from my Department were, inadvertently, incorrectly calculated. As soon as the error came to light it was corrected. The Deputy will appreciate that it is important that staff be remunerated in accordance with correct scales and that any overpayments which were made be reclaimed. However, I have asked each health board to discuss with staff arrangements for recoupment to ensure no financial hardship occurs.</P>

      <Quest>the reason the Government backed an EU Council of Ministers decision in May 1999 to defer for 13 years the implementation of the Working Time Directive with particular reference to junior doctors; the proposals, if any, the Government has to ensure reduced working hours for the 2,500 doctors who work 72 hour shifts and sometimes over 100 hours per week; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that trainee doctors, along with several other groups, were excluded <Col N="963" /> from the provisions of the original Working Time Directive adopted by the EU in 1993. Following adoption of the 1993 directive, the European Commission embarked on a consultative exercise with the sectors concerned and the member states on how a broadly similar level of protection to that provided by the 1993 directive, could be afforded to the excluded groups while taking account of the specific requirements of the industries and services concerned. In the case of hospitals this involved attempting to balance the need for reasonable working hours for doctors while recognising the 24 hour nature of hospital services and the need to guarantee continuity of care for patients. In Ireland's case we needed a framework which would allow us to move from our present position of having a maximum working week of 65 hours for junior doctors to the 48 hours contained in the 1993 directive. My Department has been concerned to achieve this in a manner which would not endanger patients and which would not throw the entire medical workforce career structure into chaos by recruiting large numbers of trainee doctors for whom there would be no reasonable prospect of securing career posts. The Deputy will be aware that the future structure of the hospital medical staffing is already being looked at by the medical manpower forum.</P>
      <P>The European Commission published its proposals for an amending directive to the 1993 directive in November 1998. The Commission's proposals have been the subject of discussion in a social questions working group under the aegis of the Labour and Social Affairs Council. A significant number of the member states felt that the Commissions' proposals were impractical and could not be implemented in the timescale proposed. The German Presidency then had to work on compromise proposals which might be acceptable to a majority of the member states. These proposals involved a total transition period of 12 years with a gradual reduction in maximum weekly working hours to 48 hours over the period. The United Kingdom proposed a 13 year transition period to reach the objective. In the interests of securing unanimity at the Council this proposal was accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have to point out that we have progressively reduced hospital doctors' working hours over the years. It is the responsibility of local hospital management to roster non consultant hospital doctors taking into account the nature of the clinical service to be provided. The basic working week of all NCHDs is 39 hours. However, they are liable to be rostered to work up to an average of 65 hours per week. The 65 hour week was implemented in 1989 following a Labour Court recommendation and in consultation with the Irish Medical Organisation which represents the interests of NCHDs. A mechanism has been introduced to monitor and control working hours of NCHDs as part of the revised terms and conditions of the NCHD contract of employment <Col N="964" /> effective from 1 January 1997. The first stage of the mechanism was introduced on 1 July 1995 and the complete four stage mechanism to resolve any breach of the Labour Court recommendation has been in place since 1 January 1997. I am not aware that there has been any use made of this mechanism to date.</P>
    <P>The 65 hour week was introduced in 1989-1990 at considerable cost resulting in the recruitment at the time of over 400 additional doctors. The number of junior doctors has continued to grow since then. This growth has resulted in a serious imbalance between the number of these trainee posts and the number of consultant posts. I established the medical manpower forum to address this and associated medical manpower issues. The forum is taking full account of the need to reduce working hours in its deliberations. However, we have to be realistic in how we approach this complex problem. What we have sought from these negotiations is a practical framework to implement the 48 hour week. I believe that we now have a set of proposals which will allow us to reduce doctors' hours in an orderly and progressive fashion without jeopardising standards of patient care or damaging young doctors' reasonable career expectations.</P>
    <P>What was agreed at the Council meeting on 25 May 1999 now goes to the European Parliament for consideration. The eventual final content of the directive is a matter for negotiation between the Council and the Parliament. I do not believe that we need to await the final outcome of the EU's deliberations on the draft directive to begin to put in place the preparatory process required to implement the primary provisions of the legislation. In that regard it is necessary to establish the facts on the ground. Accordingly, it has been agreed following a recent meeting between representatives from my Department, the Health Service Employers Agency and the Irish Medical Organisation that a study should be undertaken which would look at the hours worked by NCHDs. When the findings of the study and the outcome of the medical manpower forum's deliberations are available, it is intended to reach agreement on how to reduce NCHD working hours in a manner that benefits doctors and patients.</P>

      <P>The granting or refusing of planning permission is a matter for planning authorities or An Bord Pleanála on appeal. In considering whether to grant planning permission a planning authority is required to have regard to the proper planning and development of the area including the provisions of the development plan and any directives issued by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. I have not issued any directive or criteria in relation to planning in coastal areas. Therefore, there are no criteria laid down by my Department requiring local authorities to grant planning permission in such areas. The Local Government Act, 1991, requires local authorities, in carrying out their functions, to have regard to the policies of Government Ministers but I am <Col N="966" /> not aware of the policies of any Minister which would require planning authorities to grant planning permission in coastal areas. In any event under the Planning Acts, a planning authority cannot grant a planning permission which would materially contravene its development plan without invoking the statutory procedures for material contravention.</P>

      <P>Except for the rural water programme, my Department does not make annual allocations to local authorities under the water and sewerage services investment programme. This programme is funded on an individual project basis, prioritised by reference to statutory obligations, EU directives, health and safety, environmental impacts and support of economic development. Details of the <Col N="972" /> schemes being advanced under the investment programme and the rural water allocations to county councils for 1999 are available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Increasing housing supply is the key element of the Government's strategy to stabilise the housing market. Measures such as the serviced land initiative, the provision of temporary treatment facilities and the promotion of more sustainable residential densities are all contributing to the acceleration of housing output and will help to underpin continued growth in housing output. The increase of more than 20 per cent in overall housing output in the first four months of 1999 compared to the same period last year represents a positive response to the Government's actions.</P>
      <P>Ensuring the delivery of more affordable house types, with better design and high quality, are essential elements of the Government's strategy on affordability. The recently launched local authority affordable housing scheme involves the provision of additional new houses for low income house purchasers at prices below what is currently available in the market. I am aware of proposals, some ready to commence construction, in a number of areas including Dublin, Cork, Galway, Meath, Mayo, Wexford, Westmeath and Wicklow. Measures to promote a better mix of affordable type units in new developments are also being pursued, and this objective is also being examined in the context of the forthcoming planning and development Bill.</P>
      <P>The provisions of the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1998 have had beneficial effects on the housing market. Following withdrawal of tax incentives for investment in residential property investors are no longer pricing first-time buyers out of the starter home market. As a result of significant reductions in stamp duty levels effected by the Act, increasing numbers of second-hand houses have been coming on the market.</P>
      <P>There is a general consensus that Government action in relation to the housing market has, and will continue to have, very positive effects. House price statistics for the March quarter of 1999 are encouraging. Significantly, for the second quarter in succession, there has been little change in the average price of second-hand houses in Dublin, which has tended to be a leading market indicator in recent years. This positive trend of moderating house price increases is also reflected in other house price indices produced by mortgage lenders and others.</P>

      <P>Ireland's target under the Kyoto Protocol is to limit the increase in emissions of greenhouse gases to 13 per cent above 1990 levels in the period 2008-2012. A number of measures are currently in place to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions in the energy, transport, residential, industrial, agricultural, waste and commercial sectors. These are outlined in detail in Ireland's Second National Communication under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Since the preparation of this report in July 1997, there have been a number of further policy developments which,<i> inter alia</i>, address climate change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the purposes of the preparation of a national greenhouse gas abatement strategy to meet Ireland's commitment under the Kyoto Protocol, a consultancy study on the Limitation and <Col N="982" /> Reduction of CO2 and other Greenhouse Gas Emissions in Ireland was published by my Department and the Department of Public Enterprise in June 1998, as a basis for public consultation. Copies of the Second National Communication and the consultancy study are available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    <P>A discussion forum was held last autumn for interested bodies, organisations and individuals who made submissions on the consultancy report. The submissions made, and the wide-ranging discussion at the forum, are being utilised in the development of the national strategy, now being prepared for Government approval as a priority. The strategy will provide a framework for achieving Ireland's Kyoto commitment, building on existing measures and developing additional policies and measures for implementation in all sectors in a cost effective and environmentally sound manner. Measures at national level will be complemented by further common and coordinated policies and measures within the EU to assist the community and its member states in meeting the commitments of the Kyoto Protocol.</P>
    <P>Negotiations are ongoing at UN level on all aspects of the principles, rules, modalities and guidelines for emissions trading and the other flexible mechanisms provided for in the protocol. Under the Buenos Aires plan of action decided at the last ministerial meeting under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, agreement on these will be sought at the ministerial meeting in 2000. No approaches have been made to other countries at this stage with a view to trading emission surpluses.</P>
    <P>I have established a consultation group on greenhouse gas emissions trading to assess this option as it affects Irish policy formation, including the scope for development of a domestic emissions trading market and the implications for Ireland of an international trading regime. Relevant Government Departments and appropriate external interests and expertise are represented on the group.</P>

      <P>Occupational pensions arrangements are trust-based; the trustees of the individual schemes are responsible to the scheme members in relation to matters such as choice of provider, investment of funds, etc. On this point, I would draw the Deputy's attention to the Government's acceptance in principle of the Pensions Board's recommendation in its report on the National Pensions Policy Initiative, Securing Retirement Income, which related to the introduction of a new pensions savings vehicle, the Personal Retirement Savings Account. This will be a simplified pensions savings mechanism which, it is hoped, will encourage more providers to enter the market-place and allow greater choice for the consumer. The legislative framework for the introduction of PRSAs will form part of the new pensions Bill referred to above.</P>

      <P>The aim of the national fuel scheme is to assist householders who are on long-term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs. A payment of £5 per week, £8 per week in smokeless zones, is paid to eligible households for 26 weeks from mid-October to mid-April.</P>
      <P>The standard rate of fuel allowance was last increased in 1985. However, fuel price inflation has been much lower than general price inflation at approximately 7 per cent in total over the 12 years between 1985 and 1998. Increasing the basic fuel allowance by this amount would cost £2.6 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Expenditure on the national fuel scheme has increased by approximately 20 per cent in the last five years from £37.5 million in 1993 to £44.9 mill<Col N="984" /> ion in 1998. This year a sum of £46.4 million has been provided in the Estimates for the scheme. It is estimated that increasing the basic allowance by £1 per week would cost an additional £7.6 million.</P>
    <P>Any change in the rate of payment would have significant cost implications and could only be considered in a budgetary context, taking increases in primary weekly payment rates into account. In that regard, substantial increases in all the social welfare primary payments ranging from £3 to £6 per week for a single person and from £5 to £9 for a couple became effective from last month.</P>

      <P>My Department has, since 1996, operated the scheme of community support for older people, the purpose of which is to provide funding for initiatives to improve the security and social support of vulnerable older people. This funding is provided by way of grant to voluntary groups and organisations such as St.</P>
      <P>Vincent de Paul, Neighbourhood Watch and Community Alert who have undertaken to identify those elderly people in need of assistance under the scheme.</P>
      <P>Under the scheme grants are available for: small-scale physical security equipment such as strengthening of doors and windows, window locks, door  chains and locks and security lighting; and socially-monitored alarm systems, such as the &ldquo;pendant&rdquo; or &ldquo;button&rdquo; alarm system which is operated via the telephone and is worn around the wrist or neck.</P>
      <P>To qualify for assistance under the scheme, older people, aged 65 or over, must: be living alone or be living in households made up exclusively of older people, or of older and other people who are dependent and vulnerable and be unable to install or purchase the security equipment or alarm system themselves.</P>
      <P>In general, grants under the scheme cover from 50 per cent to 90 per cent of the once-off cost of the purchase and/or installation of the necessary security equipment. While the maximum grant available under this scheme is 90 per cent of the total cost, it is not possible to guarantee this level of funding in respect of all applications received under the scheme.</P>
      <P>Since its inception in 1996 a total of £12.6 million has been made available for this scheme and up to the end of 1998 some 56,000 people had been assisted by the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Applications under the 1999 scheme were invited recently from voluntary organisations and community groups. The closing date for receipt <Col N="985" /> of applications is 16 July 1999 and it is understood no application has been received, to date, under the scheme from any voluntary group or organisation in County Waterford on behalf of the person named in the Deputy's question.</P>
    <P>It is expected that a large number of applications will again be received in 1999 at the regional offices of the Department. Any application received before the closing date from a voluntary organisation or group on behalf of the person named in the Deputy's question will be processed as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Voluntary organisations and community groups will be advised of the result of their applications once all applications under the scheme have been processed.</P>

      <P>A key priority of the Government's action programme is that the old age contributory pension will be increased to £100 per week by the year 2002. This year's increase of £6 a week in the maximum personal rates for all pensioners aged 66 and over means that, in its first two budgets, the Government has moved half way towards fulfilling this commitment.</P>
      <P>Reduced rate contributory pensions are paid in cases where a claimant has less than the required standard of social insurance contributions. The level of pension payable in such cases is set as a percentage of the maximum payment. In the case of the old age contributory pension scheme, a yearly average of 48 contributions is required in order to qualify for the maximum rate of pension. However, a person with a reduced yearly average can qualify for a reduced rate of pension. For example, a person with a yearly average of between ten and 14 contributions would be entitled to a pension which is set at 50 per cent of the maximum rate. Accordingly, the level of increases provided to recipients of reduced rate contributory pensions is determined by the percentage relationship between the reduced rate and the appropriate maximum rate of payment. This is the system which has operated since the introduction of the old age contributory pension scheme and it applies equally where the general increases are provided on a percentage basis or, as has been the case in recent years, on a monetary basis.</P>
      <P>Some 98,800 pensioners on full-rate old age contributory and retirement pensions received an increase of £6 in their weekly personal rates of payment, with effect from the beginning of June, while a further 50,580 pensioners on reduced rates received <i>pro rata </i>increases, at a total cost of £44.5 million on a full year basis, £26.5 million in 1999. The additional cost of increasing all reduced rate old age contributory and retirement pensions by £6 a week would amount to £2.11 million on a full year basis, £1.26 million in 1999.</P>
      <P>In all, there are some 61,600 people receiving reduced rate contributory payments, including widow's and widower's contributory pensioners aged under and over 66. The additional cost of providing the same increases as apply in the case of those in receipt of the maximum rates of those payments would amount to £4.17 million on a full year basis, £2.49 million in 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of future increases in social welfare payments, including those for pensioners on <Col N="987" /> reduced rates, are matters to be examined in a budgetary context in the light of available resources and having regard to the Government's other priorities.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 191 and 198 together.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the students summer jobs scheme is to provide income support during the summer holiday period for less well-off third level students who are unable to obtain summer work and are disqualified from claiming unemployment assistance.</P>
      <P>The focus of the scheme is on those students who are unable to get summer work and have no other means of support. For this reason, students are required not to undertake other part-time work while participating on the scheme. Students, are of course, free to take up work after participating on the scheme and many do so.</P>
      <P>As in previous years, approved students are allowed to undertake up to 200 hours work on the scheme and earn £600. The scheme was revised in 1999 to exclude September from the period covered by the scheme and to limit to ten the number of students who can be taken on by any one sponsor.</P>
      <P>The closing date for applications for this year's scheme was 25 June and at that date a total of 15,700 students had applied to take part.</P>

      <P>The social insurance system is an important expression of social solidarity both between people generally and the gener<Col N="988" /> ations. The Social Insurance Fund plays a key role in the provision of social protection in Irish society. People, when they are economically active, make contributions to the fund according to their ability to pay and depending on the range of benefits and pensions for which they are covered. These payments fund the pensions of an earlier generation of contributors and also pay benefits to people who are not working due to unemployment or illness. Contributors, accordingly, build up entitlements to various pensions and benefits which are paid to them as of right, without having to undergo a means test.</P>
      <P>The old age, contributory, and retirement pensions operate on a pay-as-you-go system with pension benefits calculated on the basis of a formula fixed in advance and dependent on the average number of contributions over a person's working career. As such, the question of a special once-off or top-up payment does not arise.</P>
      <P>The Department is currently undertaking a detailed review of the contribution conditions applying to the old age, contributory, and retirement pensions including the possibility of using contributions paid prior to 1953. The issues involved are complex and raise fundamental questions regarding the number of contributions, both paid and credited, that a person has, the PRSI actually paid in respect of their contributions and their overall value. Issues of equity and redistribution within the social insurance system also arise to be addressed. This review will be completed later this year.</P>
      <P>In relation to the rate of payment of the old age pension, I would point out that a key priority of this Government's programme is to increase this to £100 by 2002. We are well on the way to achieving this target rate with the £11 total increase over the last two budgets.</P>

      <P>The payment of pay-related benefit, PRB, in addition to disability benefit was phased out with effect from April 1992 as part of the policy of directing available resources towards those most in need by increasing the basic rate of payment, rather than through pay-related supplements. This policy is broadly in line with the recommendations of the Commission on Social Welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result of the adoption of this policy, the basic rate of disability benefit has been signifi<Col N="989" /> cantly increased since the phasing out of PRB. While the cost of living index has risen by 15.7 per cent in this period, the rate of disability benefit has increased by 47 per cent, i.e. three times the rate of inflation. In addition, the rate of disability benefit has increased by substantially more than average industrial earnings, which have increased by 30 per cent in the period up to December 1998, latest figures available.</P>
    <P>It should also be noted that the improvements in the basic rate of disability benefit are of benefit to all recipients. This contrasts with the payment of PRB, which was only paid in the case of a minority of recipients, in the region of 20 per cent.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, I am satisfied that this widely supported policy approach, continues to be the most appropriate one for this scheme.</P>

      <P>When the fuel schemes were rationalised in 1988 persons in receipt of a fuel allowance under the urban fuel scheme were allowed to retain their entitlement provided they continued to satisfy the conditions for the urban fuel scheme.</P>
      <P>The person concerned qualified for a fuel allowance as a recipient of widow's contributory pension under the former urban fuel scheme. She continued to receive a fuel allowance while payment of her widow's contributory pension continued.</P>
      <P>She qualified for an old age contributory pension with effect from 6 February 1998 and as a result she ceased to satisfy the conditions for the automatic payment of fuel allowance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is committed to protecting the family through political, economic, social and other measures which will support the stability of the family. A range of family income support programmes are provided by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. These include child benefit, widow/er's payments, payments for families who are out of work through illness or unemployment, one-parent family payment for parents rearing children alone, family income supplement and carer's allowance. These support programmes have been developed over the years to respond to the different personal circumstances which families may experience during their life cycles. The overall objective is to ensure that individuals and families, whatever their personal marital circumstances have recourse to income support for themselves and their dependants in times of need.</P>
      <P>The policy focus in Families First is on support for parents and their children in the same inclusive way. Families First is designed to make families central to policy making and the delivery of services. The need for formal guidelines as to what constitutes a family or in relation to how a family is to be defined in the sense suggested by the Deputy's question does not arise. The promotion of continuity and stability in family life, which is particularly important for children, and support for marriage, which for the vast majority of people is their expression of commitment to continuity and stability in their relationships, are important features of Families First. The policy approach recognises that the best interests of children are the paramount concern in all circumstances and that a child's basic need for love, security and stability can be met in a variety of family situations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The prevention of marital breakdown and policies to address the effect of divorce on families are key priorities. In line with this pro-family approach the family affairs unit has been set up in my Department and the Government has allocated £6.5 million this year specifically for the development of family services compared to only £1.5 million in 1997. This includes a radically improved £2.1 million support programme for the voluntary organisations providing marriage, child <Col N="991" /> and bereavement counselling, compared to only £900,000 in 1997.</P>
    <P>The family mediation service is now expanded nationwide with services available from eight regional centres with an allocation of £1.2 million in 1999 compared to only £300,000 in 1997 &ndash; an increase of 300 per cent.</P>
    <P>The expansion of the family and community services resource programme includes some 50 centres this year.</P>
    <P>As well as a families research programme, pilot projects to improve information services locally for families, and a parenting awareness programme are to be introduced later this year.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, access to many education, training and employment programmes is available to both men and women who are in receipt of unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance for a specified period or who are signing-on for credited contributions. There are also a number of programmes available to men and women alike for which there is no live register attachment and female participation rates in those courses has increased significantly in recent years.</P>
      <P>In accordance with a commitment given in Partnership 2000, a working group has been established to review the question of access by women to labour market opportunities with a view to increasing gender equity and improving job opportunities. This group is chaired by my Department and includes representatives from the National Women's Council of Ireland, the Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the Irish Business and Employers Confederation, the Irish Farmers' Association, the Congress Centres for the Unemployed, FÁS, the Employment Equality Agency, Aontas and relevant Government Departments. It is expected that the report of the group will be completed later this summer and the Government will then consider what action needs to be taken on foot of the recommendations in this report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government also recognises that women who leave the workforce to undertake family responsibilities in the home face difficulties in maintaining their social insurance record and has given a commitment under An Action Programme for the Millennium &ldquo;to provide the <Col N="992" /> mechanism to allow women, who take time out for family reasons, to continue contributions for pension purposes&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>However, certain measures have already been introduced to address this problem. Special arrangements are already in place to help people who work in the home to qualify for an old age contributory pension. From 6 April 1994 years spent out of the workforce caring either for children up to the age of six, increased to age 12 from 6 April 1995, or incapacitated people may be disregarded in calculating the person's yearly average number of contributions for old age contributory pension purposes. A maximum of 20 years may be disregarded in this way.</P>
    <P>Provision is also made for the award of credited contributions in the year in which a person commences or ceases to be a homemaker. In addition, earnings of up to £30 per week where a person is engaged in part-time employment outside the home are also permitted. It is estimated that up to 250,000 people could ultimately benefit under the above arrangements.</P>
    <P>I would also point out that in November 1997 I introduced new <i>pro rata </i>pensions so that people who pay social insurance for a reasonable period of time will qualify for an old age contributory pension. A yearly average of between 15 and 19 contributions gives a pension of 75 per cent of the maximum rate, while an average of between ten and 14 gives a pension of 50 per cent. To qualify a person also needs to have a minimum of 260 paid contributions. This measure is of benefit to many women who have gaps in their PRSI records due to working in the home looking after a child, or caring full time for an elderly or incapacitated person.</P>
    <P>In line with its stated commitment, the Government accepts that more work needs to be done in this area. My Department is now considering the issue on a three-fold basis. First, the issue is being examined in the context of the general review of the qualifying conditions for the old age, contributory, and retirement pensions which, it is hoped, will be completed shortly. Second, an in-depth examination of the provisions of the homemakers scheme will also be undertaken by the Department, later this year. This examination will consider the present disregard arrangements and alternatives such as the award of credited contributions, the question of retrospection, and the cost of any change to the present arrangements.</P>
    <P>Finally, the question of pension provision, both social welfare and occupational, is being considered by the Department in the context of the Pensions Board report on the national pensions policy initiative, NPPI. In their report &ndash; Securing Retirement Income &ndash; the Pensions Board recommended that occupational pension coverage targets also include specific targets for increased coverage of women in both employed and self-employed areas.</P>
    <P>The board considered that the proposed introduction of personal retirement savings accounts, <Col N="993" /> PRSAs, would greatly facilitate the position of women with broken employment records due to child care and other responsibilities. The working group, chaired by my Department, which was set up to examine issues relating to the introduction of PRSAs, is making good progress. The outcome of the group's deliberations will be reflected in the comprehensive Pensions Bill which I hope to publish early in 2000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that Ennis Friary was included in my Department's overall list of capital projects which were to be funded under the Operational Programme for Tourism, OPT, 1994-1999. The proposed works at this 13th century urban friary were to the vaulted sacristy and latrine tower to the east of the friary site and, while primarily conservation in nature, the works were also to include an enhancement of the tourism product at the friary in accordance with the requirements of the OPT. Thus, the main objective of the works were to allow for the housing indoors of the magnificent McMahon and Creagh tombs, with their stone panels of exceptional quality which have deteriorated in recent years due to atmospheric pollution. In addition, however, it was proposed to include a first floor exhibition space over the vaulted sacristy, and the intention here was that the space would be used to sensitively explain the story of the links between the Franciscan Order and the town of Ennis over some 800 years.</P>
      <P>In preparation for the carrying out of these capital works, an archaeological investigation of the proposed site was carried out in the period April to June 1998. At their request, I then met a delegation from a local group, Oidhreacht na hInse, at Ennis Friary on 18 July 1998 during which I explained my Department's proposals for the site; emphasised that they were only preliminary in nature; and undertook to take full regard of the groups own views in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In response, the representatives of Oidhreacht na hInse expressed a number of concerns about my Department's preliminary proposals at the site meeting itself, and followed this up with a detailed written response which was submitted to my Department in August 1998. In summary, the group indicated their opposition to the construction of any new building at the friary on the grounds, <i>inter alia</i>, that it would profoundly alter the view of the friary and would be entirely out of sympathy with it. The group accepted that the relocation of the stonework to a protected indoor environment is the proper responsibility of <Col N="994" /> Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department, and they suggested that adaptation of the adjacent nineteenth century stables would be the solution to this problem.</P>
    <P>Following on from the site meeting and the subsequent submission of the written response from Oidhreacht na hInse, I requested the architectural service of Dúchas to examine all options which might meet the concerns expressed by Oidhreacht na hInse. I can assure the Deputy that, subsequently, all options for development within the Ennis Friary site, which would also meet the tourism requirements of the OPT, were considered and exhausted, but that no solution to my satisfaction could be found. Moreover, the Dúchas architectural service advised me that, while the stonework could be housed in the adapted stables adjacent to the friary site, this would have to be in a somewhat fragmented way which was not favoured by them. This, however, is something which I feel needs further consideration and I have asked for a feasibility study to be carried out on the possible adaptation-reconstruction of the stable buildings, notwithstanding the fact that, to my Department's knowledge, the site in question is not for sale at the present time, even if I did consider it suitable for development. I must also inform the Deputy that, as an alternative to any additional works either on the friary site or adjacent thereto, I am seeking specialist advice on the possible preservation of the stonework outdoors on a cyclical treatment basis.</P>
    <P>The position, therefore, is that I have been obliged to remove Ennis Friary from the list for inclusion in the current round of EU funding, since no project at the site could now be completed within the time constraints laid down by the OPT, which requires commitment of funds by end-1999 and full completion by end-2000.</P>
    <P>The process which I have outlined above has been a rather lengthy one, but I believe it has generated a worthwhile debate both within my own Department and with local conservation interests on alternative strategies for the protection and conservation of national monuments. I am happy to assure the Deputy that, notwithstanding the de-listing of this project from the OPT, I am committed to providing whatever funds are necessary for the proper protection of the stonework at the friary once the outstanding matters which I have cited above have been addressed and considered by me.</P>
    <P>I am, however, pleased to also inform the Deputy that the funds which I had allocated to the Ennis Friary project have been re-directed to a major upgrading of the monastic site of St. Senan at Scattery Island, Kilrush, County Clare. Following on the construction of a new pier at the Island last year, the additional works now under way include the re-surfacing of all pathways on the island; additional signage and information panelling to provide a number of heritage trails on the Island; upgrading of the area off the pier; consolidation works to the derelict village on the Island; the eventual provision of a very <Col N="995" /> modest guide service building on the island itself, subject to environmental considerations being fully met; and the upgrading of my Department's visitor centre at the marina in Kilrush town. I should also inform the Deputy that work on the construction of a new archaeological trail at Mooghaun Fort, Newmarket-on-Fergus, County Clare, is now well under way and that I will be opening this new tourism facility during National Heritage Week in September.</P>

      <P>I believe that the European Communities (Natural Habitats) Regulations, 1997, (S.I. No. 94 of 1997), combined with more general EU and national provisions, provide a valid legal basis for ensuring protection for a site from the time it is first publicly proposed as an SAC. However, in order to remove any possible ambiguity in this context, I have proposed, in the Wildlife (Amendment) Bill which I have published today, an amendment to the regulations which will clearly provide, by means of an amendment to the definition of European Site, that protection for SACs applies in all instances from the time of notification of the proposed designation.</P>

      <P>The equal opportunities childcare programme, which is the responsibility of my Department, provides a budget for the two year period 1998-99 to support the development of child care facilities. The programme is designed primarily to support local communities who are helping parents who have child care responsibilities to access employment, education and training opportunities. It is targeted primarily at community based projects in disadvantaged areas but also has an equal opportunities dimension to assist women and men generally to meet their child care needs.</P>
      <P>The equal opportunities childcare programme is part-funded by the EU and has a budget of approximately £6 million, over £4 million Exchequer and £2 million EU funding, for the period 1998-99. The equal opportunities childcare programme is administered by Area Development Management Limited on behalf of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To date the programme has funded capital infrastructure for 106 projects, the salary costs of senior child care workers for 25 community-based projects and a financial contribution towards <Col N="997" /> eight employer consortia demonstration child care projects involving 21 employers. The allocation of these funds was related to the overall objectives of the programme and made on foot of applications received by June 1998 in response to a national media advertising campaign.</P>
    <P>Additional funding from the European Social Fund has recently been provided for the programme. It is a requirement that European Social Fund moneys are used for training and development purposes. They cannot be used for capital initiatives. Accordingly, the additional funds were provided to the equal opportunities childcare programme, for example, to assist the up-skilling of personnel working in the child care area. No additional funding was available for capital purposes.</P>
    <P>Applications to my Department for assistance with capital projects can only be considered in the context of the allocations for child care in the budget for 2000.</P>
    <P>With regard to future support for child care the Government established an interdepartmental committee on childcare to evaluate, cost and prioritise the child care proposals in the reports of the expert working group on childcare, the Commission on the Family and the National Forum for Early Childhood Education in addition to the Government's child care proposals in An Action Programme for the Millennium. The interdepartmental committee is due to report by August.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>Firstly, I would like to remind the Deputy that recruitment to the prison service is by way of open competition which is conducted by the Civil Service and Local Appointment Commission, which is an independent body and as such I have no involvement in the selection process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, having made inquiries into this matter, I understand that normally the number of applications received far exceeds that required to fill the vacancies advertised and it is not practical to interview everyone. For this reason the Civil Service and Local Appointment Commissioners use a shortlisting process to select a group for interview, having regard to the nature of the job, the number of vacancies, current and projected, and the skills and experience of candidates. Shortlisting is typically based on an assessment of <Col N="998" /> the application forms by an expert board having regard to the requirements of the position.</P>
    <P>In this case, 116 applications were received; 94 of these were deemed eligible and satisfied the qualification requirements of the competition regulations. Having examined all application forms in turn and having assessed the relative merits of each application against the criteria, the board recommended that 28 of the 94 be invited for interview.</P>
    <P>There are currently seven vacancies for carpenters in the prison service; in recommending that the 28 applicants be invited to attend to interview, the board took account of the current and future vacancy situation in the grade over the next 18 months.</P>

      <P>I am informed that the operation of gaming machines as defined in the Gaming and Lotteries Act, 1956, has been illegal in the Dublin area, with the exception of Skerries and Balbriggan, since part three of the Act was rescinded by the local authorities some years ago.

However, in this instance I understand a case was made that the person concerned, who is not a transition year student, would benefit from the extended period and the Garda authorities agreed to this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position with regard to full time employment is that clerical staff in the Garda area are civil servants recruited through open compe<Col N="1001" /> titions held from time to time by the Civil Service Commission. The Civil Service Commission is committed to a policy of equal opportunity and it is also their policy to establish parallel panels of disabled candidates. I understand that the person concerned has been made aware of the recruitment process.</P>

Accordingly, as Minister, I may not direct the board in how it carries out its statutory functions. The board, however, has informed me that it has no plans at present to open additional law centres, but the matter will be kept under review. In the circumstances the use of moneys held in the funds of suitors for the purpose of opening additional law centres does not arise at this time.</P>

      <P>1 would refer the Deputy to my reply to Parliamentary Question Nos. 61, 74 and 83 of 15 June 1999.</P>
      <P>The courts are, subject only to the Constitution and the law, independent in the exercise of their judicial functions and I, as a member of the Executive, am precluded from intervening directly.</P>
      <P>Under our legal system, the law provides generally for maximum penalties for criminal offences. The law enables the Judge to exercise his discretion, within the maximum penalty, by reference to the conclusions he or she has reached after trying the case, hearing all the evidence and assessing the culpability and circumstances of the accused. Our system of recruitment to all levels of the judiciary is based on the concept of bringing in experienced and trained legal</P>
      <P>practitioners and, consequently, judges, on appointment, have a wide knowledge of the law and its application. In so far as consistency of sentencing is concerned, I consider it important to mention that the Criminal Justice Act, 1993, provides that the Director of Public Prosecutions may apply to the court for a review of what appears to the director, to be an unduly lenient sentence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The complex question of sentencing policy was addressed at length by the Law Reform Commission who specifically recommended against the introduction of statutory sentencing guide<Col N="1003" /> lines. Their report pointed out a number of differences of opinion among members of the commission in relation to some of the recommendations in that report which tends to underline the obvious complexities which arise in relation to sentencing policy.</P>
    <P>The Courts and Court Officers Act, 1995, enables me to provide funds for judicial training courses arranged by the Judiciary and, this year, I made £60,000 available to the Judicial Studies Institute, which was established by the Chief Justice for the purposes of judicial training. I understand that the issue of sentencing has been examined by the institute in the context of its training programme.</P>
    <P>I might also mention that section 36 of the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act, 1961, makes provision for meetings of District Court judges to discuss, <i>inter alia</i>, the avoidance of undue divergence in the exercise of the jurisdiction of the court and the general level of fines and penalties. While there is no similar provision in the case of other courts, I understand they hold similar meetings.</P>
    <P>The Sixth Report of the Working Group on a Courts Commission also made reference to the issue of sentencing. The working group suggests that judicial education could be addressed by a judicial standards body in liaison with the Judicial Studies Institute. This new body could, <i>inter alia</i>, provide a monitoring and analytical service on matters such as sentencing along the lines of the Judicial Commission in New South Wales. I am pleased to inform the House, in this regard, that the Chief Justice has established a judicial committee to consider, <i>inter alia</i>, the recommendations made in the working group report and the Judicial Committee met on 19 May 1999.</P>

      <P>The Employment Equality Act, 1998, prohibits discrimination in relation to employment on nine grounds, including age. The Act is comprehensive and deals with all areas relevant to employment including access to employment, conditions of employment, remuneration, promotion and vocational training. The age provisions of the Act apply to persons between the ages of 18 years and 65 years, except in the case of vocational training, where the Act applies to persons over the minimum school leaving age, 15 years at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Act makes it unlawful to apply arbitrary age limits in employment, but permits employers to set maximum recruitment ages which take account of the cost or period of time involved in <Col N="1004" /> training for the job and the need to ensure a reasonable period of effective service prior to retirement. Any maximum recruitment age set by an employer can, in the context of an equality case under the Act, be examined by the Director of Equality Investigations, a new organisation which will be established to provide redress of first instance under the Act, to determine if the age limit set conflicts with the criteria mentioned above.</P>
    <P>The Act also requires the phasing out of age related pay, in all employments where such a practice exists, within three years of the date on which section 29 of the Act, which deals with equal remuneration on non-gender grounds, comes into operation. However, different rates of pay, or different terms and conditions of employment, are permitted, if the difference is based on relative seniority or length of service in a particular post or employment. Existing retirement ages will remain legal as will different treatment based on sound actuarial evidence.</P>
    <P>The target date for implementation of the Act is 1 September 1999.</P>

    <P>(Dr. McDaid): Although Ireland became a signatory to the Council of Europe Anti-Doping Convention, 1989, on 25 June 1992, to date, it has not been ratified. However, today &ndash; 1 July 1999 &ndash; sees the establishment of the statutory Irish Sports Council. The council has been charged with taking such actions, as it considers appropriate, including testing, to combat doping in sport. Ireland's first ever national sports anti-doping programme will become operational under the auspices of the council.</P>
    <P>These initiatives and developments in the field of anti-doping in sport should enable Ireland to ratify the Council of Europe Anti-Doping Convention.</P>
    <P>It is hoped that, if possible, ratification may be concluded during the term of Ireland's forthcoming Presidency of the Council of Europe and, in this regard, I will shortly be consulting with my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, on the matter.</P>
    <P>The Council of Europe Convention on Spectator Violence and Misbehaviour at Sports Events and in particular at football matches was signed on 3 November 1986. While this convention has not yet been ratified by Ireland, the Department of Education in 1996 published a code of practice for safety at sports grounds.</P>

      <P>However, one of the key objectives of the projects strand of the eight to 15 early school leaver initiative, that was introduced in 14 project areas in September 1998, is to test responses to the problem of early school leaving and to identify models of good practice.

      <P>The staffing of primary schools is determined by reference to the enrolment of the <Col N="1009" /> school on 30 September of the previous school year. This is in accordance with guidelines agreed between this Department and the education partners.</P>
      <P>The current staffing of St. Nicholas of Myra national school is a principal and six mainstream class teachers based on an enrolment of 192 as at 30 September 1997. The school also has the services of a shared remedial teacher. The enrolment as at 30 September 1998, on which the staffing for the 1999-2000 school year is based was 189 pupils. This means that the school will retain its existing staffing levels into the 1999-2000 school year.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, there is no basis whereby an additional teacher can be sanctioned for the next school year. The school's enrolment falls well short of the figure of 210 required for the appointment of the seventh assistant teacher.</P>

      <P>The current staffing of Naul national school is a principal and three mainstream class teachers based on an enrolment of 87 as at 30 September 1997. The enrolment as at 30 September 1998, on which the staffing for the 1999-2000 school year is based, was 83 and, unfortunately, does not meet the retention requirement for the third teacher in this school.</P>
      <P>Staffing schedules are issued on an annual basis outlining the appointment and retention figures for assistant teachers for the following school year. The only exception to this staffing schedule arises where a school qualifies for developing school status.

      <P>My Department does not have the statistical information available in relation to the number of children with special educational needs who drop out of the education system early.</P>
      <P>A recent survey carried out by my Department identified an estimated 750 children who left special schools or special classes during the course of the 1996-97 school year and did not take up places in further education or training facilities or in sheltered employment. A total of 370 of these children stayed at home after leaving school. Schools were unable to provide my Department with any information on the remaining children.</P>
      <P>Overall policy in this area is focused on the provision of a continuum of supports ranging from preventive action such as home school liaison, the remedial, resource, guidance and psychological services, additional staff and funds for schools in the disadvantaged areas, staff development and curricular reforms and the forging of improved community links, to second chance education provision under programmes such as youthreach.</P>
      <P>Earlier this month I announced a £4.5 million initiative aimed at keeping pupils in schools up to the end of the leaving certificate. The core approach underpinning this initiative is one of empowering schools to take charge of tackling early school leaving. Under this initiative, schools and VEC schemes with retention rates below the national average will be invited to put forward a retention plan for approval. It is expected that up to 40 schools will participate in the first phase of this initiative and each will receive resources to implement the agreed retention plan sat-in-school initiatives. The number of pupils catered for under the initiative will become known when schools are selected and retention plans are agreed with my Department.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 238, 239 and 240 together.</P>
      <P>My Department does not have the projected statistical information of children entering primary level with special educational needs nor of the number of children of primary school age who have special educational needs.</P>
      <P>A survey carried out in 1993 on behalf of the special education review committee indicated that, at that time, there were approximately 8,000 pupils with specific disabilities in mainstream national schools. This represented 1.5 per cent of the total enrolment at that time.</P>
      <P>The level of support available to pupils with special educational needs depends on the nature and degree of each pupil's special educational need. Support teaching can be in the form of remedial teaching, resource teaching or support from the visiting teacher service. Pupils with specific care needs as a result of a disability may be allocated a special needs assistant either on a full or part-time basis. In addition, schools which have pupils with special educational needs enrolled may apply to my Department for funding for specialist equipment such as computers, radio aids etc.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that arrangements have been put in place to expand the remedial teaching service to cover all schools with a pupilteacher ratio of 10:1 or more with effect from September 1999. I expect that approximately 1,465 remedial teacher posts will be in place in national schools by September 1999.</P>
      <P>At present, there are 42 visiting teachers, 163 resource teachers and 564 special needs assistants providing additional support to pupils with special educational needs at primary level.</P>

      <P>Expenditure on these services amounted to £3.79 million in 1998 which includes both grant allocations and teacher and child care worker salaries.</P>

The Rutland Street pre-school project currently has an enrolment of 92 pupils. There are currently 56 traveller pre-schools in operation catering for approximately 660 traveller children.</P>
      <P>Work on a White Paper on early childhood education is under way in my Department.

      <P>In advance of completion of the White Paper, I recently announced an allocation of £1.2 million for special initiatives on early education. My intention is that this funding will be focused in particular on the development of early education services for children with disabilities.

      <Quest>if his Department will re-examine the staffing position of Gaelscoil Dhún Dealgan, which has been threatened with losing a teacher in view of the fact it was one pupil under the quota for 1998 to 1999; and if he will authorise retention of the existing eight teachers for September 1999 in view of the fact that, with new enrolments, the quota will be exceeded by 26 pupils in 1999.</Quest>

      <P>The staffing of primary schools is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year. This is in accordance with guidelines agreed between this Department and the education partners.</P>
      <P>The current staffing of Gaelscoil Dhún Dealgan is a principal and seven mainstream class teachers based on an enrolment of 189 as at 30 September 1997. The school also has the services of a shared remedial teacher.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The enrolment as at 30 September 1998, on which the staffing for the 1999-2000 school year is based, was 185 pupils. The seventh teaching post would normally be suppressed in these circumstances. However, I am pleased to advise the <Col N="1016" /> Deputy that the school has qualified for the retention of the seventh post under developing school criteria. This post has been sanctioned provisionally pending confirmation of the enrolment of the school as at 30 September 1999.</P>

      <P>The actions being taken and proposed for the north Kildare area at first and second level have been outlined to the Deputy in my responses to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 379, 386 and 387 on 18 May 1999.</P>
      <P>With regard to third level, developments are taking place on an ongoing basis. In the north Kildare area itself, the National University of Ireland, Maynooth, has benefited from a number of major initiatives including £3 million from the scientific and technological education (investment) fund for an extension to the Callan science building which will provide 300 degree places in software engineering and £4.25 million from the recently launched £75 million initiative for the third level sector. This allocation responds to the needs identified by the expert group on skills needs and is a major part of the Governments response to the demand on the education system to ensure a sufficient throughput of young people with skills necessary to meet the emerging skills needs of our economy. It will enable the university to provide 300 additional student places in high technology courses.</P>
      <P>In addition, £7.6 million was allocated under the European Regional Development Fund-Exchequer-private sector capital programmes to provide an additional 800 student places at the Callan science building phase II.</P>

      <P>I announced details of a major new initiative to tackle educational disadvantage. This initiative involves expenditure of £57 million over the next two years and is aimed at addressing educational disadvantage at all levels in the education system. It represents the largest ever programme of its type in this country and it is my intention to build further on this initiative in the years ahead.</P>
      <P>My Department has a number of pilot programmes in place at present, including early intervention measures which are targeted specifically at areas of serious disadvantage. The purpose of the programmes is to test models of response with a view to their possible integration into the mainstream education system after proper evaluation.</P>
      <P>The last general expansion of the disadvantaged areas scheme at primary level took place in 1994. The school referred to by the Deputy applied for inclusion on that occasion but did not rank sufficiently high in terms of priority of need to secure inclusion in the scheme at that time.</P>
      <P>A study of educational disadvantage conducted by the Combat Poverty Agency and the Education Research Centre in 1996 concluded that disadvantaged status should be confined to 16 per cent of the schoolgoing population. The study noted that such status had already been granted to 17 per cent of pupils. As an alternative to extending the disadvantaged areas scheme to additional schools, the study recommended that available resources should be targeted on the most disadvantaged schools.</P>
      <P>The Breaking the Cycle pilot project was subsequently introduced to deliver the sort of targeted support recommended in the study. The operation of this project is being closely monitored by my Department's inspectorate and the project is being evaluated by the Education Research Centre.</P>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that the needs of the school to which he refers will be fully considered in the context of any additional initiatives which may be undertaken to address educational disadvantage.</P>
