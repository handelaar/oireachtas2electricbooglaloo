      <P>My programme manager-special adviser, Mr. Gerry Hickey, is employed on a contract basis in line with the Civil Service Regulation Acts, 1956 and 1958, for the duration of the current Government.</P>
      <P>The terms of reference and the job description of my programme manager-special adviser are no different than those of his predecessors. He advises me on a wide range of matters including administrative, business, social, financial and economic issues. As programme manager he meets other advisers, on a weekly basis and reviews the papers for the Government meeting of that week. With his colleagues, he monitors and reports on the programme for Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach stated in his reply that his programme manager, as part of his responsibilities, meets with another adviser or advisers. Apart from the Tánaiste's programme manager, what other advisers would he meet on a regular and structured basis?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There are only two programme managers, mine and the Tánaiste's. Regarding people who work closely with Ministers, one such person meets with the programme managers every week while they review what is going on and most Ministers have a personal representative for that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the old system of programme managers been reinstated? If I heard the Taoiseach correctly, he said there is one adviser, whom he did not specify, who meets with the two programme managers, and the other advisers to Government Ministers meet on a regular basis.</P>

Does he agree that, if there was any ball of smoke or misrepresentation, it was based on fact as the journalist understood it and as advised by the Taoiseach's spokesperson?

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 to 4, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>Those authorised in my office to have regular dealings with the media are the Government press secretary, the deputy Government press secretary, head of the Government Information Service and press officers in the GIS. From time to time some political and background briefing is done by my special advisers at my request. Inevitably, in the absence of the Government press secretary, the same people may be drafted in as the occasion demands to brief the media on my behalf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="447" /> The Government Information Service and the Government press office are meeting the divisional goals set in my Department's strategy statement. The Government Information Service and the Government press office provide a comprehensive information service on Government policy to the public through the national and international media on my behalf and on behalf of my Department and the Government. Through regular contact with departmental press officers, the GIS ensures there is a co-ordinated approach to media matters.</P>
    <P>The press secretary and his staff are in daily contact with news desks. Political correspondents are briefed daily by the press secretary and deputy press secretary and foreign correspondents receive a weekly briefing. Press releases, statements and speeches are faxed simultaneously to news desks daily and all important speeches and policy documents are posted on the GIS website. Staff of the GIS and departmental press officers are available after hours and at weekends to answer media queries. The press secretary and his staff strive to ensure the business of implementing Government policy is communicated accurately, speedily and efficiently to the media.</P>
    <P>Since 1 January 1999 I have conducted 11 pre-arranged interviews with the media, comprising three for television, two for radio and six with different publications. I have given numerous interviews to radio, television and print media while carrying out official functions at home and abroad in that period, including nine to Irish and international media during my recent visit to the United States.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of the structures outlined by him I wish to ask the Taoiseach about two incidents. I understand the word &ldquo;diverted&rdquo; was used by the Taoiseach's programme manager, Mr. Gerard Hickey, in a telephone conversation with a particular journalist regarding the controversy that arose in relation to the passports for sale scheme and the role played by Mr. Lindzon and Mr. O'Carroll. Was this word used with the Taoiseach's authority or did Mr. Hickey speak prior to consulting the Taoiseach on the matter? On the morning of Sunday, 14 February, some hours after the article appeared in the <i>Sunday Times,</i> a civil servant in the Department's press office &ndash; I do not propose to name him &ndash; gave a briefing to journalists in which substantial clarification was given. Who briefed him?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have answered questions in great detail about the ICC accounts. In so far as it is relevant, discussions took place between my programme manager and the journalist in question. They acted in good faith. Nobody tried to mislead anybody else. I do not know what words were used. Some of the discussions took place before I had knowledge about the issue. As I said in the House, what I was objecting to was that <Col N="448" /> money, like IDA money, should have been used by the party that I lead. There is no need to go back over the second issue that I dealt with on the day.</P>
      <P>As I have said numerous times, I have no difficulty with the lead article in the <i>Sunday Times</i> of 14 February. However, the word used in the trailer throughout Northern Ireland &ndash;&ldquo;banned&rdquo;&ndash; misconstrued totally what I had said in the interview, which was given some days previously. That is not a word anyone familiar with the Northern situation would use as it would straightaway introduce a precondition. I informed the official concerned that I had not used the word &ldquo;banned&rdquo;. I also telephoned Mr. Martin McGuinness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In extensive questions and answers in the House the Taoiseach described the newspaper story which derived from the conversation in which the word &ldquo;diverted&rdquo; was used as a load of lies and a ball of smoke. Subsequent clarification of the events shows that the story was not a lie and was far from being a ball of smoke. Does he now think the programme manager perhaps inadvertently misled the journalist in using the word &ldquo;divert&rdquo; when, in fact, the substance of the published story has been substantiated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to rerun it, but I do not think the story was substantiated or that the impression was given&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The idea that I would try to use my position, if I had any influence with the DPP, to change how he would deal with a witness to a tribunal was what I was extremely annoyed about on that morning. I would not involve myself directly with the DPP to try to decide the immunity of an individual who happened to be a former colleague.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no idea. I have no wish to continue this. To the best of my knowledge, those who work for me and others do their best and the journalists also tend to do their best. If sometimes a story becomes unstuck, so be it. We need not go on about it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>We all get annoyed from time to time and say things we do not intend to say but, in the cold light of day and having reflected on the issue, will the Taoiseach withdraw the terms he used in the Dáil, &ldquo;lies&rdquo; and &ldquo;a ball of smoke&rdquo;, given that the article concerned was substantially accurate and, whereas some of the information may have been inaccurate, the source relied upon for that information was the spokesman for the Taoiseach so that if any misleading was done, it was by the Taoiseach through his spokesman? He should now put the record <Col N="449" /> straight and be decent enough to withdraw the allegation which he made in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy, before he came in to ask the question, was good enough to read the &ldquo;blacks&rdquo; of that day, he would see that I already said that if I was over annoyed that day at anyone, I apologised. I did so on that day. I do not consider now or then that those were the facts but I do not intend to go on about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the case that the reference to IDA funds did not appear in the story? It was a comment on radio. Is the Taoiseach disowning the use of the term &ldquo;divert&ldquo;? Why is he still saying the story was not substantiated when the allegation was that the funds were diverted and his term was &ldquo;transferred&rdquo;, which I accept? Funds were transferred from the investment account of the person who was the beneficiary of the passport to a Fianna Fáil account in the Taoiseach's name and that of the former Taoiseach for Fianna Fáil purposes? Is that not the fact? How is that story then not substantiated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The way something is put in the cold light of day and the way it is put on another occasion, as Deputy Rabbitte would appreciate, are often two very different things. How the story was put on that day was very much as if money, like IDA money, was diverted into a Fianna Fáil account. What happened was that a member of our national executive, trying to assist the party, had gone around looking for donations and a person had given a donation to the party which was transferred into the Fianna Fáil account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>It came from the investor. It had nothing to do with the member of the party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It came from a joint account, if the Deputy will recall, which was held in the two&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>No. He opened the account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>He did, but it was a joint account which was transferred on. It was a donation. Perhaps if I had known that this person even had made an application, I would have had a row about it but, as it happened, it still is a loan in the Department's records. What happens in due course is neither here nor there. I could go on and look into what happened to the investment afterwards which is a far more interesting story. That aspect is being examined by Forfás or one of the State agencies. The Deputy is correct in saying that there was no great substance in the newspaper article but I was annoyed by two things which were said that day on the &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; radio programme, which is listened to by one million people, and which were not true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the case that the member of Fianna Fáil concerned said the money belonged to the investor? None of it was his money. Is it <Col N="450" /> not the case that the account was expressly opened for the purpose of transferring money to the Fianna Fáil Party in return for the subsequent issue of a passport? Is this not the aspect which the Taoiseach ought to repudiate and condemn? This man was mainly involved in passport brokering and it has never been established if this was a habitual practice? Did it happen when my party was in Government and when the Taoiseach's party was previously in Government? Was it part and parcel of applying for a passport under the scheme that this man caused a separate account to be opened for the purpose of transferring payment to any political party?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The individual did seem to be involved in a number of cases but to the best of my knowledge the person who was investing money was a bona fide investor who did not need to invest money in any way other than the way he did. Some of the investment advice he was given may not have been the best advice.</P>

        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> The Taoiseach now accepts that it is highly unethical for a large donation to be accepted by a political party from someone who is looking for a substantial concession from the State, that is, citizenship. The Taoiseach has also said that the money given was a loan. Will he tell the House the time limit for the repayment of the loan by Fianna Fáil?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 and 6 together.</P>
      <P>On 5 June 1998, at my request, my Department forwarded to the Chairman of the Flood tribunal a copy of a letter written under a false name and dated 29 May 1998 which I received on 3 June. On 22 June copies of correspondence from two other Departments arising from their initial examination of the matter referred to in the letter of 29 May were forwarded to the Chairman. On 14 July 1998 copies of letters dated June 1998 but received in July, addressed to the Attorney General and myself, containing an anonymous allegation of impropriety in a planning matter were forwarded by my Department to the Chairman of the Flood tribunal. That tribunal has sought no files from my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 28 August 1998 my Department made available to the Moriarty tribunal copies of its <Col N="451" /> records concerning a particular matter which the solicitor to the tribunal had sought by way of a confidential letter of 13 July 1998. Records in my Department's files relating to naturalisation for investment are replicated on Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform files which have been made available to the Moriarty tribunal. While no order of discovery has been made in respect of my Department's records the Department has signalled to the tribunal the availability of its files if at any time the tribunal wishes to access them. Additionally, on 2 and 4 March 1999 my Department brought to the attention of the tribunal a number of records relating to naturalisation for investment which were among miscellaneous working papers of special projects officers formerly assigned to my Department from the IDA and the CII. These records were delivered to the tribunal on 5 March 1999.</P>
    <P>My Department will of course continue to give any assistance it can to both tribunals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach tell the House if the former Taoiseach, Mr. Haughey, took away copies of files relating to the passports for investment scheme, copies of which are not retained by his Department? Is the Taoiseach aware of whether Mr. Haughey has files which would be of assistance to the tribunal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no idea. The only information I have is contained in the records of my Department, all of which are available. Records relating to passports for investment and naturalisation applications are copies of files which are in the Department of Justice Equality and Law Reform and the Minister has outlined those at length on a number of occasions, including in an Adjournment debate. The miscellaneous files are of no great significance but the archivists on secondment from the gallery working in the Department came across them and they were passed on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>How comprehensive has the search been in his Department to track any record of files that might be or have been there now or in the past and may have been removed to Kinsealy by the former Taoiseach? I draw to the Taoiseach's attention the fact that on 24 February, in an Adjournment debate, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform indicated there were no further files in the Department of the Taoiseach, yet in response to a parliamentary question from me on 10 March the Taoiseach indicated, that, as he has just mentioned, some further files from the former project officers had been located and sent to the tribunal. It is important that a comprehensive trawl is done in the Department and, if possible, records traced, particularly if they show whether files had been removed from the Department by previous holders of the office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="452" />
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>To avoid any confusion about this matter, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform was talking about departmental files. The Department of the Taoiseach has no departmental files on the naturalisation scheme and any copies we had would have been available to the Moriarty tribunal, but the tribunal already has those from the Minister. The other notes I mentioned were found following an extensive trawl, but there are approximately 60 cabinets in the Department relating to previous Taoisigh and they have been trawled by a number of people in the Department, including a number of private secretaries to former Taoisigh who would have a good knowledge of the filing system. A total examination of all the files and records is being done for the archivists which hopefully will be finished mid-year. They have done the examination asked of them and they found in three separate folders 22 loose pages with manuscript notations of <i>aide-mémoire </i>type as well as a small number of miscellaneous type records, some of which are dated 1989 and 1990. I understand the other two are folders containing copies of correspondence about individual naturalisation for investment cases, again of an inquiry/representation type. They contained material information about the operation of the scheme in other countries. There is no suggestion of impropriety of any kind in these pages, files or folders and from the nature of the documents it is highly probable that many of them are replicated in the records already made available to the tribunal but, to be sure, we passed them on to the tribunal anyway.</P>

      <P>As a former Minister of State the Deputy will know that when Ministers leave office they usually take their private records, representational and constituency files with them. That is the normal practice. People may have taken files but there are no departmental files missing and in the extensive check of 60 cabinet loads of records of former Taoisigh nothing was found other than what I mentioned.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 9 together.</P>
      <P>The four sections dealing with Government policy and direction, as set out in my Department's Strategy Statement, are Northern Ireland Division, European and International Affairs Division, Economic and Social Policy Division, and Strategic Management Initiative Division.</P>
      <P>There are seven staff in the Northern Ireland Division, seven in the European and International Affairs Division, 19 in the Economic and Social Policy Division and seven staff in the Strategic Management Initiative Division. Overall, good progress has been made in achieving the goals set out in the strategy statement in each of these divisions.</P>
      <P>Taking into consideration what was set out in my Department's Strategy Statement relating to policy on Northern Ireland &ndash; that there are external factors which influence the prospects of success in achieving our goals &ndash; I am satisfied that we have secured a considerable amount of success. This is in no small way due to the tremendous dedication, commitment and input by the staff involved.</P>
      <P>The four goals of the European and International Affairs Division, as set out in the Strategy Statement, are continuous in their nature. At present the key focus of the division is Ireland's Agenda 2000 negotiations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Economic and Social Policy Division plays <Col N="454" /> a pivotal role in the co-ordination of policy development in conjunction with the Department of Finance and other key Departments to achieve the Government's economic objectives, especially those set out in Partnership 2000. Good progress is being made in achieving these objectives.</P>
    <P>Significant achievements are being made in progressing the strategic management initiative, SMI, in the Civil Service and the wider public service and the SMI divisional goals set out in my Department's Strategy Statement are being achieved. The SMI is a wide-ranging programme for the modernisation of the Civil Service and the public service and as set out in the report, Delivering Better Government, published in May 1996, the key objective is the achievement of an excellent service for all clients and customers.</P>

      <P>The Department is not reviewing that Act in the sense the Deputy means but it has since 1994 been trying to use the strategic management initiative and the Delivering Better Government document to make the Civil Service more efficient and customer friendly. In that sense, it is trying to do so by other means.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 to 25, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I take this opportunity to reiterate our condemnation of the terrible murder of Rosemary Nelson and to offer my sincere sympathies to her family and friends. Many tributes have been paid to Rosemary in recent days, to her outstanding abilities, to her commitment and to her courage in the most difficult circumstances. This is a measure of the regard she was held in by the people of Northern Ireland and internationally.</P>
      <P>It is now of critical importance that those responsible are brought to justice, that the rule of law prevails and is seen to prevail, so that all the people of Northern Ireland can be confident of equal treatment before the law. I noted the unique arrangements that have been made for the investigation and I hope it delivers the just outcome that we all want. It is absolutely essential that the investigation should not just be independent and transparent but be seen to be such. I have noted the unique arrangements that have been put in place for the investigation and I hope it delivers the just outcome that we all want. It is absolutely essential that the investigation should not be only independent and transparent but be seen to be such. In this regard, I will discuss the role of the Chief Constable of Kent, Mr. Phillips, in the investigation with the British Prime Minister at our meeting in Berlin. Clearly, those who carried out this attack sought to undermine the process on which a peaceful future for Northern Ireland depends. Our best response to those who murdered her will be to ensure the success of the process they are trying to wreck.</P>
      <P>My programme of engagements for the St. Patrick's Day period began in San Francisco, where I was honoured to be the recipient of the &ldquo;Spirit of Ireland&rdquo; Award &ndash; from the Dublin-San José Sister City Committee. In Silicon Valley I met representatives of companies with significant operations in Ireland, including Guidant, which announced a major expansion of its facility here. I also launched, for Enterprise Ireland, an electronic network for the increasing number of Irish high-tech companies doing business in Silicon Valley. My visit to the United States also provided many opportunities to reiterate to the business community the excellent conditions for business and the attractiveness of Ireland as a place in which to invest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I attended the St. Patrick's parade in San Francisco on Sunday, 14 March and later attended a <Col N="457" /> reunion at the United Irish Cultural Centre in that city. Both events highlighted the tremendous pride evident in the Irish community throughout the United States. The following day, I addressed the Commonwealth Club of California and World Affairs Council of North California. I outlined Ireland's position as the software capital of Europe and the many positive developments in our economy in recent times. I outlined the evolution of Ireland's contribution since independence in the field of international affairs. I also focused on the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, recognising the importance of the US contribution in helping us to come so far.</P>
    <P>In Washington on 16 March at the American Ireland Fund Dinner, I had the opportunity of acknowledging the tremendous contribution which the American Ireland Fund has made to this island over the past two decades. The American Ireland Fund Dinner honoured, in particular, Senator Edward Kennedy and I was delighted to have the opportunity there to pay tribute to him &ndash; a true friend of Ireland &ndash; for his invaluable contribution to the network of relationships which has made the peace process possible. Earlier that day, I met the Senator with another good friend of Ireland, Senator Chris Dodd, and also had a well attended meeting with the Friends of Ireland Ad-Hoc Committee and a breakfast meeting with Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright, and senior officials of the Department of State.</P>
    <P>On St. Patrick's Day, in addition to the traditional presentation of shamrock at the White House, I had an excellent meeting with the President, the Secretary of State and his other top advisers on Northern Ireland. President Clinton also hosted a major reception at the White House in the evening. His interest in, and focus on, the peace process is clearly as keen as ever. Speaker Hastert also honoured us by hosting the traditional Friends of Ireland lunch on Capitol Hill, which was also attended by President Clinton, all the Northern Ireland party leaders and Secretary of State, Mo Mowlam. I look forward to welcoming the Speaker in turn to Ireland, when he arrives here on 1 April as part of his first overseas visit as Speaker.</P>
    <P>While in Washington, the events hosted by President Clinton and his Administration facilitated various meetings and discussions, formal and informal. These involved President Clinton, Northern party leaders and other key figures from both North and South in Ireland &ndash; from both traditions &ndash; and Vice President Gore, Secretary of State Albright and many others These meetings provided a good opportunity for all of us to step back and look, in a creative way, at the big picture, to remind ourselves of the enormous benefits we stand to gain, provided we give the Agreement a chance to work and what will be lost if we do not. What is at stake is a fresh start, which is to the benefit of everyone, after 30 years of conflict.</P>
    <P>The meetings also provided an opportunity to focus on the one obstacle to launching the insti<Col N="458" /> tutions provided for in the Agreement. It is clear there is no easy solution and the only way out of the current impasse is for everyone to give a little bit. In the period between now and the first anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement, we will all have to work intensively to create the necessary political space and translate these realities into a resolution that is consistent with the Agreement. We will have to do it together in the same spirit of partnership, creativity and shared responsibility which brought about the Agreement in the first place. We will all have to move. It is not an option for anyone to stand back and say they have done their bit or will not do their bit. We all &ndash; Nationalists, Unionists, loyalists and republicans &ndash; worked very hard for the Agreement. We all share responsibility for its success. The people of this island, to whom we are all ultimately responsible, voted for the Agreement in overwhelming numbers. It is up to us to make it succeed.</P>
    <P>It was particularly fitting that President Clinton chose to honour Senator George Mitchell with the highest civilian honour that can be conferred in the United States, the Presidential Medal of Freedom. It was also especially fitting that it should be presented to him on St. Patrick's Day, when so many, who know better than most the true extent of his contribution at considerable personal sacrifice to himself and his family, could be there to witness that recognition of a very worthy recipient. I hope too that the Northern party leaders will take inspiration from George Mitchell's direct remarks to them, as he stressed the imperative of resolving the remaining difficulties. Senator Mitchell knows the process better than most, and his urgent appeal will, I believe, encourage people to move forward.</P>
    <P>On Thursday, 18 March, I chaired a meeting of the Ireland-America Economic Advisory Board in Washington. I took the opportunity to brief board members on the peace process. The meeting also included a discussion on developments in the Irish economy, including the telecommunications sector and our preparations generally to put Ireland in a position at the forefront of the e-commerce revolution. It was also agreed that the next meeting of the Ireland-America Economic Advisory Board, to be held in Ireland, will be devoted to looking at all aspects of the provision of further infrastructure to support our economic growth.</P>
    <P>On Friday morning, 19 March, President Clinton and Prime Minister Blair joined me in issuing a tripartite statement urging the Northern Ireland leaders to meet the deadlines set for all aspects of the Agreement. We are nearly there. The prize is in sight. We have to make it succeed. Over the coming weeks we will continue to work intensively to find a solution, to build the necessary trust and confidence, to engage and to work with General de Chastelain, to find the additional space which will allow an accommodation to be reached on this issue, which I genuinely believe everyone wishes to see resolved.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="459" /> Regarding the possible requirement for the enactment of legislation to extend the period during which the Government may declare that the amendments should be made to Articles 2 and 3, we continue to work on the basis that we will make the necessary progress to give effect to this provision and thus be in a position to make the necessary declaration within the specified period &ndash; failure to meet our target is not an option. As I said earlier in my reply, all our efforts are focused on achieving that goal.</P>
    <P>I have no specific plans to visit Northern Ireland between now and Easter, but I and my relevant ministerial colleagues stand ready to take every appropriate step between now and Easter to ensure that the promise of the Good Friday Agreement is realised for all the people of this island.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the bowl of shamrock was Irish grown, given what Deputy Conor Lenihan has been saying about imported shamrock. In regard to Question No. 14, which concerns the Ireland-US Economic Advisory Board, I understand Mr. Brian Thompson is a member of that board. Did the Taoiseach have discussions with Mr. Thompson at, or outside, that meeting in relation to the possible conflict of interest he may have had as chairman of Telecom Éireann and, if so, what was the outcome of those discussions?</P>
      <P>In relation to the Taoiseach's visit to San José, with which Dublin city is properly and strategically twinned, is he aware of any proposals to have direct flights from San José to Dublin? If so, what steps are being taken to explore this matter further?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to the first question, the gentleman to whom the Deputy referred played a full and active part in the meeting. I had no discussions about the subsequent decisions of the Minister. I do not believe he was aware of the difficulty at that time. He played a full part, as always, in the meeting.</P>
      <P>There were meetings in regard to the flight arrangements which I did not attend but I hope progress can be made on that issue. The statistics and presentation which I was shown indicate there is an enormous amount of travel by the almost 100 San José companies which are involved here in one form or another, with executives and technical and supervisory staff travelling back and forth on a weekly basis. The case was also made in regard to tourism. Enterprise Ireland is involved with 30 or 40 companies in the San José area and it expects that number to double in the next year. The justification for such flights has increased since the matter was last looked at. As I understand it, the matter is being discussed by Aer Lingus and some other airlines.</P>

      <P>I share the views of Deputy Higgins in regard to the carry-over of questions, because the situation is somewhat unsatisfactory. In regard to the quoted pivotal role of General John de Chastelain, given that the Agreement is quite specific that the role and function of the General shall be no more than to monitor, verify and review progress on decommissioning, how can it be expected that there will be an initiative from him, in view of the fact that he has no political authority and, therefore, no political power? Given that more and more of the parties seem to be placing the burden of responsibility on General de Chastelain, who has quite rightly remained quiet on the issue, how does the Taoiseach interpret the General's role and function at this stage?</P>

      <P>I have stated for a long time now that the only way we will make progress on this issue is under the Agreement. Senator George Mitchell's earlier role was to provide a report on the decommissioning body which was subsequently set up under General de Chastelain. It is widely agreed by all the parties and the Governments that General de Chastelain, rather than having political control, has the ability to initiate some conclusions which may prove helpful. He cannot do that on his own; he can only do it through direct dialogue with the parties which have associations with paramilitary bodies and the Governments. General de Chastelain has sought to develop his role in a helpful way to construct a resolution with the parties involved. That remains to be done. I do not believe the General can initiate any measure which has not been developed with the assistance of the parties.</P>

In light of the shocking murder of Rosemary Nelson whom I always found to be very courteous, professional and motivated by the highest ideals of fair treatment and human rights, can the Taoiseach offer the Opposition parties any type of briefing to avoid their having to second guess more than is necessary in regard to the subtleties and sensitivities of this difficult period?

I do not know anything about the Chief Constable of Kent, Mr. Phillips, but I presume he is an honest broker since I have not read anything to the contrary.

I presume it will be ready in early autumn. On the other issue, the important matter is that Mr. Phillips is not just a convenor without direct operational and executive say in these matters, that he is not just co-ordinating a team where all the other people do the work, but that he has his own people. That is the difference between the human rights groups and what I will convey to Prime Minister Blair later this evening. In the House of Commons Mr. Blair made a very clear statement that he wanted it to be broad based and intensive. However, when some of the international human rights people contacted the chief constable's office, he stated he saw his role as a co-ordinating one and not one of direct involvement. That is where the confusion arose last week and we must try to resolve it.</P>

      <P>Schools are not required to advise my Department of cases where children are expelled or otherwise excluded from schools and the Department is not aware of such information having been compiled by any group or individual. In the circumstances I cannot comment on the accuracy of the figures referred to by the Deputy which I understand were quoted as an estimated figure at the recent national congress of the Parents' Association for Vocational Schools and Community Colleges. My Department, however, through its guidelines on school discipline, lays considerable stress on the use of suspensions and expulsions only as a last resort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the rules for national schools no pupil shall be struck off the rolls for breaches of discipline without the prior consent of the patron <Col N="465" /> and unless alternative arrangements are made for the enrolment of the pupil at another suitable school. In addition, my Department gives assistance in securing placement in individual cases. Typically this can arise where a pupil has been suspended as a result of disruptive behaviour and where alternative arrangements need to be made. In these circumstances, my Department endeavours through a process of consultation with the schools and through the inspectorate to assist in the reinstatement of the pupil in the school, or alternatively, his or her placement in another school. In more difficult situations my Department's psychological service is available to assess pupils in order to determine the nature and extent of any special needs with a view to having them addressed in the most appropriate manner. I should add that I am not satisfied with the adequacy of current arrangements in relation to school attendance, suspension and expulsion.</P>
    <P>Under new legislation, which is currently being drafted and will be enacted in 1999, I will be bringing forward a comprehensive range of measures to address the problem of non-attendance at school. Among my key objectives is the establishment of a single national authority with responsibility for school attendance on a countrywide basis. The legislation will also include specific measures for the early identification and support of children at risk of dropping out of the school system. In addition, the eight to 15 early school leavers initiative will involve the development of a tracking template/pupil database for use in primary and second level schools which will track children's attendance and ensure corrective action can be taken at an early stage.</P>

      <P>I have made it clear that I am not happy with the existing situation which I inherited. The only way we can effectively deal with it is through new legislation. The School Attendance (Amendment) Bill will facilitate the compiling of such data and will place obligations on schools to notify the Department of children who have been expelled. No school may expel a child from primary school without first receiving the consent of the patron and, second, making sure alternative schooling is made available for the child.</P>
      <P>I do not have figures in terms of the numbers who contact the Department on an ongoing basis to seek resolution of issues between schools and pupils. Currently, the Department has no authority to direct second level schools, for example, to lift a suspension or re-admit a pupil. What tends to happen is that we receive complaints from parents of children who have either been expelled or suspended. We advise parents of their rights and about utilising local appeals mechanisms to boards of management. Where this fails we intervene and officials of the Department are constantly working with schools and parents in this context to try to locate alternative schooling for young people in the event of a school refusing re-admittance due to disruptive behaviour, etc.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously, regulations must be formulated in terms of the appeals mechanism which has been provided for in the Education (No. 2) Act which we piloted through the House. This will make a significant difference to parents in <Col N="467" /> terms of their right to appeal decisions made by school management in relation to their children. Regulations are currently being drafted in the Department. This matter is receiving priority in terms of implementation of the Education (No. 2) Act which in itself is a huge process and which should not be underestimated. The appeals mechanism will certainly be implemented before the commencement of the next school year.</P>
      <P>The individual concerned has been working for quite some time with parents, particularly those involved in that association, in a very positive way.

The School Attendance (Amendment) Bill, which is very close to publication, will deal with suspensions, expulsions and school attendance. Furthermore, in the context of the eight to 15 early school leaver survey, we are putting in place a tracking template for children at risk in primary schools so that in future we will be in a position to identify children professionally and at an early stage and make interventions to assist them and prevent them from dropping out of school. This is a new initiative. Consultants have been commissioned to produce such a tracking template.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>An Action Programme for the Millennium contains a commitment to give primary education a clear priority in the allocation of resources. The programme specified that all <Col N="468" /> one teacher schools with ten or more pupils would be allocated a second teacher.</P>
      <P>I began the process of implementing this commitment soon after taking up office. In the 1997-98 school year, a one teacher school needed a minimum enrolment of 25 pupils before it could gain title to its second post. From 1 September 1998 I reduced this figure to 18. Consequently, 25 one teacher schools have been allowed their second teaching post from the start of the current school year. The retention figure for the withdrawal of the first teaching post in the 1997-98 school year was 23 pupils. I reduced this figure to 18 from 1 September 1998, with the result that 28 schools continue to operate in the current school year as two teacher units.</P>
      <P>In addition, I allowed 14 schools, which had enrolments below 18 pupils, to continue to operate in the current school year as two teacher units. In total, therefore, in the current school year alone, a total of 67 schools have benefited from my determination to support one teacher schools.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will also be aware from my recent announcement that I am introducing additional measures in the 1999-2000 school year which are designed to further improve the position of one teacher schools and which will benefit 50 schools. Specifically, I am reducing the number of pupils required to appoint a second teacher from its existing level of 18 to 14. As a consequence of this initiative, 22 existing one teacher schools will become two teacher units from 1 September 1999.</P>
      <P>Additionally, by reducing the figure for the retention of the second teacher from 18 to 14 pupils, 21 existing two teacher schools will continue to operate in the 1999-2000 school year as two teacher units.</P>
      <P>I have further indicated that seven schools, which are currently two teacher units but which have an enrolment below 14 pupils, will also continue to operate in the 1999-2000 school year as two teacher units.</P>
      <P>While the above initiatives clearly demonstrate this Government's commitment to one teacher schools, I assure the Deputy that within the lifetime of this Government all schools with ten or more pupils will have a second teaching post.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
      <Quest>the proposals, if any, he has to strengthen guidance counselling in schools in view of the increasing demands on this service.</Quest>
      <QRef>[8174/99]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the increasing demands being made on the guidance service. The amount and complexity of careers and educational information to be managed and disseminated has increased greatly in recent years. In addition, changes in society have led to an increase in the demand from students for individual personal counselling.</P>
      <P>My Department is committed to improving its support for the guidance service, subject to the availability of resources. Every second level school in the free education scheme has an ex-quota allocation of posts or hours for the purpose of guidance. I recently announced a significant improvement in this provision. At present, provision ranges from two full additional posts in the largest schools to 2.2 hours per week in the smallest schools. With effect from the beginning of the next school year, a minimum allocation of eight hours per week for guidance will be provided to all second level schools in the free education scheme, however small. That allocation will be ring-fenced.</P>
      <P>My Department's policy is that guidance should be an integral and important part of the whole programme offered by each second level school. An outline of how to develop a school plan for guidance is currently being prepared for inclusion in the guidelines for school development planning. These guidelines will be issued by September 1999. The pilot phase of whole school evaluation is practically complete. It is intended that a review of policy and practice in guidance and counselling will be included in the next phase. This process will be supportive of the work of guidance counsellors and will help to consolidate the position of guidance and counselling within the educational system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other recent developments in my Department which will strengthen the guidance service include the establishment of the National Educational Psychological Service Agency which will provide guidance counsellors with advice and support on individual casework and on general issues to do with counselling; the renewal of the contract of the National Centre for Guidance in Education, a specialist agency of my Department established to support the guidance service; and the development by the NCTE, in consultation with the national Centre for Guidance in Education, of a dedicated package of information technology support for guidance counsellors. This support package is currently being formulated and will include incareer development for all guidance counsellors; the provision of ICT <Col N="471" /> software materials on guidance; the funding of innovative guidance projects under the IT2000 Schools Integration Project and the development of a careers software library in education centres.</P>
    <P>To be able to plan systematically for the future, my Department will initiate during the current school year a systematic programme audit of the guidance service. This will involve, among other things, a review of the numbers of guidance counsellors in the system and the hours and other resources available for guidance in schools. The data gathered will help to inform future allocation of resources for guidance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply. Does he agree that guidance in second level schools is inadequate? This can be seen from the recent CAO statistics. Some 6,000 applications were returned to students who failed to fill them in correctly. There were basic mistakes in filling in names, addresses and dates of birth. The guidance service in second level schools is overstretched at present and is unable to meet the demands of final year pupils going on to third level colleges. Does the Minister agree that some of the 6,500 young people who drop out of the first year of college courses do so because of inadequate guidance they received at second level?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with the Deputy's final point. I accept that the guidance service has not recovered from the drastic cutbacks imposed in the early 1980s which led to a significant reduction in the number of career guidance teachers available in schools of a certain size, particularly those with fewer than 600 pupils. The service has not fully recovered its strength.</P>
      <P>There is a need for an extensive audit of what is happening in the area of guidance in second level schools. This will determine the provision to schools and how they are using it. The Department has received reports from guidance counsellors and others that the current provision is not being used exclusively for its intended purpose. The Department has decided in consultation with the Institute of Guidance Counsellors and the national centre for guidance to undertake a comprehensive audit of what is happening in the area. In the meantime, I have increased the number of hours available to small second level schools by allowing a basic minimum provision of eight hours to every secondary school. At present, the level is as low as two hours in some schools. It will be a minimum of eight hours from next September.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is hoped that the audit will be completed by next September and prior to the next round of Estimates. We will then have a better idea of how to resource this area, if the best methodologies are being used and if the best approaches are being taken. The audit will be undertaken in con<Col N="472" /> sultation with the Institute of Guidance Counsellors and all interested parties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister suggesting that none of the 6,500 young people who drop out of third level are given poor information prior to filling out their CAO application forms and end up doing courses about which they know nothing or in which they have no interest? Is the Minister suggesting that the lack of guidance counsellors at second level is not a factor in the number of students dropping out of third level?</P>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that students doing the junior certificate or going into fifth year are losing out dramatically because guidance counsellors are concentrating on pupils who are leaving second level this year? Does the Minister agree that young people making subject choices for the leaving certificate and deciding whether they should do the applied or vocational leaving certificate course rather than the mainstream leaving certificate course are losing out? Students are not being encouraged to take up technical subjects because resources are not being provided for the guidance service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>We should be careful about overdramatising the situation and making such statements. The Deputy mentioned the attrition rate at third level. However, accurate and detailed statistics on this matter are not available. I am concerned about this and the Higher Education Authority has commissioned the Education Research Centre to carry out a detailed study on attrition rates in universities. The council of directors of institutes of technology has also commissioned the ERC to carry out a similar comprehensive study on attrition and the reasons for the current rates. However, in comparative terms, although the level is high, the rates are not out of step with other European countries. There is a need accurately to quantify the attrition rate.</P>
      <P>Some pupils may leave third level early because of an inadequate guidance service at second level. However, the Deputy mentioned a figure of 6,500 and I do not accept that attrition is related only to career guidance at second level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree, but guidance is a factor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a much more complex issue and has much to do with what happens at third level. For example, the lack of a mentor system in many colleges and the lack of a proper approach to first year students are factors. The Department has, for the first time, secured specific funding for attrition rate initiatives in the institutes of technology. The Department has asked for proposals to allow it to make funding available to improve the situation, particularly for <Col N="473" /> first year students in institutes of technology and universities.</P>
      <P>The points commission research indicates that because students tend to fill in the fourth, fifth and sixth options on their CAO application forms, they end up taking that option although they may be unsuitable for it in terms of aptitude or because they do not like the course.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Government has over the past year put in place a range of policies which are already radically improving the special education services. Arising from my announcement of new additional teaching and childcare supports, appointments are being made on an ongoing basis and are benefiting children and schools in all parts of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department is currently finalising three circulars and an accompanying information note to advise schools on recent developments in support services for children with special needs and how <Col N="474" /> schools may avail of these new developments. The circulars and information note are expected to issue to schools in the near future. They will provide guidance to schools on the procedures to be adopted in applying for full-time or part-time teaching support for children with disabilities, in applying for full-time or part-time childcare support for children with disabilities, in applying for the establishment of a special class for pupils with disabilities, and in seeking the appointment of a resource teacher for children of the travelling community.</P>
    <P>My Department is also finalising information booklets on the ordinary school transport service and the special school transport service which caters for children with disabilities attending special schools and special classes attached to mainstream schools. Arrangements are already in place whereby school authorities may apply to my Department for funding for specialised equipment for pupils with special educational needs.</P>
    <P>I recently announced my decision to extend the remedial teacher service to every first and second level school which is currently without the service. This extension of the service will take place from September next. In March 1998 my Department notified all primary schools of the approach to be adopted in identifying pupils requiring a remedial teacher service.</P>
    <P>Speech therapy services are generally provided through the relevant health authority. However, schools seeking such a service may make an application through my Department which will liaise with the relevant health authority regarding the provision of the necessary service.</P>
    <P>I recently announced the establishment of a national educational psychological service. As part of this development, I have arranged for the appointment of an additional 25 psychologists to the service in the current year. It is intended that the service will eventually become an independent statutory agency with approximately 200 psychologists. Information on the availability of this service is being provided to schools as the service develops.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister respond to the second part of my question regarding the Department getting a proper picture of the unmet needs in relation to the services for children with special needs? For example, according to the study on remedial education, of which the Minister is aware, pupils in 30 per cent of disadvantaged schools need support in English and 85 per cent of those who need support in mathematics are not receiving adequate attention or any remedial service. Will the Minister ensure that the Department gets a proper picture of the requirements of children with special needs in primary and secondary schools?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>We assisted with the Ahead group, for example, who conducted a comprehensive survey of second level schools to establish a database of children with special needs and that is nearing completion. We have commissioned a survey at primary level to obtain a picture of all outstanding needs. The Government announced last November that it was giving an automatic staffing entitlement to each child with special needs, both in terms of resource teaching and child care assistance. We are now implementing that and it has made a significant difference. We have already appointed 33 additional resource teachers and an additional 156 child care assistants on foot of that decision.</P>
      <P>People have applied to the special education section of the Department which is under pressure because of the number of applications. That is to be expected because of people applying reasonably quickly after the decision was announced. It is the first time child care assistants have been appointed to national schools for children with special needs, a policy such as this has been implemented and resources provided for it. We have committed ourselves to issuing circulars to every school to make them aware of how they can qualify for these additional teaching and child care assistants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister a view on the refusal of his Department to recognise attention deficit disorder, the needs of children who have been diagnosed as suffering from it and the difficulties of their parents, some of whom have written to me? Has the Minister or his Department any proposals to recognise the disorder and to provide assistance in schools to children suffering from it? Given that three circulars are imminent, is a set of definitions of special needs likely to emanate from the Department?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not correct to say we do not recognise the existence of attention deficit disorder. The degree of research on it in this country is not what one would like and we are dependent on international experience of the matter. I have met with various groups representing parents of children with attention deficit disorder. I recognise it and am anxious to make additional provision for it in the context of the remedial service. There are now more than 1,300 remedial teachers in the system. The recent evaluation of the remedial service highlights the need to expand and reform the service in terms of the degree to which it focuses on and targets those with greatest need and avoids a broad brush approach.</P>
      <P>Regarding definitions, the SERC report in the early 1990s supplied definitions and categorised a variety of but not all special needs. In terms of learning difficulties which are now emerging, in our package announced last November we allowed for students with attention deficit disorder or severe dyslexia to be covered by that initiative. However, I acknowledge we have more to do in terms of learning difficulties.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy is referring to a specific case, I would appreciate it if he would bring it to my attention. As of November, we have given automatic entitlements to children with special needs. We are appointing additional remedial teachers and next September every school will have access to a remedial resource. It is unfortunate and regrettable that it will take until September 1999 for every primary school to have access to a remedial resource. The message I wish to give parents is that as and from next September there will be access to remedial teaching resources which will help the children Deputy Higgins described as requiring additional assistance. An additional 600 posts will be created from next September, a significant additional provision. An additional 25 psychologists will also be appointed this year. The establishment of the National Psychological Agency will make a significant difference to the lives of parents, one of whose major complaints for a long time has been the lack of a nationwide psychological service.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>My difficulty is that if a question mark is placed over the definition of a condition by the Minister's officials &ndash; one must query how additional remedial teachers will be trained to deal with that &ndash; will affected children be left in the same position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the remedial service needs to be reformed. In-service training will have a central role to play, especially in terms of modules on children with specific learning difficulties. A great deal must be done in that regard. It is also important that the pre-service teacher training programme has special education as part of its specific terms of reference.</P>

        <b>:</b> While I welcome the appointment of resource teachers and special school class attendants, is there a backlog because the cart was put before the horse some years ago when disadvantaged children were told to attend their local schools and no appointments were made? I met a teacher on one occasion with two children in her classroom who needed special help. There were more children with special needs in her class than there were in three of the schools to which the Minister is allocating six teachers because of a mad promise he made before the election. She had no help for two children with disabilities. Has the Department dealt with the backlog and, if not, how long will it take to provide assistance to teachers who accepted children with disabilities into their classrooms in <Col N="477" /> the past?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>No. Many of the schools affected did not apply and the purpose of the circulars is to address that. Some school principals have not applied in respect of certain children. A process of education for school boards of management needs to be conducted in this regard. I tell people concerned with this matter who I meet that they are entitled to additional assistance and should apply for it. That is the purpose of the circular and the information note. It will take some time before every case is dealt with. It would not be expected that we would have dealt with it in three months.

Will the Minister ensure the support for students with special needs taking exams will be reviewed? On the last occasion the Minister replied to questions I gave an example of a dyslexic student who has been refused support even though two private psychologists stated the child suffered from dyslexia. The Department psychologist states the child is only suffering from anxiety. This is the type of case which has arisen. Does the Minister agree this is the cause of much anxiety for such students?

      <P>Three assessment instruments were used in the recent evaluation of Early Start children which compared the attainment of children in junior infants with that of children who had not been in Early Start. Early screening profiles designed for use with children aged between two and seven were used to assess cognitive and motor development. Subscales of the test were used to assess verbal concepts, visual discrimination, logical relations, basic school skills &ndash; in particular, receptive and expressive language abilities &ndash; gross motor development and fine motor development.</P>
      <P>The Drumcondra primary reading test &ndash; level 2, form A &ndash; was used to assess pupils' achievements in word analysis, reading vocabulary and reading comprehension. The Drumcondra mathematics test &ndash; level 1, form B &ndash; was used to assess pupils' achievements in computation, mathematical concepts and problem solving, involving number and measurement. There were no significant differences between the cognitive attainment of the experimental and control groups in the tests.</P>
      <P>Longitudinal literacy and numeracy tests on the first cohort of Early Start pupils in second class were carried out in November-December 1998 and tests on the second cohort will be carried out in November-December 1999. Reports on these tests will provide comparisons with the attainment of the children's peers in second class who did not participate in Early Start. They will also provide comparisons with the attainment levels of pupils who were in second class in the project schools at the start of the scheme in 1994. These reports will be available in May 1999 and May 2000, respectively.</P>
      <P>The process of incareer development for the teachers and child care workers in Early Start is ongoing and is under continuing review in light of developments in the project. A core group of Early Start personnel engaged in innovative professional development during the 1997-98 school year. Through their work with the trainers, a draft working document that identifies structured play activities and the holistic development of the children, including cognitive development, was prepared. This work is being disseminated to a further group of Early Start personnel in the current school year.</P>

They are funded through voluntary contributions with assistance usually from health boards and local authorities. They are supervised by these bodies, not by the Department of Education and Science. There is no information available on an independent evaluation of the effectiveness of these services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A White Paper on early childhood education is being prepared by my Department. This will take into account the report of the Forum on Early Childhood Education and the evaluation report <Col N="479" /> on Early Start. Changes in early childhood education provision will be considered when the White Paper is published and considered by all the partners involved.</P>

      <P>The Minister stated that following publication of the White Paper changes will be considered. Does he agree assessment of other pre-school programmes should start immediately? Given that there were no significant differences between the attainment of those who participated in the Early Start programme and those who did not, does the Minister agree the programme should be re-examined with a view to introducing those elements of other programmes which have been successful?</P>

      <P>I caution against jumping to rapid conclusions on what is a pilot scheme. Further tests have to be carried out on second class pupils participating in the Early Start programme. Further comparisons can then be made between pupils who are participating in the programme and those who are not. While there were no significant differences between the cognitive attainment of the experimental and control groups in the tests, I have an open mind. We have to await the results of all the comparative tests and analysis. These will inform future practice. We cannot unilaterally impose edicts on those providing early education and child care services outside the Department. There is a clear need, however, for co-ordination. That is the purpose of the White Paper on early childhood education. A Cabinet subcommittee was established under Partnership 2000 to examine the recommendations of the child care strategy group and to develop a co-ordinated approach to early childhood education provision.</P>

      <P>The Minister mentioned that the White Paper will take into account the report of the Forum on Early Childhood Education and the evaluation report on the Early Start programme. There are, however, vast numbers of children who do not have access to pre-school services. The problem is that nobody in Government is taking responsibility for pre-school education. Responsibility is passed from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to the Department of Health and Children and, in turn, to the Department of Education and Science. Why is there so much secrecy surrounding the evaluation report on the Early Start programme? To secure a copy I submitted a request under the Freedom of Information Act, but this was refused. Will the Minister allow us read the report and contribute to the debate? Who is included in the other cohorts? Do the pupils who are not participating in the Early Start programme have pre-school experience and what is their socio-economic background?</P>

      <QRef>[8187/99]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <P>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin): In only a brief period in office this Government has already demonstrated an unmatched commitment to giving real priority and substantial resources to the area of educational disadvantage.</P>
    <P>In this context, I refer the Deputy to my statement of 3 December 1998 detailing a two year £57 million plan for a wide range of initiatives at all levels of education to tackle educational disadvantage. It is a comprehensive package, which represents the largest ever programme of its type in this country.</P>
    <P>The package covers key areas such as early education, remedial services, home school community liaison, traveller education, children with disabilities, the establishment of the National Psychological Service, school planning, substance misuse prevention, early school leaving, adult literacy and third level access and retention. Our most important goal is to broaden and deepen participation at all levels of education as I am very conscious of the vital role that education can play in ensuring that each individual maximises his or her potential. Education is also crucial in breaking the cycle of intergenerational disadvantage so evident in some of our communities.</P>
    <P>As I stated in December, it is my intention to build further on the initiatives launched and to continue to address educational disadvantage as part of a broader social inclusion programme during my term of office. I might add that in order to give a central co-ordinated focus to this work I have recently established a social inclusion unit in my Department, the role of which is to co-ordinate and develop policy and initiatives aimed at combating social exclusion and disadvantage.</P>
    <P>As further evidence of my commitment to tackling educational disadvantage I provided in section 32 of the Education Act, 1998, for the establishment by order of an educational disadvantage committee to advise me on policies and strategies to be adopted to identify and correct educational disadvantage.  Up to half the membership of this committee will, following appropriate consultation, be appointed from nominees of voluntary and state bodies whose aims and objectives are relevant to the work of the committee. Part of the committee's remit will be the preparation and submission to the Minister of a statement containing: (a) proposed policies and strategies for the identification and correction of educational disadvantage, relating to such period as it considers appropriate; and (b) the areas of activity to which the committee accords priority.</P>

      <P>I have responsibility in the early education area and am happy to inform Deputies that work on a White Paper on early childhood education is under way in my Department. The White Paper will set out Government policy on early childhood education and will provide a blueprint for the development of the sector for the future.</P>
      <P>Initial work on the preparation of the White Paper commenced early in 1998, when I hosted the National Forum for Early Childhood Education. This forum provided an opportunity for all those involved in the area of early childhood education to come together and to share their views on future policy for early childhood education. The report on the forum, which was compiled by an independent secretariat, was published last November. It is my intention that the White Paper will be completed as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>In advance of the publication of the White Paper, and to avoid delays, I announced last December that I will provide £1.2 million for special initiatives on early education. My intention is that these will focus in particular on early education for children with disabilities.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 41 and 46 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="499" /> A study of educational disadvantage conducted by the Combat Poverty Agency and the Education Research Centre in 1996 concluded that disadvantaged status should be confined to 16 per cent of the school-going population. The study noted that such status had already been granted to 17 per cent of pupils. As an alternative to extending the disadvantaged areas scheme to additional schools, the study recommended that available resources should be targeted at schools with the greatest concentrations of children from disadvantaged backgrounds already in the scheme.</P>
    <P>The Breaking the Cycle of Disadvantage pilot project was subsequently introduced to deliver the sort of targeted support recommended in the study. This scheme is operating over a planned five year period. The operation of the scheme is being closely monitored by my Department and the scheme is being evaluated by the Education Research Centre.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware that I recently announced details of a major initiative to tackle educational disadvantage. This initiative involves expenditure of £57 million over the next two years to address educational disadvantage at all levels in the education system. It represents the largest ever programme of its type in this country and it is my intention to build further on this initiative in the years ahead.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 42 and 52 together.</P>
      <P>A number of steps are being taken to address the weaknesses identified in the delivery of remedial education at primary level revealed in the recent report Study of Remedial Education in Irish Primary Schools.</P>
      <P>The summary report of the study has been issued to all schools. Principals have been requested to convene a meeting with their remedial teachers, staffs and boards of management to discuss the content of the report and the steps they should take at school level to implement the recommendations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The summary report has also been given to the directors of all of the courses in remedial edu<Col N="500" /> cation organised for remedial teachers. In this way the findings and recommendations of the report will become part of the training of remedial teachers and there will be an immediate application of them.</P>
    <P>As part of the 1998 budget package to tackle educational disadvantage, I announced that the remedial teaching service will be extended to every primary school in the country from next September. This will mean that for the first time all pupils who need special help will have access to a remedial teacher.</P>
    <P>It is also my intention to act on the recommendation to have the Guidelines on Remedial Education revised as soon as possible. This should ensure that there is clarity about the aims of remedial education and about the population of pupils for whom it is intended. Innovations in best practice will be incorporated in this revision.</P>
    <P>Particular attention will be focused in the revised guidelines on the needs of schools in designated areas of educational disadvantage. They will include advice on the approaches used in the Success for All programme, which is a school-wide restructuring programme designed specifically for schools with large numbers of disadvantaged pupils. The main features of this approach are: regrouping of pupils for instruction based on their reading performance for up to 90 minutes per day with pupils in a group sometimes drawn from more than one class level; provision of individual tutoring where needed; co-operative learning of comprehension skills in the upper classes; and regular assessment to monitor the effects of tutoring.</P>
    <P>I have also decided to allocate significant funding to assist school development planning in these schools. An important focus of this planning will be to address the needs of pupils with serious literacy and other learning difficulties.</P>
    <P>The general improvements recently announced in the staffing of primary schools, and the introduction of the revised curriculum in English which will have a major emphasis on the development of literacy skill, coupled with the £6.5 million allocated to schools, with larger grants to the schools in the disadvantaged areas scheme, for the purchase of library works will be of major benefit in raising reading standards.</P>
    <P>In addition, I will shortly announce a range of national reading initiatives for later this year. The aim of the initiatives will be to increase reading standards and to reduce the number of students who leave school with poor literacy.</P>

The operation of the scheme is being closely monitored by my Department and the scheme is being evaluated by the Education Research Centre.</P>
      <P>Because of the multi-faceted approach to addressing the complex issues in educational disadvantage, the project is designed to have an impact on schools, teachers and pupils. Consequently, the evaluation will be wide-ranging in its focus.</P>
      <P>Baseline data has already been developed in relation to children in the participating schools in terms of literacy and numeracy levels. This will provide a benchmark for the final evaluation of the scheme.</P>
      <P>An interim report on the operation of the scheme is expected from the Education Research Centre in January, 2000 and the final evaluation report is due in the latter part of that year.</P>
      <P>The future of the scheme as a model for addressing educational disadvantage in urban and rural settings will be considered in the light of the findings in the evaluation report.</P>

It is my intention to continue to build on this initiative in the years ahead.</P>

      <P>I  have had discussions with a number of groups who were unsuccessful in their applications to participate in the current phase of the eight to 15 year old early school leavers initiative.</P>
      <P>The number of projects which could be accommodated within the pilot phase of this initiative was limited by the level of funding available and the need to make meaningful resource allocations to those projects which were selected.</P>
      <P>A total of 14 project areas have been selected for inclusion in the present phase of the initiative. Funding of £3.68 million is being made available to the initiative over the two school years 1998-99 and 1999-2000.</P>
      <P>A management committee comprised of representatives of my Department and outside agencies has been established to oversee the operation of this phase of the initiative. A project co-ordinator has been appointed to work with the selected projects in developing the programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the current pilot phase of the <Col N="502" /> initiative is to test models of response to the problem of early school leaving. The key objective is to select strategic pilot projects in urban and rural areas of disadvantage which will test models of good practice with a view to their integration, after structured evaluation, into mainstream policy and practice.</P>
    <P>The operation of the pilot phase of the initiative is being kept under ongoing review. The question of expanding the initiative will be considered in the light of experience gained with the models now being tested. In the event of any such expansion being undertaken, I can assure the Deputy that consideration will be given to those projects which were unsuccessful on this occasion.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the budget will allow my Department to support a range of activities to reduce the level of unqualified school leaving. In addition, the Education (Welfare) Bill will put in place a national framework to address this vitally important issue.</P>

      <Quest>if he will give details of the way in which the £3 million fund to tackle disadvantage at third level and the £1.5 million to deal with the problem of non-completion of third level courses, announced in the last budget, will be spent; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The allocations referred to by the Deputy form part of the £6.9 million two year funding initiative to tackle educational disadvantage in the third level sector, which I recently announced. A sum of £3 million is specifically allocated to promote access to third level amongst students from disadvantaged backgrounds, including people with disabilities. A further £1.5 million is being provided to address the issue of non-completion of courses in institutes of technology. The remaining £2.4 million will fund an extension to the maintenance grants scheme so that all independent mature students will now qualify for the higher, non-adjacent, rate of grant.</P>
      <P>The initiatives will be effective from the next academic year and my Department is currently examining options and consulting with the relevant bodies to identify how the allocations can be best utilised. Once this examination is complete, I will consider the matter and announce the detailed arrangements for the disbursement of these funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The promotion of access must deal with tackling disincentives of tradition and support. Colleges must reach out into the community and additional support should be available where it is needed. The additional £3 million fund will complement the existing funding in this area, which between direct funding from my Department, and funding through the HEA, amounts to some <Col N="503" /> £900,000 in the current academic year. This funding supports initiatives involving links between the colleges and local second level schools to provide supervised study facilities, extra tuition for pupils, information and advice for parents and pupils, including seminars, mentoring and support teaching in key subject areas. These programmes either assist students to meet the points requirement for courses for entry through the standard CAO procedure or involve special entry arrangements through which more flexible entry criteria are applied.</P>
    <P>On the question of non-completion, it is suggested that the problem is particularly experienced by students from disadvantaged backgrounds. While information is not readily available from all the institutes of technology and universities on the numbers of students who fail to complete third level courses, the Educational Research Centre, St. Patrick's College, Drumcondra has been commissioned by both the Higher Education Authority and the Council of Directors of the Institutes of Technology to undertake detailed study in this area. The Council of Directors of the Institutes of Technology has established a National Committee on Retention with representatives from each institute to focus on &ldquo;maximising success rates&rdquo; for institutes' students. The committee is currently assembling a profile of current good practice in retention across the sector. This profile will be made available to all institutes of technology. Institutes of technology have introduced a range of initiatives and support services seeking to improve completion rates. These include induction/orientation programmes, course information services, tutor services and systems designed for the early identification of &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; first year students. The £1.5 million funding will support and complement these programmes and will have regard to the recommendations being prepared by the committee in relation to the funding of action projects-programmes both short and long-term based on best practice.</P>

      <P>I am committed to the promotion of an integrated area-based approach to addressing educational disadvantage, and to the enhancement of links between education providers and community, youth, welfare, employer and training interests. My Department will continue to work closely with local development interests in the future to achieve the objective of integrated area planning and a strengthening of home, <Col N="504" /> school and community links. My Department at present funds the cost of 25 whole-time equivalent posts to enable an education co-ordinator to be employed in each of the area based partnerships, and the cost of their employment is not aided by the European Structural Funds. These co-ordinators, who are generally teachers on secondment from schools, are playing a vital role in forging an integrated response to educational disadvantage. While I am anxious that such services will be continued into the future, it would not be feasible to deal with the continuation of such posts in isolation from future developments for the partnerships generally nor do I believe anyone involved would believe it to be desirable.</P>
      <P>The area based partnerships are funded at present as part of the EU aided Operational Programme for Local Urban and Rural Development 1994-99 co-ordinated by the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation. The continued operation of the partnerships after the current round of EU Structural Funds and their scope and function will be influenced by emerging developments generally regarding both the negotiations for the new round of EU funding and a greater integration between the local Government and the local development systems.</P>

      <P>Arrangements are currently being made to extend the remedial teacher service to every first and second level school in the country with effect from September next.</P>
      <P>An additional 600 teacher posts are being made available from the commencement of the next school year. The priority focus of these posts will be to facilitate the extension of the remedial service at first and second level and to facilitate the extension of the home-school-community liaison service to every first and second level school which has disadvantaged status.</P>
      <P>My Department is currently identifying schools which are without a remedial service and arranging for the delivery of the service to those schools. In some cases the small number of pupils involved may require that a post be shared with an adjacent school or schools. The precise number of posts which will be required for the extension of the service has not yet been finally determined. However, I am satisfied that the substantial allocation of additional posts to which I have referred will be adequate to meet the need.</P>
      <P>Schools selected for receipt of a remedial service will be notified of their allocation as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>The demographic dividend at primary level this year is of the order of 230 posts. Officials of my Department have been engaged in an intensive consultation process with the education partners in recent months and a number of discussions have taken place concerning the allocation of teaching posts arising from the dividend.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware from my recent announcement that, in addition to the aforementioned 230 posts, I am allocating an additional 150 posts in order to effect further substantial reductions in class sizes in primary schools.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that teacher allocations at second level are considerably more complex than at primary level and the term &ldquo;demographic dividend&rdquo; is not particularly appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="506" /> This arises from a number of factors including the subject specialisation of individual teachers, variable patterns of demographic change and a comparatively inflexible redeployment model.</P>
    <P>Projected enrolments in second level schools including those in post leaving certificate courses suggest a decline in numbers of the order of 4,000 to 5,000 pupils each year over the next number of years. This decline will not be uniform and we are likely to see schools in some rural areas experiencing falling numbers while some schools in urban areas actually increase their enrolments.</P>
    <P>I recently announced a major funding initiative for the education sector. As a core element of this, a total of 225 new second level teachers will be appointed this year. These new teachers will enable a move towards the provision of a remedial resource in all second level schools.</P>
    <P>The package is being resourced by allocating an additional teaching provision to schools which are within quota and lack the appropriate remedial and home-school provision. In the case of schools with over-quota teachers who might otherwise be redeployed, this resource will be used in the first instance to meet the remedial and home-school needs of the school.</P>
    <P>In addition a retention ratio of 18:1 will be utilised. This will allow schools, which have teachers over-quota following implementation of the package, to retain teachers who might otherwise be redeployed. This will give schools greater certainty in the utilisation of these permanent teachers pending the occurrence of retirements.</P>
    <P>My Department will continue the process of consultation with the interested parties in relation to the most efficient and effective use of available teaching resources.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 51 and 54 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of its remit, the planning section of my Department, on a regular basis, examines areas where significant housing developments may lead to a requirement for new school provision or the expansion of existing schools. This exercise is carried out irrespective of whether the developments are driven by Government policies on regionalis<Col N="507" /> ation or decentralisation or by the demands of the housing market.</P>
    <P>Such examinations involve liaising with school management bodies regarding the extent of existing school provision and projected future requirements and with local authorities concerning the extent and time-scale of new housing to be provided in particular areas and other developments which might have implications for the provision of educational facilities.</P>
    <P>Extensive housing developments proposed or under way in many of our towns and cities, including areas in north County Dublin, may require the provision of additional school accommodation. It is my objective to ensure that adequate provision is made for this emerging demand in a rational and planned manner.</P>
    <P>I have very significantly increased the amount of capital funding available in 1999 to take account of the additional demand for school places. I should also mention that my recent initiative to improve the level of grant-aid payable in respect of building projects will reduce significantly the local contribution payable by the school operators.</P>

      <P>The Bill, <i>inter alia,</i> will establish two new awarding councils, the Council for Further Education and Training Awards and the Council for Higher Education and Training Awards. Under the Bill both of these councils will have the power to validate programmes of education and training and make awards in respect of such programmes. A programme of education and training in the Bill is defined in broad terms as &ldquo;any process by which learners may acquire knowledge, skill or competence and includes courses of study or instruction, apprenticeships, training and employment&rdquo;. The aim therefore is that national certification will be available for learning relevant to work, including work-based learning.</P>
    </Speaker>

Data for the reading survey will be collected by inspectors of my Department in April-May 2000.</P>
      <P>In the area of adult literacy, research projects are not currently under way. In 1997, I published the results of a national adult literacy survey, commissioned by my Department in association with the OECD, which showed that 25 per cent of the adult population, amounting to some 500,000 people, had literacy problems. Subsequently investment in this area was increased by £250,000 in 1997, a further £2 million in 1998 and an extra £3.2 million in 1999 and 2000. In the Green Paper, Adult Education in an Era of Lifelong Learning, the implementation of a national adult literacy programme has been identified as a top priority, with an increase in investment on a phased basis recommended to a level of at least £10 million per annum.</P>

The case for national and regional co-ordinating structures proposed in the Green Paper is based on the fragmentation of the existing system, the multiplicity of providers, the current low level of investment in adult education and training in Ireland, the lack of articulation and communication between the various sectors and levels, and the rigidities of service which are ill-suited to adult needs.</P>
      <P>The key role of the National Adult Learning Council would be to promote the development of the adult education sector in line with emerging social and economic needs, to advise on policy and quality standards, promote the development and monitor the implementation of a co-ordinated strategy and to liaise with the key stakeholders in the field. The local adult learning boards were proposed to ensure similar co-ordination, information sharing, quality support and integrated area planning and implementation. The precise nature and form of such boards was not specified in the Green Paper so that the implementation of the recommendations could be discussed in the light of emerging developments generally in regard to local services reforms. The Green Paper is a focal point for extensive consultation and debate which will enable the Government to plan its priorities for the future development of the sector.</P>
      <P>The fragmentation and diversity of adult education and training is not a feature of other levels of education. Rather than investing in regional education administrative structures, the priorities at these levels are to improve the range of services and the quality and relevance of provision to ensure optimum access, participation and benefit, and to support employment growth and competitiveness and full participation in society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am committed to the promotion of an integrated area-based approach to addressing educational disadvantage, and to the enhancement of links between education providers and community, youth, welfare, employer and training interests. My Department will continue to work closely with local development interests in the future to achieve the objective of integrated area planning and a strengthening of home, school and community links. It is considered that this can best be done through existing mechanisms such <Col N="511" /> as the vocational education committees, home school community liaison staff, education co-ordinators seconded to area based partnerships, and local voluntary networks and consortia in which education plays an active role.</P>

      <P>The reasons for dropping out are complex. There is no simple explanation and no one simple initiative that will address the issue. Factors such as motivation, capabilities and suitability are all involved. There must also be a balance between completion rates on programmes and maintaining the necessary, objective standards. The challenge of maximising completion rates, consistent with maintaining appropriate standards is a matter, in the first instance, for individual universities, institutes of technology and the National Council for Educational Awards.</P>
      <P>On the university sector, the Higher Education Authority carried out a study in 1994, which indicated a completion rate of 81 per cent, which is high by international standards, for those entering in 1989-90. The authority has commissioned the Educational Research Centre, St. Patrick's College, Drumcondra to undertake a further detailed study in this area and a report should be available by the end of 1999.</P>
      <P>A number of initiatives have been taken in the technological sector to assist the compilation of a data base on attrition-drop out rates and to develop appropriate strategies to address the issues. The Council of Directors of the Institutes of Technology has established a national committee on retention with representatives from each institute to focus on &ldquo;maximising success rates&rdquo; for institutes' students. The committee is currently assembling a profile of current good practice in relation to retention across the sector. The profile will be made available to all institutes of technology.</P>
      <P>Institutes of technology have introduced a range of initiatives and support services seeking to improve completion rates. These include induction/orientation programmes, course information services, tutor services and systems designed for the early identification of &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; first year students.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the request of the Department, the Council of Directors has commissioned the Educational Research Centre, Drumcondra, to undertake a comprehensive study on the issue of non-completion in the Institutes, which will consist of: (i) a quantitative analysis to track a cohort of <Col N="512" /> students over a four year period; and (ii) a qualitative study of students who leave without graduating.</P>
    <P>The research project team is currently undertaking a visit to each of the institutes of technology and is developing a standard format to which institutes of technology can respond to the variables that influence progression-retention for each course.</P>
    <P>As part of a two-year funding initiative to tackle educational disadvantaged at third level, I recently announced that I have provided £1.5 million over the period 1999-2000 to address the issue of non-completion of courses in the technological sector. This funding will support and complement the programmes already in place and will have regard to the recommendations being prepared by the committee in relation to the funding of section projects-programmes both short and long-term based on best practice. I am also actively addressing the provision of science and technology in second level schools, a provision of particular importance in preparing persons for successful participation in technical courses at third level.</P>
    <P>A computerised management information systems project is currently in progress as part of the ongoing work to establish modern financial and administrative systems for the institutes of technology. The project has the aim of supporting the efficient and effective administration of the institutions and providing both the institutions and my Department with timely and accurate management information for a variety of purposes. This new system will provide enhanced information on attrition and the results from the initiatives above will be fed into this project.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware of my recent announcement in regard to a £15 million programme for the development of science in second level schools. In making this announcement, I said it is critical for Ireland's development as a world leader in high-skills employment that we improve our performance in physics and chemistry. Over the last year, I and my officials have been examining the current state of these subjects in our schools.</P>
      <P>A major programme of investment in modernising school science laboratories will be implemented. Details of this will be finalised following the completion of the detailed analysis of a survey of science facilities undertaken in recent months.</P>
      <P>A new payment for schools for each student undertaking physics or chemistry will be introduced from September 1999. Costing over £300,000 in a full year, this will involve providing schools with £10 for each student to aid in the purchase of materials for these classes.</P>
      <P>I am confident this initiative will encourage an increased uptake of the physical sciences in our schools, opening up increased opportunities for students, and in the process, enhancing Ireland's highly deserved reputation for a well-educated and scientifically literate workforce.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the functions of the Higher Education Authority is to maintain a continuous review of <Col N="514" /> the demand for and need for higher education in the university sector.

      <P>The higher education grant schemes operate under the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992. These Acts define a mature student to mean a person &ldquo;of not less than 23 years of age, or such other age as may stand specified for the time being in regulations made by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance, who have secured places in approved institutions and have reached that age on the 1st day of January, or such other date as may be prescribed from time to time by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance, in the year of entry to such institutions&rdquo;. The Acts further provide, <i>inter alia,</i> for the making of grants to mature students whose means and those of their parents, where the mature students are dependent on their parents, and the means of their spouses, if any, do not exceed prescribed limits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the terms of the higher education grants schemes, mature students are categorised as either independent mature students or mature students dependent on parents. An independent mature student is defined to mean a mature student who was not ordinarily resident at home with his or her parents from the October preceding their entry to an approved course. Indepen<Col N="515" /> dent mature students are deemed to be self-supporting and are assessed without reference to either their parents' income or address.</P>
    <P>When assessing the means of students other than mature students, the Acts specify that the students' means and those of their parents or guardians must be below a prescribed limit.</P>
    <P>This provision requires that parental income be taken into account irrespective of the individual circumstances in any case where the student is not a mature student.</P>
    <P>The other student support schemes have similar provisions in relation to the means assessment of students.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the difficulties that these provisions can give rise to in certain cases such as in the case of married students or lone parents and I have asked my Department to examine the issues concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Existing funding arrangements for post primary schools includes provision for the purpose of providing for materials for art classes in schools. The way in which this provision is made reflects the different management and ownership arrangements for vocational schools and community colleges, community and comprehensive schools and voluntary secondary schools and is consistent with the manner in which resources generally are allocated to these schools.</P>
      <P>The financial allocations for vocational schools and community colleges are made to the vocational education committees as part of a block grant which also covers the VEC overheads and other activities apart from the second level programme. Voluntary secondary schools are funded on a <i>per capita </i>basis based upon enrolments while the annual budget for community and comprehensive schools takes into account factors which vary from school to school.</P>
      <P>The way in which funding is expended is a matter for each school and/or VEC and they are not required to inform my Department of their priorities in this regard. However, it is my Department's experience that the decision regarding specific materials to be purchased for the teaching of art is taken within the individual school collaboratively by the teacher of art and the principal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This year, the standard <i>per capita</i> grant payable to voluntary secondary schools is being increased by £7 to £184 with <i>pro rata </i>increases in the allo<Col N="516" /> cations for other sectors. I am satisfied this increase represents a substantial response to the many demands for increased funding for schools generally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since coming into office, I have been concerned to address the issue of substitution within the primary school system.</P>
      <P>For these reasons, I have introduced a range of measures designed to boost substantially the supply of trained primary teachers. Specifically, I have ensured that there are over 1,000 places available in the colleges of education during the current academic year. This includes 730 students who will pursue the three year B.Ed degree programme while 280 degree holders will be admitted to an 18 month full time post graduate course.</P>
      <P>Additionally, B.Ed graduates of St. Mary's College, Belfast who have studied Irish to honours level as an academic subject as part of their teaching qualification will be recognised as fully trained.</P>
      <P>I am also examining the possibility of the University of Limerick providing a one year conversion course for degree holders, who hold the higher diploma in education and who have either Irish as part of their degree or have Irish to grade C at the leaving certificate or its equivalent.</P>
      <P>I have further decided that from 1 September 1998, all primary degree holders who also hold the higher diploma in education are recognised as fully trained for the purposes of providing substitution service.</P>
      <P>Finally, montessori trained teachers who successfully completed the course of three years duration at St. Nicholas, Dún Laoghaire, and which is recognised by the National Council for Educational Awards, are granted recognition as fully trained substitutes since 1 September 1998. The appointment of substitutes to replace second level teachers absent on approved leave, including sick leave or maternity leave, is a matter in the first instance for the authorities of the schools concerned.</P>
      <P>While on occasion individual school authorities may experience difficulties in securing a teacher qualified in a specific subject area, I am satisfied that, in general, qualified second level teachers are appointed as substitutes in second level schools.</P>

      <P>The scheme to which the Deputy is referring is the European Social Fund-aided third level courses maintenance grants scheme for trainees under which funding is made available to eligible students who are pursuing middle level technician and higher technical/business skills programmes at the institutes of technology.</P>
      <P>The objective of the middle level technician and higher technical/business skills programme is to enhance industrial competitiveness and growth by providing initial third level education and training to meet the technical and higher level manpower needs of the economy and the regulations emphasise the extent to which training conditions mirror the reality of the work environment, thereby preparing trainees for the workplace.</P>
      <P>The regulations governing the middle level technician and higher technical/business skills programme state that &ldquo;Trainees on the programmes will be subject to normal industrial disciplines during training regarding time keeping, absenteeism etc., and the institute authorities will be required to reflect these factors in the payment of allowances. Trainees may be allowed sick leave without reduction in the level of grant for a maximum of 15 days per academic year. All such absences must be notified to the Institute Authorities in writing&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Normal industrial discipline refers to the normal conditions which exist in the workplace, for example, notifying absences due to illness in writing to the college authorities. Candidates applying for a maintenance grant for an ESF-aided course receive a copy of the scheme in which the payment procedures are set out and they are, accordingly, familiar with these provisions from the commencement of their courses.</P>
      <P>My Department does not have any details in relation to the amount of maintenance grants payments students are losing under this provision of the ESF maintenance grants scheme and it has not been brought to my attention that this provision is causing concern to many students.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The higher education grants scheme and the vocational education committees' scholarship scheme allow for the payments of grants in three equal instalments. These grants are paid on the basis of the student continuing to be a registered student at college rather than a roll call taken on a daily basis which is the system which operates <Col N="518" /> on ESF-aided courses in the institutes of technology.</P>
    <P>The method of payment of grants under the various student support schemes is one of the issues which will be addressed in the context of the review of the administration of the third level student support schemes which is being undertaken by officials of my Department and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs.</P>

      <P>The Special Education Review Committee, which reported in 1993, carried out a comprehensive review of education services for all children with special needs. The report presented by that committee has been published. It provides a detailed description of each special needs category. In respect of each distinct group identified, the committee put forward detailed recommendations for the development of special education services. Since the publication of the review committee's report, very significant progress has been made in the development of special education services.</P>
      <P>I will continue to review needs in this area and to take whatever further steps are necessary to ensure that all special needs children receive the support they require to enable them to gain maximum benefit from the education system.</P>
      <P>My Department does not keep data on the number of children with learning disorders in the general school population. The report of the Special Education Review Committee estimated that approximately 8,000 pupils with special educational needs attend mainstream schools. It is estimated that there are approximately 10,000 pupils with special needs enrolled in special schools or special classes attached to mainstream schools.</P>

      <P>Notwithstanding the wide range of strategies in place to improve retention rates within education to completion of senior cycle education, I am concerned that the growth in employment opportunities may be encouraging young people to mortgage their futures by leaving school early with inadequate qualifications in order to enter work. Accordingly, in the context of the forthcoming school attendance legislation, I am examining the feasibility of enabling legislation to ensure that all under 18s have access to some form of education or training provision, in line with many of our European counterparts. I am also examining the implications of any such provision.</P>
      <P>Funding has been provided in 1999 for the piloting of part-time PLC, VTOs and Youthreach places, and a working group is being established to make recommendations on the implementation of the initiative. Increasing the flexibility of the system will play a key role in enabling young people as well as adults to combine the attainment of education and training qualifications with work and family responsibilities.</P>

      <P>At primary level there is no formal or prescribed mechanism for participation of pupils in matters relating to school organisation. However many schools encourage and promote active pupil involvement in school activities e.g. games, selection and evaluation of library books for school. At second level some schools have established school councils which act in an advisory role to the management and staff. Other schools have a well developed prefect system.</P>
      <P>I strongly favour the establishment of school councils at second level and the Education Act, 1998, states that students of a post-primary school may establish a student council. The Act also states that a school board shall establish and maintain procedures for the purposes of informing students in a school of the activities of the school and shall encourage the establishment of a school council and assist students who wish to establish a council and also when a school council has been established.</P>
      <P>I am aware of research undertaken for my Department by the ESRI in a recent publication &ldquo;Do Schools Differ?&rdquo;. In the schools surveyed pupil involvement was relatively high in one quarter of the schools and there was no formal involvement in one third of the schools. Schools with well developed pastoral care systems, larger schools and girls &ndash; only secondary schools are likely to have the highest pupil involvement reflecting the presence of school councils/well developed prefect systems.</P>

    <P>I recently announced a major £57 million package to tackle educational disadvantage across the education system. This plan included the allocation of extra teaching resources to facilitate the extension of the remedial teaching service to all first and second level schools and the extension of the home-school-community liaison service to all first and second level schools with disadvantaged status.</P>
    <P>In addition, £3.68 million is being committed to the eight to 15 year old early school leavers initiative over the two school years 1998-99 and 1999-2000.</P>
    <P>The forthcoming Education (Welfare) Bill, which is currently undergoing detailed drafting and will be published shortly, will provide for the introduction of a comprehensive school attendance service.

      <P>My Department introduced a European Social Fund-aided staff development scheme, known as the training of trainers programme a <Col N="524" /> number of years ago whereby funds are made available to provide training courses to enable staff in the third level institutions to update their skills and knowledge and to upgrade their qualifications. As a result of this initiative a range of courses were devised and developed by these institutions and are designed to meet the unique needs of each participating institution and to enable institutions to customise their staff development requirements.</P>
      <P>There is a significant emphasis within the programme in the university sector on the development of pedagogical skills training. While the training of trainers programme in the university sector is primarily for the staff of the university colleges, staff from non-university institutions may participate in courses which meet needs which are common across the higher education sector. Furthermore, the Irish universities' training network was set up in 1992 with the aim of encouraging and promoting collaborative development and training initiatives, to complement the initiatives being taken by individual universities.</P>
      <P>In the technological sector, most of the institutes of technology are currently engaged in self-study evaluations and the putting in place of procedures and mechanisms to improve the quality of educational provision. In the technological sector, the training of trainers programme scheme is operated under the following four strands: the primary degree strand; the master's degree strand; the short course strand and the advanced qualifications support strand.</P>
      <P>Under the short course strand, a number of institutes of technology run courses on pedagogics. In addition to this programme, a number of institutes of technology run short training courses on teaching practices for new staff as part of their induction training. In the Dublin Institute of Technology, teaching and learning workshops are a regular feature of the institute's development programme. A teaching and learning resource unit is being established at present which will have three development officers as part of its staffing.</P>
      <P>These arrangements facilitate the continuing development of the teaching and other skills of third level lecturers.</P>

      <P>In the context of the free fees initiative, the third level colleges levied a standardised charge of £150 in the 1995-96 academic year for examinations, registration and student services. This charge was fixed at a maximum of £150 for two academic years. At that time, the then Mini<Col N="525" /> ster stated that the level of the charge would be reviewed. In the light of the arguments advanced by the universities that the true costs of the charges would on average amount to £400 in 1997-98, the need for improved student services and the fact that the charge had been frozen since 1995, I accepted that the third level institutions could increase this charge to £250 for the 1997-98 academic year. In line with the 4 per cent increase agreed for third level tuition fees for the 1998-99 academic year, I also accepted a similar increase in the level of this charge to £260. The level of the charge is subject to annual review.</P>
      <P>Students who are eligible for maintenance grants under the means tested student support schemes do not have to pay this charge. In this regard, some 60 per cent of certificate and diploma students in the technological sector and 40 per cent of students in the university sector are eligible for maintenance grants.</P>

      <P>I have recently announced a £15 million plan to develop sciences and, in particular the physical sciences at second level. This plan includes measures to develop science teachers' skills and, thereby, the quality of science education at second level.</P>
      <P>New syllabi in leaving certificate physics and chemistry will be issued to schools at the beginning of the next school year for introduction in September 2000. Along with support materials being developed by the NCCA and comprehensive reference handbooks for teachers prepared by my Department under a gender equity initiative, an extensive in-career development initiative for teachers of physics and chemistry at both junior certificate and leaving certificate level will be provided this year. There will be a comprehensive programme which will emphasise modern developments in teaching methods including the role of practical work in relation to these subjects. Changes in content in the new leaving certificate syllabi will also be addressed.</P>
      <P>At junior certificate level these courses will be particularly targeted in the first instance at those teachers whose major subject qualification may not include physics or chemistry. About 500 teachers will receive additional training during 1999 with a target of providing such training for up to 1,500 teachers over the next three years if such an expanded programme is felt to be necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An appropriate in-career development programme for teachers of leaving certificate biology and agricultural science will be developed in the context of the introduction of revised syllabi in <Col N="526" /> these areas by 2001 or thereafter. The quality of science education is also being addressed through the review group on pre-service education which I have established. My Department is also in discussion with a number of third level institutions in relation to pre-service and in-career development needs of science teachers.</P>
    <P>Finally, the plan recognises the importance of the use of information and communication technologies, ICTs, in all aspects of teaching and learning. The use of ICTs in the teaching of the physical sciences will also be developed, with the objective of extending it to all second level schools.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>My approach to increasing income limits has been to follow the practice of recent years including that followed by the last Government and increase the reckonable income limits in line with movements in the average industrial wage. The figures are provided by the Central Statistics Office and are computed in each case to March of the previous year. The average industrial wage increase for the period March 1996 to March 1997 was 3.2 per cent. The reckonable income limits for the 1998-99 academic year were, therefore, increased by 3.2 per cent. This increase was also applied to the allowance by which the income limits may be increased in respect of other family members pursuing a course of study.</P>
      <P>In the context of the annual review of the student support schemes, I intend to continue with this practice and increase the reckonable income limits for the 1999 schemes in line with the relevant increase in the average industrial wage to March 1998. Having regard to the competing demands for the available resources, I have previously outlined my intention to tackle the anomalies within the schemes and target resources to those most in need as a first priority, rather than applying significant across the board increases to the income limits or the grant rates.</P>
      <P>In this regard, I was particularly concerned about mature students generally and independent mature students in particular in regard to the rate of grant payable. With effect from the coming academic year all eligible mature students will qualify for the higher non-adjacent rate of grant. This improvement is estimated to cost £2.4 million over the next two years. This cost will be met from the additional funding which is being allocated over the next two years to tackle educational disadvantage at third level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My priority in the area of student support has been to honour the commitment given in the programme for Government, An Action Programme <Col N="527" /> for the Millennium to introduce equitable support for students attending PLC courses. I have honoured that commitment by way of introducing a maintenance grants scheme for students attending post leaving certificate courses with effect from the current academic year. The grants payable under this scheme will be at the same level as the third-level maintenance grants. It is estimated that expenditure on these grants will be in the region of £14 million in 1999.</P>

      <Quest>the way in which he proposes to improve pupil-teacher ratios in the current year with particular reference to the needs of those schools which have an undesirable pupil-teacher ratio; the number of these schools; the number of teachers to be deployed to address this issue; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Government has already reduced the pupil-teacher ratio in both primary and second level schools.</P>
      <P>While the pupil-teacher ratio serves a very useful function of indicating the relationship at national level between pupil numbers and teacher numbers, it does not accurately reflect the position in many classrooms. While there are schools which have a pupil-teacher ratio which is lower than the national average, there are schools with a ratio higher than the national average. Unfortunately, the number of such latter schools is not readily available. The pupil-teacher ratio in primary schools now stands at 21:2.</P>
      <P>The pupil-teacher ratio at second level has improved due to the allocation of additional ex-quota and concessionary posts and the application of a reduced ratio in respect of a range of new programmes which have been introduced in second level schools. The Deputy will also be aware of my recent significant initiative which introduced a retention ratio of 18:1 in relation to schools with over quota full-time teachers who might otherwise be redeployed. This, coupled with the provision of a remedial entitlement to all second level schools, and the extension of the home school liaison scheme will have a considerable and sustained impact on the pupil teacher ratio at second level.</P>
      <P>From the start of the 1999-2000 school year, in addition to retaining the demographic dividend and reducing class sizes in primary schools, and introducing a retention ratio at second level for over quota full-time teachers, the Government has sanctioned the creation of a further 600 new posts across both sectors. These measures will result in a further substantial reduction in the pupil-teacher ratio. This is the first significant increase in teacher staffing for many years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="528" /> These moves clearly indicate the importance which this Government attributes to education, and demonstrate its commitment to seriously addressing the issue of teaching resources available in our schools.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the one year full-time degree course leading to a bachelor of nursing which is offered by the National University of Ireland, Galway, to students who have successfully completed the nursing registration-diploma programme.</P>
      <P>By way of background information, I advise the Deputy that the revised programme for basic pre-registration nurse education and training which was introduced in October 1994 is funded by the Department of Health and Children. Successful completion of the three year programme leads to a diploma in nursing studies and students are eligible to register with An Bord Altranais for employment as a nurse. The Department of Health and Children consulted a number of colleges on the development of accessible degree programmes which would be open both to nurses graduating under the revised programme and to nurses who graduated under the traditional model of education and training. These programmes were intended to offer post-registration qualifications on a part-time basis. A number of degree programmes were introduced on a self-financing part-time basis.</P>
      <P>The course at the National University of Ireland, Galway, is the only full-time degree programme and I understand that the Minister for Health and Children is not in a position to provide funding for this course. This course has not been included within the scope of the free fees initiative. As this matter is at issue in the case of Sarena Tansey and Others v. the Minister for Education and Science, the Minister for Health and Children, the Western Health Board, Ireland and the Attorney General, I do not consider it appropriate for me to make any statement as requested by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I refer to the recommendation of the Commission on Nursing that the future framework for the pre-registration education of nurses be based on a four year degree programme, the third year of which will involve a 12 month continuous clinical placement as a paid employee of the health service. The Nursing Education Forum has been <Col N="529" /> established to prepare a strategy for the implementation of the new four year degree programme for the intake of nursing students in 2002.</P>

      <P>I have taken a number of steps to fulfil this commitment. I am engaged in ongoing bilateral discussions with my colleague, the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands on this matter. A formal liaison committee has been established between our two Departments and An Chomhairle Ealaíon, the Arts Council. The terms of reference of this committee are to assess the development and implementation of the school curriculum in the context of helping to ensure that the curriculum places more emphasis on cultural and artistic activities as promised in the programme for Government.</P>
      <P>There have been two full meetings of the liaison committee. During those meetings, the following issues have been discussed: the arts in the primary sector; the arts in the post-primary sector and arts education personnel at both levels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of the arts plan which was initiated by the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, a series of consultations have taken place under the auspices of An Chomhairle Ealaíon, one of these was specifically on <Col N="530" /> the arts and education. Joint partnership on the place of the arts in school curricula between my Department, the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands and the Arts Council was seen as very desirable by those involved.</P>
    <P>The newly-revised primary curriculum will place much greater emphasis on the arts in the classroom in that it will contain a specific curricular area designated &ldquo;arts education&rdquo;, comprising visual arts, music and drama, while dance will be an integral part of the physical education programme. In addition, the Irish and English programmes will place proper emphasis on cultural aspects of language learning such as story-telling, poetry, legends, festivals, local lore and place-names.</P>
    <P>In mainstream art offered as a subject in second-level schools, important developments have been taking place. A revised junior certificate syllabus has been successfully implemented. A revised leaving certificate syllabus is at an advanced stage. A number of initiatives have gone outside the classroom and linked the world of artists and art galleries with the pupils' artistic development in the classroom.</P>

      <P>Information on the total number of children who have been diagnosed with autism and who are awaiting services is not readily available in my Department.</P>
      <P>Children with autism have access to a range of educational support services. The precise nature of the support provided will depend on the severity of the condition in each case.</P>
      <P>In some cases, children with mild features of autism are educated in ordinary schools with the support, where necessary, of remedial or resource teachers. Children with more serious needs were traditionally catered for in a number of special schools, including schools for children with mild general learning disability and schools for children with emotional-behavioural disorders.</P>
      <P>I recently announced my Department's formal recognition of the distinct educational needs of certain children with autism. Such children are now being catered for in 40 special classes established in special schools and in mainstream primary schools throughout the country. Twenty-eight of these classes have been newly established since the commencement of the current school year. Each of these classes caters for a maximum of six pupils and each class has the support of a special needs assistant. The current enrolment of these classes is not readily available in my Department. However, these special classes can cater for up to 240 pupils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="531" /> My Department's inspectorate is currently investigating the possibility of establishing a number of additional special classes for children with autism in a variety of locations throughout the country. Such classes will be established in any area where the need for such provision has been identified.</P>

      <P>The Department of the Taoiseach has a strong commitment to invest in people so that the best possible service can be given. In my Department's strategy statement published in April 1998, we state that &ldquo; the quality of our services is dependent on the calibre of the people who provide them. It is essential that we continue and enhance this resource through focused recruitment, training and development.&rdquo;  Training and development of staff falls, essentially, into three categories: general training courses; information technology, IT training, and refunds of fees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has directly arranged and paid for a wide range of training courses for staff at all levels since June 1997, covering topics important to the concept of delivering better Government, <Col N="532" /> such as quality customer care, management development, clerical development, the Irish language, foreign languages, professional writing skills, Government accounting, interpersonal communications, staff management, presentation skills, design/desktop publishing, stress management, effective meetings, change in the Civil Service and induction courses for new staff. In support of our continuing revisions of and improvements to the Department's safety statement, we have arranged a number of health and safety courses, including the issue of tackling bullying in the workplace. We have also provided briefing sessions and workshops on subjects such as Agenda 2000 and the introduction of the euro.</P>
    <P>A wide variety of IT training courses have been provided to staff of all grades to enable them to derive the maximum benefit from information technology, so important to their day to day work.</P>
    <P>Many members of staff undertake diploma, degree and masters degree courses in their own time. Where these courses of education are relevant to their work and/or their development as civil servants, my Department supports these endeavours by refunding the course fees to the student and by providing study leave and exam leave. In addition to this, fees and expenses are paid to enable staff to attend conferences and seminars in support of the work of their individual sections and divisions.</P>
    <P>Investment in staff training and development amounted to a total of £77,890 and £79,126 in 1997 and 1998 respectively. This year, £136,000 has been allocated in my Department for this important work. The increase in this year's allocations is due to the introduction of the performance management system, an essential element of delivering better Government, which will require extensive training for staff at all levels. The budget will also, <i>inter alia</i>, cover the cost of courses, IT training and refunds of fees, as well as the salary of the training officer, £20,471 per annum, and any additional materials he may require.</P>

    <P>I am satisfied that my Department continues to make good progress towards achieving full year 2000 compliance. Out of the original 24 year 2000 projects identified in my Department, only five remain to be completed. It is expected these projects will be completed shortly. Since the year 2000 project commenced there have been, to a <Col N="536" /> greater or lesser extent, a total of seven staff involved in securing year 2000 compliance &ndash; four from the IT unit and three from the management services division, the section which deals with office equipment. No staff member has been engaged full-time on a continuous basis on this work.</P>
    <P>The bodies under the aegis of my Department continue to make steady progress. Most of the offices are substantially compliant. The compliance status and number of personnel working in those bodies on securing full year 2000 compliance is as follows:</P>

      <P>My Department is committed to developing all staff members through various avenues and wherever possible such courses are funded. As a result an increasing proportion of payroll is spent on staff development and training. A large proportion of the training budget is spent on refund of fees to staff attending third level courses in recognised and approved colleges. The Department also provides funding for in-house courses which cater for the training needs of all staff. The courses provided by the Department include front-line skills, personnel development, staff development, management development as well as customer service, induction courses and effective writing. Funding is also provided for training in specialised areas of interest to particular divisions of the Department.</P>
      <P>Given the number and diversity of courses attended by staff of my Department, it would be very difficult to provide information in the detail sought. However, the following table includes the breakdown of the cost of funding the various different types of training and development courses:</P>

      <P>The company announced its intention to go on a three day working week from 17 March 1999 until the end of April to reduce its inventory level. The reason for this change is a result of a continual decline over the past  four years of Bissell Ireland sales <Col N="538" /> with its core product, carpet sweepers, down by approximately 40 per cent over this period. The company has experienced difficulties in its role as a line production unit with no design, research and development or marketing function. Continuous attempts. in conjunction with IDA and the linkage programme, to secure additional business have proved unsuccessful.</P>
      <P>The IDA will continue with efforts to secure additional work for the company and met with the parent company on 15 March 1999. The parent company is now actively seeking new contracts for the Irish operation and is liaising with IDA on various initiatives. New products developed in the US and sold in Europe will, however, continue to be sourced in lower cost locations in Asia. Accordingly future prospects for the company are uncertain.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 102 and 103 together.</P>
      <P>Long delays are being experienced in recent months in receiving European Social Fund aid for a number of operational programmes from the European Commission. At the end of 1998, the European Commission had budgetary constraints and in January 1999 it began upgrading its computer payments facilities which has added to the delays in clearing payments.</P>
      <P>In recent days, however, my Department has received some ESF aid in respect of applications made to the Commission in November-December 1998 for a number of operational programmes, including the EMPLOYMENT initiative, of which HORIZON is a strand. Advances due for 1998 in respect of EMPLOYMENT have now been received and will allow for payments to be made to the 11 HORIZON projects which are overdue this advance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Application for the first advance for 1999, 50 per cent, was made to the Commission in respect of the EMPLOYMENT initiative in February following verification by projects that the 60 per cent threshold to enable the drawdown of such <Col N="539" /> aid had been reached. This payment is awaited and, according to the Commission, is not likely to issue until April. I am acutely aware of the problems this is causing for project promoters who are endeavouring to deliver on their action plans without ESF advances. While my Department has made every effort to speed up the release of funds, the problem is one for the Commission and is outside my control.</P>
    <P>Officials of my Department have been in continuous contact with promoters advising them of the position and, in many cases, have made contact with their banks explaining the reasons for the delays. However, while the delays in ESF receipts are a reality, there is also a certainty that the funds will be received and that specified amounts have been committed to individual projects. This allows promoters to seek facilities from their banks to enable project work to continue. While my Department has not told project promoters to do so, many in the current circumstances have availed of such facilities.</P>
    <P>In endeavouring to respond to the needs of promoters in a number of EU programmes, including HORIZON, in which my Department has a particular responsibility, my officials have had discussions with the Department of Finance in recent times with regard to possible Exchequer pre-financing of delayed ESF receipts. These discussions are continuing. In the meantime, every pressure is being brought to bear on the Commission to release funds at an early date to allow projects to complete their activities.</P>

      <P>The 1999 Estimate for my Department includes provision of £14 million for the operation of the local employment service, LES. Partnerships, FÁS and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs also contribute to the LES either through the provision of staff or through direct financial contributions.</P>
      <P>Currently there are 18 LES areas, 16 partnerships and two non-partnership areas, and the service is being set up in seven new partnership areas. In the 18 existing LES areas there are 98 centres and contact points providing intensive mediation services to the long-term unemployed and other socially excluded groups to assist them access employment. The number of LES centres and contact points reflects the outreach nature of the LES with the service being provided at local level within disadvantaged communities.</P>
      <P>Currently there are 263 full-time and 14 part-time staff employed by the LES in the 18 areas. There are up to a further 37 staff employed in LES jobs clubs.</P>
      <P>At the moment seven new areas are recruiting staff and establishing contact points which will mean that the number of LES offices and staff will increase over the coming number of months as the service becomes operational in these areas.</P>
      <P>I intend to bring proposals to Government shortly which provide for a closer alignment of the LES and the FÁS employment service. This will ensure that optimal use is made of the substantial resources being invested in the LES and in the FÁS employment service and to improve the service being provided to assist the long-term unemployed and other disadvantaged groups return to the labour market.</P>

      <P>The principal regulations governing asbestos waste are the European Communities (Asbestos Waste) Regulations, 1990, &ndash; S.I. No. 30 of 1990 &ndash; the European Communities (Control of Water Pollution by Asbestos) Regulations, 1990, &ndash; S.I. No. 31 of 1990 &ndash; and the Air Pollution Act, 1989 (Emission Limit Values for the Use of Asbestos) Regulations, 1990 &ndash; S.I. No. 28 of 1990. These regulations are the responsibility of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.</P>
      <P>In so far as my Department is concerned, the Health and Safety Authority is the statutory body responsible for the promotion of occupational safety and health and for the day to day administration and enforcement of relevant statutory provisions in this area. The authority currently administers and enforces legislation in relation to the protection of the health and safety of workers from exposure to asbestos and restrictions on the marketing and use of asbestos.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current regulations enforced by the authority are the European Communities (Protection of Workers) (Exposure to Asbestos) Regulations, 1989 &ndash; S.I. No. 34 of 1989 &ndash;  which were amended in 1993 &ndash; S.I. No. 276 of 1993. These regulations place a duty on employers whose work involves coming into contact with asbestos or materials containing asbestos to make assessments of the exposure to asbestos in the air in the place of work. They have a duty to ensure that employees are not exposed to concentrations above limits indicated in the regulations. In addition, adequate information must be provided <Col N="543" /> to workers and their representatives at the workplace in relation to the potential risks to health from exposure to asbestos and the precautions to be taken. Employers must also ensure that asbestos used as a raw material is stored and transported in suitable sealed packing and that all asbestos waste kept in sealed receptacles is clearly labelled when being collected and removed from the place of work, other than in respect of mining activities carried on at that place.</P>
    <P>Other regulations relating to asbestos enforced by the authority are the European Communities (Dangerous Substances and Preparations) (Marketing and Use) Regulations, 1998 &ndash; S.I. No. 462 of 1998. Under these regulations, without prejudice to other EU provisions on the classification, packaging and labelling of dangerous substances and preparations, the placing on the market and the use of products containing chrysotile fibre &ndash; white asbestos &ndash; may be permitted only if the products bear a label in accordance with the detailed requirements specified in Part A of the Second Schedule of the regulations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>The current standards-based apprenticeship system was introduced in 1993 as a result of social partner negotiations under the Programme for Economic and Social Progress. The system comprises seven phases, alternating between four on-the-job and three off-the-job phases.</P>
      <P>Employers are responsible for recruiting apprentices, who are regarded as employees of the recruiting firm. Apprentices are paid industry-agreed apprenticeship rates which vary from industry to industry.</P>
      <P>There are no registration costs for an employer taking on an apprentice. During the on-the-job phases of training, the employer pays the apprenticeship allowance. The employer is also responsible for any other associated employment costs, including employer's PRSI liability. The employer may, in addition, provide the apprentice with any tools required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Off-the-job training is carried out on phases 2, 4 and 6 of the apprenticeship. Phase 2 training is carried out in FÁS training centres; phases 4 and 6 are carried out in institutes of technology or <Col N="544" /> Department of Education colleges. Off-the-job training is generally of 40 weeks total duration, divided as follows: phase 2: 20 weeks; phase 4: ten weeks, and phase 6: ten weeks. During these modules, in most cases, the apprentice remains an employee of his or her employer, but is paid by FÁS. The payment of the apprenticeship allowance by FÁS during these phases represents a substantial saving to the employer in terms of wages and overheads.</P>
    <P>At the beginning of March 1999, 17,914 apprentices were registered with FÁS compared to 13,978 at the end of December 1997. This represents an increase of 3,936, 28 per cent, in 15 months and is illustrative of an upward trend since 1996 in the number of apprentices being registered. Bearing in mind that employers are responsible for recruiting and registering apprentices, there is no evidence of reluctance on the part of employers, in general, to take on apprentices.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 114, 115 and 122 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied with the progress being made in our Department towards achieving full year 2000 compliance. The Government has set 31 July 1999 as the deadline for achieving compliance on all fatal and critical systems across all Departments and our Department is on schedule to meet this deadline. This is also the timeframe set for achieving compliance by the agencies under this Department's remit. The agencies named by the Deputy have all been reporting to my Department on a quarterly basis on progress being made on their respective year 2000 programmes. These reports show that steady progress is being made towards meeting this deadline. This week staff <Col N="545" /> from my Department with direct responsibility for the year 2000 programme have scheduled meetings with all of the agencies listed by the Deputy to ensure that programmes are progressing according to plan. I expect to be in a better position to advise the Deputy on progress within the agencies after these meetings have been held.</P>
    <P>In a previous reply to the Deputy on 15 December 1998 on the numbers of staff engaged on year 2000 work, I indicated that two staff members were assigned full-time to the year 2000 project with others assigned as the need arose. Since that time, in effect, the entire complement of staff in the IT unit of my Department has been working on various projects which are year 2000 contingent. The year 2000 project within my Department is a top priority to the extent that no new projects or system development is being assumed by the unit until such time as the year 2000 programme is complete. The unit comprises 23 staff including two staff members at management level.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 116, 119, 120 and 121 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister with responsibility for dealing with the year 2000 problem, I launched a national business awareness campaign in May last year. The success of this campaign is evidenced by a survey, conducted by the Irish Computer Society, which showed in September last that almost nine out of ten businesses are aware of the year 2000 <Col N="546" /> problem. It also showed, however, that only 52 per cent of companies had already begun year 2000 projects.</P>
    <P>Despite the high levels of awareness, the somewhat poorer level of action is worrying. For this reason and to heighten knowledge of the need to take early and definitive action, in December last I launched the Enterprise Ireland national Y2K information service specifically geared to the needs of both small and medium sized companies. The new information service includes a helpline number. Callers are provided with an information pack including a directory of Y2K consultants and service providers. In addition, the service provides a series of training workshops both to companies and to intermediaries such as the county and city enterprise boards and many others. The new information service also operates a dedicated website providing updated versions of its information pack and various other relevant material. The Y2K website provides links to other suitable sites of direct benefit to SMEs.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, I am still concerned about the levels of preparedness of companies to deal with the millennium bug problem. To try to accurately gauge their preparedness, Enterprise Ireland is initiating a comprehensive national survey on the levels of compliance of companies. This survey will be repeated every quarter for the remainder of the year to assess the changing levels of compliance and to direct actions to stimulate compliance. The first results are expected in early April.</P>
    <P>I am broadly satisfied that the awareness campaign has been a success and I reiterate that the Government has no responsibility towards ensuring that companies actually take our advice and get their systems compliant. A total of £42,964 was spent on the campaign during 1998. A sum of approximately £300,000 is being made available to Enterprise Ireland for the awareness campaign this year. A further sum of £30,000 has been included in this Department's Estimate for spending on this issue during 1999, if required.</P>
    <P>Continuing efforts to publicise the issue will continue during this year and I have addressed several conferences already on the subject and will continue to use every opportunity to publicise the subject. The Enterprise Ireland campaign, which I outlined, will continue for the full year and even to the early part of next year. I have arranged that the county and city enterprise boards will organise a series of events for their client companies during the year and the first of these is being launched this week. Shannon Development is organising a series of seminars next month. Various initiatives have also been undertaken by private sector groups and I have encouraged these projects.</P>
    <P>It has been made clear from the start that the role of Government has been to raise awareness for business on the issue. There is no question of State funding, including any State-sponsored loan scheme, being provided to companies to defray the costs of ensuring that their systems are com<Col N="547" /> pliant. I do not consider that it would be appropriate for the State to get involved in such funding.</P>
    <P>Individual enterprises must identify the issues as they affect their companies and devise solutions and many have already done so. This is primarily a management issue, just like other management issues which arise all the time in the running of business. I do not consider it to have any political context. It is a matter for each business and other users of computer systems to assess the full implications of the year 2000 on their systems, to identify the necessary solution and take remedial action.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 117 and 118 together.</P>
      <P>In early 1998, I invited and received the commitment of representatives of a broad range of relevant business organisations and State agencies to support the Government's awareness campaign and take part in a year 2000 committee to oversee and advise on the campaign. The membership is set out in the accompanying table.</P>
      <P>The role of the committee, the members of which have given their time on a voluntary basis, has been to advise me on campaign strategy and to report on the progress within the bodies represented and in the wider business community. Its members include representatives of groups which interact with small business on a daily basis and are, therefore, in a position to exert influence, for example, the banks, the accounting-auditing profession and the insurance industry.</P>
      <P>The committee has met on four official occasions since its formation. Several members of the committee have attended many other meetings on this issue throughout the year.</P>
      <P>With the help of the committee, a comprehensive brochure was prepared outlining the nature and implications of the problem and giving advice on how to deal with it. This brochure was circulated to more than 100,000 businesses throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, a series of seven regional conferences have been held to increase awareness of <Col N="548" /> the problem where I, along with committee representatives, have impressed on participants the urgency of the need to address the issue. These and a subsequent national conference in Dublin received wide media coverage. The total cost of the brochure and the conferences was £42,964. A further sum of £30,000 has been included in this Department's Estimates for spending on this issue during 1999, if required.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to the detailed and comprehensive reply which I gave to the House regarding this subject on 9 March 1999 in which I stated that formal consultations on the proposed life assurance disclosure regulations have taken place between my Department and all interested parties, including the Irish Insurance Federation, Irish Brokers Association, the Professional Insurance Brokers Association, the Consumers Association of Ireland, the Director of Consumer <Col N="549" /> Affairs and the Pensions Board. Despite the fact that the formal consultation process has concluded, submissions continue to be received and considered by my Department, including from the Irish Brokers Association.</P>

      <P>There have been many allegations over the years about irregularities in the affairs of this company. It was originally incorporated in Gibraltar in 1976 and essentially sprang from an industrial and provident society registered by the Registrar of Friendly Societies on 20 February 1975.</P>
      <P>The company is in liquidation since 1984 by order of the Gibraltar Supreme Court. My predecessors have had extensive inquiries made in this case. I have been informed that there has been a full and detailed Garda investigation of the matter. On completion of the investigation, a file was forwarded to the Director of Public Prosecutions who, having considered the matter, directed that the evidence was insufficient to support a prosecution for fraudulent activities within the State.</P>
      <P>Zimmerman &amp; Company Limited, Thistlewaite House, Enfield, County Meath, has made representations to successive Ministers about the liquidation of International Investments Limited seeking the appointment of an inspector. The information supplied has not up to now been sufficient to convince the Garda that they should reopen their inquiries in this case. Notwithstanding the above, I have recently received further correspondence in the matter. I am currently reviewing the correspondence and I will respond to it later.</P>

      <P>A sum of £455.145 million is available in my Department's Vote in 1999 for FÁS employment and training programmes. In addition, FÁS will receive approximately £86 million from the European Social Fund in 1999 towards the cost of training programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Revised Estimate for my Department will provide 10,275 new places on active labour market initiatives this year, including 875 new job initiative places, 1,500 bridging programme places <Col N="550" /> to enable the long-term unemployed to enter mainstream training and 5,200 job club places. My Department will also provide an average of 37,500 places on community employment in 1999.</P>
    <P>The initiatives to which I have referred reflect my policy to enhance the range of places available for the unemployed, to focus on programmes with the best employability outcomes and to target places at specific disadvantaged cohorts in the labour market. In that context, there will be some refocusing of places, notably from community employment to other programmes. Decisions regarding support for specific schemes within training and employment programmes are the operational responsibility of FÁS.</P>

      <P>The main element of Ireland's industrial policy for some time, has been to seek to move our economy further up the value chain by promoting the quality of our education, skills and overall competitiveness.</P>
      <P>The quality of our educated and skilled workforce is our key advantage in any competition with low labour cost locations for overseas mobile investment. Many companies in Ireland, both Irish and overseas owned, are highly competitive in the international marketplace. Wages, while important, constitute only one element of a company's overall costs.</P>
      <P>Obviously companies, from time to time, make a decision to relocate their facilities. This is generally for a combination of reasons including lack of competitiveness in certain labour intensive operations, consolidations, the availability elsewhere of spare capacity or as a result of mergers and acquisitions.</P>
      <P>The long standing objective of our industrial policy has been to increase overseas companies commitment to Ireland and our economy. I am pleased that we have been increasingly successful in this approach. The impact on the economy of IDA Ireland supported companies has increased by nearly 20 per cent in value terms in the past four years. This economic impact is a major contributory factor to the high levels of growth in other sectors of the economy. The maintenance of Ireland's low tax regime beyond the year 2010, as recently agreed with the EU Commission, will facilitate Ireland's current competitive stance in Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, we cannot be complacent. As the most open economy in Europe, we are potentially exposed to the impact of any serious and sustained downturn in our key markets. The 150,000 <Col N="551" /> plus new jobs created in our economy over the past three years are encouraging and are clear indicators of the success of the current approach. The task for the coming years is the prioritisation of ongoing enhancement of the physical-technological infrastructure and the need to continue to expand the range and level of skills in the labour force so that the advances of recent years will continue.</P>

      <P>Under the operational programme for environmental services I994-9, grant-aid of £135,000 was made available to Meath County Council in 1995 and 1996 towards a coast protection scheme at Laytown costing £180,000. In 1997, the Department provided further financial assistance to the local authority towards the undertaking of a study on erosion problems and suitable protection techniques for the Meath coastline generally. The report, prepared for the county council by consulting engineers, recommended that coast protection works with an estimated cost in excess of £2 million be undertaken.</P>
      <P>Meath County Council applied to my Department last year for financial assistance towards implementation of the recommendations contained in the consultants' report. In view of the considerable calls on the funding available for coast protection in 1998, it was not possible, however, to make any funding available to the local authority in respect of the proposed scheme. The county council was informed accordingly on 22 October 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="553" /> I recently announced my Department's coast protection programme for 1999, under which financial assistance will be provided for projects with a total cost of some f:4.7 million.  In view of the many competing demands on the funding available for coast protection and the urgent need for works at many locations right around the coast as well as the level of commitments on hand and prior requests for funding, it was not possible on this occasion to allocate moneys for works in County Meath. The requirements of the east Meath area will, however, receive further careful consideration in the drawing-up of future coast protection programmes.</P>

      <P>The meeting to which the Deputy refers was held on 9 February 1999 at the request of the Cobh Fishermen's Association, CFA, and the Cork Lobster Fishermen's Co-op. In addition to the representatives of both groups, the meeting was attended by Mr. Frank Doyle of the Irish Fishermen's Organisation and Deputies Michael Ahern, Coveney and Stanton.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="555" /> As the Deputy may recall, the meeting addressed various concerns which had been expressed by the CFA and the Lobster Fishermen's Co-op regarding proposed further dredging of sand and gravel required as backfill material in the construction of the Lee Tunnel.</P>
    <P>During the meeting, I explained the assessment process which would be applied to the proposed dredging operations. The submission made by the fishermen had been referred to the company engaged in building the tunnel for its comments. Their response and the fishermen's submission would be carefully considered by the Marine Licence Vetting Committee, a multi-disciplinary expert group which assists my Department in assessing proposals of this kind.</P>
    <P>I confirmed that the overall volume of material to be extracted under the proposal would not exceed the total catered for in the original licence. In addition, in order to minimise any environmental effect on the fishery, the company had agreed to a dredging site which was located over 800 metres from the scallop beds.</P>
    <P>I undertook to let the fishermen know of my decision in the matter and in doing so would indicate the consideration which had been given to their submission. I also undertook that in the event of the proposal being approved, I would provide details of any conditions which had been included in the terms of the licence to meet their concerns and minimise or eliminate any impact on the fishery. I hope to be in a position to announce a decision shortly.</P>
    <P>The delegation also inquired as to whether the research vessel of the Marine Institute had carried out any surveys of fish stocks in Cork Harbour and I advised that they should approach the Institute directly in the matter. I also said that if they felt there was a need for other surveys to be undertaken, they should make proposals to the Marine Institute.</P>

      <P>The proposal to set up a new National Maritime College at Ringaskiddy, County Cork, is a key recommendation of the Task Force on Seafarer Training and Employment which I established in February 1998.</P>
      <P>In its final report presented to me in October 1998, the task force stressed that more detailed costings would be necessary before the National Maritime College development could proceed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Government approval in principle to the development of the new National Maritime College for Cork announced in October 1998 was <Col N="556" /> further underpinned by the allocation of £200,000 to my Department to advance work on the costings and scheduling, for the new college.</P>
    <P>To progress the recommendations of the task force, an interdepartmental expert working group has been established. The group comprises senior officials and technical experts from my Department, the Departments of Finance, Education and Science and Defence, as well as representatives of Cork Institute of Technology, the Naval Service and FÁS. The group will examine the costings, financing and timing of the new National Maritime College with a view to submission of a fully developed proposal for implementation to Government.</P>
    <P>It is my intention that the group's work be progressed as quickly as possible so that the Government approval in principle can be given tangible effect in terms of an implementation plan and time frame.</P>

      <P>The applicant applied to plant two parcels of land in early 1998. The area was subsequently inspected by the local forestry inspector who advised that the land would not be capable of producing a commercial crop of wood and the applicant was accordingly advised in September 1998. The applicant has since appealed this decision and this appeal will take the form of an inspection by two of the senior inspectors in the Department. Each application to plant land is determined on its merits and the initial inspection would have had cognisance of the fact that the adjoining areas were planted.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that salmon populations remain vulnerable and that our commitment to improving protection, conservation and management on an incremental basis must be sustained by everybody involved, be they commercial or angling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recently announced my salmon management policy for this coming season. I have decided to continue the general conservation measures which were in place in 1998, including the close <Col N="557" /> seasons. I have also announced additional measures this year including a salmon tagging scheme as the first phase in the development of tagging and quotas which was recommended by the Salmon Management Task Force. To protect spring salmon stocks, which are particularly vulnerable, as well as spawning fish, I have announced a ban on the use of prawn and shrimp bait and the use of gaffs, identification of &ldquo;blackspot&rdquo; spring salmon rivers for which the close season will be extended next year to 1 May, and the development of catch and release schemes.</P>
    <P>I have no plans to grant an extension to the salmon fishing season. However, as I have already indicated, where commercial fishermen and anglers can agree a management plan for specific areas, I am prepared to consider the possibility of extending the season in those areas.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 138, 139 and 140 together.</P>
      <P>My Department and the agencies under its aegis are advancing their action programmes to address the year 2000 compliance issues for IT systems, office equipment and other plant with a view to achieving early compliance.</P>
      <P>I can report considerable progress with the Department's programme. All systems and equipment at the various offices and locations have been identified and their assessment in terms of whether or not they comply is virtually complete. All operating systems have been upgraded and non-compliant servers have been replaced. Work has commenced on the installation of upgraded communications links between Dublin offices and remote locations for completion in early April, 1999. Outside expertise has been obtained to test and modify PCs for completion by the end of April 1999. The Department aims to replace any non-compliant items of non-IT equipment, mostly fax machines and photocopiers, by the end of May 1999.</P>
      <P>The Department has an additional budget of £330,000 during 1999 to address expected additional expenses related to the issue. Four additional staff, including one specialist employed on a consultancy basis, have been assigned to the Department's IT unit to upgrade the Department's IT capability generally, including year 2000 compliance requirements.</P>
      <P>My Department is in communication with the various agencies under its aegis regarding the level of preparedness for the year 2000. The responses received all indicate a high level of awareness of the issues concerned and show that appropriate action is being taken to ensure timely compliance of relevant IT systems. The costs incurred and the numbers of staff employed by the bodies under the aegis of the Department in ensuring full compliance is a matter for each individual agency.</P>

      <P>The overall size of the Irish fishing fleet is constrained in terms of tonnage and engine power by binding requirements under the EU multi-annual guidance programme for the fisheries sector. A person who wishes to introduce a vessel into the Irish fishing fleet or to increase the tonnage or engine power of an existing vessel must, therefore, arrange to acquire equivalent capacity and have it removed from the fishing vessel register.</P>
      <P>The EU fourth multi-annual guidance programme allows, however, for proposed increases in fishing vessel capacity to be considered outside of overall fleet limits on a case-by-case basis where such increases result exclusively from safety improvements and do not increase the fishing effort of the vessel concerned. Any proposals of this nature would be subject to rigorous scrutiny by the relevant national authorities and the European Commission and would require the approval of the EU management committee on fishery structures.</P>

      <P>BIM provides training courses to provide new entrants as well as existing skippers and crews with the necessary skills and qualifications for a career in the fishing sector. In particular, BIM provides structured deck crew training programmes for new recruits to the industry to certificate level. Recruitment of new entrants is carried out in the spring and autumn of each year. BIM does its best to accommodate all applicants with a genuine interest in a fishing career.</P>
      <P>In addition, the whitefish fleet renewal programme which I delivered last year is providing, through a combination of tax incentives and capital grant aid, support for a total investment of up to £60 million in the whitefish fleet over a three year period. This has created significant opportunities for younger skippers to invest in new and modern second hand vessels and in the purchase of tonnage.</P>

      <P>The actions permissible under a prospecting licence, PL, are in general non-invasive and of minimum environmental impact. It is a condition of each PL that any drilling or trenching should not take place without prior consultation with and notice to my Department to ensure environmental compatibility and observance of precautions. Candidate areas for SAC or SPA status have the same legal status as designated areas in this process.</P>
      <P>In assessing an application for a PL it is practice to ascertain what, if any, restrictions arise from the designated or proposed environmental or heritage status of the subject lands. These are notified to the recipient of the PL and compliance with them is a condition of the PL.</P>
      <P>In this case inquiries were made of Dúchas in addition to checking our records of earlier contacts with it to get a clear picture of what activities might be subject to restriction or partial restriction. Having established that exploration in these areas of Connemara was viable and that the applicant was suitable, I issued notice of my intention to grant the PLs to allow for other matters to be brought to my attention by members of the public. Having reviewed the objections submitted, I will come to a decision on whether to issue the licences.</P>

      <P>The Barcelona Process, in which Egypt plays an active and constructive role, was established in November 1995. The primary objective of the process is to lend support to the Mediterranean countries in their efforts to transform their region into a zone of peace, stability and prosperity. The participants are: the EU and its 12 Mediterranean partners, Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Palestinian Authority, Israel, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, Turkey, Cyprus and Malta. The Barcelona Process entails strengthened and regular political dialogue, the development of economic and financial co-operation and the social, cultural and human dimension.</P>
      <P>An essential component of the economic and financial partnership envisaged in the Barcelona Process is the creation by the target date of 2010 of a free trade area between the EU and its Mediterranean partners. A central feature in preparation for the free trade area is the conclusion by the Union of Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreements with each of the Mediterranean participants. It is within this context that negotiations have been taking place between the EU and Egypt.</P>
      <P>Agreement or significant progress has now been achieved in a number of areas. However, negotiations are continuing. It is hoped that outstanding issues can be resolved to the satisfaction of both sides in the near future, thus allowing for the conclusion of the association agreement.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 147, 148, 149 and 150 together.</P>
      <P>The questions posed by the Deputy have been raised by the Department of Foreign Affairs through the framework of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference. The British authorities have provided the following information.</P>
      <P>In connection with the frequency of parades, the British authorities have advised that between March 1998 and 21 March 1999 there were 151 parades in Portadown RUC sub-division. Of this number, 115 were legally held and 36 were illegally held. The vast majority of these parades were loyalist parades.</P>
      <P>With regard to the level and frequency of the police presence in the area, the British side have advised that an RUC presence has been maintained in the general Garvaghy Road area since 29 June 1998 and that a static RUC presence has been maintained at Craigwell Avenue.</P>
      <P>The chief executive of the Northern Ireland Housing Executive has advised that it can only provide information about the number of families who would have moved out of the Garvaghy Road and the Craigwell areas of Portadown based on approaches made to it to buy houses from those families or to provide them with alternative accommodation. This type of information is held by the executive on a financial year basis.</P>

      <P>The Government has at all times, in its contacts with parties associated with paramilitary groups, emphasised the need to adhere to the principles of non-violence and democracy as enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 154, 155 and 156 together.</P>
      <P>The Department, in common with other Government Departments, has established a plan to ensure that it is year 2000 compliant by the end of 1999. This plan covers all IT hardware and software along with other office equipment and plant. The plan includes the following: an inventory of all hardware and software in the Department, close contact with suppliers, on-site testing and replacement-upgrading of any non compliant hardware or software.</P>
      <P>In the context of the Departments quality customer care strategy, the remedial work required for the Passport Office is well under way. Work to ensure the continuity of internal services such as word processing, financial and personnel management systems etc., is progressing satisfactorily. At HQ there are nine people in the IT section working on the implementation of the Departments year 2000 plan with essentially twelve people contributing to the project as and when required within their areas of responsibility. Officers at each of our 52 missions are also contributing to the project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Progress on the implementation of the plan is being closely monitored in conjunction with the year 2000 Monitoring Committee. The implementation of the compliance plan has been assigned the highest priority and additional staff have been allocated to the IT communications unit to assist <Col N="566" /> with the project. All agencies under the aegis of the Department have completed their projects and are year 2000 compliant. I am satisfied that all the relevant Departmental systems will be compliant in good time.</P>

      <P>At the meeting of the European Council held in Luxembourg on 12-13 December 1997, the Council welcomed the European Commissions plans to submit a communication on the problems arising from the year 2000 computer problem and called on the incoming Presidency, the United Kingdom, to accord top priority to the action to be taken.</P>
      <P>At its meeting in Cardiff on 15-16 June 1998, the European Council recalled that problems for information technology and other electronic systems arising from the year 2000 could have serious cross-border effects and that it was important therefore that member states should share best practice in addressing the problem. The Council indicated that national programmes should raise awareness and prescribe action to minimize disruption and that such action should include ensuring millennium compliance in critical systems in the State sector, contingency planning and appropriate training to address skill shortages. The Council stressed that the issue should continue to receive top priority and invited the Commission to report on progress at the its meeting in Vienna on 11-12 December 1998.</P>
      <P>At the meeting in Vienna, the European Council urged the member states to implement timely plans for the protection of their own infrastructure and to continue to raise awareness across all sectors, focusing in particular on the public sector and on small and medium-size enterprises. The relevant authorities in the member states were urged to examine closely the implications of the problem of supply-chain failures outside the EU, to elaborate contingency plans to address this and to exchange information with their counterparts in other member states. The Council called on the Commission to convene a meeting of representatives of the public infrastructure providers from the member states to establish whether the cross-border dependencies within the EU in areas such as transport, energy and water supply were being adequately addressed and to recommend appropriate action, where required, at the European Council to be held in Cologne in June 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Discussions on the year 2000 problem are continuing at expert level, with particular emphasis on transport and energy aspects, and I understand that the Council of Telecommunications Mini<Col N="567" /> sters will discuss the matter at their meeting on 22 April next.</P>

      <Quest>the procedure for a single lone parent to get a passport for a school trip for her 13 year old daughter (details supplied); if an affidavit sworn by the mother in this case will suffice; if it can be witnessed by a peace commissioner; if he will clarify the situation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The consent of the father of a child whose parents were never married to each other is not required for passport purposes unless he has acquired joint guardianship rights through a court order or by virtue of a statutory declaration sworn by him and the child's mother.</P>
      <P>The Passport Office is not automatically aware when a father is appointed a joint guardian by a court or becomes one by virtue of a statutory declaration. Accordingly, if a mother seeking passport facilities for a child claims to be a single parent, the normal practice of the Passport Office is to ask her to sign an affidavit to the effect that she is the child's sole legal guardian and that no other person has been appointed a guardian by a court or by operation of law. The affidavit must be sworn before a commissioner for oaths; a peace commissioner would not suffice unless he or she were also a commissioner for oaths.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The consent of both parents is normally required for passport purposes where a child's parents are married to each other or, in the case of a child born out of wedlock, where the father has acquired joint guardianship rights. In such instances, when the consent of the father cannot be obtained because he is no longer in contact with the family, the mother is required by the Passport Office to apply to the District Court for an order dispensing with the need to obtain the father's consent and authorising the Passport Office to provide passport facilities for the child. It would appear that this procedure would be the <Col N="568" /> one to follow in the specific circumstances of the case cited by the Deputy.</P>

However, the Deputy may wish to note that I will shortly be making regulations pursuant to an EU directive which will, among other things, put in place a framework for the imposition of universal service obligations in the fully liberalised telecommunications sector. The provisions relating to universal service obligations, which will be administered by the Director of Telecommunications Regulation, will include requirements relating to the affordability of the services concerned.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 162 and 165 together.</P>
      <P>My Department received informal inquiries from the private sector concerning the potential for public private partnerships in the provision of transport services, particularly in relation to light rail development. Following the Government decision to endorse a public private partnership approach, on a pilot basis, for public capital projects, I commissioned consultants, Arthur Andersen, together with Steer Davies Gleave, to advise me on the possibilities for a Public Private Partnership approach to the development of the Luas network. The consultants have completed their work and their report is now being finalised. I will make an appropriate announcement when their recommendations have been fully considered.</P>

I understand from CIE that there has been some delay in appointing consultants to carry out the preliminary studies on the proposed underground section. However, this will not have any significant impact on the timescale set out for the borehole drilling and should enable the preliminary geotechnical studies to be completed by the end of the year.</P>

      <P>It is and always has been my policy <Col N="573" /> that transport operators, and in particular the State transport companies, should provide the highest possible degree of accessibility. I am committed to bringing about a situation where public transport facilities are fully accessible to all at the earliest possible date. The CIE companies are fully aware of my policy in this regard and I am satisfied that they are doing all in their power to achieve this goal.</P>
      <P>Bus Átha Cliath currently has six low floor single decker buses in operation on the No. 3 route, Belfield to Drumcondra, and the company has given a commitment that, from now on, all single-deck buses due for renewal will be replaced by low-floor equivalents.</P>
      <P>At my request the company is preparing a broad programme of trials of possible low floor buses. I expect the trials to include six double deck; one articulated; and one alternative fuel bus. These trials, together with the experience of their existing low floor single deck buses and a further 20 fully accessible 33 seater midi buses which the company will purchase this year will provide the basis for decisions on the future fleet replacement programme. Depending on the results of these pilot tests, Bus Átha Cliath should be in a position to begin ordering accessible double decker buses from 2000.</P>
      <P>At present Bus Éireann has one low-floor single deck bus operating on the Bishopstown route in Cork. A wheelchair-accessible school bus is also in service in Cork City. A further ten low-floor vehicles are currently on order. Bus Éireann states that these vehicles are due for delivery in early summer and will be put into service on the company's Cork and Limerick city routes.</P>
      <P>Considerable progress has also been made in making the railway accessible to people with disabilities. Iarnród Éireann has published an accessibility guide for passengers. Almost all of the 90 mainline stations are accessible by wheelchair users. All of the newer rail passenger carriages, including the DART, are accessible by wheelchair users. In addition, the new DART stations at Drumcondra, and Clontarf Road and the upgraded Dun Laoghaire station are all fully accessible.</P>
      <P>I am also pleased to report that each of the companies, Bus Átha Cliath, Bus Éireann and Iarnród Éireann, have now established user groups representative of people with disabilities. The input from these groups gives the companies very valuable assistance in their ongoing programmes of improving the suitability of their services for mobility-impaired customers.</P>

      <P>I announced on 4 March that I had been given Government approval to arrange for the carrying out of costing and feasibility work on a suburban rail development plan. The plan comprises two elements: a short-term programme based on making more intensive use of the existing rail corridors and a longer term programme based on certain conceptual suggestions for improving the suburban rail network contained in the strategic planning guidelines for the greater Dublin area. One of the suggestions in the guidelines, to be published later this week, is a possible new inland rail link to Navan.</P>
      <P>My Department has asked CIE to arrange for the carrying out of the necessary costing and feasibility work on the programme without delay. I am aware that Iarnród Éireann and Meath County Council have carried out some preliminary feasibility work on the Navan rail link proposal which included broad estimates of the likely capital cost and passenger usage. However, a more detailed feasibility study, with firm cost and passenger demand estimates, will be required.</P>

      <P>The workshop to which <Col N="577" /> the Deputy refers was organised by the Nuclear Energy Agency to bring together nuclear regulators and operators, Government officials, consultants and software specialists to review technical preparedness for addressing the potential impact of the millennium bug. Given that the workshop was primarily directed at countries with nuclear installations, Ireland did not attend the workshop.</P>
      <P>I understand a report on the workshop has not yet been finalised by the NEA but that it will be available in due course on the NEA website &ndash; www.nea.fr. According to the NEA, consensus was reached among the participants at the workshop that Y2K issues have been addressed in a consistent and comprehensive manner for several years now and that installations are expected to be Y2K compliant by the middle of 1999. The workshop, however, concluded also that nuclear operators and regulators must continue to be vigilant to ensure confidence in Y2K readiness and that further development of contingency plans, nationally and internationally, is necessary to deal with the issues associated with the Y2K problem.</P>
      <P>It is of vital importance that computer based systems, essential to safety in nuclear plants in EU member states and elsewhere, do not encounter problems associated with the Y2K issue which could cause an undue risk to the public. Officials from my Department and the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, RPII, have raised the Y2K issue in the UK nuclear industry with their UK counterparts. The RPII is satisfied that the UK nuclear installations inspectorate has set up a rigorous programme aimed at ensuring Y2K compliance by all operators of nuclear installations in the UK.</P>
      <P>The Y2K issue has been raised by Ireland at the EU atomic questions working group, an EU Council working group. As a result, the EU Commission has undertaken to prepare a paper for discussion in the group setting out the various initiatives the Commission has undertaken in regard to this problem.</P>
      <P>The International Atomic Energy Agency has established an action plan to assess the scope of the Y2K problem and to act as a clearing house and central point of contact for IAEA member states to exchange information regarding actions with respect to Y2K compliance.</P>
      <P>I will continue to monitor nuclear sector Y2K compliance developments to ensure the potential impact of the Y2K problem is fully addressed by the nuclear industry and regulators.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is aware that the provision of telecommunications infrastructure is primarily a matter for operators in the newly liberalised telecommunications market. Recognising that in certain regions of the country, competition alone will not provide the required broadband telecommunications infrastructural investment, I recently sought proposals for projects supporting the development of advanced communications networks and services which might be co-funded by European Union funding. Unfortunately no suitable proposals were received relating to Waterford. However, my Department, with Forfás, is preparing estimates of further funding requirements to ensure nationwide broadband connectivity. All regions will be considered in this review.</P>

      <Quest>if her attention has been drawn to the use of the IRIDIUM mobile phones service in North America which uses satellites to give global coverage and which, if introduced in Ireland and Europe, would render mobile phones masts redundant; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[5791/99]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the Iridium satellite communications system and of a number of other similar systems which are being developed. I understand the Iridium satellite communications system has been licensed by the Director of Telecommunications Regulation to provide services in Ireland. While such systems are capable of providing global coverage, it is not expected that demand for their services would be such as to render current terrestrial mobile phone systems or the masts associated with them redundant. Currently, calls made on satellite communications services are, in general, more expensive. In addition, while the technology is improving, the phone handsets associated with these systems are larger and heavier and are also more expensive. One of the features of these systems is that the frequencies at which they operate are higher than the terrestrial mobile telephony frequencies. Consequently, penetration of the signal through buildings is less successful and indoor coverage equivalent to what is achieved by terrestrial mobile systems may be difficult to match.</P>
      <P>Another point is that the amount of radio frequency spectrum available to these services is not sufficient to accommodate all of the day-to-day traffic requirements of mobile phone users in developed urban areas. Because of this limited amount of spectrum, it is envisaged that satellite operators will negotiate roaming agreements with terrestrial mobile operators so that many calls made to or from a satellite communications system will be carried at least partly on a terrestrial system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Satellite communications systems are, therefore, seen as complementary rather than as <Col N="579" /> replacements to terrestrial mobile networks. Unless and until such systems match terrestrial mobile systems in terms of cost and service features, it is probable that the direct use of such systems will largely be limited to areas where there is no agreement with the terrestrial operators or where there is no terrestrial mobile telephony coverage.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 175 to 177, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>As I indicated in response to previous questions from the Deputy, there are formal procedures for regular reporting to Government on the year 2000 compliance issues in respect of my Department and the State agencies under my aegis. The work within my Department is on schedule to be largely completed by end June 1999. There are regular discussions between my Department and the semi-State bodies under my aegis. I have written to chairman and chief executives highlighting the importance of this matter. I am informed that all State agencies are on target for timely completion for critical systems.</P>
      <P>I continue to be confident in the ability of my Department and the State agencies for which I am responsible to cope with the year 2000 problem. As a matter of prudence I will be ensuring appropriate contingency plans will be in place.</P>
      <P>There are more than 30 persons in my Department who have an involvement to varying degrees in dealing with year 2000 compliance. The number engaged in compliance work in the State agencies is a matter for the bodies themselves.</P>

      <Quest>the Government's policy in relation to future airport development in the greater Dublin area with reference to Baldonnel; the Government's policy in relation to private airfields, for example an airfield (details supplied) in County Dublin, in view of the fact they need to know the overall governmental policy in relation to this private facility in deciding whether to make further investment in the future.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of future airport development in the greater Dublin area, including the possible development of Baldonnel as an aerodrome for civil aviation purposes, is a matter which falls to be considered by me, following consultation with my colleague, the Minister for Defence, against the backdrop of an overall strategy for the airports sector in Ireland.</P>
      <P>I have asked the board of Aer Rianta to conduct a fundamental review to establish what would be the most appropriate strategic direction for the company and it will submit a report to me in early April. I am firmly of the view that the question of introducing commercial airport facilities at Baldonnel should be considered within the overall context of that strategic review.</P>
      <P>The long standing policy of my Department is that private interests may provide and develop airfields, provided the safety licensing requirements of the Irish Aviation Authority are met and planning permission is secured. I understand that, while encouraging investment which would lead to the improvement of safety standards at the airfield to which the Deputy refers, the Irish Aviation Authority has not encouraged the operators to invest in a commercial development. It would not be within the remit of the authority to do so. It is for the promoters to satisfy themselves that expansion of an existing facility can function as a viable commercial entity.</P>

      <P>I am informed by Bord Gáis that the comments referred to by the Deputy were made by a spokesman for the company by way of response to a request from a journalist for a comment on a proposal by another company to provide a North-South gas interconnector, in the context of providing infrastructure for the growing demand for natural gas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As stated in reply to questions on this subject on 18 February last, Bord Gáis and my Depart<Col N="581" /> ment are carrying out a study of gas demand and related infrastructural developments to the year 2025. As part of that study, technical consultants appointed by Bord Gáis have recommended the provision of a second gas interconnector between Scotland and Dublin, parallel to the existing interconnector, as the optimal solution to the provision of additional infrastructure to cater for the growing demand for natural gas.</P>
    <P>This recommendation is still being examined by Bord Gáis and my Department. The consultant's recommendation is being examined against the background of a possible commercial gas discovery in the Corrib field off the west coast, a proposal for the provision of a North-South interconnector and the interest shown by a number of private sector companies in the provision of additional gas infrastructure both to and within the State.</P>
    <P>The various options and proposals will be care<Col N="582" /> fully considered by me and no decision has been taken regarding a possible pipeline landfall at Loughshinny, County Dublin.</P>

      <P>The Military authorities advise that there are no commissioned officers who are due to be retired from the Permanent Defence Force on medical grounds. The Deputy may be referring to non-commissioned personnel who enlisted for five year engagements in 1994 and whose service engagements would be due to expire this year. Any such personnel who have applied for extension of service must meet minimum medical standards under a number of headings, including &ldquo;Keenness of Hearing&rdquo;. Personnel who wish to extend their service must have &ldquo;Keenness of Hearing&rdquo; not lower than grade 2. The current minimum medical standard for extension of service is prescribed to ensure only personnel who are medically fit to perform all military duties are permitted to extend their service.</P>

      <P>Under the 1998 ewe premium scheme the person named submitted an application in respect of 36 ewes. Following an inspection of the sheep he was notified in writing that as he had not co-operated fully with the Department's inspecting officer the penalty was that he was debarred from the scheme for 1998 and 1999. Under the charter of rights for farmers he had his case reviewed by the district inspector who reduced the penalty from two years to one year. The person named then submitted an appeal to the appeals unit in Agriculture House who upheld the decision made by the district inspector and issued a lengthy explanation as to the reasons for agreeing with that decision.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>Provisions for the ring-fencing of milk quotas are contained in the European Communities (Milk Quota) Regulations, 1995 (S.I. No. 266 of 1995). The ring-fencing legislation provides that any milk quota involved in a land transfer in the disadvantaged areas can be produced on the land in question or on other land held by the <Col N="590" /> transferee within 48 kilometres (c. 30 miles) of that land. The basic principle underlying the ring-fencing of milk quota is the retention, in so far as possible, of milk production in those regions of the country which are most vulnerable in terms of economic and social decline. The importance of milk production in terms of rural development and the maintenance of population has been highlighted in many studies. I have no proposals to change these provisions at present.</P>
      <P>The Milk Quota Review Group, which is made up of representatives of the farming organisations, the dairy industry and technical advisers, has in recent months reviewed all aspects of the operation of the regime in Ireland but no recommendation has been made by the group to amend the ring-fencing provision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 198 and 199 together.</P>
      <P>The Agenda 2000 proposals did not include any specific proposals for the sheepmeat sector. However, I was concerned that the proposals to change the method for calculating stocking density for the extensification premium in the beef sector would impact adversely on the sheep sector, particularly by putting pressure on mixed cattle-sheep producers to reduce sheep numbers in order to retain eligibility for the extensification premium. I made my concerns in relation to sheep clear to the EU Commission and the Council throughout the negotiations. I am satisfied that the increase in the stocking density limit which I negotiated as part of the final package will ensure the vast majority of eligible producers will continue to qualify for the premium without reducing stock herds.</P>

    <P>I have for some time been seeking the introduction of an extensification premium in the sheep sector. However, the EU Commission is unwilling to accede to my request on the grounds that the cost of such a premium, in the Union as a whole, would not be justified as sheep production is already an extensive operation. There is no support for the idea among other member states. The Commission has indicated to me that <Col N="591" /> it regards the rural world premium, which is paid to producers in disadvantaged areas, as having the effect of an extensification payment.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to calculate the value of a sheep extensification premium to Irish producers since this would be determined by the rate per ewe, as well as the stocking density and any other conditions which might be attached to such a measure.</P>

      <Quest>if he is seeking to have the suckler cow premium substantially increased in the Agenda 2000 negotiations in response to the EU Commission proposed 30 per cent beef price cut; and his views on the required level of suckler cow premium to keep suckler farming viable.</Quest>

      <P>Under the agreement reached on the agricultural aspects of Agenda 2000 in Brussels on 11 March, I secured substantial improvements in the Commission's proposals for suckler cows. In spite of the fact that the price reduction will be 20 per cent rather than 30 per cent as proposed by the Commission, the basic suckler cow premium will be increased to 200 euro per head compared with the 180 euro originally proposed. In addition, the supplementary national premium of 24 euro per head will continue to be financed by FEOGA. Furthermore, suckler cows will qualify for a slaughter premium of 80 euro. Finally, I succeeded in preventing any reduction in our national suckler cow quota, thereby ensuring a strong base for the production of high quality beef for the supply to markets in the European Union. I am satisfied that the outcome of the negotiations will protect the viability of suckler cow production in Ireland.</P>

      <P>The retention of the current milk quota year was reviewed by the Milk Quota Review Group and the group considered that the current quota year, 1 April to 31 March, has certain advantages over a system based on the calendar year. Among these advantages are the following: since the volume of milk deliveries rises towards year end, a small percentage adjustment can have a significant effect in helping producers to remain within their quotas &ndash; the opposite is the case for 1 January-31 December quota year; there are many more calves born in February and March than in the autumn giving a good opportunity to dispose of surplus milk as feed; farmers trying to reduce deliveries towards the end of the calendar year would be more likely to dispose of surplus cows as cull cows while in the current regime they are more likely to calve down in spring &ndash; a change could therefore have a negative impact on the beef sector; fresh milk required during the winter period could be adversely affected by a change in quota year.</P>
      <P>The Milk Quota Review Group, which is made up of representatives of the farming organisations, the dairy industry and technical advisers, has in recent months reviewed all aspects of the operation of the quota regime in Ireland but no recommendation has been made by the group to seek a change in the current quota year.</P>

      <P>The revised REP scheme requires that a framework plan be drawn up for all commonage land. The preparation of the framework plans is being carried out under the supervision of my Department and the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands. As there are approximately 8,000 commonages in all, it will take some time before framework plans will be available for all commonages. Priority is being given to the preparation of plans in the six western counties of Donegal, Leitrim, Sligo, Mayo, Galway and Kerry and it is expected that many of these plans will be available by the end of June 1999.</P>

      <P>It would appear that this question relates to applications lodged in 1997. The person named lodged a bull premium application in respect of one animal and a 22 month application in respect of two animals. He did not submit an area aid application. His premium entitlements were restricted to 15 livestock units. However, as he had a milk quota of 28,962 gallons, the equivalent of 32.29 livestock units, no premium was payable on the animals in question. In cases such as this, the EU regulations governing the schemes require that animals be deemed to have received the premium and, accordingly, the cattle identity cards had to be stamped and punched.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 254, 255 and 256 together.</P>
      <P>In consultation with the centre for management and organisation development of the Department of Finance, my Department completed a year 2000 preliminary assessment report in 1997. In August 1997 a year 2000 project board was set up, chaired by an assistant secretary, to oversee the work on year 2000 compliance. As part of the preliminary impact assessment, some 50 departmental systems were identified as being non-compliant. Resulting from this, a year 2000 compliance plan was drafted in October 1997. The year 2000 project board meets on a monthly basis to review and monitor progress and reports regularly to the Department's management committee and IT steering committee. In addition, every two months a status report is forwarded to the interdepartmental year 2000 monitoring committee.</P>
      <P>At present approximately 110 of the staff in my Department's computer division are working on year 2000 compliance tasks. A small number of these staff are engaged full time on the year 2000 project and the vast majority carry out year 2000 tasks alongside their normal duties. Remedial work is being carried out on all of the non-compliant systems and some tasks have been completed. It is expected that work on all non-compliant systems will be completed by end July 1999. I am satisfied that the Department is well positioned to meet the compliance deadline.</P>
      <P>With regard to State bodies, the position is that on foot of a Government decision, a monitoring committee, chaired at assistant secretary level, was established in my Department in June 1998 to oversee year 2000 compliance in the relevant State agencies. All of the agencies have been reporting year 2000 progress every two months and no major difficulties have been encountered.</P>
      <P>The National Milk Agency, Western Development Commission and the Irish Horse Board are Year 2000 compliant and the remaining agencies will be compliant by the third quarter of 1999.</P>
      <P>The number of personnel working on securing Year 2000 compliance within the State agencies</P>
      <P>is outlined below:</P>

      <P>The position is that during the course of a general examination of the arrangements in place for the notification of transfer and lease of ewe quota rights to my Department certain inconsistencies came to light. When these inconsistencies were further examined it became apparent that the possibility of irregularities could not be discounted. As a result it was necessary for inspectors from my Department to carry out on-the-spot inspections in County Wexford which included interviewing ewe premium applicants about their ewe premium and ewe quota transactions. A number of inspections were carried out recently and irregularities have been identified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These inspections and interviews were and are being carried out by senior experienced personnel from my Department and while I accept that certain detailed questions relating to ewe quotas and ewe premium applications have had to be <Col N="608" /> asked I am satisfied that the interviews were conducted in a fair and courteous manner.</P>

      <P>Under the terms and conditions of the scheme of early retirement from farming, payment of a pension can only be authorised from the date of receipt of a valid application. The date of receipt of a valid application is the date on which all the core documentation is lodged with the local FDS office. In this case, the application for the person named was lodged in the local FDS office on 11 May 1998. Due to the volume of work in the office, the file was not examined until 22 June 1998. On the examination of the file a number of queries arose.</P>
      <P>The officer examining the file wrote to the applicants solicitors requesting further details in relation to these queries on 22 June 1998. A reply was received on 4 September 1998. The date of valid application has now been revised to 24 July 1998 to take account of the full period of the delay in processing the application in the local office. In the circumstances, there are no grounds for backdating the payment of the pension to the original date of application.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I set up a working group last year to examine the taxation of returns on credit union savings. This group, under the chairmanship of Mr. Terence Larkin, was comprised of members of the League of Credit Unions, the Registrar of Friendly Societies and senior officials from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, my Department and the Revenue Commissioners. I received the report of the working group last October and I recently made it publicly available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was not possible for members of the working group to reach a consensus and, in the absence of an agreed position, the chairman made a number of recommendations, namely, that credit union surpluses should continue to be exempt from corporation tax; 20 per cent DIRT should apply to interest on all credit union deposits; 20 per cent DIRT should apply to all dividends from shares except where the dividend in any year is £750 or less, and in such cases only the first £375 would be exempt; and there should be no reporting to Revenue of interest or dividends on credit union savings. The Revenue and Finance members of <Col N="613" /> the group did not support these recommendations.</P>
    <P>At Report Stage of the Finance Bill, I indicated that there are a number of issues which must be considered. Issues such as tax equity and Exchequer cost, particularly if tax breaks given to credit union savers had to be extended to savers in other financial institutions. In addition, there is also an EU dimension which must be considered in full. The corporation tax exemption for credit union, which I renewed last year, has been questioned as a State aid in Brussels. I understand that one consideration apparently influencing the Commission in taking a benign attitude to this exemption is that the members themselves are liable to income tax on the dividends. However, this benign attitude might change if we were to exempt dividends from income tax.</P>
    <P>The different views expressed in the working group reflect the complexity of this issue and the need to examine carefully all the implications before coming forward with firm proposals.</P>
    <P>I am still considering this report and as of yet have no proposals to amend the law in this regard.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that a person (details supplied) in Dublin 4 has been seeking to have his pension entitlements finalised and enhanced in accordance with the years of service that he had with the Civil Service and Irish public bodies prior to his retirement following the sale of the company in which he was an employee; the steps, if any, he will take to ensure that a reasonable and proper settlement can be made; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have examined this case personally. There are a number of difficulties associated with the pension terms sought by the individual concerned, who was seconded for a number of years from one public service body to another and who then retired from the first body.</P>
      <P>The principle is that public service pensions are based on the salary which was payable by the organisation which employed the individual at the time of retirement and on the individual's pensionable service, including seconded service with another organisation. In this case, the individual was awarded a pension in accordance with the rules of the pension scheme of the public service body which employed him and from which he was seconded to the other public service body. and the award took account of the period of seconded service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Against this background, it would not be appropriate for me to alter the position taken by my Department that the retirement benefits payable to the individual in question should be those provided by the pension scheme of the organis<Col N="614" /> ation which actually employed him. In particular the pension benefits should be determined on the basis of substantive salary levels within the organisation concerned and not on the basis of a higher pay level applying during secondment.</P>

      <P>The employment status of building and construction workers who are self-employed under the C45 system but who wish to pay tax and PRSI as normal employees is primarily a matter of fact and law for the individuals involved. I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that self-employed building and construction workers, like all other self-employed individuals, pay tax under the self-assessment tax system and that employees pay tax under the PAYE system. The Commissioners must of course be satisfied that the correct taxation system is being used. In this context it should be noted that during 1997/1998 the Revenue Commissioners undertook a very intensive special project to monitor all aspects of compliance in the construction industry. In the course <Col N="616" /> of that project more than 7,000 principal contractors were visited. No problems were found in 52 per cent of cases. Of the balance, 76 per cent agreed with Revenue rulings. The remainder are subject to different aspects of follow-up action which may include additional visits, a comprehensive Revenue audit and assessments of additional tax where necessary.</P>
      <P>I am also informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they have recently produced two new booklets as guides for principal contractors and subcontractors to assist them in making the correct decisions in these matters. Copies of the booklets will be sent to the Deputy under separate cover.</P>

    <P>The overall level of staffing within the Ombudsman's office has risen from 36 in 1996 to its current level of 59. This includes staff dealing with the Freedom of Information Act and the Public Offices Commission. However, the number of staff dealing with complaints from the general public has risen from 35 in 1996 to 42 at present, including five staff who are assigned to the Ombudsman function when not required for Referendum Commission work.</P>
    <P>Whilst the office has seen an increase of over 13 per cent in complaints within the Ombudsman's remit over the last three years, it is clear from the table that the proportion of complaints finalised is very high &ndash; nearly 100 per cent over the three years. This does not suggest any difficulty with staffing levels in the office.</P>

      <P>Disability benefit (DB) became a taxable source of income with effect from 6 April 1993 while unemployment benefit (UB) was brought into taxation with effect from 6 April 1994. There have been a number of changes in the arrangements for the taxation of these benefits since then which have resulted in some differences in the tax treatment currently applying. These are outlined below.</P>
      <P>UB paid to those on systematic short time work was made exempt from taxation in the 1994 Finance Act. This measure, which initially had effect only for the 1994/95 tax year, has been extended in each subsequent Finance Act. This relief relates to the unique position of those on systematic short time work.</P>
      <P>In the 1995 budget the Minister for Finance announced certain chances on foot of the statement in the Government's policy agreement that the method of taxing UB and DB would be restructured in order to improve the position of those most adversely affected. First, to assist families, the child dependant additions payable with UB and DB were made exempt from tax. Second, the first £10 per week of UB was also made exempt from tax from 6 April 1995.</P>
      <P>The 1997 budget announced certain concessions in relation to the taxation of DB arising from commitments in P2000. A three week exemption was introduced for the 1997/98 tax year, while the administrative arrangements were being put in place, with a six week exemption applying from the 1998/99 tax year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be clear therefore that the differences which exist between the tax treatment of UB and DB reflect both the honouring of commitments since taxation of the benefits was introduced, and <Col N="618" /> also the differing nature of the benefits. Taking all these factors in to account, the current system can be considered fair.</P>

It has not been specifically surveyed to determine the impact on the river of the development mentioned. Kilkenny Corporation wrote to the Office of Public Works in September 1992 and were responded to by the national monuments division, who drew attention to the necessity to have an archaeologist on site during any works. This division has since transferred to the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands. The development in question was advanced prior to the Office of Public Works commencing investigation of the flooding problem in Kilkenny and, in any case, it does not have any adverse effects in times of flooding.</P>

      <Quest>if the increase in the rate of corporate tax from 10 to 25 per cent to the working of minerals in section 66 of the Finance Bill, 1999, applies to the working of limestone quarries; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>Section 71 of the Finance Bill, 1999, as passed by Dáil Éireann, provides that the standard rate of corporation tax is to be reduced on a phased basis to 12.5 per cent. The standard rate is to be 28 per cent for the year 1999, 24 per cent for the year 2000, 20 per cent for the year 2001, 16 per cent for the year 2002 and 12.5 per cent for the year 2003 and subsequent years.</P>
      <P>Section 73 of the Bill provides for the imposition, with effect from the year 2000, of a higher 25 per cent rate of corporation tax on certain profits of companies. In line with the budget announcement, the 25 per cent rate is to apply, <i>inter alia</i>, to income from the exploitation of oil, gas and mineral resources.. However, an amendment introduced at Committee Stage of the Bill will ensure that the 25 per cent rate will not apply to any manufacturing activity involving the use or conversion of minerals and stone substances. Consequently, those mining operations, including relevant limestone quarries, which currently qualify as manufacturing for the purposes of the 10 per cent rate of corporation tax will continue to do so and, when entitlement to manufacturing relief expires, will qualify for the 12.5 per cent rate of corporation tax.</P>

      <P>I am still considering this report and as of yet have no proposals to amend the law in this regard.</P>
      <P>On Report Stage of the Finance Bill, I indicated that there are a number of issues which must be considered. Issues such as tax equity and Exchequer cost, particularly if tax breaks given to credit union savers had to be extended to savers in other financial institutions. In addition, there is also an EU dimension which must be considered in full. The corporation tax exemption for credit unions, which I renewed last year, has been questioned as a State aid in Brussels. I understand that one consideration apparently influencing the Commission in taking a benign attitude to this exemption is that the members themselves are liable to income tax on the dividends. However, this benign attitude might change if we were to exempt dividends from income tax.</P>
      <P>The different views expressed in the working group reflect the complexity of this issue and the need to examine carefully all the implications before coming forward with firm proposals.</P>

      <P>In 1997, the Government established an Interdepartmental Year 2000 Monitoring Committee to oversee the achievement of year 2000 compliance for IT systems and other office equipment and plant in the Civil Service. This committee is made up of four private sector representatives and eight civil servants at principal officer level. The chair and secretariat are provided by my Department.</P>
      <P>The committee levies status updates on each Department/office; seeks self-assessments of year 2000 programmes from chairpersons of departmental Y2K monitoring committees; and interviews Y2K programme managers on their work programmes from time to time. Based on this process, the committee reports every two months to Government on the progress being achieved. The committee has reported on six occasions to date. It is preparing its seventh report for submission to Government in early-mid April 1999.</P>
      <P>Since December 1997, the committee has met in full on 15 occasions. In addition, a number of committee subgroups have met on six occasions. The committee will continue to monitor Departments/offices under March 2000 at the earliest to ensure a smooth transition through the millennium changeover period and through the leap year date. It will continue to meet as necessary during this time.</P>

      <P>Work to deal with the year 2000 problem has been under way since 1996 and covers the Civil Service and public services agencies. The Government is regularly informed on the position.</P>
      <P>As there are no precedents, it is widely recognised that it is difficult to anticipate exactly what remedial action will be necessary and the total costs involved. I am, however, satisfied that the substantial contingency sum of £40 million I have set aside should be adequate to cover any necessary additional expenditure that may arise.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the contingency sum is to provide for necessary expenditure in relation to the year 2000 problem to the extent it cannot be met from normal allocations.</P>
      <P>No moneys have as yet been expended from this contingency sum, and I do not expect that such expenditure will be required until later in the year, when it will be easier to judge the extent to which existing allocations may need to be supplemented.</P>

      <P>As I have stated in response to questions from Deputy Michael Noonan and Deputy Derek McDowell on 25 February, the question of free or discounted shares for customers only arises in the case of organisations such as mutual building societies which are owned by their customers. This does not apply in the case of TSB or any of the State companies such as ACC or ICC. The proceeds from the sale of TSB and public assets will accrue to the Exchequer. However, subject to confirmation that there are no problems in relation to domestic or EU legal requirements, I am prepared to reserve a specific number of shares at the offer price for longstanding customers of ACC-TSB when floated on the Stock Exchange. I have advertised for advisers in relation to the flotation process and the question of an allotment of shares at the offer price to longstanding customers is one of the issues that will be examined in detail by these advisers.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is referring to the disabled drivers and disabled passengers scheme. The medical criteria for the purposes of the tax concession under this scheme are set out in the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994, copies of which are available in the Dáil Library. I would also refer the Deputy to the Adjournment Debate in this House on 2 March 1999 which comprehensive dealt with the workings of this scheme.</P>
      <P>Six different types of disablement are listed under the regulations and a qualifying person must satisfy one or more of them. It is the nature and the extent of the disability which determines a person's eligibility under the scheme rather than the circumstances which have given rise to that disability. The scheme targets relief at those persons who are severely and permanently disabled with regard to physical mobility. Where a person meets the medical criteria, the relevant senior area medical officer issues a primary medical certificate for presentation to the Revenue Commissioners. Where the issue of such a certificate is refused, the person concerned may appeal that decision to the Disabled Drivers' Medical Board of Appeal, an independent board, whose decision is final.</P>

The cost of the services of a general practitioner, the cost of periods of treatment in hospital and the cost of drugs or medicines supplies by a practitioner would be allowable for the purposes of section 469.

      <P>Apart from any tax implications, there are no exchange control restrictions on moving funds out of the State.</P>
      <P>The Exchange Control Act, 1954, empowered the Minister for Finance to impose certain obligations and restrictions on Irish residents of foreign currency dealings and certain other financial transactions. The main purpose of these controls was to safeguard official external reserves and to regulate the effects of capital movements on the exchange rate of the Irish pound. A phased relaxation of exchange controls was announced on 13 November 1987 to commence in 1988. The Exchange Control (Continuance) Act, 1990, provided that the 1954 Act would continue in operation until 31 December 1992 and would then expire. Therefore, as and from 1 January 1993, exchange controls no longer exist.</P>

      <P>The funding of services, such as respite care and <Col N="637" /> residential services, for people with disabilities is a matter for the relevant health board.</P>
      <P>This year, a total of £13.4 million additional funding is being provided for the maintenance and development of services for people with physical and sensory disabilities. Of this, £3 million, rising to £6 million on a full year cost basis in the year 2000, is for the development of services and £4 million is for capital projects. The North-Eastern Health Board was allocated £0.270 million for development of services and £0.270 million for capital projects in its functional area. The setting of priorities for the allocation of this funding is a matter for the board in consultation with its Co-ordinating Committee on Physical and Sensory Disability Services.</P>
      <P>In relation to services to persons with a mental handicap, additional revenue funding of £12 million is being provided in 1999 for new services, with a full year cost of £18 million in the year 2000.</P>
      <P>The additional revenue funding of £18 million will provide 320 new residential places, 80 new respite places, 200 new day places, health related support services for children with autism, the continuation of the programme to transfer persons with a mental handicap from psychiatric hospitals and other inappropriate placements and additional specialist and other support services.</P>
      <P>Of this funding, £1.273 million was provided to the North-Eastern Health Board in 1999, with a full year cost of £1.595 million in 2000, for the development of new residential-respite places, day places, health related support services for children with autism and the transfer of clients from inappropriate placements. It is estimated that this funding will enable the board, in consultation with its Regional Mental Handicap Co-ordinating Committee, to provide 28 new residential places and seven new respite places.</P>

      <P>Radiotherapy is a highly specialised and capital intensive service. Because of its complexity and the considerable cost involved, there are currently just two public radiotherapy facilities in Ireland. These are in St. Luke's Hospital, Dublin and Cork University Hospital. However, I am pleased to say that a third public radiotherapy facility will be provided as part of the major development of University College Hospital Galway. I also approved, recently, the provision of a second linear accelerator for the radiotherapy unit at Cork University Hospital.</P>

      <P>The information sought by the Deputy is not collected by my Department. Hospital consultants are expected to discharge their responsibilities to public patients in line with the contract they hold.</P>
      <P>The present consultants' contract is designed to protect public patients in that a consultant's entitlement to off-site private practice should not result in any neglect of public patients. With regard to on-site private practice, a consultant's overall proportion of private to public patients should reflect the ratio of public to private beds in a hospital as designated under the 1991 Health (Amendment) Act.</P>
      <P>Local management is charged with ensuring that the terms of the contract are discharged including the scheduled commitment to public patients. The contract includes a grievance procedure which can be used in the event of non-compliance by either party with its terms and conditions. In addition, an employer can also invoke the disciplinary procedures where necessary.</P>

      <P>The Dental Council is largely independent in the exercise of its functions under the Dentists Act, 1985 [No. 9 of 1985].</P>
      <P>The provisions of the Dentists Act do not, in my view, require the Dental Council to make a scheme for establishing a class of auxiliary dental worker to operate independently of the registered dental practitioner.</P>
      <P>There are powers available to me under section 55 of the Act to direct the Dental Council to produce a scheme for a particular class of auxiliary dental worker but the content of such a scheme is a matter for the Dental Council in the first instance. I am advised that while schemes are subject to my consent I do not have powers of amendment.</P>
      <P>Some years ago, at the request of the Minister for Health, the Dental Council brought forward a draft scheme for a class of auxiliary dental worker to be known as a clinical dental technician. The clinical dental technician could operate independently, in accordance with the provisions of section 54 of the Act, in the fitting, insertion or fixing of artificial teeth.</P>
      <P>The draft scheme required a high academic standard and was not acceptable in its present format by some groups who would be directly affected by its introduction.</P>
      <P>The position in other member states of the European Union regarding the fitting of artificial teeth by persons other than dentists varies widely. Denturists are known to operate in the Netherlands, Denmark, Spain and Portugal. In the Netherlands denturism is deregulated. The other countries where denturists operate require that they be well trained and competent in laboratory techniques and in the provision of clinical prosthesis.</P>

      <P>The provision of orthodontic treatment to eligible persons in the Midland Health Board area and the maintenance of waiting lists are the statutory responsibility of the Midland Health Board.</P>
      <P>I have had inquiries made of the Midland Health Board. I understand that the number of teenage children on the waiting list is 645. The number of children on the waiting list at the end of 1997 was 711. The length of time on the waiting list depends on what age the teenage children are, when placed on the waiting list but the average waiting period is approximately two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite several attempts the Midland Health Board has not been successful to date in the <Col N="645" /> recruitment of a consultant orthodontist. The board is continuing its efforts and is hopeful that it will be successful in the near future. The successful recruitment of a consultant orthodontist by the board should enable it to further increase treatment levels and further reduce waiting times.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of persons aged over 65 who are covered by the drug cost subsidisation scheme is 22,380.</P>
      <P>The primary aim of the new drug payment scheme is to bring about important improvements in the existing schemes. The new scheme will effectively merge the best elements of the two existing schemes and is designed to significantly improve the cash flow situation for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.</P>
      <P>The new family scheme will have significant advantages over the existing drug refund scheme. Under the drug refund scheme, families and individuals pay the full cost of their prescription medicines and may, at the end of the quarter, claim reimbursement from their health board of expenditure over £90 in that calendar quarter. Many families and individuals have very heavy expenditure on drugs and medicines in a quarter and have to wait a further six weeks from the end of that quarter before they receive a refund. This can cause considerable cash flow problems for a significant number of families and individuals. This will not happen under the new drug payment scheme. From the introduction of the new scheme, no individual or family will have to pay more than £42 per month for prescribed medicines. It means that families and individuals will, for the first time, be able to budget for the cost of medicines. Families and individuals will know that, whatever the size of their drugs bill, they will not have to pay more than £42 per month. In addition there are families where, although one member may qualify for a drug cost subsidisation scheme card, combined expenditure on medicines by other members, which can be considerable, cannot be recouped until the end of the quarter. With the new drug payment scheme, no family will have to pay more than £42 in any month for prescribed medicines. The new scheme will be of significant benefit to such families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact that the drug payment scheme will operate on a monthly basis has distinct advan<Col N="646" /> tages over the current drug refund scheme. Under the drug refund scheme, a family or an individual could, for example in one month have expenditure of say £80 but no expenditure in the other two months. They would not have been entitled to a refund. Under the new scheme, they will only have to pay £42 in that month.</P>
    <P>There are no qualifying criteria for inclusion on the new drug payment scheme. Where expenditure by a family or an individual exceeds £42 per month on prescribed medicines, the balance will be met by the State. This is in contrast to the old DCSS scheme, where patients had to be certified by their doctor as suffering from a condition requiring ongoing expenditure on medicines in excess of £32 per month.</P>
    <P>With regard to the increase in the threshold, the position is that there has been no increase in the threshold for the existing schemes since 1991. It must also be borne in mind that the new threshold refers to family expenditure as opposed to the existing threshold in the drug cost subsidisation scheme which relates to individual expenditure.</P>
    <P>As the new scheme is designed to be more user-friendly for individuals and families incurring expenditure on prescribed drugs and medicines in excess of £42 per month, it is expected that the uptake for the scheme will be broadly in line with the combined uptake of the drug cost subsidisation and drug refund schemes.</P>
    <P>I would also point out that where an individual or a family is subjected to a significant level of on-going expenditure on medical expenses &ndash; general practitioner fees, prescribed drugs etc. &ndash; due to a long-term medical condition these expenses may be reckoned in determining eligibility for a medical card. In some cases a medical card may issue to a family member on a personal basis. Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board to decide.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is Department policy that, on medical grounds, the delivery of babies should take place in consultant staffed maternity units. This policy is in line with the recommendations of the Comhairle na nOspidéal report, Development of Hospital Maternity Services, which examined in detail the objectives of health care in relation to maternity services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report of the Maternity and Infant Care Scheme Review Group, which was circulated in April 1997, gave a strong endorsement to Department policy on this issue. However, the report also recognised that one of the main reasons women opt to give birth at home is their desire for a positive experience in friendly, familiar surroundings where they retain full control. The health boards' chief executive officers established an expert group to consider a number of <Col N="650" /> approaches suggested by the review group in relation to domiciliary births and to make recommendations on long-term policy and on the procedures and protocols which may be necessary. Funding has been provided in 1999 for the piloting of a number of approaches suggested.</P>
    <P>It is generally accepted that current Department policy has contributed to the marked decrease in the level of maternal, perinatal and infant mortality. At present Ireland's maternal mortality rates are amongst the best in the world, reflecting the excellent ante-natal and obstetric services available in this country. While arrangements must be made for those who wish to give birth at home, the safety and welfare of both mother and infant must at all times take priority.</P>

      <P>This report was conducted under the aegis of the Coombe Women's Hospital and funded by the Department of Health. The study relates to the five year period 1981-5 and, as the Deputy states, <Col N="651" /> was completed in 1992. In view of the time which elapsed between the commencement of the study and its completion it was decided not to publish the report.</P>
      <P>The report was, however, made available to the Maternity and Infant Care Review Group which considered, <i>inter alia</i>, the question of domiciliary births. In its report, which was circulated in 1997, the review group made recommendations in relation to domiciliary births. Funding has been provided in 1999 for the piloting of a number of the approaches suggested.</P>

      <P>There are nine intensive care unit beds provided at Tallaght Hospital and I am satisfied with this number. Seven of these beds are currently in use.</P>
      <P>I can also confirm that similar sized hospitals in the Dublin region who are comparable to Tallaght Hospital have a similar allocation of intensive care unit beds. For example, in comparison to Tallaght Hospital, St Vincent's Hospital has eight intensive care unit beds with seven of these beds currently in use.</P>
      <P>Obviously the complexity of an individual hospital's case mix is also a factor in determining its requirements for these type of beds.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board. Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Income guidelines have been drawn up by the chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these are revised annually in line with the consumer price index. However, these guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers <Col N="652" /> that his or her medical needs or other circumstances would justify this.</P>
    <P>I have asked the chief executive officer of the Southern Health Board to investigate the assessment of income from home help for entitlement to a medical card and to reply directly to you.</P>

      <P>The provision of accident and emergency services at St Columcille's Hospital, Loughlinstown, is a matter, in the first instance, for the Eastern Health Board. I understand from the board that the level of accident and emergency consultant cover at St. Columcille's Hospital and, indeed, across the south-east Dublin region is under examination at present by a joint sub-committee of the South-East Dublin Departments of Surgery and Medicine.</P>
      <P>In addition, the chairmen of the three Dublin paediatric hospitals have agreed to set up a joint council to identify specific actions needed to facilitate necessary changes and development in the delivery of paediatric services in the Dublin area. My Department has indicated its approval to the establishment of this forum. It is intended that the joint council will be in a position to report before the end of the year and the issue of the provision of paediatric services to Dublin south-east has already been identified by my Department as an area which we wish to have the council's views on.</P>

This necessarily involves the identification of staffing requirements and the deployment of staff within the overall financial and employment levels set by my Department. Each agency, on receipt of its annual level of financial determination and as part of its preparation of an annual service plan, makes decisions with regard to the staffing levels and the skills mix it requires to provide an agreed level of service within overall financial allocation.</P>

The assistant inspector is satisfied that the consultant psychiatrist in charge of his wife's care made every effort to meet with the person in question.

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The guidelines determining the eligibility for receipt of a domiciliary care allowance are covered in Circular No. 24/73. When a child is assessed for eligibility, the medical officer decides if the condition is likely to change at some later date and hence the medical officer will arrange for a medical review.</P>
      <P>If the condition is considered permanent then a review may be carried out at periodic intervals based on the child's needs and specific circumstances. These reviews are not carried out simply to determine the permanency of a recipient's condition but also to ensure that the services available and the care plan in place meet, to the extent possible, the needs of the recipient on an ongoing basis and to ensure that the child continues to reside at home. These issues can affect entitlement to the allowance.</P>
      <P>Reviews are also necessary for the purposes of the health board's financial accountability. Where such reviews are carried out, the cost is included in the overall cost of the health board's community care programme and it is not possible to isolate the medical cost of the review.</P>
      <P>Health boards are requested to carry out all reviews in a sensitive manner to minimise any distress to the recipients or their carers. However, if the Deputy is aware of a specific case requiring attention she should supply me with the details and I will arrange to have the matter investigated further.</P>

      <P>The development at Tullamore General Hospital will proceed in two phases. The first will involve the great bulk of the work to be carried out, such as new entrance and concourse, medical and sur<Col N="655" /> gical wards, accident and emergency department, radiology department, intensive care-coronary care unit, and a range of ambulatory day care facilities including the out-patient department, day theatre, oncology unit and renal services.</P>
      <P>The second phase of the project, which will include the education centre and Midland Health Board headquarters, will complete the development.</P>
      <P>The detailed planning of this project has now commenced and it is hoped to commence construction next year. Given its size, the timescale for the completion of the facilities will be about three years from the time that building starts.</P>
      <P>I must emphasise that the development at Tullamore General Hospital will benefit all of the people of the Midland Health Board. The hospital provides regional specialties in orthopaedics and ENT, and improvements in these services will be to the advantage of everyone in the Midland Health Board area.</P>
      <P>The development means that all three acute hospitals in the Midland Health Board area are the subject of significant investment. I provided over £2 million to open Phase 2A of Longford-Westmeath General Hospital, a development that had remained idle for a lengthy period while the last Government was in office. I have also approved the detailed planning stage of the acute psychiatric unit at Portlaoise General Hospital together with approval to expanding the project to include a new paediatric unit.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Midland Health Board's own plan for the development of acute hospital facilities involves, firstly, Phase 2A of Longford-Westmeath General Hospital, which is now complete, followed by the developments at Tullamore and Portlaoise, followed by Phase 2B of Longford-Westmeath General Hospital.</P>

      <P>I am aware of reports of certain adverse reactions in relation to Roaccutane, including reports suggesting possible linkages between this product and depression, including suicidal tendencies. Roaccutane &ndash; isotretinoin &ndash; is a vitamin A derivative used in the treatment of acne. In Ireland, it is authorised by the Irish Medicines Board for the treatment of severe acne, unresponsive to other treatments, and its availability is limited in that it must be prescribed and its use monitored by a specialist dermatologist.</P>
      <P>The Irish Medicines Board has in the past, and continues on an ongoing basis, to actively monitor all available data on Roaccutane, including reports of adverse reactions, which it reviews both internally with its experts and with the other European regulatory agencies. In addition, the board has also recently reviewed the terms of the authorisation for the product with the company. As a result of this, revised wording for inclusion in the prescribing information for the product, outlining the current position regarding its use and warnings related to the possible development of psychiatric reactions were agreed. The warnings refer to possible side effects including depression, psychotic symptoms and of rare reports of suicide associated with Roaccutane. The revised warnings have been incorporated into the authorisation documents for the product and the company has circularised all physicians and pharmacists outlining the new warnings regarding the use of Roaccutane.</P>
      <P>Whilst I am aware of recent calls for an independent inquiry into the matter of adverse reactions to Roaccutane, I do not consider it necessary for me to establish or carry out any such inquiry into the matter, particularly as the Irish Medicines Board, an independent statutory body with a specific remit in this area, is already engaged in monitoring those adverse reactions reported to it.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 342 to 346, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The report of the Review Group on Health and Personal Social Services for People with Physical and Sensory Disabilities, Towards an Independent Future, published in December 1996 sets out the requirements for the development of these services, including speech and language therapy services. The report recommended that 150 new speech and language therapy posts be put in place over the next ten years. As also recommended in the report, regional co-ordinating committees for services for people with physical and sensory disabilities have been put in place in each of the health boards. One of the primary functions of the co-ordinating committees is to advise the chief executive officer of each board on priorities for the allocation of funds available for the development of the services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the report was published three new speech and language therapy posts were created in 1997 and ten new speech and language therapy posts in 1998. The setting of priorities for the development of services, including speech and language therapy services, in 1999 is being discussed by the health boards with their local co-ordinating committees. At present, there are 229.1 whole time equivalent speech and language therapy posts in the health boards providing services in the community to both children and adults with physical and sensory disabilities and <Col N="658" /> this service continues to be identified by all health boards as a priority service for development.</P>
    <P>While the speech and language therapy service provided to adults is generally more limited than that provided to children, it does include assessment, diagnosis and treatment. The current waiting list for children awaiting speech and language therapy services averages one year. The waiting time varies depending on the clients priority rating which is determined at the time of the initial assessment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 348 and 349 together.</P>
      <P>As at 31 December 1998 the latest date for which figures are available, the number of public patients awaiting over three months for cardiac surgery at Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin was 73.</P>
      <P>Following discussions in 1997 between Our Lady's hospital and officials from my Department it was considered that a range of measures should be implemented to alleviate pressure on cardiac surgery services at the hospital and resources for the implementation of these measures were provided by my Department under the cardiac waiting list initiative. One of the measures agreed was that, as an interim measure, the hospital should enter negotiations with suitable UK facilities for the purchase of additional cardiac surgery procedures. Under this initiative 18 children were referred to the UK in 1997, of these 18, ten were referred to Great Ormond Street Hospital, London. In 1998, 30 children were referred to the UK and of these 30, 21 were referred to Great Ormond Street. The purchase of additional cardiac procedures from the UK will continue in 1999 and it is expected that a further 30 patients will be transferred.</P>
      <P>Our Lady's hospital currently perform an average of five cardiothoracic procedures a week. However, as the Deputy may be aware I have a recently granted approval to the hospital to appoint a design team for the theatre development at the hospital. When complete the new theatre development will provide five new operating theatres complete with ancillary accommodation, a day surgery area and a central sterile supplies department. The existing theatre facilities will be upgraded to provide a further two theatre suites. It is expected that when these theatres are fully commissioned Our Lady's hospital will be in a position to perform an additional 100 paediatric cardiac procedures which is a 40 per cent increase on existing capacity.</P>
      <P>The estimated completion date for the development is 2002. However, the timing of the completion of planning and tendering and the commencement and completion of construction for the development will depend on several variable factors which are difficult to assess accurately in advance and it is not possible, therefore to give a precise timetable for this project.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Deputy may wish to note, that I recently approved the appointment of an additional consultant cardiothoracic surgeon and a consultant cardiologist to the hospital and I understand that the process of appointing suitable persons to these posts is under way.</P>

Chiropractice lies within the field of alternative medicine which is outside the scope of the Act and there are no current plans within my Department to include it.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department publishes a wide range of health statistics including health services data, health status and lifestyle indicators, and vital statistics. Most recently in mid-February 1999, the public health information system was launched on electronic media. This system is distributed on CD-ROM and includes detailed current health statistics on demography, mortality, fertility and hospitalisation. It is intended to serve as a public health common data set to monitor key health indicators at regional and national level. The first results of the National Health and Lifestyle Survey carried out during 1998 have also been recently released.</P>
      <P>Partly as a result of the extensive work required in the development of the public health information system, there have been unavoidable delays in the publication of a hardcopy annual report on health statistics. However, most of the statistical tables which form the content of the annual report continue to be available publicly on the Department's Internet website where they are regularly updated. From the perspectives of efficiency, timeliness, and accessibility, the Internet is without doubt the optimum medium for the dissemination of health statistics. Nevertheless, it is accepted that there is a continuing need for paper-based statistical reports at regular intervals. Work is now well advanced on a more comprehensive report which will bring data right up to 1998 inclusive. In line with departmental strategy towards the achievement of measurable health and social gain, much more data than previously will be included on health status and lifestyle indicators. It is expected that this report will be ready for publication in about three months.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 354, 355 and 366 together.</P>
      <P>Hepatitis B vaccination is recommended for health care personnel, certain patients and their family contacts, security and emergency services personnel who may be at high risk and susceptible members of high risk groups. The immunisation advisory committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland advised my Department in 1998 that vaccination against hepatitis A and B is also recommended for persons with hepatitis C. My Department advised the designated units in January 1999 to implement this recommendation in the treatment of hepatitis C patients. The recommendation is applicable to all patients suffering from hepatitis C, irrespective of how they may have contracted the disease. The cost of such immunisation is borne by the health agencies in which the patients are treated, from within their financial allocation from my Department.</P>
      <P>My Department does not have precise information on the number of persons suffering from hepatitis C, which is not a separate infectious disease for notification purposes. The number of cases of viral hepatitis unspecified, under which cases of hepatitis C would be reported, notified to my Department for each of the last five years is as follows: 1994, 60; 1995, 66; 1996, 67; 1997, 122; 1998, 147 (provisional)</P>
      <P>Approximately 1,600 people were infected with hepatitis C through the administration within the State of blood and blood products.</P>
      <P>Beaumont Hospital and the South-Eastern Health Board have informed my Department that the number of hepatitis C patients who received vaccinations against hepatitis A and B in 1998 and up to February 1999 was as follows:</P>

      <P>Section 4(1)(d) of the Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal Act, 1997, provides that any person who is responsible for the care of a person who has been diagnosed positive for hepatitis C through the administration within the State of blood or blood products, and who has incurred financial loss or expenses as a direct result of providing such care arising from the person being cared for having contracted hepatitis C, may make a claim for compensation to the hepatitis C compensation tribunal.</P>
      <P>With regard to compensation for persons with haemophilia who have been infected with HIV and hepatitis C, the Government, at its meeting of 23 February 1999, noted the Irish Haemophilia Society's concerns in relation to its perception of the inadequacy of the compensation available for such persons, affirmed its commitment to fair and equitable compensation, and asked me, following detailed discussions with the society, to revert to Government with proposals to address any inadequacy in the current compensation arrangements in a fair and equitable manner. Discussions are currently taking place with the Irish Haemophilia Society on this matter.</P>

      <P>The data sought by the Deputy is not routinely gathered by my Department. I am having inquiries made of the health boards and I will communicate further with the Deputy in the matter.</P>
      <P>However, having regard to the recommendations of the report, Towards an Independent Future, this Government, since taking office, has made almost £37 million available by way of additional funding to the physical and sensory disability sector. This includes special allocations for the provision of aids and appliances by way of Supplementary Estimate in 1997 and 1998 totalling £8.325 million and almost £1 million from the capital programme last year. The amount allocated to each health board from these sources is given in the attached table. I should point out that the bulk of the money in 1997 was channelled via the Eastern Health Board to national voluntary organisations, providing services in the sector, which are headquartered in the board's area.</P>
      <P>This year, additional funding of £13.4 million has been allocated for the maintenance and development of services in the sector including capital supports. However, it is not possible to say at this stage what amount of this funding will be spent on aids and appliances.</P>

      <P>At present the scheme does not cover children under the age of two years, since all children in that age group are regarded as requiring constant care and attention.

My policy is to develop the range of services as a whole, having regard to available resources, in accordance with the recommendations of the report of the Review Group on Health and Personal Social Services for People with Physical and Sensory Disabilities, Towards an Independent Future.</P>
      <P>Out of a total of £13.4 million provided this year, £3 million revenue, rising to £6 million on a full year cost basis in the year 2000, is for the development of services.

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the provision of speech and language therapy services in the eastern region is the responsibility of the Eastern Health Board. As it would not be appropriate to provide the information sought by the Deputy in relation to the individual concerned by way of a parliamentary question, I have asked the health board to examine this matter and to respond directly to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The recruitment of additional multidisciplinary support staff, including speech and language therapists, for services to persons with disabilities in the eastern region is a matter for the Eastern Health Board in consultation with the Central Mental Handicap Planning Committee and the Physical and Sensory Disability Co-ordinating Committee in line with the priorities for service developments which have been identified for the region by these committees.</P>
      <P>Following a Labour Court Recommendation in 1997, an expert group has been established to examine and report on various issues relating to paramedical grades, including speech and language therapists. One of the issues to be examined by this group is the problems which arise in relation to the recruitment and the retention of various paramedical grades. It is anticipated that the report of this group will be completed later this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Interdepartmental Committee on Paraguayan Adoptions established in late 1996 first met in December 1996. The committee consisted of representatives from the Departments of Health <Col N="673" /> and Children, Education and Science, Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Foreign Affairs, Social, Community and Family Affairs and the Office of the Attorney General. The committee was chaired by an Assistant Secretary from the Department of Health and Children and was established to examine both the legal position with regard to simple Paraguayan adoptions and the practical difficulties being encountered by families who adopted children from Paraguay. I did not receive a formal report from the committee, but my officials briefed me on its conclusions.</P>
      <P>The committee found no practical problems being encountered by these children in the area of access to child benefit, health and education services. The committee could not address the legal and practical problems relating to citizenship and inheritance rights as these were matters that could only be resolved in the overall context of having the simple Paraguayan adoptions effected by Irish residents converted into full adoptions under Paraguayan law.</P>
      <P>A number of parents of adopted Paraguayan children are currently pursuing the conversion of their simple adoptions to full adoptions under Paraguayan law and I have made every effort to assist them with this undertaking. I have written to the Paraguayan courts in support of their case and provided statements on Irish law on the recognition of foreign adoptions as required by their Paraguayan lawyer. My officials also met with representatives of the Parents of Adopted Paraguayan Children, in February 1999 to consult them on the proposals for the legislation to ratify the Hague Convention on Intercountry Adoptions.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 383, 384, 385 and 386 together.</P>
      <P>The administration of the registration system, including the services and facilities provided at Joyce House is statutorily a matter for An tArd-Chláraitheoir (Registrar-General) of Births, Deaths and Marriages and for the superintendent registrar, Dublin, and registrars, who operate under his general direction.</P>
      <P>There are two separate offices located at Joyce House issuing certificates of births, deaths and marriages, the General Register Office and the above-mentioned superintendent registrar's office on the ground floor, which provides certificates for all births, deaths and Roman Catholic marriages occurring within the Dublin city and county area.</P>
      <P>There have been some difficulties with these services from time to time but a number of measures have been taken to improve the situation. The Eastern Health Board, which is responsible for the administration of the superintendent registrar's office, has secured a lease on a premises adjoining the offices in Lombard Street. The necessary refurbishment has been completed and this building will open within the next couple of weeks. Registrars of Births, Deaths and Marriages, who are currently located in temporary accommodation on the third floor in Joyce House will be relocated into the new accommodation, which has been specially adapted to ensure that people are enabled to conduct sensitive registration matters with an appropriate degree of privacy. The board has also taken steps to improve staffing levels in the superintendent registrar's office in order to improve the rate of production of certificates.</P>
      <P>In May 1998, my Department made the above mentioned accommodation available on the third floor in Joyce House to enable Registrars of Births, Deaths and Marriages to vacate space on the ground floor of that office. The provision of this accommodation on the ground floor facilitated the extension of the waiting area in the superintendent registrar's office and improved waiting facilities for applicants for certificates. The registrars were moved to more spacious temporary accommodation and this ensured a greater level of privacy and comfort to people registering births and deaths, than had previously been available.</P>
      <P>The transfer of the registrars to the new building will facilitate further improvements within the General Register Office itself. The improvements planned include the extension of the present public search room to cater for the increased interest in family research. I also understand that the General Register Office is currently experiencing some delays in responding to postal applications but that additional resources have been provided to resolve this particular problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy may be aware, the General Register Office archive conversion project is currently under way in Roscommon. This project <Col N="678" /> involves the capture of the records of over 150 years of births, deaths and marriages and associated indexes. It will be appreciated that the computerisation of these records and indexes will make a major contribution to the delivery of a flexible, effective and efficient service. It is intended that when this work is completed, including the development of a sophisticated retrieval system that the General Register Office will relocate to Roscommon. However, a facility for research will also be retained in Dublin.</P>
    <P>In addition to the above-mentioned computerisation of the archival records of the General Register Office, my Department, together with the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs is currently engaged in planning the technological, legislative and structural changes necessary for the computerisation of the registration process.</P>

      <P>Under the Health Act, 1970, a health board may make arrangements for the supply without charge of drugs, medicines or medical and surgical appliances to persons suffering from a prescribed disease or disability of a permanent or long-term nature. Diabetes mellitus and diabetes insipidus are among the prescribed conditions covered in this scheme. The operation of the scheme is primarily a matter for the relevant health board.</P>
      <P>I have referred this case to the Eastern Health Board and have asked the board to communicate directly with the Deputy in the matter.</P>

      <P>The terms of Circular L9/98 of 22 October 1998 require local authorities to submit their assessment of needs and a prioritised list of capital projects for water and waste water infrastructure before the end of June 1999. Kerry County Council's assessment has not yet been received. It might be noted that prior to submitting the assessment, local authorities have been requested to have regard to the views of the public, based on a published draft document, and to have the draft considered by the appropriate strategic policy committee.</P>

      <P>The Local Government (Planning and Development)(No. 3) Regulations, 1997, provide that Part IX of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Regulations, 1994, shall not apply to the development of a facility in relation to which a waste licence is required.</P>
      <P>At the time these regulations were made, there were two applications for ministerial certification under article 119 of the 1994 regulations in respect of proposed waste facilities. These related to proposed landfill developments at Ballynagran-Coolbeg-Kilcandra in County Wicklow and Hardbog, Grangemockler, County Tipperary. A copy of reports prepared within my Department in respect of these applications will be made available to the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The conditions governing the new house grant scheme normally preclude payment of a grant where a person, or the spouse of such person, had previously purchased or built, individually or with each other, another house for his/her own occupation. However, a grant may be allowed where: first, the marriage of the person has been dissolved or annulled by court order, or the person is separated under a court order or deed of separation and, second, the person and any dependants are in need of housing and refusal to pay the grant would cause undue hardship.</P>
      <P>In this particular case, having regard to the fact that the applicant received the entire beneficial interest in the family home, it has not been possible to authorise payment of a grant.</P>

      <P>I refer to the reply to Question No. 51 of 28 January 1999. My Department has maintained close contact with the Irish Detergent and Allied Products Association in relation to the reduction of phosphates in detergents. Three meetings have been held between departmental officials and industry representatives over the past 12 months, with a further meeting arranged for next week. In addition, there have been many other contacts by way of phone, letter and fax. I will be taking a final decision on the possible adoption of a voluntary agreement in this regard within two to three weeks.</P>

      <P>In the case of &ldquo;Euroflex&rdquo; pipe, the certification required is not available in respect of its use for hot water or central heating systems. As a consequence, a total of 57 applications for new house grants have not been paid to date and the applicants have been notified accordingly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 413 and 426 together.</P>
      <P>Local authorities are legally responsible for monitoring compliance by designers, builders and owners of buildings with the building regulations. The authorities are empowered to take any necessary enforcement action, as building control authorities under the Building Control Act, 1990, and not as planning authorities.</P>
      <P>My Department compiles statistics of enforcement activities by local authorities on the basis of returns furnished by the authorities half-yearly, and statistics for 1998 are given in the table following. The statistics do not relate to enforcement to specific parts of the regulations, e.g., Part M &ndash; Access for Disabled Persons.</P>
      <P>While enforcement is legally the responsibility of each local building control authority, I have, since taking office in 1997, actively encouraged and facilitated enforcement in three ways.</P>
      <P>First, I have urged each building control authority to appoint a building control officer and have sanctioned the creation of additional posts, where necessary. Of the 37 relevant authorities, all but three now have building control officers. The balance have assigned officers temporarily to the duties and are making arrangements to make permanent appointments. In addition, my Department in October 1998 requested each local authority manager to assign to a specific access officer the function of co-ordinating and promoting access activities for people with disabilities, supporting local access groups with training, advice, etc. To date, 26 of the 34 major authorities have assigned access officers and I understand that the remaining authorities are in the process of doing so.</P>
      <P>Second, I have asked local authorities to make rapid progress to reaching a target level of inspecting 12 per cent to 15 per cent of developments, as recommended by guidelines adopted by the City and County Managers Association.</P>
      <P>Third, I increased building control fees on 1 July 1998, and introduced a new commencement notice fee &ndash; £25 a house &ndash; for new houses commencing on or after that date. The objective here was to provide local authorities with the necessary financial resources to increase enforcement.</P>
      <P>Finally, I might add that the development and enforcement of Part M of the building regulations will, at the request of my Department, form a core theme of the national conference of the Irish Building Control Institute, IBCI, in Cork on 25 and 26 March 1999. This conference will be formally opened by my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Dan Wallace. Most building control officers are members of the IBCI.</P>

      <P>Section 31(1)(a) of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, allows the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to direct a planning authority to take enforcement action against unauthorised development. This power has never been used as successive Ministers have considered that enforcement of planning law is more appropriately a matter for local planning authorities.</P>

The relevant Irish authorities have commissioned further investigation of certain environmental issues involved and a comprehensive response will be sent to the Commission shortly. A copy of this response will be forwarded to the Deputy when it becomes available, together with related correspondence.</P>

      <P>Briefs for the Schull and Baltimore sewerage schemes were submitted to my Department in 1991, but have not been approved. As these schemes are not included in the 1999 water and sewerage services investment programme, they come within the terms of my Department's Circular letter L9/98 of 22 October 1998, which asked each local authority to undertake a fresh assessment of the needs for capital works in its area and to prepare a prioritised list of projects based on the assessment. The priority lists will be taken into consideration by my Department in framing future water and sewerage services investment programmes under the next National Development Plan 2000-2006.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for the maintenance and improvement of non-national roads lies with local authorities, to be <Col N="700" /> funded from their own resources supplemented by allocations from the local government fund. As part of their allocations, county councils receive discretionary improvement grants and urban authorities receive block grants; the provision of appropriate car parking facilities may be funded by local authorities from these sources. Responsibility for works relating to the national road network lies with the National Roads Authority.</P>
      <P>Under the operational programme for local urban and rural development 1994-1999 and the EU special support programme for peace and reconciliation, grants are available to local authorities for the carrying out of environmental improvement works in urban and village areas. Where the provision of car parking facilities forms part of a project under these programmes, the cost can be considered as part of the eligible expenditure for grant purposes.</P>
      <P>Finally, the 1999 budget included a provision of £2 million for the development on a pilot basis of park and ride facilities in the Dublin area. The Dublin Transportation Office is responsible for allocating funds under this budget line.</P>

    <P>As the Deputy may be aware, relevant housing authorities &ndash; county councils, county borough corporations, borough corporations and Bray and Dundalk Urban District Councils &ndash; are obliged under the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act, 1998, to draw up and implement five year traveller accommodation programmes. I have arranged to send to the Deputy copies of the circular letter and detailed memorandum on the implementation of the Act which issued to local authorities following its enactment. The memorandum incorporates directions issued under a number of sections of the Act. Furthermore, my Department, in conjunction with the housing unit of the Institute of Public Administration, conduc<Col N="701" /> ted a number of seminars for local authority staff involved in the implementation of the Act to appraise them of its requirements.</P>

      <P>An interdepartmental committee, representing the Departments of the Environment and Local Government, Social, Community and Family Affairs, Health and Children and Finance, is examining the issues which arise in relation to the transfer of the administration of the supplementary welfare allowance, rent and mortgage supplementation scheme from the health boards to local authorities.</P>
      <P>The work of the interdepartmental committee is well advanced and considerable progress has been made in addressing the major issues involved. The transfer of SWA housing supplementation to local authorities gives rise to a number of important issues with wide ranging implications for recipients under the scheme, local authorities and other agencies concerned. These will require careful consideration by Government. It is hoped to finalise the work of the interdepartmental committee at an early date.</P>

      <P>Designations under the new urban renewal scheme were based on integrated area plans submitted by local authorities and were in line with recommendations made by the independent expert advisory panel on urban renewal which I established to assess all of the plans submitted.</P>
      <P>The IAPs were drawn up on the basis of detailed guidelines prepared by the expert panel and issued to local authorities. These guidelines made it clear that, in selecting areas for the preparation of IAPs, local authorities were expected to give priority to areas in cities and towns with strong urban characteristics and the highest concentrations of physical decay and socio-economic disadvantage.</P>
      <P>Rathkeale, in common with several other smaller towns, was unsuccessful in getting a recommendation for approval from the expert panel as its size made it impossible for it to meet the criteria for the new scheme and it failed to advance convincing arguments for treatment as a special case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the situation in Rathkeale was regarded as unique, the panel considered that the urban <Col N="705" /> renewal scheme would be unlikely to rectify the particular problems associated with Rathkeale.</P>
    <P>The expert panel exercised an independent role in assessing the plans submitted. The recommendations made by the panel were accepted in full and that is the basis on which designation is now being implemented.</P>
    <P>The expert panel found also that many of the smaller towns which had not been recommended for designation contained a significant amount of urban townscape which had deteriorated badly. The proposed townscape restoration scheme is aimed at the restoration and conservation of townscapes in smaller towns. Local authorities, including Limerick County Council, will be asked to submit urban townscape plans by 1 August next. Guidelines are being prepared for issue to local authorities to assist them in preparing plans for this new scheme which is to be introduced in the autumn.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 430, 431, 433 and 434 together.</P>
      <P>My Department has had a year 2000 remedial programme in place for over 18 months. This programme is progressing satisfactorily and it is expected that all critical systems in the Department will be compliant within the July deadline required by Government.</P>
      <P>While my Department does not have a specialist team dealing full time with the year 2000 problem, the remedial programme demands significant input from most officers in the Department's IT unit. In addition, consultants have been engaged to assist with particular aspects of the programme.</P>
      <P>Bodies under the aegis of my Department are reporting progress with their remedial programmes to the Department every two months. The number of bodies being monitored by the Department is 51, comprising 34 local authorities and 17 other bodies. Reporting and monitoring of local authorities is being co-ordinated through the Local Government Computer Services Board. All other bodies are reporting progress directly to my Department.</P>
      <P>Most local authorities are reporting very good progress in their information technology remedial work. The area of &ldquo;embedded systems&rdquo; continues to be the principal cause for concern. These systems are used in water supply, sewage works and traffic control. In order to assist local authorities in this area, a firm of consultants, specialising in the compliance of embedded systems, has been engaged. Taking this into account and the vigorous efforts being made by local authorities throughout the country, I am satisfied that all necessary steps are being taken to ensure that remedial work will be completed in the time remaining.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards other bodies under my aegis, it is clear from the latest reports submitted to my Department, which cover the period up to the end of January, that these bodies now have detailed compliance programmes in place and that substantial progress is being made with those programmes. Several bodies have already reported full compliance. Others are not scheduled for full compliance until later in the year. My Department will continue to closely monitor progress in these bodies and will provide what<Col N="707" /> ever assistance it can to ensure that compliance is achieved.</P>
    <P>While the LGCSB provide regular reports to my Department on progress with its year 2000 compliance programme, the allocation of resources within the LGCSB is a matter internal to that organisation and I do not have information concerning the level of expenditure incurred in relation to its year 2000 remedial programme.</P>

In particular, the Dublin authorities have all indicated that their remedial programmes are on schedule.</P>

      <P>In common with all county councils, South Dublin County Council was notified on 1 February 1999 of its 1999 allocation for non-national roads. The allocation amounted to £4.526 million and included a grant of over £2 million for the Cookstown-Old Bawn Distributor Road under the EU co-financed scheme of grants. South Dublin County Council has also been making a case to my Department for substantial additional funding, beyond currently available budget lines, for a number of major road improvement projects arising from exceptional traffic and development demands affecting the area.</P>
      <P>As part of this process, my Department received a request from South Dublin County Council on 3 March 1999 for grant assistance towards Firhouse Road West/ Bohernabreena Road. The cost of the project is estimated by the council to be £6.9 million plus VAT and includes a bridge over the River Dodder.

      <P>I refer to the reply to Questions Nos. 237 and 250 of 1 December 1998. In the meantime, my Department has learned of a number of further proposals to introduce such vehicles to the Irish market.</P>
      <P>In principle, an electrically assisted tricycle is a mechanically propelled vehicle for the purposes of the Road Traffic Acts. As such, any person driving such a vehicle in a public place should hold a driving licence, and the vehicle may be liable for vehicle registration tax and motor tax. It would be appropriate for those marketing this vehicle to contact the Revenue Commissioners and the relevant local licensing authority in order to assess these possible requirements in more detail.</P>

      <P>My Department places considerable emphasis on staff training, delivered primarily by its staff development unit and regionally based trainers. Training courses which are delivered &ldquo;in-house&rdquo; and available to staff on an ongoing basis include Induction for new employees, supervisory skills, management development, effective writing, communication and PC skills, presentation skills and performance appraisal training. In addition, specialised training is currently being provided, also by Departmental trainers, in the areas of customer service, interviewing and report writing for inspectors and advanced training for the Department's deciding officers. Other specialised training is currently being developed for local office managers and their support teams, information officers, and higher executive officers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A separate IT Training unit provides in-house training for staff in the Department's information <Col N="712" /> systems division covering the basic technical knowledge required by new recruits to the division including courses in structured computer programming, VAX/VMS utilities and commands, RMS/FDL, datatrieve and program testing, as well as a basic introduction to computers.</P>
    <P>In addition, my Department operates an annual fees refund scheme which covers part of the cost of the pursuit by staff members of approved third level courses in their own time. Appendix A contains a list of the 51 third level courses in respect of which refunds were made by the Department since June 1997 at a total cost of £208,976.</P>
    <P>Funding is also available to cover the cost of approved attendance by staff members at outside training courses or seminars. Appendix B contains a list of 164 external courses funded since June 1997 at a cost of £422,812.</P>

      <P>The number of staff positions currently filled in the Information Systems Division of the Department is 283.</P>
      <P>A total of 52 people left the division since January 1998. Five more departures have been confirmed and are due before the end of March 1999. This has resulted in a loss of 57 people, or 20 per cent of total staff, over a 15 month period. Most of these vacancies have now been filled in the normal course.</P>
      <P>Eighteen of the 57 staff losses were due to resignations from people taking up IT positions in the private sector. This is indicative of the continuing strong demand for skilled IT staff at a national level.</P>
      <P>The erosion of IT skills limits the capacity of the Department to take on new IT projects, since maintenance of the existing systems must always take priority.</P>
      <P>Every effort is made to recruit and train replacement staff as quickly as possible. There is close liaison between the Department and the Civil Service Commission to ensure that recruitment panels are maintained and that vacancies do not remain unfilled any longer than is absolutely necessary.</P>
      <P>The issue of recruitment and retention of IT staff in the Civil Service is currently under review at central level. Certain initiatives, such as the payment of staff loyalty bonuses, have already been agreed. Final decisions in relation to the number of people who will receive such a bonus, and the payment due to each, have yet to be made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I announced in my budget speech, I am introducing a special old age contributory pension for a specific group of people &ndash; namely those self-employed who were aged 56 years or over in April 1988 when social insurance was extended to the self-employed, and who failed to qualify for a standard old age contributory pension as they could not satisfy the requirement of having entered insurance at least ten years before pension age.</P>
      <P>Title to this special pension will be created from 6 April next with payment commencing from 15 October 1999. This will facilitate the necessary examination of claims and will ensure that refunds of contributions already made to some 3,000 pensioners in this group are recouped. Arrears of payment from April to October, where due, will be paid at that stage.</P>
      <P>The new pension will be payable to those self-employed who were aged 56 or over when they entered social insurance on or after 6 April 1988 and who have at least five years reckonable contributions paid since then.</P>
      <P>Under the new arrangements, payment will be made at a flat rate of 50 per cent, £41.50 per week, at present, and rising to £44.50 from next June of the standard personal rate with equivalent increases, where applicable, for adult and/or child dependents.</P>
      <P>Entitlement will also give access to the free schemes.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that some 11,000 people &ndash; 9,000 pensioners and 2,000 adult dependants &ndash; will benefit under the new arrangements at a full year cost in the order of £19 million.</P>
      <P>I consider that the measures I am introducing represent a fair response to the situation in which this group of self-employed people found themselves through no fault of their own.</P>

      <P>There are various schemes within the social welfare system to assist families in dealing with death and funeral expenses. These include the payment of six weeks social welfare following the death of certain social welfare recipients or their spouse, the payment of a death grant to insured people and their families and the payment of a funeral grant under the occupational injuries benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the death of a recipient of a social welfare payment or his/her spouse the payment is generally continued at the same rate for six weeks <Col N="717" /> in circumstances where both spouses had a separate entitlement &ndash; provided one or both of the entitlements was a non-contributory old age pension, a blind pension or a carer's allowance &ndash; or where the payment includes an increase for a qualified adult. The payment does not arise where each spouse had an independent entitlement to an insurance-based contributory pension.</P>
    <P>As the person concerned is in receipt of her own retirement pension, she is not entitled to receive a six weeks after death payment from this Department.</P>
    <P>Improvements to the death grant scheme, which is a payment made to certain insured people and their families based on their PRSI contributions to assist in the payment of funeral expenses, were recently announced. The death grant is now being totally redesigned and upgraded in the following ways: increasing the amount payable five-fold from £100 to £500; improving the coverage by easing the qualifying PRSI conditions and extending the scheme to other PRSI contributors; and renaming the scheme to bereavement grant.</P>
    <P>These improvements are provided for in the Social Welfare Bill, 1999, which was recently published. The improvements will apply in respect of deaths which occur on or after 2 February 1999.</P>
    <P>These improvements, at an estimated cost of £10 million in a full year, are the first step in the development of a new and improved bereavement allowance. Other schemes, including the six week payments after death arrangements will be reviewed further in 1999.</P>
    <P>The person concerned has applied and qualified for a bereavement grant. A cheque for £500 will be issued to her next week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 450 and 464 together.</P>
      <P>Under the supplementary welfare allowance, SWA, a weekly supplement may be paid in respect of rent or mortgage interest to people in receipt of social welfare or health board payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="719" /> Entitlement to a supplement is determined by the health boards and supplements are normally calculated to ensure that the person, after payment of rent or mortgage interest, has an income equal to the rate of SWA appropriate to the family circumstances, less £6.</P>
    <P>This £6 represents the minimum contribution which clients are required to pay from their own resources. Applicants are also required to contribute any assessable means in excess of the appropriate basic supplementary welfare allowance rate towards their rent or mortgage interest supplement.</P>
    <P>The current SWA rate for a single person is £68.40 per week. Any increase in income over and above that rate will result in a decrease of that amount in the rent supplement rate payable. The result is that a single person has £62.40 per week to meet their other needs in all cases where a rent supplement is in payment.</P>
    <P>When a person is in receipt of pre-retirement allowance &ndash; PRETA &ndash; at £70.50 per week, the contribution that he or she is required to pay towards rent is £8.10 per week leaving £62.40 per week to meet other needs.</P>
    <P>When the person moves on to an old age non-contributory pension at a weekly rate of £72.50 his/her total income has increased by £2 weekly. As the appropriate rate of SWA for a single person is £68.40 weekly, the personal contribution towards the rent will increase by £2 from £8.10 to £10.10 weekly &ndash; £4 excess plus £6 minimum contribution &ndash; again leaving £62.40 per week to meet other needs.</P>
    <P>These rules also apply to unemployed people and other rent supplement recipients who take up part-time employment. This aspect of the SWA scheme will be examined in the context of the Government's commitment under Partnership 2000 to consider a tapering arrangement for SWA housing supplements in consultation with the social partners. Initial contact has been made with the social partners in that regard with a view to opening discussions during April 1999.</P>
    <P>The further development of the SWA rent and mortgage interest supplement scheme, to address this and other issues, will have to be considered in a budgetary context, taking into account also the views of the social partners.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The position of people working full time in the home rearing children is being examined from a number of perspectives; maintaining their PRSI contribution records and recognising and supporting the very valuable role which such people play in society.</P>
      <P>From 6 April 1994, special arrangements for homemakers were introduced to assist people who work in the home to qualify for old age contributory pension. From that date, contribution years spent out of the workforce caring either for children up to the age of six, which was increased to age 12 from April 1995, or incapacitated people, may be disregarded when calculating the yearly average number of contributions. A maximum of 20 years can be disregarded in this way. My Department will shortly be undertaking a review of this provision to allow women, who take time out of the paid workforce for family reasons, to continue contributions for pension purposes. This is in line with the Government's commitment in An Action Programme for the Millennium.</P>
      <P>The Commission on the Family considered the position of parents taking time out of the workforce to care for children and put forward a number of different suggestions designed to recognise the valuable work performed by these parents and to provide direct support when their child care responsibilities are at their most demanding. Their suggestions include an enhanced child benefit, a parenting allowance and a PRSI based parental leave scheme.</P>
      <P>There is also demand for change in the way qualified adults are catered for under the social welfare system. It is felt in many quarters that entitlements should not be derived from spouses or partners but that people should be able to qualify for payments in their own right. Such a system poses many difficult questions, not just for the social welfare system, but also for the taxation system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this regard, an interdepartmental group, chaired by my Department, is currently examining the treatment of married, cohabiting and one-parent families under the social welfare and tax codes. As part of its terms of reference the group is to examine and cost ways of ensuring consistent and equitable treatment of the household types concerned under both systems. As part of its work the group is reviewing previous reports in this area, including the report of the Commission on the Family some of whose recommendations are outlined above. The establishment of the group also marks the first stage in meeting the commitment in the national anti-poverty strategy <Col N="721" /> to examine the individualisation of social welfare payments.</P>
    <P>The group will complete its work in the next couple of months and we must await this report to see what measures are proposed before deciding on further action.</P>

      <P>National lottery funding is used in my Department to support the community development programme, islands development programme and a number of family resource centres, under the family and community services resource centre programme. The community development programme was established in 1990 in recognition of the role of community development in tackling poverty and disadvantage.</P>
      <P>Details of the funding paid in 1998 under these programmes is available in the Oireachtas Library for the information of Members. The total national lottery allocation for my Department in 1998 was £7.759 million.</P>
      <P>Each of these programmes provides funding on a three year basis to projects participating in the programmes and payments are made on a quarterly basis and depend on the continued implementation of the agreed workplan and receipt of accounts and returns for payments previously issued.</P>
      <P>I might mention that applications and proposals for funding under the CDP are considered by an independent technical group. The functions of the group also includes assisting the Department in drawing up a list of 30 priority areas/communities of interest to be targeted for the development of new projects as provided for in the Partnership 2000 agreement. I have already announced details of 17 areas that have been identified in the regions outside of the eastern and southern regions. The information gathering exercise is also being used by the technical group to identify priority areas for the family and community resource centre programme of which 11 have been announced.</P>
      <P>In addition a CDP national advisory committee has been established to assist in the development of the CDP and advise me and my Department on relevant policy matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Membership of both the technical group and the advisory committee is drawn from local projects participating in the community development programme, as well as CDP support agencies, the Combat Poverty Agency, ADM and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. <Col N="722" /> This gives people directly involved in community development work on the ground a role in advising me on decisions in relation to selection of new areas and groups for funding and on policy matters that arise.</P>

      <P>The person in question has not applied for and has never been in receipt of a rent supplement from the South-Eastern Health Board but has now been advised to apply.</P>
      <P>The purpose of rent supplements is to assist with reasonable accommodation costs of eligible persons living in private rented accommodation who are unable to provide for their accommodation costs from their own resources and who do not have accommodation available to them from another source.</P>
      <P>Entitlement to a rent supplement is determined by the health boards in accordance with the appropriate legislative provisions. The health board must be satisfied that the claimant is a bona fide tenant, in need of accommodation and is unable to provide for it from his own resources.</P>
      <P>While the onus is on the individual to provide proof of tenancy, the person concerned has been informed that any proof of tenancy will be accepted, for example, a contract, a rent book or receipt. In that regard, I understand that the landlord in question has provided the necessary documentary evidence for other tenants on previous occasions.</P>
      <P>The health board has also informed the person concerned that it will assist him in every way possible on receipt of an application for rent supplement at the current address or at any other address should the person choose to seek alternative accommodation.</P>

      <P>It is assumed that the Deputy is referring to the widow's or widower's contributory pension scheme and the possibility of introducing a <i>pro rata</i> pension similar in structure to its old age contributory pension counterpart.</P>
      <P>The qualifying conditions for the widow's or widower's contributory pension are more flexible than those for, say, the old age contributory pension. For instance, a person's entitlement is based on either the full social insurance record or the record over the previous three or five years to satisfy the yearly average condition. A widow or widower may qualify on either his-her own or late spouse's insurance records; in addition, social insurance contributions paid or credited under the National Health Insurance Acts since 1936 may be used to satisfy the requirement that 156 contributions are paid.</P>
      <P>On that basis, I have no plans, at present, to introduce such a scheme which, as the Deputy will appreciate, would have to be considered in a budgetary context and in the light of available resources.</P>

      <P>The objective of the back to work allowance scheme, is to provide an incentive to long-term unemployed persons who, in the absence of the scheme, would not be in a position to take up a job. The scheme has a limited number of places and it is a requirement of the scheme that an application must be made prior to taking up employment.</P>
      <P>The person concerned commenced employment on 4 January 1999. He applied for the allowance on 22 February 1999. Under the rules of the scheme his application was refused as the claim was late and he was in a position to return to the workforce without the additional incentive which the scheme provides. However, the matter has now been reviewed in the light of information that the delay in submitting the application was caused by his employer.</P>
      <P>In the light of this his application has been allowed and arrangements for payment of the allowance and arrears due will be made shortly.</P>

      <P>My Department has, since 1996, operated the scheme of community support for older people, the purpose of which is to provide funding for initiatives to improve the security and social support of vulnerable older people. This funding is provided by way of grant to voluntary groups and organisations such as St. Vincent de Paul, Neighbourhood Watch and Community Alert which have undertaken to identify those elderly people in need of assistance under the scheme.</P>
      <P>Under the scheme grants are available for: small scale physical security equipment such as strengthening of doors and windows, window locks, door chains and locks and security lighting; and socially-monitored alarm systems (such as the pendant or panic button alarm system which is operated via the telephone and is worn around the wrist or neck).</P>
      <P>In general, grants under the scheme cover from 50 per cent to 90 per cent of the once-off cost of the purchase and/or installation of the necessary security equipment. While the maximum grant available under this scheme is 90 per cent of the total cost, it is not possible to guarantee this level of funding in respect of all applications received under the scheme.</P>
      <P>I am anxious to ensure that this scheme addresses the security needs of the most vulnerable people and that it provides this assistance in the most efficient and effective way possible. In this regard, my Department has, in consultation with the Departments of Finance and Health and Children, commissioned an independent review of the scheme which will consider how the scheme is meeting its objectives and whether it is doing so in the most efficient and effective way possible.</P>
      <P>The final report from the consultants has been received and is currently being examined in my Department. The future operation of the scheme will be determined in the light of the outcome of this review.</P>

      <P>The objective of the back to work allowance scheme, is to provide an incentive to long-term unemployed persons who, in the <Col N="725" /> absence of the scheme, would not be motivated to take up a job. The scheme has a limited number of places and is targeted at people who need such an incentive to return to the workforce. It is, therefore, a requirement of the scheme that an application must be made prior to taking up employment to demonstrate that the scheme is instrumental in the applicant deciding to leave the live register. If payments were made under the scheme on a large scale after persons had returned to work it would give rise to serious deadweight effects which over time would impact adversely on the viability of the scheme.</P>
      <P>The deadweight issue plays an important role in determining the overall cost and effectiveness of labour market programmes such as the back to work allowance. There are, however, circumstances where late claims for the allowance are accepted and the allowance is paid, for example, where an employer has delayed certifying and submitting the claim.</P>
      <P>The person concerned commenced employment on 23 November 1998. He applied for the allowance on 28 January 1999. Under the rules of the scheme his application was refused as the claim was late and he was in a position to return to the workforce without the need for the financial incentive which the scheme provides. There were no extenuating circumstances in this case which could have justified a revision of this decision.</P>

      <P>The free schemes such as free electricity allowance, free telephone rental allowance and free TV licence are available to people, usually aged 66 or over, who are in receipt of a welfare type payment and who are either living alone or who otherwise satisfy this condition. In addition, widows/widowers between the ages of 60 and 65, whose late spouses had been in receipt of the free schemes, retain that entitlement.</P>
      <P>The free schemes are also available to people who are over 75 years of age and who are in receipt of a qualifying payment or who satisfy a means test regardless of who resides with them. In order to satisfy the means test the applicant's means must not exceed the maximum rate of the old age contributory pension, which is currently £83.00 per week, plus £30 per week.</P>

      <P>Under the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993, every person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet his or her needs and the needs of any adult or child dependant, has an entitlement to supplementary welfare allowance.</P>
      <P>It is expected that the normal day to day food bills would be met from any weekly social welfare payment. However, additional assistance in the form of a weekly diet supplement, is available to an eligible person who has been prescribed a specified diet arising from a specific medical condition and whose means are insufficient to meet this need. A diet supplement can be paid provided a person also satisfies the general rules governing entitlement to supplementary welfare allowance. A diabetic diet is a specified diet for diet supplement purposes.</P>
      <P>Entitlement to a diet supplement is determined by the health boards in accordance with the legislative provisions which specify the medical conditions in respect of which a diet supplement may be paid.</P>
      <P>The main considerations in determining entitlement for a diet supplement are the type of diet prescribed, the household income and whether the person in respect of whom the diet supplement is payable is an adult or a child.</P>
      <P>Information regarding the diet supplement is available in the SWA information booklet, SW54, and the Guide to Social Welfare Services book, SW4, or by contacting any local health centre.

      <P>The EU provisions on social security do not replace the national social security systems of the 15 member states by a single, standardised European system. Rather, they perform a co-ordinating role between these different systems and establish common rules and principles which have to be observed by all national authorities.</P>
      <P>These precepts are reflected in the EU regulations on social security, Nos: 1408/71 and 574/72, which contain detailed provisions on the application and implementation of social security schemes throughout the European Union and apply to employed persons, self-employed persons and to members of their families moving within the Union.</P>
      <P>Old age pensions are among the most important social security benefits covered by the EU regulations. These provide, for instance, that a person who has been insurably employed in more than one member state will have his/her pension calculated according to the insurance record in each country &ndash; the rate of payment corresponding, on a <i>pro rata</i> basis, to the periods of insurance completed there. This <i>pro rata</i> principle also applies to any increases paid in respect of the recipient's personal circumstances &ndash; for example, in the context of Irish social welfare pensions, where the over-80 increase is applicable.</P>
      <P>The standard rate increase of £6 per week paid in respect of a person living alone &ndash; otherwise known as the living alone allowance &ndash; is not subject to this rule. This is because the increase is a contribution towards a specific contingency &ndash; namely, in acknowledgement of the extra costs incurred where a person resides alone.</P>
      <P>I understand the Deputy is also inquiring as to why a person resident in Ireland and in receipt of a British social security pension, is not entitled to a living alone allowance or the over-80 increase from my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="731" /> Both of these payments are particular features of our national (social welfare) pension environment. They are an integral part of the Irish pension system and are designed to cover specific contingencies. As such, they have no applicability <i>vis-à-vis</i> pension payments made under the social security regimes of other EU member states or countries with which Ireland has bilateral agreements. This is fully in accordance with the EU regulations which allow all member states to decide which benefits are granted and under what conditions.</P>
    <P>In the case of the living alone allowance, it is worth repeating, as I stated in my reply to Question No. 135 of 3 March last, that failure to qualify for this allowance does not preclude low-income pensioners from qualifying for the free schemes, provided that they are in receipt of a qualifying payment &ndash; in this instance, for example, from another EU member state &ndash; or that they are age 66 or over, satisfy a means-test and are living alone or with certain categories of excepted people.</P>
    <P>Finally, I must state that I do not consider the extension of the over-80 and living alone increases to foreign social security pensioners resident in Ireland warranted at this time. I would point out to the Deputy that any such measure is likely to have significant budgetary implications.</P>

      <P>The aim of the national fuel scheme is to assist householders who are on long-term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs. A payment of £5 per week &ndash; £8 per week in smokeless zones &ndash; is paid to eligible households for 26 weeks from mid October to mid April, subject to a means test.</P>
      <P>Invalidity pension is a qualifying payment for the purposes of the national fuel scheme but in order to be eligible for assistance under the scheme, the person must also satisfy a means test. They may have a combined household income of up to £15 per week over the relevant maximum pension rate, or savings of £8,000, and still qualify for the fuel allowance. This income limit will be increased from £15 to £30 per week with effect from commencement of the next heating season in October 1999.</P>
      <P>It would be inappropriate for me to provide a fuel allowance to all invalidity pensioners without any means test and not to dispense with the means test for other groups.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Abolishing the means test for fuel allowance would be costly. Only those with a significant <Col N="732" /> amount of additional income over and above their social welfare payment would benefit and this would not represent the best use of the resources.</P>

In the context of a number of proposed measures to improve the quality of the water, local staff of Dúchas indicated that they would not object to a proposal for the limited removal of sand from the shallow end of lake. Such removal of sand could facilitate improved flushing of the lake which could in turn improve the water quality.</P>

      <P>One of the most significant effects of the National Monuments (Amendment) Act, 1994, was the extension of legal protection to cover all recorded monuments on an accelerated blanket basis. Section 12 of this Act provides for the establishment of a Record of Monuments and Places, RMP. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the RMP for the State as a whole was completed last December, as a result of which protection has now been extended to approximately 120,000 monuments nation-wide. The listing of a monument in the RMP requires anybody proposing to carry out works which in any way interferes with a recorded monument to give my Department two months written notice of such intention. A person contravening these provisions shall be liable to severe penalties under the Acts, the maximum penalty for offences being a fine of £50,000 and/or five years imprisonment.</P>
      <P>The RMP for each county consists of OS constraint maps &ndash; six inch scale &ndash; with an accompanying index which shows the locations of monuments and places which are protected under the Acts. These are publicly exhibited at various venues around each county such as local authority offices, county libraries, farm development services and Teagasc offices.</P>
      <P>If a feature which may be a suspected monument is discovered subsequent to the above record having been put in place, details of this feature together with its precise location should be forwarded to my Department, specifically to National Monuments and Historic Properties, Dúchas, 51 St. Stephen's Green, Dublin 2, for consideration and possible inclusion in any later amendments to the RMP.</P>

      <P>I understand that in January 1995 a planning application for a 103 bedroom hotel, conference centre and ancillary accommodation in respect of lands to the rear of Bridge House, John Street, Kilkenny was lodged with Kilkenny Corporation. Details were subsequently forwarded to the Commissioners of Public Works, whose functions in relation to heritage were subsequently transferred to my Department. Following a review of the application, I understand that a letter issued from the Office of Public Works to Kilkenny Corporation stating that the details of the application were considered to be inadequate and recommending that either further information be sought or that permission be refused. The primary concern was the impact of the proposed development on Bridge House, a building of architectural and historical significance in its own right. Concerns were also expressed regarding the implication of the proposed tree felling on the river bank, having regard to the views towards and from Kilkenny Castle. The Deputy will be aware that the proposed development was ultimately refused permission by An Bord Pleanála, following an oral hearing.</P>
      <P>In October 1996, a revised planning application was submitted for the erection of a scaled down 90 bedroom hotel, together with ancillary facilities on the same site. This application was also reviewed by my Department. In addition to dealing with the archaeological implications, recommendations were also made in relation to the architectural aspects of the proposed new hotel, with a view to improving the overall appearance of the new development, particularly in the light of potential impacts on Bridge House, which by then had been registered as an historic monument under the National Monuments Acts, 1930-1994.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This application was also appealed to An Bord <Col N="738" /> Pleanála which, on this occasion, decided to grant permission, subject to 16 conditions. A number of the conditions responded to the specific concerns expressed by my Department, notably those designed to conserve the archaeological heritage of the site and to ensure that any works to the external fabric of Bridge House be carried out to the highest conservation standards.</P>
    <P>Information relating to the number of planning applications received and replied to, is only available from 1992 when such information was first recorded on computer. Between 1992 and 1998 a total of 138 planning applications have been referred by Kilkenny Corporation. All applications referred have been considered and, where appropriate, views have been conveyed to the corporation.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 573 of 3 Samhain 1998. The position remains the same save that funding has now been provided in the Vote of the Department of the Environment and Local Government for the system of grant-aid towards the conservation costs of buildings and structures of significance as part of the full package of measures which I advanced in conjunction with my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, for strengthening the protection of the architectural heritage. The full package of protection measures includes legislation currently being piloted through the Oireachtas by me to place the National Inventory of Architectural Heritage on a statutory basis. I understand that details of the grant-aid scheme, which will be administered by local authorities, will be announced shortly.</P>

There is no change in this position but, should the local authorities concerned approach me with a proposal for a joint purchase with them, I will give the matter further consideration.</P>

      <P>The National Museum has in its possession a cannon which its records show as having been received into the museum in 1910 and as having been found in the barquette of the old wall of Kilkenny. From these records it is not possible to state whether this cannon is the cannon from the Talbot Tower, Kilkenny, referred to by the Deputies. While this piece is not on exhibition currently, it forms part of the National Museum's artillery collection and will be considered for display as part of any future military or historical exhibition.</P>

      <P>The remains referred to in the Deputy's question are not being held by my Department. Some 200 human skeletons were <Col N="740" /> uncovered, dating to the period 1200-1600 A.D. at archaeological excavations at Abbey Street, Kilkenny in 1996. These skeletons are still with the excavators awaiting scientific examination by a qualified bioarchaeologist. The National Museum of Ireland is aware of the situation and has expressed its concern several times to the excavators regarding the slow progress in carrying out this scientific examination. Until such examination is completed and a report submitted, no decision can be made as to the ultimate fate of the Abbey Street remains. Excavation of human remains sheds valuable light on the history of early populations in Ireland and can contribute significantly to medical research. On the basis of expert advice, it is the policy of the National Museum of Ireland that all excavated human remains be retained for future research. Storage facilities have been provided for this purpose in the museum's premises in Collins Barracks. The Deputy will appreciate, therefore, that funding as suggested by him would not be a matter for my Department.</P>

      <P>In general, my Department does not directly provide financial support for heritage buildings throughout the country. A new grant-aid scheme has been established for approved conservation works to buildings listed for protection. This scheme, which will commence shortly, will be administered by the local authorities, will have funding of approximately £4 million per annum, and will be operated in accordance with national criteria and standards currently being drawn up by an advisory group made up of representatives of my Department, the Department of Environment and Local Government and the Heritage Council. This scheme should be of assistance to owners of houses of notable vintage, such as Georgian houses, which are listed for protection in local authority development plans.</P>
      <P>A further source of public funds for projects relating to heritage buildings is the Heritage Council, which is a statutory, autonomous body. The council has powers to provide advice and assistance, including financial assistance, in relation to the protection, preservation and promotion of the physical heritage. It should be noted that, although my Department funds the Heritage Council, I have no function in relation to decisions by it on the disbursal of grants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of local concerns regarding the ongoing construction works for the installation of a major drainage scheme in the centre of Kilkenny. In January 1996, officials from Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department, met with representatives of the local authority and a firm of consulting engineers, to discuss concerns regarding the archaeological implications of the proposed works.</P>
      <P>A detailed set of archaeological recommendations was submitted subsequently to the consultants in April 1996 including a recommendation that, in respect of the proposed sewer which was to pass beneath the Black Freren Gate the gate itself should be shored up in advance of the site works in order to ensure its safety.</P>
      <P>On 6 February 1997, a preservation order was placed on the Black Freren Gate, the effect of which is that it is unlawful for any person to demolish or remove the monument, either wholly or in part, or to interfere with it, or to dig, plough or disturb the ground within, around or in proximity to it without my written consent.</P>
      <P>I understand that the installation of the drainage scheme has been a long and difficult operation and one which has encountered unforeseen engineering difficulties. An archaeologist has been engaged by the consulting engineers to monitor, under licence from my Department, any excavations that may be necessary. The archaeologist is in regular communication with officials from Dúchas with a view to ensuring the safety and integrity of the national monument.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding the local authority's responsibility in this matter, as developers of the scheme, Dúchas has undertaken its own inspection of the structural stability of the Black Freren Gate within the last few days, having been alerted to a possible movement within the gate. I am awaiting a report on this inspection to consider what further action, if any, is required.</P>

      <P>The primary task of the Screen Commission of Ireland is to market abroad the many attractions of Ireland as a film and television production location. Its specific terms of reference are as follows: to promote Ireland as a film and television production location and centre internationally by marketing the tax advantages and other incentives, the range of facilities, the body of professional crew, actors and creative personnel and, the variety of locations available; to facilitate incoming and indigenous production by providing information from a one stop source by co-ordinating a network of national and regional organisations, commercial, State and State-sponsored, companies and individuals; to encourage the location of international distribution companies, facilities companies, creative and talent agencies and international producers to Ireland on a long-term strategic basis and generally to promote Ireland as a film and television production location internationally to attract film and television production to Ireland, and to co-ordinate and integrate as appropriate the efforts of local bodies with similar objectives. The Screen Commission has been established as a committee of the Irish Film Board under section 16 of the Irish Film Board Act, 1980. The Screen Commission acts autonomously in the performance of its functions under section 16(6) of the Irish Film Board Act, 1980.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Questions Nos. 69 and 79 of 9 March 1999. The Deputy will be aware that the core policy goal of my Department in relation to the Irish language is to reverse the decline in the use of the language as the principal means of communication in the Gaeltacht and to extend its use in the rest of the country generally. My Department will continue to maximise the use of the grant schemes and programmes at its disposal to achieve this aim. Since coming into office I have initiated a comprehensive review of these schemes with a view to identifying opportunities which could be exploited. This review is ongoing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am also in the process of putting in place the most comprehensive legislative programme ever in relation to the Irish language, including: a Lan<Col N="747" /> guage Bill; a major revision of the Údarás na Gaeltachta Acts; the establishment of the North-South Language Body and a new Housing (Gaeltacht) (Amendment) Bill.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 360 of 15 December 1998. There are five members of staff responsible for my Departments IT systems. Replacement and upgrading of hardware/software, which, in any event, takes care of the year 2000 problem, is part of the normal ongoing IT programme being carried out by those staff members. All IT systems, office equipment and plant in my Department are scheduled to be year 2000 compliant by 30 June 1999. My Department will publish details of its year 2000 programme in the near future.</P>
      <P>As I have already informed the Deputy, the achievement of year 2000 compliance for bodies under the aegis of my Department is primarily a matter for those bodies. However, a committee has been established within my Department to monitor and report on progress being achieved. Some bodies are already compliant, while others have programmes under way to achieve compliance. It is anticipated that all business-critical systems will be compliant before end-1999.</P>

      <P>The objective in the State acquiring these lands is to establish a Liffey Valley Park which will be co-operatively managed and maintained by the three local authorities concerned &ndash; Fingal, Kildare and South County Dublin &ndash; on the basis of an agreed management plan. I can advise that a revised draft management plan was agreed by the local authorities and approval in principle was given by my Department to this revised plan in early December last.</P>
      <P>South Dublin County Council has already executed the legal transfer documents and the way is clear for Fingal County Council to sign. The remaining local authority, Kildare County Council, has submitted a request, which is under consideration at present, for a slight revision of the park boundary. Once this issue is resolved, execution of the legal agreements transferring ownership of part of the demesne to Kildare County Council can proceed.</P>
      <P>The contract documents and management plan are designed to protect the interests of all parties involved and also to provide the flexibility for the development of a co-ordinated management strategy for the Liffey Valley Park for the benefit of the local community and the general public.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 316 of 9 March 1999. As the Deputy is aware, special areas of conservation &ndash; SACs &ndash; arise by virtue of the EU Habitats Directive which was transposed into Irish law by the European Communities (Natural Habitats) Regulations, 1997. SACs are, therefore, a legal obligation as part of our membership of the EU.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of liaison committees was to improve the flow of information between my Department and land holders in proposed SACs. A series of meetings is taking place throughout the country with a view to setting up these committees and when this process is completed, I will review the situation in relation to those SACs <Col N="749" /> where, by then, no liaison committees have been formed.</P>
    <P>I would strongly recommend that land holders participate in liaison committees as the purpose in setting them up was to fill the information gap which land holders had complained about in the ongoing and developing situation in relation to SACs.</P>

    <P>1. This includes prisoners released early on health grounds.</P>
    <P>2. All prisoners are entitled to standard remission of 25 per cent. Therefore the number released on remission of sentence is the same as that released on completion of sentence.</P>
    <P>3. Section 33(1) and (2) of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939 gives the Government power to release any person convicted by a Special Criminal Court and to impose conditions on that release.</P>

    <P>A proportion of subversive prisoners were also granted short-term temporary release under conditions using the Minister's powers under the Criminal Justice Act, 1960. Before granting temporary release consideration is given to various factors including the nature and seriousness of the offence, the potential threat to the community, the length of sentence served and remaining and if there are any compassionate grounds which merit special consideration.</P>

    <P>In addition, the Government has committed itself, under the multiparty Agreement, to put in place mechanisms to provide for an accelerated programme for the release of prisoners, including repatriated prisoners, who qualify for such a programme under the terms of the Agreement. Prisoners affiliated to organisations which have not established or are not maintaining a complete and unequivocal ceasefire will not benefit from these arrangements. Part of the mechanism in place under the Agreement is the procedure laid down in the Criminal Justice (Release of Prisoners) Act, 1998 and all proposed releases under the Agreement must go through that procedure. In those circumstances it is not possible to indicate how many more prisoners will benefit from early release under the terms of the Agreement.</P>

      <P>The Matt Talbot Services previously knows as the Father Rock Centre, Cork, sought funding prior to the budget for each of three Departments &ndash; Health and Children, Education and Science and Justice, Equality and Law Reform. An allocation of £250,000 was announced under the Department of Health and Children to be provided through the Southern Health Board as the operation of these centres is considered to be primarily the responsibility of the Department of Health and Children and health boards.</P>
      <P>My Department through the probation and welfare service paid a capital grant of £31,700 in November 1998 to Matt Talbot Services towards improvements and equipment. The service is not in a position to provide ongoing funding to the Matt Talbot Services, due to the heavy demands on the resources of the service.</P>
      <P>Over the past four years the probation and welfare service has paid capitation grants, that is, paying per head for use of the Matt Talbot Service, of the order of £183,000.</P>

      <P>Bray is one of the six areas afforded a high priority listing for the installation of Garda CCTV systems as an aid to policing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a shortage of technicians in the telecommunications section of An Garda Síochána <Col N="757" /> which is impacting on the progress in implementing CCTV systems. I am having this problem addressed as a matter of urgency through the recruitment of a significant number of additional technicians and the recruitment process is actually under way at present. However given recruitment/selection procedures and training, etc., realistically it will be some months before they will be available to commence work on existing or new projects in the telecommunications area, including CCTV.</P>
    <P>I am, however, keen for CCTV to be installed in all of the prioritised areas, including Bray, as soon as possible and I have instructed my officials to pursue the issue with the Garda Síochána and to explore all avenues for expediting matters.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 530 and 534 together.</P>
      <P>As part of my Department's strategy to safeguard and promote health it has been policy for some time to offer vaccination to any prisoner who would reasonably be expected to spend at least six months in prison. Six months represents the time required to provide the standard three dose vaccination regime. Vaccination has not been recommended for prisoners expected to spend only a short period in custody as failure to complete the vaccination schedule may prevent the development of any immunity or result in only partial, brief immunity.</P>
      <P>In total 1,387 prisoners received hepatitis B vaccinations, either in full or in part, in 1998. The total cost of administering the vaccine in 1998 was £57,569.92 which covered the cost of purchasing the vaccine, doctors' administration fees and the salaries of prison staff involved.</P>
      <P>Hepatitis A vaccination has not, to date, been offered to prisoners. However, in view of the emerging medical advice, that individuals who are hepatitis C positive should be offered hepatitis A vaccination, a review of this situation is taking place at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 531 and 532 together.</P>
      <P>I confirm that a medical policy document on substance abuse within the prison system has been agreed between my Department and the Eastern Health Board.</P>
      <P>I should also explain, for the sake of completeness, that this document will form part of a comprehensive Action Plan on Drug Misuse and Drug Treatment in the Prison System. The action plan, which has not been finalised, sets the broad policy context within which the issue of drugs in prisons will be dealt with. It is important, in dealing with the questions raised by the Deputy, to quote the opening paragraph of this overall action plan which states: </P>
      <P>It is the absolute policy of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to take all reasonable measures that may be required to prevent drugs getting into prisons. The Department recognises however, that in line with world-wide experience, despite best endeavours and applying best operational practice, some contraband may, from time to time, be brought inside. It may not be possible, within any set of arrangements that can be defended on human rights grounds, to detect all attempts to get contraband through prison controls. That being the case, it is clearly incumbent on the Department, to have in place an Action Plan which draws on the best medical advice available in this area and which addresses the health-care and other issues that are associated with the misuse of drugs in prisons. The Department considers it important to emphasise that the existence of the Action Plan does not in any way signal any tolerance or acceptance of the presence or misuse of drugs in prisons, nor does it signal any dilution in the basic policy of prevention. It represents a measured and responsible response to the reality that contraband sometimes gets through &ndash; and nothing more than that.</P>
      <P>As to the more narrowly-focused medical policy document, which will form part of the overall action plan, I confirm that a copy of this document was recently faxed to a medical journal by the press office of my Department. The document, which reflects the need to provide treatment to prisoners equivalent to that available in the community, is available on request under the terms of the Freedom of Information Act, 1997.</P>
      <P>With regard to the specific, medically-advised safety measures mentioned by the Deputy re the issue of condoms and sterilising tablets, I confirm that these are, not surprisingly, referred to in the medical document. In the interests of public health, it has been the practice for many years to give condoms to male prisoners leaving prison &ndash; for example, those leaving prison on temporary release. Disinfectants and other sterilising agents have also been available in the prisons for various hygiene related reasons for years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="762" /> Finally, for the avoidance of any doubt or confusion on the matter, no decision has been made, or is likely to be made in the near future, on the provision of sterile needles and condoms to serving prisoners.</P>

      <P>All solicitors, including solicitors employed by the Legal Aid Board, are obliged when dealing with applicants who have matrimonial discord, to discuss with the applicant the possibility of engaging in mediation. This is a requirement under section 6 (2)(<i>b</i>) of the Family Law Divorce Act, 1996 (No. 33 of 1996) and section 5 (1)(<i>b</i>) of the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989 (No. 6 of 1984). The solicitor is obliged to give the applicant the names and addresses of persons qualified in mediation services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The solicitor is also obliged to discuss with the applicant both the possibility of reconciliation and of effecting a separation by means of a deed of separation and when dealing with an applicant <Col N="767" /> for divorce, ensure that he-she is aware of judicial separation as an alternative.</P>
    <P>Furthermore all applications for a decree of judicial separation or divorce before the court shall be accompanied by a certificate completed by the solicitor certifying that he has complied with the relevant provisions of the Acts in informing the applicant of available alternatives.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem of controlling on-line illegal activities, particularly those involving the Internet, gives rise to a wide range of complex legal, technical and enforcement issues. Many of these issues were described in the report of the working group on the illegal and harmful use of the Internet which was published last year. While legislation specific to the Internet is not always warranted, every effort is made as new legislation is being developed to ensure it applies to illegal activities in an on-line environment.</P>
      <P>The Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act, 1997, introduced criminal sanctions for persons found guilty of the offence of harassment which is aimed at what is commonly called &ldquo;stalking&rdquo;. This new offence created by the 1997 Act carries a maximum penalty of seven years imprisonment. A person will be guilty of this offence if he or she by any means. harasses another by persistently following, watching, pestering, besetting or communicating with the victim.</P>
      <P>The court is also empowered under this legislation to order the stalker not to communicate in any way with the victim for such period as may be specified by the court. Breach of such a court order will be an offence and the maximum penalty here is also seven years imprisonment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="768" /> I have no plans at present to review the law in relation to harassment.</P>

      <Quest>if the Garda Síochána pilot initiative in Tallaght, Dublin 24, to help local housing tenants to build up contacts with the local gardaí in liaison with the county council will be extended to the north and west Clondalkin areas which contain high densities of local authority housing.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the divisional and district officers and representatives from South Dublin County Council launched the initiative in Tallaght between local gardaí and South Dublin County Council on 13 November 1998. At present weekly clinics of two hours duration are conducted at Fettercairn, Jobstown and Killinarden community centres. The service is designed to give the local community within these areas convenient access to the gardaí and the housing section of South Dublin County Council.</P>
      <P>I am advised by the Garda authorities that a comprehensive review of the initiative will be conducted after a period of six months in operation, at which stage the feasibility of extending the initiative will be considered. Pending the outcome of this review there are no plans to extend the initiative to the Clondalkin area.</P>
      <P>I am also advised by the Garda authorities that any decision made to extend the initiative to the Clondalkin area will take account of local demand for such a service, availability of suitable accommodation and any other initiatives operating in the relevant area. It should also be borne in mind that there is currently in place in the relevant area, a high level of consultation between An Garda Síochána and local authority officials, albeit in a less structured manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recently launched integrated services project is an example of where the gardaí, the community, voluntary organisations and statutory agencies come together to address local issues. This project is under way in four designed areas <Col N="770" />&ndash; Dublin's north east inner city, the canal communities, Jobstown in Tallaght and Togher in Cork. The aim of this project is to develop a more focused and co-ordinated response by the statutory agencies to the needs of the communities. The ultimate objective is to develop from this a model of best practice from a diversity of experience which can be replicated in other areas of disadvantage.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that the process of maintaining and developing good community relations is a high priority with the gardaí who are committed to working closely with the local communities. I consider that one of the most important developments in recent years has been the obvious improvement in relations between the Garda Síochána and disadvantaged urban communities. Both the communities and the gardaí are to be commanded for their work in this area.</P>

      <P>Work is currently in train at central level in the Department of Finance in relation to the preparation of a national development plan for the period 2000 to 2006 to which my Department will be inputting an appropriate tourism dimension.</P>
      <P>As part of this process, the Department produced a policy paper last March, entitled &ldquo;Strategy for Tourism Development in the context of EU Structural Funding 2000-2006&rdquo;, which is compatible with the timeframe in the financial perspectives set out in the European Commission's Agenda 2000 proposals. The document contains objectives and a proposed strategic approach for investment in product development, marketing and training, based on a range of possible policy actions to meet those objectives.</P>
      <P>Since then, my Department has been engaged in a consultation process in relation to future tourism policy with the industry, through the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation, who themselves examined funding and institutional options in their own planning document of May last year, entitled &ldquo;Strategy for Growth beyond 2000 &ndash; A Strategic Framework for Irish Tourism&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department is also in discussion with Bord Fáilte which has published a business plan for Irish tourism marketing, 1998-2003, after consultation with ITIC. The plan reviews recent performance, puts forward principles for prioritising future markets, details a possible growth scenario and sets out forecasts until 2003. The plan also discusses how tourism promotion might be funded in future, an important <Col N="781" /> element of which is pending the outcome of current negotiations on the next round of Structural Funds for Ireland.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 576 and 620 together.</P>
      <P>My Department does not have details of the full-time student admissions outside the CAO system for 1998-99 in respect of disadvantaged students or details of the total pool of non-standard entry disadvantaged students in 1998-99.</P>
      <P>There are a number of initiatives currently in place in both the university and institute of technology sectors specifically geared towards disadvantaged students. These initiatives involve links with second level schools and local communities to provide supervised study facilities, extra tuition for pupils, information and advice for parents and pupils, including seminars, mentoring and support teaching in key subject areas. These programmes either assist students to meet the points requirement for courses for entry through the standard CAO.</P>
      <P>In schools where the pastoral care system is well developed the form teacher usually has a period at the beginning of each day to discuss general and specific issues. The civic, social and political education programme, as it is concept-based by nature, enables the discussion of a range of general issues affecting pupils. Further opportunities also exist in the transition year programme.</P>

      <P>As an interim measure, grants have already issued to some schools to facilitate the immediate provision of escorts where particular need has arisen. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that a grant has already been sanctioned to enable three escort services to be provided on buses serving the school to which he refers.</P>

      <P>The main panel is made up of permanent teachers whose posts have been suppressed and temporary teachers who have a minimum of five years temporary service. Teachers whose posts have been suppressed and who have not been redeployed at the start of the new school year remain in their old school until redeployed. Such teachers are entitled to payment of full salary while awaiting redeployment.</P>
      <P>The supplementary panel is made up of temporary teachers who have between three and five years temporary service. This panel comes into operation only when the main panel is clear.</P>
      <P>A temporary teacher on the panel who is awaiting an offer of employment is free to seek employment in any capacity, including temporary or substitute appointments.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 583 and 651 together.</P>
      <P>My Department's inspectorate is currently investigating the possibility of establishing a special class for children with specific learning disabilities in the Swords area. In September 1998 a remedial teacher post was allocated on a shared basis to three primary schools in the Swords area.</P>
      <P>Arrangements are currently being made in my Department to extend the remedial teacher service to all first and second level schools in the country from September next. Any schools in the Swords area which are currently without a remedial service will benefit from this extension. Also from September next it is intended to extend the home/school/community liaison service to all first and second level schools in the country which have disadvantaged area status. Any qualifying schools in the Swords area will benefit from this development.</P>
      <P>I recently announced a major new development in special education provision under which all pupils with special educational needs in the primary system will be entitled to an automatic response to those needs. The response in question may take the form of additional resource teacher support or child care support, or both, depending on the particular needs of the child. Pupils attending schools in the Swords area will be entitled to benefit from this development.</P>
      <P>My Department will shortly be issuing detailed circulars advising schools, including schools in the Swords area, of the procedures to be followed in seeking to avail of this important new development in special education services.</P>
      <P>Schools in the area will, of course, benefit from my recent announcement concerning the reduction in class sizes in primary schools and the retention of teachers in secondary schools.</P>

      <P>The matter of the recognition of teacher qualifications is a function of the primary administration section of my Department. To date the person referred to by the Deputy has not applied to that section to have her qualifications recognised for teaching purposes in this country. On receipt of the person's qualifications, my officials will undertake an immediate examination of same to determine if those qualifications entitle her to teach in any capacity in this country.</P>
      <P>In addition, in certain cases, a tutor may be employed to deliver one-to-one tuition to pupils awaiting placement or to pupils who are too ill to attend school. This tuition my take place in the pupil's home or in an approved alternative placement. In such cases, an allowance is made to the parent/guardian of the pupil to cover the cost of such provision. The demand for tutors to deliver such a service varies from time to time and persons seeking to deliver such tuition should apply to the special education section of my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 585, 586 and 587 together.</P>
      <P>There are currently ten one teacher schools in County Mayo.</P>
      <P>The overall number of one teacher schools in June 1997 was 124. This number decreased to 103 for the 1997-98 school year and to 74 for the 1998-99 school year.</P>
      <P>An Action Programme for the Millennium gave a commitment that all one teacher schools with ten or more pupils would be allocated a second teacher.</P>
      <P>I began the process of implementing this commitment soon after taking up office. In the 1997-98 school year, a one teacher school needed a minimum enrolment of 25 pupils before it could gain title to its second post. I reduced this figure to 18 from 1 September 1998. Consequently, 25 one teacher schools have been allowed their second teaching post from the start of the current school year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The retention figure for the withdrawal of the first teaching post in the 1997-98 school year was 23 pupils. I reduced this figure to 18 from 1 September 1998 with the result that 28 schools con<Col N="790" /> tinue to operate in the current school year as two teacher units.</P>
    <P>In addition, I allowed 14 schools, which had enrolments below 18 pupils, to continue to operate in the current school year as two teacher units. In total, therefore, in the current school year alone, a total of 67 schools have benefited from my determination to support one teacher schools.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will also be aware from my recent announcement that I am introducing additional measures in the 1999-2000 school year which are designed to further improve the position of one teacher schools and which will benefit 50 schools. Specifically, I am reducing the number of pupils required to appoint a second teacher from 18 to 14. As a consequence of this initiative, 22 existing one teacher schools will become two teacher units from September next.</P>
    <P>Additionally, by reducing the figure for the retention of the second teacher from 18 to 14 pupils, 21 existing two teacher school will continue to operate in the 1999/2000 school year as two teacher units.</P>
    <P>I have further indicated that seven schools, which are currently two teacher units but which have an enrolment below 14 pupils, will also continue to operate in the 1999-2000 school year as two teacher units.</P>
    <P>While the above initiatives clearly demonstrate this Government's commitment to one teacher schools, I can assure the Deputy that within the lifetime of this Government all schools with ten or more pupils will have a second teaching post.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may wish to note that, as a result of the various initiatives one teacher schools, five schools in County Mayo benefited in 1997-98, a further eight County Mayo schools benefited in the current school year, while a further six schools in the county will benefit in the 1999-2000 school year.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 588 and 624 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recently announced a major new funding initiative for the education sector. As a core <Col N="791" /> element of this, a total of 225 new second level teachers will be appointed this year. These new teachers will enable the extension of the home/school/community liaison scheme to all second level schools currently designated as disadvantaged.</P>
    <P>In the current school year, of the 762 schools at second level, 190 schools have been allocated disadvantaged posts and qualify for disadvantaged status on that basis.</P>
    <P>While I have no proposals at present for designating further schools as disadvantaged, I can assure the Deputies that the position of Moyle Park College will receive full consideration in the context of any future review of the disadvantaged and home/school/community liaison schemes.</P>
    <P>A study of educational disadvantage conducted by the Combat Poverty Agency and the Education Research Centre in 1996 concluded that disadvantaged status should be confined to 16 per cent of the school-going population. The study noted that such status had already been granted to 17 per cent of pupils. As an alternative to extending the disadvantaged areas scheme to additional schools, the study recommended that available resources be targeted on the most disadvantaged schools.</P>

      <P>Speech and language therapy services for pupils attending the two special classes for children with autism at Scoil Muire, Leixlip, are provided by an outreach team based in Beechpark, Stillorgan, County Dublin and funded by the Eastern Health Board.</P>
      <P>I have asked my officials to carry out a review of the general situation concerning the provision of speech therapy services in special schools and special classes, in consultation with the Department of Health and Children. My objective is to ensure that the system is in a position to respond in a positive and efficient manner to the needs of children requiring such a service. The needs of the school referred to by the Deputy will be considered in the context of this review.</P>
      <P>With regard to transport arrangements for the pupils in question, I understand that a transport service is now provided for six of the seven pupils presently attending the special classes. Arrangements are also being made for a grant to issue to the school to facilitate the appointment of an escort on this service.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the case to which the Deputy refers.</P>
      <P>The child in question has been a residential pupil at a special school since 1992 and travels home at weekends. A weekend bus service was available to this pupil from 1992 to 1997, when the child's parents changed address. Since then, a rail service has been available to the pupil for weekend travel to and from the school. However, I understand that the child's family opted to make their own private transport arrangements rather than avail of these services.</P>
      <P>In cases where private transport is provided, my Department offers a grant to the parents to help defray the cost involved. The amount of grant payable depends on the distance involved and the level of school attendance by the pupil. Such grants range from £100 per annum for a distance of half a mile to a maximum of £1,500 per annum for 25 miles and over. These rates are currently being reviewed in my Department.</P>
      <P>The level of transport grant paid in any individual case may be appealed where it can be shown that the family involved is encountering hardship in supporting the private transport arrangement. In such cases, a transport grant of up to 50p per mile may be arranged. However, no such appeal has been lodged in the case in question.</P>
      <P>I should also mention that a payment has recently been made to the family in question in respect of their private transport arrangements over the period 1992 to 1998.</P>

      <P>The most recent data available to my Department relates to the 1996-97 school year. At that time there was a total of 5,998 children with special needs attending special classes attached to ordinary primary schools. The data is broken down by reference to children's ages rather than class attended. A total of 4,842 of these children were aged 11 years or younger. The remaining 1,156 children were aged 12 or over.</P>
      <P>The annual census of children attending primary schools conducted by my Department's statistics section indicates that of the 456,094 ordinary pupils in the primary system in 1996-97 school year, 735 did not make the transition on second level. The survey also indicated that 749 children who left special schools or special classes did not continue their participation in the education-training system and did not go to open or sheltered employment.</P>
      <P>Data relating to the overall number of special needs children attending primary school on a fully integrated basis and the number of special needs children in the second level system is not readily available in my Department at present.</P>
      <P>The lack of adequate statistical data relating to special needs children within the education system, particularly integrated special needs children, and the development of mechanisms to address this deficit is one of the key issues currently being considered by a special steering group which has been established in my Department to review overall provision in the special needs area. In considering this issue the group will have regard to the findings of a recent survey of special needs within the second level system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recently announced a major development in special education services under which all special needs children in the primary system are now entitled to an automatic response to those needs. The response in question may take the form of <Col N="794" /> additional teacher or child care support, or both, depending on the needs of the particular child. My Department is currently finalising a series of circulars and information notes to advise schools on the procedures to be followed, including the supporting data required, in seeking special support under this initiative. The data in question will include particulars of the individual special needs children involved; their ages, the nature of their disabilities, etc.</P>
    <P>The circulars and information note in question will shortly be issued to all primary schools. The data submitted by schools is expected to provide a comprehensive picture of the level of special needs within the ordinary primary system. If, following receipt of this data, it is considered that further survey data is required, the necessary arrangements will be made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 597, 598, 599, 600, 601 and 627 together.</P>
      <P>I can confirm that my Department has received representations on behalf of the above named school.</P>
      <P>This Department provides funding towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services in primary schools under two separate schemes. One scheme is the 1978-79 scheme for the employment of secretaries and caretakers under which this Department meets the full cost of salary and employer's PRSI. This is the scheme under which Sancta Maria primary school qualified for a shared secretary arrangement with another primary school. However, this scheme is being phased out as posts become vacant and there is no provision for the appointment of full-time secretaries in posts which are being shared. In the circumstances it will not be possible to sanction the appointment of an additional full-time secretary to either school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Arising from the Programme for Economic and Social Progress &ndash; PESP &ndash; a second scheme was introduced in 1992 whereby this Department provides additional capitation grants for primary schools towards the cost of caretaking and clerical services. This is the scheme under which the Sancta Maria primary school is assisted towards the cost of caretaking services. Under the PESP <Col N="797" /> scheme, schools receive grants of £30 per pupil, £15 for each service, based on their enrolments, which are paid as additions to the standard <i>per capita </i>grant.</P>
    <P>Sancta Maria primary school is currently in receipt of £3,465 per annum, 231 pupils x £15, towards caretaking services, which is the maximum amount available to the school under the current terms of the scheme. Since this is the appropriate amount payable under the scheme, it is not open to my Department at this stage to make an additional grant available to the school.</P>
    <P>In relation to class sizes, the Deputies will be aware from my recent announcement that a new staffing schedule is being introduced which will ensure that from September next all primary schools will operate to a maximum class average of 30 pupils.</P>
    <P>I am also aware of the application from Sancta Maria primary school for the services of a support teacher, formerly known as a teacher counsellor. The operation of the pilot phase of the support teacher pilot project is being closely monitored by my Department's inspectorate. I have received an evaluation report on the project which I am currently considering.</P>
    <P>The question of any further expansion of this pilot project will be addressed following consideration of the evaluation report. The needs of Sancta Maria primary school will be fully considered in the context of any expansion of the support teacher pilot project.</P>
    <P>I have been aware since taking office of difficulties being experienced by some schools in recruiting teachers. In order to alleviate this situation, I have introduced a range of measures which are designed to boost substantially the supply of trained teachers. These measures include a very significant increase in the intake into the colleges of education as well as the recognition for substitute teaching service of primary degree holders who also hold the higher diploma in education.</P>
    <P>In relation to capitation funding, the standard rate of capitation grant payable at primary level was increased by £5 in 1998, with a further £10 increase in 1999, which has brought the standard capitation grant to £60 per pupil. This constitutes a 33 per cent increase in the grant in place in the last two years. These increases in the capitation grant represent important steps in the process of increasing capitation funding at primary level. In addition, Sancta Maria primary school is included in the disadvantaged areas scheme and receives additional funding of £30 per pupil in respect of same.</P>

      <P>The information requested by the Deputy on the number of teachers of art employed in second level schools, the employment status of the teachers concerned, and the extent to which art is being taught by unqualified teachers is not readily available in my Department.</P>
      <P>There is a common basic salary scale for primary and second level teachers. In general, newly appointed second level teachers are placed on the third point of the scale. Incremental credit may be awarded in respect of approved teaching experience and/or relevant non-teaching experience in accordance with agreements reached at the Teachers' Conciliation Council. Each case is considered on its merits.</P>
      <P>In addition to the basic salary, a teacher may qualify for the payment of allowances in respect of qualifications held. The amount of the allowance, if any, payable in any particular case depends on the type and level of the qualification concerned.</P>
      <P>I have asked my Department to forward to the Deputy a list of the approved qualifications in art together with details of the colleges at which the courses leading to the award of these qualifications can be pursued.</P>

      <P>There is only one degree course in occupational therapy available in the State offered by Trinity College Dublin, while both University College Dublin and Trinity College Dublin offer degree courses in physiotherapy. The statistical information on the number of applications to the Central Applications Office and the number of acceptances for these courses for the 1996-97, 1997-98 and 1998-99 academic years is outlined below. As the Deputy will see from these figures, the demand for places on these courses has decreased over the period while remaining very significant, with more than eight first preferences, on aggregate, for each place on offer in 1998-99.</P>

Following the establishment of TEASTAS on an interim basis in September, 1995, the NCEA designation and accreditation process for private colleges was put in abeyance pending receipt of proposals from TEASTAS in regard to this issue in the context of an overall national qualifications framework.</P>

    <P>The Bill provides for the setting up of the National Qualifications Authority to establish and maintain a framework of qualifications, to act as the overall guarantor of the quality of awards and to facilitate and promote access, transfer and progression.</P>
    <P>A further education and training awards council and a higher education and training awards council will also be set up to provide certification, within the framework of qualifications. The Bill sets out provisions for the validation of programmes of education and training by the new awarding bodies and further provides that commercial institutions in respect of some of whose provision the further council or the higher council may make or recognise awards must make arrangements to provide protection for the financial interests of their students.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Youth organisations receive funding from my Department in the form of grant-in-aid under two main schemes &ndash; the youth service grant scheme and the scheme for projects to assist disadvantaged youth. It is a matter for an organisation in receipt of funds to ensure the appropriate financial support for its projects, programmes, and <Col N="802" /> project workers, having regard to the overall level of grant aid available. Youth organisations are not specifically funded along county or geographical boundaries.</P>
    <P>Applications for funding are considered each year having regard to policy considerations, existing commitments and to the overall level of financial resources available for youth organisations. Likewise, applications for 1999 funding will be considered together with other demands on the youth service budget.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 611, 615 and 644 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the issue raised by the Deputies.</P>
      <P>My Department allocated £14,000 to the centre in question in 1998. However, as has been previously indicated to the centre, my Department is not in a position to make further funding available. To the extent that funding becomes available to support children with specific learning disabilities, the key focus will continue to be on school based services.</P>
      <P>The educational needs of pupils with specific learning disability, including those with dyslexia, should generally be capable of being met within the ordinary school system, with the support, where appropriate, of the remedial teacher service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fully qualified primary school teachers are trained to deal with a variety of reading problems, including those which are accompanied by perceptual difficulties. The level and quality of this training is one of the important issues to be addressed by the review group on primary teacher training. In addition, the special training programme for remedial teachers includes a module on specific learning disability. At present, there are 1,302 remedial teacher posts in the primary system. I recently announced my intention to extend the remedial teacher service to all first <Col N="804" /> and second-level schools with effect from September, 1999.</P>
    <P>Second level pupils with specific learning disability are normally integrated into ordinary classes where they may receive additional support through the remedial teacher, guidance counsellor and subject teachers.</P>
    <P>Where more serious cases of difficulty arise, provision is made in one of four special schools and seven special classes dedicated to such children. These special facilities operate at a reduced pupil teacher ratio of 11:1.</P>
    <P>In 1998 my Department allocated a sum of £38,111 to the Association for Children and Adults with Learning Disabilities, ACLD, to assist its administration service and to facilitate access to workshops and summer schools for children from disadvantaged areas. In the current year an allocation of £50,000 is being made available to the ACLD.</P>
    <P>I recently announced a major new development in special education services under which all primary school children with special educational needs will have an automatic right to a response to those needs. The response in question may take the form of additional teaching or child care support or both, depending on the specific needs of the child. Children with specific learning disability, including dyslexia, are entitled to benefit from this development.</P>

      <P>My Department is currently giving active consideration to the recommendations of an interdepartmental committee established to examine and advise on the need for and the cost implications of transferring the UCD faculty of veterinary medicine from its existing premises in Ballsbridge to a new site on the main campus at Belfield. The faculty of veterinary medicine represents an essential national resource for animal and food industries. The existing premises are antiquated and have been evaluated as being unsuitable for modern veterinary education.</P>
      <P>At present day prices, the preliminary estimate for the project is considered to be in the order of £25 million. It has been recommended that funding for the project will be derived from private sector donations, the sale of the existing premises and a direct Exchequer contribution.</P>
      <P>Consideration of all aspects of the project is at an advanced stage.</P>

      <P>Under our system, schools have considerable discretion in the setting and marking of mock examinations. In this context I am aware that certain schools engage in a practice of hiring outside agencies to administer school examinations as a preparation for the certificate examinations. The Deputy will be aware, of course, that all schools have access to past examination papers as a source of preparation for their pupils should they so choose.</P>
      <P>On the more general point raised by the Deputy, I emphasise that this Government is committed to making the education system as accessible and equitable as possible. The abolition of the examination fee for medical card holders represents a tangible step in this direction in the area of examinations.</P>

      <P>The objective in making special arrangements at the certificate examinations for students who have specific learning difficulties including dyslexia is to ensure as far as possible that such candidates are enabled to demonstrate at the examination their level of ability.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy will agree that, in the interests of equity and fairness across the entire body of candidates and indeed to ensure the credibility of the examination system, the work done by students must ultimately be assessed according to the same strictly objective criteria. This is achieved by having a common marking scheme apply to the work of all candidates in a subject and at the same time by ensuring that every effort is made to ensure that full credit is given in accordance with that marking scheme for the work done.</P>
      <P>Traditionally where a concern has been expressed regarding the readability of material, this has been brought to the attention of the individual examiner. However, in the event of an examiner encountering difficulty in reading the script, the examiner is instructed to send the answer book to this or her supervising examiner. This is to ensure that notwithstanding any presentational or readability difficulties every effort is made by the examiner or supervising examiner to ensure that the candidates is given full credit for all work done.</P>
      <P>This year my Department has moved to strengthen this arrangement by instructing all examiners who have a difficulty in accessing the information given by a candidate to refer the script to their supervising examiner. The intention is to ensure that problems with readability whether or not brought to the attention of the Department area dealt with by the examiner and that no candidate is disadvantaged.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 640, 641, 642 and 643 together.</P>
      <P>My Department is continuing to implement a major programme of work designed to ensure that all its existing IT systems and all of the hardware and software components of its IT infrastructure will continue to work through the changeover to the next millennium. This programme also deals with the potential impact of the year 2000 on non-IT equipment with embedded electronics e.g. phone systems, lifts, security systems etc. My Department's programme of work is progressing well towards the goal of ensuring that any potential problems in relation to year 2000 compliance are addressed. Within my Department, personnel are assigned to year 2000 related work as necessary. Over 50 staff, mainly from the IT, personnel and organisation units of my Department are involved in this work to a greater or lesser extent, with overall co-ordination being handled by the IT unit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The National Centre for Technology in Education, NCTE, which I established last year, issued purchasing guidelines to all first and second level schools for use in the acquisition of IT equipment, with particular reference to the expenditure of computer equipment grant aid supplied under the schools IT 2000 programme. This document provided advice on the need to ensure that all IT equipment purchased is year 2000 compliant. In addition, my Department has produced a set of guidelines for schools on dealing with the year 2000 problem. These guidelines document the actions that need to be taken to ensure that existing and newly purchased equipment is year 2000 compliant and provide references to other sources of information on the issue. The guidelines were published through the NCTE which has made them available on its Internet web site and has also issued them in <Col N="814" /> booklet form to all first and second level schools. The NCTE also has a telephone helpdesk in place for schools with queries on the year 2000 issue. My Department is addressing centrally the issue of the year 2000 compliance of systems used in the generation of electronic annual returns to it by schools.</P>
    <P>Year 2000 compliance status reports are sought from bodies under the aegis of my Department every two months. These status reports provide self assessments of progress by the bodies under a number of headings. The reports form the basis of bimonthly progress reports to Government. While a number of bodies particularly larger bodies are making good progress, close monitoring of the situation continues to be necessary. My Department has engaged both the PA Consulting Group and Sunglen Consulting during the last year to assist in monitoring progress by bodies towards achieving year 2000 compliance. The total cost involved to date is £37,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, physical education is an established subject on the second level, post primary curriculum. I believe that on leaving school with their leaving certificate, students should have their achievements in all disciplines given due recognition. The student who displays a keen interest and a talent in physical education should have the same opportunity for recognition through the leaving certificate as an artist or musician does. The inclusion of physical education on the leaving certificate syllabus will allow students to graduate from their post <Col N="815" /> primary schooling with a more comprehensive profile of attainment.</P>
      <P>I have requested the national council for curriculum and assessment to investigate the feasibility of including physical education as a leaving certificate subject. I have asked the NCCA to prepare a draft leaving certificate syllabus and it is my intention that the subject will be introduced into the leaving certificate curriculum in the school year 2001-02.</P>
      <P>In relation to the question of third level sports scholarships, I understand that while swimmers are not precluded from applying for the sports scholarships offered by some of the third level institutions, these institutions do not currently have the facilities which would be required by elite swimmers available. As the Deputy will be aware, preparations for the provision of a 50 metre swimming pool are at an advanced stage. Finally, I would draw the Deputy's attention to the international carding scheme introduced by my colleague, the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, which provides supports, including financial support, to assist Ireland's higher performance athletes.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>

      <Quest>the estimated average annual maintenance costs of a third level student; the amount of the current maintenance grant; and the proposals if any, he has to close the gap.</Quest>
      <QRef>[8299/99]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The statutory framework for the scheme, as set out in the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992, provides for higher education grants in order to assist students to attend full-time third level education. For the 1998-99 academic year, the rates of the maintenance grants payable are set out at £1,652, at the non-adjacent rate and £660, at the adjacent rate.</P>
      <P>I intend, in the context of the annual review of the student support schemes, to continue with this practice and increase the reckonable income limits for the 1999 schemes in line with the relevant increase in the average industrial wage to March 1998. Having regard to the competing demands for the available resources, I have previously outlined my intention to tackle the anomalies within the schemes and target resources to those most in need as a first priority, rather than applying significant across the board increases to the income limits or the grant rates. In this regard, the Deputy will be interested to note that some 60 per cent of certificate and diploma students in the technological sector and 40 per cent of students in the university sector are eligible for maintenance grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to anomalies within the student support schemes, I was particularly concerned about <Col N="816" /> mature students generally and independent mature students in particular in regard to the rate of grant payable. With effect from the coming academic year all eligible mature students will qualify for the higher non-adjacent rate of grant. This improvement is estimated to cost £2.4 million over the next two years. This cost will be met from the additional funding which I am allocating over the next two years to tackle educational disadvantage at third level.</P>
    <P>My priority in relation to the area of student support has been to honour the commitment given in the Programme for Government, An Action Programme for the Millennium, to introduce equitable support for students attending PLC courses. I have honoured that commitment by way of introducing a maintenance grants scheme for students attending post leaving certificate courses with effect from the current academic year. The grants payable under this scheme will be at the same level as the third-level maintenance grants. It is estimated that expenditure on these grants will be in the region of £14 million in 1999.</P>

The situation now is that a working party in the Department is assessing the implementation arrangements for the new initiative.

The position was explained to South Dublin County Council by my Department in a letter dated 9 February 1999.</P>

      <P>I attach for the Deputy's information the detail he has requested which is drawn from the annual census of primary schools. Data for the 1998-99 school year is currently being processed <Col N="818" /> in my Department and is therefore unavailable as yet.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware from my recent announcement in relation to major improvements in primary school classes that a total of almost 400 new teachers will be appointed at primary level this year. From September next all primary schools will operate to a maximum class average of 30 pupils. A new staffing schedule, which will be issued to schools in the near future, is weighted towards improving the position of schools which currently have the largest average class size.</P>
      <P>I would expect that schools in the Tallaght area will be able to dramatically reduce the number of large classes as a result of these improvements, and I am committed to further reducing class sizes generally in the next number of years.</P>

      <P>I am aware that a significant number of new houses are proposed for the Donabate/Portrane area of north County Dublin. The architectural planning of an eight-classroom extension to the existing schools is at an advanced stage. The indications are that this additional accommodation will enable the schools to cater for the increased demand until 2002. The planning section of my Department is, at present, examining the likely accommodation requirements for the longer term and whether these can be met by way of further extension, if feasible, or by the provision of a new school.</P>

      <P>The revision of the primary curriculum under the aegis of the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment has almost been completed. The revised curriculum will shortly be presented to me for ratification. It is my intention that the documentation will be circulated to schools early in September and that the implementation will begin during 1999-2000. The implementation will be supported by an ongoing programme of in-career development for teachers. I recently established the primary curriculum support programme, which will have responsibility for the organisation and delivery of this programme of in-career development. In this regard, I also advertised for an assistant co-ordinator and for teacher-trainers with expertise in either English or Irish. Schools will be free to implement whatever aspects of the revised curriculum they see fit, taking account of the expertise and interests of their staff and the learning needs of their pupils.</P>

      <P>Special arrangements are made at the certificate examinations for candidates with disabilities. A special arrangement is intended to remove, as far as possible, the impact of the disability on the candidate's performance and thus enable the candidate to demonstrate his or her level of attainment while at the same time ensuring that the arrangement does not give the candidate an unfair advantage over other candidates at the same examination. The procedures in place at present followed a Departmental review which took place between 1992 and 1994 and were first implemented in the 1994-95 school year.</P>
      <P>This is an area that requires regular review and arrangements are in hand for a further review. On this occasion I propose to open the review process to submissions from interested parties. The intention is to invite submissions on the basis of an initial report which the examinations expert group is preparing on these matters. I expect to have that report after Easter and to invite submissions at that stage with a view to having any revisions indicated by the review in place for next year's examinations.</P>

      <P>Following qualifications as teachers and on taking up their first appointment, primary teachers undergo a one year period of probation. During this period they are inspected and advised by members of the Department's inspectorate on at least two occasions. On successful completion of the probation period, teachers are fully established as members of the teaching profession.</P>
      <P>The work of established primary teachers is regularly inspected during school inspections which are conducted by the Department's inspectorate in all primary schools at intervals of approximately six years. In addition, the work of an individual teacher is subject to incidental inspection. Teachers whose work is regarded as unsatisfactory are inspected under the terms of rule 161 of the Rules for National Schools.</P>
      <P>Students preparing to become second level teachers within either concurrent teacher education courses or consecutive, higher diploma in education, courses are required to demonstrate through a combination of theoretical and practical tests that they have attained the level of competence deemed necessary by the universities.</P>
      <P>The Secondary Teachers' Registration Council admits to its professional register teachers who meet its academic and professional requirements and have completed satisfactorily a probationary teaching period of one year. For appointment to teaching posts under vocational education committees teachers must meet the specific requirements for the post in accordance with memorandum V7 and be successful in an interview process in which inspectors of my Department participate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For a number of years it has not been possible, due to an increase in the number of second level teachers and the increased workload of the inspectorate, to inspect the work of all probationary teachers at this level. In order to address <Col N="829" /> present and future educational and professional needs of second level teachers I established a steering committee to develop proposals on the establishment of a teaching council. The report of this committee was received during 1998 and legislation is being prepared to establish a teaching council in the near future.</P>
    <P>Probated second level teachers are inspected as part of the ongoing inspection work of my Department. In accordance with circular letter 43/85, there are clearly defined procedures for dealing with cases of under-performing teachers employed by VEC's. Criteria under the headings of (a) preparation and planning and (b) learning and Teaching are used to assess teaching standards and involve the assessment of the quality of pupil-teacher interaction and of curricular attainment.</P>
    <P>A pilot project on whole school evaluation in both primary and second level schools is nearing completion. This pilot project involves an evaluation by my Department's inspectors of learning and teaching as well as school planning and school management. Draft evaluation criteria were developed by the inspectorate for use in the pilot project and they will be reviewed and amended as part of the ongoing development of a system of whole school evaluation for first and second level schools.</P>

      <P>Following a preliminary meeting in January 1999 in my Department's post primary building unit, the VEC's design team undertook to prepare a stage 1 study and produce various options as to how the accommodation needs of St. Patrick's post primary school could be met, based on an overall schedule of accommodation to cater for 500 pupils. A further meeting has been arranged in the near future where the various options will be discussed.</P>

      <P>The planning section of my Department has or is in the process of carrying out reviews of the school accommodation requirements of a number of areas in north County Kildare, such as Naas, Celbridge, Kill, Ardclough, Sallins and Caragh. As a result, temporary accommodation was approved for the convent and Ballycane primary schools in Naas and a decision taken that an additional school be provided as soon as possible. An extension is to be provided at Ardclough primary school. The question of the provision of extra accommodation at the primary schools in Kill, Sallins, Celbridge and Caragh is still under consideration</P>
      <P>At second level, building projects have been approved for all three post primary schools in Naas and they are being progressed at present. The new second level school building, to replace the girls' secondary school in Celbridge, is under construction.</P>
      <P>The school accommodation needs of the north Kildare area will continue to be monitored by my Department.</P>

I would however, mention that the first review of the 1995 report of the ste<Col N="833" /> ering committee on the Future Development of Higher Education, which was carried out by a study group under the chairmanship of Dr. Donal de Buitléir, has recently been finalised and will be published shortly.

      <P>An Action Programme for the Millennium gave a specific commitment in relation to one teacher schools, and indicated that all one teacher schools with ten or more pupils would be allocated a second teacher.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may recall that, with effect from September 1998, I reduced the minimum enrolment figure required for the appointment of a second teacher from 25 to 18 pupils. At the same time I also reduced the minimum enrolment necessary to retain a second post from 23 to 18. As a consequence of these initiatives, a total of 53 schools which otherwise would have had to operate as one teacher units have the services of a second teacher for the current school year. Furthermore, I allowed 14 schools which had enrolments below 18 pupils to continue to operate as two teacher units in the 1998-99 school year.</P>
      <P>The Department will also be aware from my recent announcement that I am introducing additional measures from September next to further improve the position of one teacher schools. Further reductions in both appointment and retention figures from 18 to 14 pupils will benefit 43 schools, while a further seven schools which are currently two teacher units but which have an enrolment below 14 pupils will continue to operate as two teacher units in the 1999-2000 school year. In addition, improvements will be implemented in relation to the staffing schedule for two and three teacher schools.</P>
      <P>I can also assure the Deputy that all schools with ten or more pupils will have a second teaching post within the lifetime of this Government. I would also point to a range of funding initiatives such as schools IT2000 and the special school library books grant which have given significant extra resources to these schools.</P>
      <P>The above initiatives clearly demonstrate the Government's commitment to small schools, and I am determined to put further improvements in place in the next number of years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since coming into office, I have been concerned at the large number of untrained personnel working within the primary school system. For these reasons, I have introduced a range of measures which are designed to boost substantially the supply of trained primary teachers. Specifically, I have ensured that there are over 1,000 places available in the colleges of education during the current academic year. This includes 730 students who will pursue the three year B.Ed degree programme while 280 degree holders will be admitted to an 18 month full-time post graduate course. Additionally, B.Ed. graduates of St. Mary's College, Belfast, who have studied Irish to honours level as an academic subject as part of their teaching qualification will be recognised as fully trained.</P>
      <P>I am also examining the possibility of the University of Limerick providing a one year conversion course for degree holders who hold the higher diploma in education and who have either Irish as part of their degree or have Irish to grade C at the leaving certificate or its equivalent.</P>
      <P>I have further decided that from 1 September 1998, all primary degree holders who also hold the higher diploma in education are recognised as fully trained for the purposes of providing substitution service.</P>
      <P>Finally, Montessori trained teachers who successfully completed the course of three years duration at St. Nicholas, Dun Laoghaire, which is recognised by the National Council for Educational Awards, are granted recognition as fully trained substitutes since 1 September 1998.</P>
      <P>The appointment of substitutes to replace second level teachers absent on approved leave, including sick leave or maternity leave, is a matter in the first instance for the authorities of the schools concerned. While on occasion individual school authorities may experience difficulties in securing a teacher qualified in a specific subject area, I am satisfied that, in general, qualified second level teachers are appointed as substitutes in second level schools.</P>

      <P>I am well aware of the need for students, parents and teachers in all areas of the country to have ready access to the support of educational psychologists. The expansion of provision is one <Col N="835" /> of my priorities as Minister. On Thursday, 11 February, I announced Government approval for the establishment this year of a national educational psychological service. Financial provision has now been made for the first two years of a five-year implementation phase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The estimated level of need nationally for a psychological service was investigated by the planning group for the national educational psychological service and is recorded in its report, which I launched during September of last year. The planning group drew upon the report of the Special Education Review Committee, 1993, as well as on epidemiological studies carried out in other jurisdictions and on the experience of the existing psychological service. As much available evidence as possible was analysed by a technical working group set out by the planning group. The final estimate made in the report was that 11.2 per cent of the school population might expect <Col N="836" /> to be referred at some stage to the psychological service.</P>
    <P>During the past year, the provision of psychological services by my Department has been enhanced by the recruitment of additional 15 additional psychologists to work in primary schools. My Department will shortly be recruiting 25 additional psychologists, who should take up their appointments during the school year 1999-2000. It will not be possible to make the service immediately available to all schools. A detailed analysis is currently being made in my Department of the needs and resources available in each in order to set priorities for the expansion of the national educational psychological service. Information about schools in all parts of the country, including those counties mentioned by the Deputy, will be taken into account in setting the priorities. It is envisaged that, at the end of the five-year period, every school in the country will have access to an educational psychological service.</P>
