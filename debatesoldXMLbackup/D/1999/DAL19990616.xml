      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business, I propose to deal with a number of notices under Standing Order 31 dealing with two different topics. I propose to deal with these two topics separately and I will call on Deputies in the order in which they submitted their notices to my office. In regard to the first topic, I received notice from Deputy Gormley and I now call on him to state the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>Under Standing Order 31, I move that the business of the House be suspended to debate the following issue of urgent public importance, namely, the increase in the number of evictions and, in particular, the latest attempt at eviction of a young man in St. Ultan's Flats, Charlemont Street; the huge increase in rents in Dublin and elsewhere and the urgent need to introduce legislation for security of tenure and the freezing of rents for a three year period.</P>

      <P>Under Standing Order 31, I move that the normal Dáil business be suspended to deal with the serious reports of malpractice in polling stations recently where helpers of voters with a mental handicap were observed marking ballot papers of their charges while the voters' attention was distracted, and that the Dáil introduce independent supervision of voting by people with mental handicap.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources is a relevant Minister in terms of the issue I wish to raise. What proposals does the Government have to restore pensions to people who were disallowed pensions because the relevant Department did not go back sufficiently far? The report of the Ombudsman heavily criticises successive Ministers for this flaw. What will the Government do in terms of paying these pensions to the pensioners involved if they are still alive or their dependants?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, recently announced a Government decision that improvements would be made with regard to those claims. A parliamentary question on this matter was answered on 2 June, in which the position was set out. The issue has been ongoing for many years and there were very limited back payments in a small number of cases. Following a previous report of the Ombudsman, the Government decided to follow the advice he gave on that occasion. That was introduced this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a very urgent issue because pensioners are getting older and they are concerned about it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister, on behalf of the Government, join me in wishing well on this momentous day Nelson Mandela who is retiring from public office and who brought hope to the world in the last number of years? I wish him well and I wish the new President, Mr. Thabo Mbeki, success in transforming that part of the world.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister inform us whether the irregularities on the register of electors for Castleblaney are being investigated, as it was indicated that might be the case?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That item is not appropriate to the Order of Business. There are a number of ways that matter&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Comments were made by the Taoiseach at that time. Are there any investigations of the matters raised by the RTE programme on register irregularities?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>In the first instance I presume that is a matter for the registrar in that area. As you say, a Cheann Comhairle, it is not a matter for legislation at this time.</P>
      <P>I think the House would join us in conveying our best wishes to President Nelson Mandela on his phenomenal achievement in bringing peace and ending apartheid. We had the privilege of him joining us in Ireland and we saw his utter simplicity and dedication to the cause he pursued for so many years, for which he suffered so greatly. Not only has he made a fine contribution to the future development of South Africa, he has given an outstanding example to the world of the value of peaceful settlements, discourse and dialogue, the arrangements necessary to deliver peace and the compromises and give and take involved. It goes without saying that everyone in the House and in this country greatly appreciates his huge contribution. I wish the new President, Mr. Mbeki, every success in his task.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I join the Minister and Deputy Howlin in conveying good wishes to President Mandela. He has been an inspiration to the world and is one of the best known politicians of the century. I hope he enjoys his retirement and have no doubt he will be kept extremely busy. He has already been asked to intervene in a number of places where his wisdom will be needed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Government considering the introduction of a special buy-out scheme, similar to the 1993 scheme, for farmers who have major problems with Land Commission annuities? At this time of plenty there is a real threat to dry stock farmers and many are in arrears.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Estimates will be dealt with in the normal way, if there is a requirement that it be brought before the House. I think the partnerships are doing excellent work and it is important that they should continue that work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>

The issue has been under consideration for some time. I set up this special committee, chaired by an assistant secretary of my Department, to accelerate matters and bring the various views together. The report was placed before the House yesterday and at the same time I supplied copies to the spokespersons, Deputy Finucane and Deputy Bell. I will ensure that Deputy Deasy receives a copy.</P>

There are issues regarding what will and what will not be included and that is why I said I understood there were consultations in this regard. There is no specific legislation on the matter raised by the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the terms of the Council of Europe Agreement establishing the Group of States Against Corruption, adopted by the Committee of Ministers at the Council of Europe on 5th May, 1998, at Strasbourg, a copy of which was laid before Dáil Éireann on 21st January, 1999.</P>
      <P>The establishment of the Group of States Against Corruption is an important develoment in the international fight against corruption. The Council of Europe has already done a great deal of good work in this area through developing guiding principles for the fight against corruption and earlier this year, finalising a criminal law convention on corruption. Ireland, of course, strongly supports these developments, and legislation to enable ratification of the convention is currently under preparation. The establishment of this group represents a further development of this process in that it puts in place a mechanism of mutual evaluation to ensure compliance with these commitments.</P>
      <P>Membership of the group will mean that paper adherence to Council of Europe anti-corruption standards will not suffice. Participating states, with Ireland I hope very much to the fore, will voluntarily submit to detailed and ongoing evaluation of compliance. This is a significant step which I very much welcome and for which I invite the support of the House.</P>
      <P>The group is commonly referred to by its French acronym GRECO. The agreement, although approved by the Committee of Ministers at the Council of Europe last year, did not come into force until 1 May of this year because the agreement contains a commencement clause whereby 14 signatories are needed before its formal adoption, and that threshold was reached only last month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>GRECO is being established for an initial period of three years and its operation will then be reviewed. Each participating state may appoint up to two representatives to the group. GRECO will operate on the basis of mutual evaluation. Participating states will be regularly examined for compliance with anti-corruption obligations by a team selected from experts nominated by all the participating states. An evaluation will initially be based on answers to a questionnaire, but this may be followed by a visit by the investigating team to the state under examination. An evaluation report will be drawn up and the state under examination will be invited to comment before the draft report is submitted to GRECO. The draft report will be debated in a plenary session of GRECO and the state under examination may submit observations orally or in writing before <Col N="485" /> adoption of the report. The report may recommend improvements in domestic legislation or practice and, if so, the state concerned will be invited to report on any measures taken to implement the recommendations. Evaluation reports will be confidential but GRECO may issue a public statement if a state responds inadequately to any recommendations.</P>
    <P>There are no direct implications for Irish law in this agreement although Ireland would, of course, be expected to take account of any recommendations made by GRECO in respect of our compliance with Council of Europe obligations.</P>
    <P>The agreement is to be financed by annual compulsory contributions by the members of GRECO together with additional voluntary contributions, whether by members of GRECO or other sources. It is intended that the percentage contribution for each participating state will be the same as its normal rate of contribution to the Council of Europe. In the case of Ireland this is 0.5 per cent, which in an initial estimate would mean an annual contribution by Ireland to GRECO of approximately £3,000.</P>
    <P>As the agreement establishing GRECO is an international agreement involving a charge on public funds its terms must, under Article 29 of the Constitution, be approved by this House in order for the State to be bound by it. I am asking the House for that approval. This is a good agreement. Membership by Ireland of GRECO will demonstrate not only our commitment to fight corruption, but our willingness for that commitment to be put to the test. I commend this agreement to the House.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Mayo)</i>
        <b>:</b> There are three Bills on the Government's published list of promised legislation dealing with corruption and fraud &ndash; the Criminal Justice (Fraud Offences) Bill, the Prevention of Corruption Bill and the Proceeds of Crime Bill &ndash; and none of them features as a priority to be dealt with this session. They are listed 10, 15 and 16 on legislative list C. Their lowly ranking in the pecking order has to be taken as an indication of the Government's lack of appetite for legislative reform or effective action to deal with the whole area of fraud, theft and white collar crime.</P>
      <P>Time and again on the Order of Business, others Members of the House and I have pressed for the publication of these Bills. None of the Bills will see the light of day before the end of this year at the very earliest yet we have the temerity to sign up to a Council of Europe Agreement establishing the Group of States Against Corruption, a body whose purpose it is to monitor the laws and policies of participating states in the fight against corruption. On the one hand we are setting ourselves up as monitors of the performances of other participating countries while at national level we stand well and truly indicted for our failure to put our own house in order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="486" /> Our laws dealing with theft and corruption date back to the middle of the last century. We have known for a long time that they are totally ineffective and inadequate yet there were so many vested interests involved that successive Governments and Ministers for Justice kicked for touch on the issue and it was regarded as a political no go area. Ordinary criminals were much easier and less politically sensitive options; it is much easier to lock up petty thieves, shop lifters and bag snatchers.</P>
    <P>In the five year period between 1987 and 1992 a stunned and shocked nation witnessed the unveiling of financial scandal after financial scandal. The Goodman corrupt monopoly's abuses in the beef industry where many millions of pounds of fraudulent practices and the systematic cheating of the European taxpayer were uncovered yet no charges were preferred against senior Goodman executives. Only two lower level operatives at the company's Rathkeale plant ended up in jail.</P>
    <P>Greencore, the sale of the Telecom Éireann site in Ballsbridge and the Carysfort College scandal were highly questionable and shady deals involving people one would describe as well connected. When the Gallagher merchant bank collapsed in 1990, Patrick Gallagher was charged, found guilty and sent to jail. However, he served his sentence, not in this jurisdiction but in Northern Ireland under the Theft Act, 1968. We do not have a theft Act in this jurisdiction. The end result was that in spite of incontrovertible evidence against Gallagher, a frustrated Director of Public Prosecutions had little option but to make a no prosecution recommendation.</P>
    <P>Since then very little has happened by way of bringing about legislative change. In the wake of the revelations between 1987 and 1992, we have had a special advisory committee established in 1992 by Pádraic Flynn, then Minister for Justice, to report on fraud and white collar crime. The Law Reform Commission produced a detailed list of recommendations, among them one to adopt British style theft laws but there was no action. The golden circle continued to thrive.</P>
    <P>A litany of other scandals has been uncovered involving huge amounts of money paid through overseas bank accounts to a former Taoiseach and his family's enterprises with no tax paid; National Irish Bank encouraged its customers to invest £35 million in illegal off-shore accounts in order to avoid tax; AIB involved itself in a tax avoidance scam to the tune of £84 million; NIB rigged its charges, thereby stealing from its own customers and Ireland became a clearing house for dodgy money with Irish registered non-resident companies being used by international criminal elements, including the Russian mafia, to launder money.</P>
    <P>As in 1992, the Government, in the wake of the mass outcry of public revulsion, again promised action. The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, guaranteed a role for the Central Bank in protecting the consumer. He spoke about <Col N="487" /> the need, as he said, to examine the law and practice governing the provision of financial services in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, went even further. In banner front page headlines he promised tough, new legislation against fraud and white collar crime. He was going to introduce a prevention of corruption Bill &ndash; a catch-all provision for theft that would also deal with the misappropriation of funds, goods and services. That was exactly 16 months ago and we are still waiting. The Bill was supposed to be published last autumn. However, with the other two anti-fraud legislation promises it has been left to languish on the list and we are now told that its publication is not expected until late 1999. We have been looking at the effective and workable British model for 31 years, yet we have failed to replicate it.</P>
    <P>The McCracken tribunal produced a succinct and scathing report. The Flood and Moriarty tribunals are unearthing major abuses of power and money, yet we do not have the legislative tools to deal with the perpetrators. For some reason, zero tolerance does not seem to have anything like the same degree of impetus when it comes to white-collar crime. We need legislative reform urgently.</P>
    <P>Organised crime knows no boundaries. Money can easily be moved at speed across borders. The supply of illegal drugs is one of the main enterprises of modern crime. It is a huge international enterprise. The Criminal Assets Bureau, set up by the previous Government, has been the most singularly successful weapon in dealing with the criminal underworld which was so dominant a mere four years ago. Huge tax demands and the CAB's extra powers have put George Mitchell, known as &ldquo;The Penguin&rdquo;, John Traynor, Gerry Hutch, Tony Felloni, Brian Meehan and John Gilligan behind bars. Ireland should be pushing for a European criminal assets bureau to track down the proceeds of crime no matter where in Europe the criminal attempts to hide them. We should also be pushing for a European criminal court.</P>
    <P>I welcome the measure, but we must hold up the mirror of reality to our own performance which has been less than adequate. We are not in a position to set ourselves up as arbiters or monitors of international performance, when we stand so indicted due to our lack of action in this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with much of what Deputy Jim Higgins has said. I welcome the Council of Europe agreement establishing the Group of States Against Corruption. The internationalisation of crime must be combated on an international scale. We must also, however, use this opportunity to reflect on our domestic performance. Grandiose international treaties and agreements serve no purpose if we do not have the legislative base to deal with issues that undermine public confidence in the fundamental institutions <Col N="488" /> of State, including politics, banking and administration.</P>
      <P>Legislative measures should ensure that those who commit white-collar crime, including fraud and corruption, end up behind bars. The statistics we debated in the Estimates for the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, or when discussing the prison system, show that the vast bulk of prisoners are incarcerated for petty theft, usually involving sums of less than £200. The bulk of such prisoners are from deprived socio-economic backgrounds. They have no confidence in the judicial or police systems because they see that some people, due to their backgrounds, are able to get away with robbery on a mass scale.</P>
      <P>This measure is before the House simply because a contribution of £3,000 annually is required. The Constitution requires the approval of the Dáil where an international agreement necessitates a payment from the Exchequer. I have the gravest concerns about how Ireland's participation in international agreements comes about. The House does not have a proper overview of international agreements and there has been no debate on our involvement in such agreements. Most of us had never heard of GRECO until this debate was listed on the Order Paper. That is also true for a raft of international agreements that are undertaken by the Government and by civil servants, without proper input by the Oireachtas from the beginning. The Oireachtas must change that practice so that we know the international agreements and treaties in which Ireland is involved. Had no financial contribution been required in this measure, it would never have come before the House for debate and nobody would have known about it, except for the officials in the Council of Europe and those dealing with it in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Department of Foreign Affairs. The House should have a much stronger role in dealing with treaties, agreements and other international business. If that were so, we would constantly have a monitoring system for our own domestic compliance with such agreements and we would not be pretending that the situation is otherwise.</P>
      <P>The aim of GRECO is to improve the capacity of its members to fight corruption by following up &ldquo;through dynamic process of mutual evaluation and peer pressure, compliance with their undertakings in the field&rdquo;. The Minister has provided some examples of how this &ldquo;dynamic process of mutual evaluation and peer pressure&rdquo; is to come about. How will peer pressure work, however, if Members of the Oireachtas, charged by the Constitution and the people to legislate, are unaware of the international obligations and what is happening in other jurisdictions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Oireachtas should examine how we are represented internationally and how international agreements and treaties are concluded in our name. Dáil Éireann should never be a rubber stamp at the end of a process that is agreed by <Col N="489" /> Government, although many of us have allowed that to happen in the past.</P>
    <P>The amalgamation of the Department of Justice with the Department of Equality and Law Reform has created a huge log-jam in the enactment of legislation. I have made this point many times since I became my party's spokesperson on justice. More than 30 instruments of legislation now form a backlog in the Department and two more have been announced this week to add to the list. The situation is becoming farcical. On the Order of Business today I asked whether the Bill to provide pensions to former judges would be enacted, and I was told that it was hoped to enact it before the end of this term, which is in two weeks. Yesterday, I asked whether the Traffic in Illegal Immigrants Bill, which was published yesterday, would be enacted before the end of this session, and I was told it was hoped to enact that also. Quite clearly, there is a difficulty in getting legislation through the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. There should be two separate Departments to undertake this work. They were quite separate and worked extraordinarily well under the stewardship of the former Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Mervyn Taylor. The mistake in amalgamating both Departments should be acknowledged and rectified.</P>
    <P>I hope we will return to the issue of a mechanism for dealing with the overview of international treaties in this House, not just in justice debates but also in the general administration of the House. Through the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, the Ceann Comhairle might reflect on the way the House questions and understands Ireland's position on international agreements before we sign up to them. Nobody believes the House will reject this agreement. I do not recall an agreement that was accepted by the Government being rejected subsequently by the Oireachtas. Other European parliaments, certainly the Nordic parliaments, have an input into every international debate right down to Council of Ministers meetings. Before their Ministers go to Council of Ministers meetings they report to a committee of the house of parliament to get instructions from parliament so they know they speak with the authority of Parliament. We work largely on an executive level. The Government makes its own decisions and expects Parliament to rubber stamp them. This is not a partisan point; it is something that has characterised Government here for some time.</P>
    <P>I wish to comment briefly on the issue of corruption. Deputy Higgins rightly talked about the tolerance of white collar crime that seems to have been the practice in this country heretofore. This type of crime has been gradually exposed by inquiries initiated by the Tánaiste's Department, the regulatory agencies or tribunals of inquiry, but basically we need a whistle blower to get at the truth. Many of the instances were brought to light by chance or happenstance.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="490" /> The unfortunate affair of Mr. Ben Dunne in a hotel in Florida opened a huge can of worms, but it was simply a set of circumstances that brought that about. It was not a monitoring system devised by the Oireachtas that uncovered those facts. We must not simply congratulate ourselves on the number of tribunals of inquiry that are painstakingly revealing the truth &ndash; which are being resisted tooth and nail by many of the principals involved &ndash; we must also consider other legislative measures that can be introduced. It is no use promising such measures; we must realise an issue is of sufficient importance to bring it to the fore. That responsibility rests squarely on the shoulders of the Government and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, who has characterised himself as the hard man on crime.  Crime is not simply something associated with the thug, the petty criminal or the thief who steals a few bob or house-breaks; it also involves the thief who manoeuvres and manipulates money internationally and huge sums illegally. In solidarity with ordinary people, we have to show that is wrong and must be rooted out.</P>
    <P>I hope our participation in the Group of States Against Corruption will show an element of determination to attack corruption. I hope the dynamic process of mutual evaluation and peer pressure envisaged under Article 1 of the GRECO Agreement will have an impact here and ensure the long promised legislative measures are enacted.</P>

        <b>: </b>Ordinary people would welcome genuine moves to curb corruption in business, politics or any other area of life. The definitions of corruption, as applied by the Council of Europe and in this agreement, are far too narrow to take account of the potential for corruption that exists right across Europe. As normal, this agreement conforms to the ethos of market capitalism, which dominates this country and Europe and which informs the relationship between big business and the leading political forces in all the States of Europe. The relationship between big business, powerful lobbies, powerful interest groups, major politics and political parties is not properly scrutinised. Corruption is regarded as having taken place only when money is secretly passed under a counter and a Government decision is made in response to that money favouring whoever paid it in the first instance, whether a wealthy individual or a powerful company. There is no scrutiny of so-called legitimate political contributions. In my view there is massive potential for corruption at this level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A few years ago the most powerful bank in this country divided £200,000 between political parties in this State and that was regarded as a legitimate contribution. There was no follow-on examination into how those parties could be influenced not to enrich particular individuals or do anything of that nature but, by that greasing of the wheels, to treat that bank and other banks favourably for tax purposes in finance Bills and <Col N="491" /> so on. Undoubtedly, no ordinary person believes those large-scale contributions are paid, even if legally according to the laws of the State at present, without those who pay them expecting something in return. That is not something any of the major parties here or throughout Europe want to examine.</P>
    <P>There are other areas of activity which should be scrutinised most intensely. What does the Council of Europe Agreement say about the arms trade in Europe? It is regarded as a legitimate economic activity, but it is the dirtiest and most corrupt undertaking in which humans could be involved. There is massive potential for corruption, which would be legitimate according to these agreements, in the relationship between arms manufacturers, dealers and sellers and the major political parties in Europe. What about funding from those institutions to major political parties across Europe? </P>
    <P>What about incessant lobbying, which has also taken off in a big way in this State in the institutions of the Dáil and Seanad? Lobbying by powerful interests has become a fact of life. These lobbyists have massive influence on major parties and on Government. What about the relationship between the alcohol and tobacco industries and major political parties and Government? We have had the infamous example of the British Labour Party being forced to give back £1 million it had received from Formula One racing, which is heavily financed by cigarette advertising, because it was found out.</P>
    <P>What about instituting bans on special pleading, lobbying and, particularly, funding from such powerful institutions and interest groups to the major political parties? This is not examined in the agreement and, undoubtedly, the major parties here, which benefit from such massive contributions from big business, will not want to examine it either. The ordinary people who have been shocked by the revelations of corruption would want the concept of corruption to include a far wider range of activities at the interface of business and politics. While they are regarded as normal and legitimate, when powerful interest groups can purchase political influence, it constitutes corruption.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I was surprised to hear Deputy Howlin say he had not heard of GRECO before this debate. I would have thought that if he had not heard of El Greco, he would at least have heard of Zorba, the Greek, but that is a matter for another discussion. What Deputy Howlin had to contribute in this respect was not indicative of a backlog but illustrated a tremendous output. Since I became Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, my Department has been responsible for the enactment of 20 Acts in the Houses of the Oireachtas, or one third of the <Col N="492" /> Government's legislative programme over the same period. I am not boasting about it &mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;it is a fact. In addition, the legislative output of the equality and law reform section of the Department bears comparison with my illustrious predecessor. The reality is that there never has been a higher output of legislation from the Department and this will continue.</P>
      <P>There was a difficulty with regard to the Proceeds of Crime Act because the original legislation which I introduced when in Opposition was challenged in the courts. It was found to be constitutional, while the former Minister of Justice on its presentation said it was not. However, the courts have spoken and what I said then was proven to be correct &ndash; that it was constitutional. In bringing forward amendments to the Proceeds of Crime Act it will be necessary to take account of the judgment of the courts which was positive and upheld the main Act. However, the details of that judgment must be urgently studied to see if there are any implications for the Bill.</P>
      <P>I am particularly interested in dealing with white collar fraud. I am satisfied that our criminal legislation, in so far as it relates to matters such as theft, forgery, counterfeiting and dishonesty, in general terms, is out of date. Our Larceny Act dates back to 1916 while some fraud offences go back further. It is time for a change. I have made perfectly clear on numerous occasions that I am determined to tackle white collar fraud. We are working on the Criminal Justice (Fraud Offences) Bill at present. I anticipate I should be in a position to publish it before the end of this year. It will be among the most comprehensive Bills of its type in the history of the State. It will introduce new definitions of theft, counterfeiting and forgery and will be underpinned by the broad offence of dishonesty. From the day of the enactment of that legislation, the ability of lawyers to use technicalities will be greatly diminished as I intend to make it plain to everyone that if a person dishonestly makes a gain or causes a loss, he or she will be guilty of a criminal offence and a jury will have little difficulty in understanding the ingredients of that offence.</P>
      <P>I always find the contributions of Deputy Joe Higgins, my fellow countyman, very interesting and sometimes what he says is positive. However, it would be a mistake to allow him get away with creating the impression that all politicians, other than himself and a few others on the left, are subject to a massive lobby and that in some way we are influenced by what large tobacco or drinks companies say to us. I assure Deputy Higgins that is not the case as far as I and my colleagues are concerned. Deputy Higgins is sincere in his observations but I am equally so in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank all Members for their support for this agreement which is a significant step forward in the fight against corruption. While it is important <Col N="493" /> that states enter into anti-corruption commitments such as the new Council of Europe Criminal Law Convention on Corruption, it is equally important that states comply fully with these commitments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>Section 1: In page 3, between lines 16 and 17, the following new definition inserted:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;Community licence' means a Community licence for the international carriage of passengers by road for hire or reward (within the meaning of Article 3a (inserted by Council Regulation (EC) No. 11/98 of 11 December 1997f7&gt;(1)) of Council Regulation (EEC) No. 684/92 of 16 March 1992f7&gt;(2));&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>From 11 June 1999, all operators carrying on international passenger transport operations must hold a Community licence, issued in accordance with the requirements of Council Regulation (EC) No. 11/98 of 11 December 1997 and amending Regulation (EEC) No. 684/92 of 16 March 1992 on common rules for the international carriage of passengers by coach and bus.</P>
      <P>In accordance with these Council regulations, a new Community licence will replace the existing international road passenger transport operations licence granted by the Minister under the European Community Road Passenger Transport Regulations, 1991. This IRPTOL is valid for both national and international operations. Many holders of IRPTOLs do not operate international services but confine their operations to the national market. The existing international operator's licence will therefore remain valid for those operators who will not be carrying on international operations after 11 June 1999. As existing international licences expire, they will be replaced by the new Community licences which will also be valid for national operations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 1 provides a definition of Community licence in section 1 of the Bill. This is required as the Bill refers to Community licence in a number of sections. Section 4 provides that transport discs shall be issued to holders of existing road freight and road passenger licences in respect of each vehicle on the licence. Transport discs will also be required by the hold<Col N="494" /> ers of the new Community licence for each vehicle. Amendment No. 2 provides that transport discs will also be issued to the holder of a Community licence in respect of each vehicle.</P>
    <P>Section 5 prohibits the operation of a vehicle under a road passenger and road freight licence unless a transport disc has been issued in respect of the vehicle. Amendment No. 4 extends this prohibition to the operation of a vehicle under a Community licence issued by the Minister. Under this amendment, vehicles operated under a road freight, road passenger or Community licence must have a transport disc in respect of each vehicle used in such operations. In regard to amendment No. 7, section 12 provides for offences in relation to the authorisation of licensing documents. Amendment No. 7 includes a community licence in the definition of &ldquo;licensing document&rdquo; for the purposes of this section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I am always interested to know why it is necessary to amend legislation in the Seanad very shortly after it has been passed by this House. Seanad amendment No. 1 was a Government amendment. The Minister has told us this amendment to include community licences is necessary because of a Council regulation of 11 December 1997. Is that the case and, if so, why was this House not told about it, given that the European regulation dates from 11 December 1997? The other amendments are technical ones consequential on Seanad amendment No. 1. I would like to know the answer to that for my own satisfaction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue is as the Deputy has put it. As we have already pointed out, the community licence was brought in under European Council regulations. It was then subsequently decided, as a matter of policy, that the community licence was to replace the current international operator's licence. As the Deputy said, the Bill had already been introduced and, accordingly, these four amendments were necessary. It should also be noted that the community licence is subject to the same qualifying conditions as the IRPTOL. We are in a constant learning process. Perhaps this heralds an increased use of the Seanad.</P>

    <P>This amendment arose on foot of proposals by Deputy Bell's colleague, Deputy Stagg. It has improved the Bill. The amendment provides that it is an offence for a person to refuse to give his or her name and address when required to do so or to give a name and address which is false or misleading. The creation of an offence and penalty in section 13 for failure to give an address when required strengthens the action.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputies and particularly the spokespersons, Deputies Finucane and Bell for their assistance in getting this legislation through the House quite quickly. We had a number of amendments on Committee Stage where both Deputies contributed. Deputy Bell raised a very important detailed drafting point and the Bill was amended, at our request, to include the Dumping at Sea Act, 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a very important Bill and gives effect to the Oil Pollution Preparedness Response and Co-operation Convention, OPRC, of 1990. The convention is designed to ensure proper arrangements are in place in the International Maritime Organisation states &ndash; IMO &ndash; to deal with emergencies that arise from oil spillages at sea. It calls for member states to have a national major emergency plan ready to deal with any of these spillages and the difficulties that result from it and provides for these plans. There is a requirement on all ships carrying oil cargo and installations producing or handling oil products to have emergency pollution plans in place for anyone becoming aware of a spillage to notify the national agency. The Irish Marine Emergency <Col N="500" /> Service &ndash; IMES which was set up in 1991 as part of my Department is the designated Irish response agency and has made the necessary arrangements to give effect to the convention. However, it is necessary to provide the statutory basis for the actions by designated response agency in implementing the convention and enabling the agency to direct the preparation of emergency plans by others and to make the reporting of oil pollution incidents or potential incidents mandatory. The Bill does this and gives them the backing they need to do the important work they have undertaken. It also extends Ireland's jurisdiction for dealing with pollution from the present 12 miles limit to 200 miles, which greatly extends their area of responsibility and control. This will be particularly important to the west and south-west generally. It is a further protection of our marine environment and the valuable maritime coastal resources which are dependent on it. It also introduces very tough new penalties of up to £10 million for non-compliance. This will help to protect our marine environment for the future and in that respect it is a very important Bill.</P>
    <P>I thank the Deputies for their constructive and helpful approach to the Bill at all stages. I look forward to bringing it to the Seanad.  Unfortunately, people do not realise the volume of worthwhile work that is done where there is agreement between all the parties. I thank the spokespersons for their help.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister said we all agreed with the necessity for this Bill. When one considers that 31 billion gallons of oil are transported by sea each day we can see what could go wrong. There were certain points raised when we discussed the Bill initially. We were very progressive in regard to the introduction of legislation in this area. The major semi-State ports would have an oil pollution preparedness policy and would have the resources to deal with it. However, I was concerned about fishery harbours around the coast, which in many cases would not have the resources or suitable receptacles for oil. In many cases those harbours are under the control of local authorities, which in turn do not have the financial resources. Parallel with the introduction of legislation of this nature, it is extremely important that where local authorities do not have the financial resources that every financial encouragement and inducement is given to them to provide the resources for the harbours and ports. We are all reminded of the damage arising from previous oil spillages and its effects on the eco system for a long time. Will the Minister have his Department assess the facilities at all harbours to store oil and so on? On a previous occasion we considered the civil liability involved and prepared for such an eventuality. In the event of anything happening there is a financial mechanism which allows for appropriate compensation. We should not, however, focus exclusively on sea pollution. We must look at the inland waterways and <Col N="501" /> the types of cabin cruisers used on them. What controls exist there? We do not want oil discharges along our inland waterways. In many cases financiers whose international tankers use our ports are from one country while the oil is from another. Often the crews are from Third World countries and there can be communications difficulties which can lead to potential problems.</P>
      <P>I welcome this legislation. Proper research should be carried out into all harbours to ensure there are adequate controls and equipment so that there is at least a receptacle for those who wish to discharge oil. That will lead to an improved environment.</P>

      <P>As a former member of a local authority and former chairman of a harbour authority, I have grave doubts that either would have the equipment or finance to deal with a major oil spillage. I am sure the Minister will take on board the points made by Deputy Finucane and me. We are pleased to support this legislation and hope it will pass through the Seanad quickly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know the extent to which the Minister liaises with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government because sea pollution is an issue which involves both Departments. I live in a coastal constituency and a serious problem arises from pollution caused by the inadequate funding provided to local authorities by the Department of the Environment and Local Government and, ultimately, the Department of Finance. The lack of sewage treatment plants in this State is a disgrace. The Government recently allocated £44 million, but that money was a blanket allocation, although some of it went to coastal towns and villages.</P>
      <P>The provision of a sewage treatment plant makes an enormous difference to an area. The blue flag scheme which is overseen by the European Union classifies beaches according to the purity of the sea water. In my county only three of the numerous beaches &ndash; Counsellors Strand, Bonmahon and Clonea East &ndash; qualify for the blue flag under that scheme. A number do not qualify because raw sewage is discharged into the sea directly from septic tanks. What will the Minister do about this problem? The Minister for Tourism and Sport should also be here because this has huge implications for the tourism industry. We need a programme to ensure that every village or town with a beach has a proper sewage treatment plant. It is frightening to think that one of the largest resorts in the State, Tramore, does not have a modern sewage treatment plant. Will the Minister bear in mind the necessity for such a basic facility? </P>

      <P>The £44 million which the Minister for the Environment and Local Government has allocated will have a huge impact on Dublin where raw sewage is pumped into the sea from the north of the city. From now on that will stop. The Minister is committed to pursuing that objective throughout the State but it is not part of this legislation, which deals with oil pollution. I will convey the Deputy's remarks to the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Deasy. The Minister made the point about Dublin. The problem is if Dublin is not affected it does not matter. If there was a sea in the middle of Dublin, there would be a sewage treatment plant to deal with the problem. Westport is a beautiful town which attracts many tourists but the sewer from the town flows into the sea, and that is outrageous. The Government should think about the west and other seaside resorts apart from Dublin. The Minister answered the question and it was &ldquo;Dublin, Dublin, Dublin&rdquo;. That is the thinking of the Minister and the officials, and it is the reason Dana is now a Member of the European Parliament.</P>

The trickles which come out elsewhere would be small in comparison to what is coming out at Howth Head at the moment. I accept that this matter is just as important in other areas. However, I hope, as does the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, that the problem in Westport and other areas will be dealt with as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>I wish to intervene on two points. There was discussion on Committee Stage that the decision to rule this amendment out of order was excessive. The case was made that acceptance <Col N="503" /> of this amendment, far from incurring an additional cost on the State, might reduce expenditure. The Minister has tabled virtually the same amendment because in the course of the discussion he saw the sense of what we proposed in relation to the addition of a structure to a list. The original provision in the Bill was that the addition would be where it was necessary. We argued that there should be an alternative, that is where it was considered desirable as well as necessary or as an alternative to being necessary. I think the Minister has accepted the argument made on Committee Stage and amendment No. 3 is similar and addresses the same point.</P>

      <P>In the interests of ensuring that the House passes a Bill which is effective and flexible enough to cope with the need to protect our architectural heritage, I agreed on Committee Stage to advance these amendments which insert the words &ldquo;or desirable&rdquo; in two sections of the Bill. The amendment in the names of Deputy Gilmore and Deputy Dukes has the same effect. The first amendment to section 5 will enable the planning authority to include a structure in the record of protected structures where the authority considers it is desirable in order to ensure its protection. Under the current wording of the Bill the inclusion of a structure is possible only where the authority considers it necessary to do so for its protection. It will now be possible to do so in both circumstances &ndash; when it is necessary and when it is desirable. I believe that covers the point made by the Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second amendment to section 22 will permit the planning authority to acquire a protected structure by agreement or compulsorily when it is desirable to make the acquisition for the protection of a structure. The current wording of the Bill would permit the authority to acquire a protected structure only when it is necessary for its protection. Therefore, acquisition will be possible in both circumstances when it is necessary or <Col N="504" /> when it is desirable. These amendments will strengthen the powers of the planning authorities to protect the architectural heritage.</P>

      <P>The reason I tabled this amendment was to give me an opportunity to ask the Minister of State whether he has been able to reflect on the intent of what is proposed.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dukes' amendment is already covered by the Bill, namely that structures proposed for inclusion in the record of protected structures are protected while their status is considered. For example in section 8, works to a proposed protected structure which affect its character are not exempted development in the same way as for protected structures. Section 9 makes it a criminal offence to damage both protected structures and proposed protected structures. The owner or occupier of a proposed protected structure is under the same duty of care as a person who owns or occupies a protected structure. The same rules and compensation apply to both structures, that is, a refusal of planning permission for works which affect a proposed protected structure is not compensatable. As such the amendment is unnecessary. This protection has been included where it is most necessary to prevent damage to structures which are proposed for protection, most importantly in section 8 where works to proposed protected structures which affect their character will not be exempt.</P>

      <P>In page 7, line 42, to delete &ldquo;may&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a matter which was discussed at some length on Committee Stage. The proposal here is to make a modification in section 7 which deals <Col N="505" /> with registration under the Registration of Title Act. The Bill as it stands proposes that where a structure is included in the record of protected structures, a structure, a specified part or a specified feature within the attendant grounds, its inclusion may be registered under the Registration of Title Act. On Committee Stage the Minister of State said that would be an onerous procedure and that he was not sure we could, in practical terms, require such registration. Given the difficulty we frequently encounter with buildings of the kind envisaged here it seemed to me we should always err on the side of protection. There can be difficulties if the relevant references are not made in the registration of title. There might be difficulties at subsequent stages with establishing that a specified feature in the grounds or a specified part of a structure benefited from the protection being provided by the legislation.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State's argument was on the grounds of practicality. He felt it would not be practical to require this although he agreed with the spirit of what we were seeking. I would like to know if he has made any further inquiries about the practicality of this matter because it seems to me we should err on the side of protection rather than leave arrangements rather loose and open to become the subject of argument at a later stage or to give rise to uncertainty. As we know to our cost, wherever there is uncertainty in relation to protected buildings or structures that uncertainty often becomes an excuse for damaging them or doing away with them or acting in a way that is contrary to their protection. I hope the Minister of State will advise that the extra duty that would be imposed following acceptance of the amendment could be taken into consideration and that there would be certainty rather than doubt.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 7 enables the planning authority to register the fact that a building is protected as a burden on that property in accordance with the Registration of Title Act, 1964. The provision is optional rather than mandatory and the language is based on a similar provision in the National Monuments Acts, 1930 to 1997, which has worked effectively.</P>
      <P>As discussed on Committee Stage, requiring the planning authority to register the status of all registered protected structures would be a laborious process and would impose a huge administrative burden, both on the planning authorities and on the land registry. Ideally, if the land registration system was reformed and updated, the provision for the mandatory registration of a building's protected status should be included in the Bill. However, in the absence of a wider reform of the system it would not be feasible to accept this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has, however, discussed with the Law Society how best to bring to the attention of the buyers and sellers of property that a building is protected. This will include measures <Col N="506" /> such as ensuring that the record is available to the public and the Law Society issuing practice guidance to specifically deal with the issue. This would cover all protected structures, including most urban property, which has never been registered.</P>

      <P>In page 8, line 44, after &ldquo;requirements&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;in so far as is practicable without compromising the integrity of the protected feature or structure&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>There was a lengthy discussion on Committe Stage regarding the provisions in respect of buildings that are used as places of worship. Has the Minister of State been able to reflect on this? This is a difficult area and the Minister of State is, properly, reluctant to deal with an area &ndash; how people dispose of the interior of buildings that are used for worship &ndash; where the State has no competence.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage there was a temptation to have a long and arcane debate on the various stages in modes of worship that have taken place. That was avoided and I will not deal with it now. Nevertheless, there have been controversies, some of them heated, about some changes to the interiors of buildings. The question is how far we should push our concern with protecting specific features of the interior of buildings without interfering with their use.</P>
      <P>The amendment is concerned with practicability and allows for changes to liturgies and modes of worship while taking account of the integrity of the features themselves. Unfortunately, in all of the cases that have been controversial there has been interference with what may be termed the visual integrity of features, for example changes that have been made to altars. In some of the controversial cases the original structure was retained and another was put in front of it. In other cases changes were made to the original structure, which has caused difficulties. Has the Minister of State any proposals regarding the balance between practicability and protection?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment would qualify the condition that planning authorities should respect liturgical requirements when considering the issue of a notice under the section as to what type of works would or would not require planning permission. The Bill contains special provisions regarding places of worship in recognition of the unique nature of these buildings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Churches form perhaps the most striking part of our architectural heritage in many towns and villages throughout the country and should be subject to the same protection as other worthy buildings. However, we must also recognise that <Col N="507" /> such buildings are sacred to the congregations who worship in them and the State must be slow to interfere in matters which affect the liturgical requirements of churches.</P>
    <P>The wording chosen in the Bill was designed to reflect the sensitive divide between the need for the State to protect the built heritage and respecting churches and other places of worship. I am, therefore, reluctant to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>In page 10, line 41, after &ldquo;element&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and the removal or alteration of any advertisement structure&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment will clarify that a section 11 restoration notice can be served to require the removal of a sign or hoarding from a protected structure. The provision as originally drafted already allowed for the possibility for a planning authority to require the removal of signs and advertisement from a protected structure. However, in response to Deputy Dukes's concerns, I agreed to look at the wording again to make it clearer and have, therefore, proposed this amendment.</P>
      <P>Advertisement structure is comprehensively defined in the 1963 Act, which is construed with this Bill. It means any structure which is a hoarding, scaffold, framework, pole, standard, device or sign, whether illuminated or not, and which is used or intended for use in exhibiting advertisements. It therefore comprehensively covers all types of structures which are used to carry advertisements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I emphasise that section 11 notices may be used for all types of works which are detrimental to the character of a protected structure or an area of special character. It can be used to require the removal of advertisements that have received planning permission or are exempt, as well as those which were done without planning permission. The only distinction made between authorised and unauthorised works is that when unauthorised works are less than five years old and are, therefore, liable to have enforcement action taken against them, the planning authority will not pay to have them removed. In other cases the authority must pay for the works. References <Col N="508" /> to the works being authorised or unauthorised, as suggested in Deputy Dukes's amendment, are, therefore, unnecessary.</P>
    <P>Regarding structures added to or superimposed upon the structure, this is unnecessary as the definition of structure in section 1 defines structure as including all fixtures or features which form part of the exterior of a structure. This is in addition to the definitions of land and structure in the 1963 Act, which mean that anything made or erected on any structure is in itself a structure. I therefore consider this element of Deputy Dukes's amendment to be superfluous.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 14:</P>
      <P>In page 19, between lines 14 and 15, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(5) Where a lawful development to a protected structure would for the first time require compliance with a requirement of building regulations or fire regulations, full compliance with which would endanger the character of the structure or any element of it, the planning or fire authority may apply those regulations with such reasonable modifications as take into account the protected status of the structure.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment was discussed on Committee Stage. I seek to have common sense applied to the interface between fire and building regulations and the provisions of this legislation in relation to the protection of buildings. I am concerned that, in the litigious times in which we live, there is growing concern among professionals, such as architects or people who, for example, must certify that buildings comply with building regulations or fire officers who have particular <Col N="509" /> statutory functions to carry out, which is leading them to take a very cautionary and rigid approach in regard to the application of the law and the regulations. When they must certify a building or approve fire regulations, one of the questions that goes through their minds is, &ldquo;what if this goes wrong&rdquo;? That is leading to a rigid application of the regulations.</P>
    <P>When dealing with listed buildings and those of architectural merit I am concerned that there may be a clash between the application of the letter of the law in terms of building and fire regulations and the protected status of the buildings. I am, therefore, seeking to legislate for the exercise of good judgment on the part of all concerned. I do not for a moment suggest that fire or building regulations should in any way be diminished or compromised in their application, but the Bill should make it clear that we are legislating for the exercise of good judgment on the part of professionals who oversee the interface between fire and building regulations and the protected status of buildings.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>When this amendment was discussed on Committee Stage I promised to consider the issue of protected structures and the building and fire regulations further before Report Stage. Having discussed the issue I am not inclined to accept the Deputy's amendment, although I understand his reasoning for putting it forward. I have taken this view primarily on the basis that my Department is currently addressing the application of the fire and building regulations to protected structures within the framework of those regulations.</P>
      <P>I intend to adopt an additional technical guidance document under the building code aimed specifically at protected structures and other heritage buildings rather than allowing a planning authority to apply those regulations with reasonable modifications as suggested by the Deputy. This document will be adopted before the Bill comes into operation. It will be based on the work of the Royal Institute of Architects of Ireland, the Heritage Council, An Taisce and my Department, which are co-operating in producing worked examples based on a dozen or so heritage buildings which have already been successfully conserved and converted to modern uses within the building control system.</P>
      <P>The building regulations apply to the designers and builders of buildings and not the local authority. Therefore, the question of the planning authority applying those regulations in a certain way as suggested in the amendment does not arise. Many of the fears that the building regulations code would inhibit the proper conservation of existing buildings have largely been unfounded. In addition, changes introduced in the 1997 regulations made new provisions for existing buildings which have further assisted their conservation and adaptation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The technical guidance documents adopted under the building control system are the best way in which to address the issue raised by the Deputy rather than an amendment providing that planning authorities may apply the building or <Col N="510" /> fire regulations on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis. While these regulations have a certain amount of flexibility to accommodate the differing requirements of protected structures, their prime purpose is to ensure the safety of people in the building. This amendment might create a big hole in that important principle and, therefore, I do not accept it.</P>

      <P>In page 24, between lines 23 and 24, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;42. &ndash; In determining any planning appeal related to a protected structure, An Bord Pleanála shall take into account that status under this Act and such consideration shall include any guidelines or reports issued by the Minister under this Act. The Board shall not permit the demolition of or material alteration to a protected structure unless two-thirds of its members shall vote for such a permission and a record of the voting of the Board members on such appeals shall be appended to the Inspector's report and made available for public inspection. Before determining such appeals the Board shall seek a report on such structures from the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, and the Board shall give specific consideration to any recommendation by the Historic Buildings Advisory Council.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>These amendments arise from a particular concern with some decisions made by An Bord Pleanála and the method of making them. The Minister of State pointed out on Committee Stage that this, perhaps, was not the best medium through which to make provisions of this kind for An Bord Pleanála and I am inclined to agree with him.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed the Government wishes to put a proposed regulation to increase the membership of An Bord Pleanála to the House without debate. That is not a proper way of dealing with this because there are issues relating to An Bord Pleanála which need to be examined.

I raised the problem with the parliamentary draftsman and it was agreed that some changes were necessary to the subsection. I have, therefore, tabled this amendment which clarifies the matter raised by the Deputy. I appreciate that his amendment and mine are virtually identical. I, therefore, ask the Deputy to withdraw his amendment and thank him for bringing the wording to our attention.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill. As the House will know, there was a major black spot on the north side of the city in that it did not have an institute of technology. While we are well endowed with DCU, the absence of a regional college of technology severely damaged participation in third level, particularly in working class areas of the north-west of the city. The Blanchardstown Institute of Technology will change that. It is important that the opportunity afforded by the establishment of this institute is seen as an innovative approach to participation in third level education of those who traditionally have not gone on to third level.</P>
      <P>Thankfully 60 per cent of the cohort now go on to third level and, if we include PLCs, there is about 80 per cent participation among students who sit the leaving certificate. However, there is still a huge gap to be bridged in that the level of participation is as low as 5 per cent in some communities. There are serious issues to be addressed on the north side of the city in areas such as Darndale, parts of Coolock, Mulhuddart and in many of the newly developing areas.</P>
      <P>The Blanchardstown Institute of Technology must not be a replica of the Regional Technical Colleges and institutes of technology that already exist. If we apply the same model, we will have the same outcome. It is disappointing that the Bill does not contain an innovative legislative framework for this institute. It will take on board the same functions, objectives, regulation system and so on as applies to the other institutes. We expected this institute to strike out in a new direction and the Minister to amplify some of the objectives in the existing institute of technology legislation to cater for the new mandate of the Blanchardstown institute.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt financial support will have to be addressed in a more innovative way. The Minister and Minister of State have acknowledged that as regards participation by mature students and those from non-traditional backgrounds in third level education, it is not enough to introduce the grants scheme and leave it at that. We must develop programmes of financial, curricular and academic support for students to ensure they get into college and, more importantly, do not drop out after a certain period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said last night, the drop out from college is a black hole about which we know very little. It would be interesting to discover if it is more concentrated among students from disadvantaged <Col N="513" /> backgrounds. I fear it is and it is disappointing that the Minister has not given hard information to enable us analyse the drop out rate which, at 35 per cent, is a serious problem. Too often it is seen as a problem in just financial terms because the State spends £10,000 per year and does not get any &ldquo;product&rdquo; at the end of it, but the loss to the students who participated in the full expectation of success and had their hopes dashed is more important. We need to analyse the background to the high level of drop out and use the Blanchardstown institute as a model to ensure those mistakes do not occur again.</P>
    <P>I am pleased the Minister recognised the great opportunity afforded by the institute for participating with information technology companies. The arrival of IBM, which is a major company not only in terms of employment but in terms of bringing a campus of activities to that area of the city, opens up the opportunity for a fruitful partnership between the institute and the industry in general. Other colleges, particularly in Tallaght, are to be commended on the more flexible approach they have taken to developing programmes suitable to industry and to students who have job commitments. It is disappointing that the Department's thinking is way behind in many ways. It still refuses to recognise part-time study as being on a par with full-time study. It is crucial that we recognise part-time study as being the way of the future and not allow it to remain the Cinderella of education. If what Ministers say about lifelong learning is to become more than rhetoric, there must be suitable packages to support part-time study.</P>
    <P>Colleges have been equally slow to offer more flexible courses. Deputy Higgins would be critical of modularisation and bringing education down from its lofty objectives, but access is crucial. Modular delivery of education which allows people to get recognition for what they do in part-time courses is crucial to giving access. I recognise Deputy Higgins's concern to ensure the broader needs of education are not lost in the process. However, it is crucial that institutes such as Blanchardstown are innovative in developing programmes people can access, using the scope of information technology to foster distance learning where possible. I sound a word of caution about distance learning. The evidence is that it is often disadvantaged students who find it most difficult to participate in distance learning because it presupposes a very high level of familiarity with the support structures of education. The institute must ensure there is a very supportive environment as well as offering the opportunity for distance learning. It is more than just developing programmes and hoping people avail of them. It must develop structures with an element of outreach and support to achieve participation.</P>
    <P>There is pressure regarding the need to encourage a high level of participation and achieve quality outcomes. For example, a college in the Thames Valley in the UK was a flagship in terms <Col N="514" /> of the achievement of much wider participation in disadvantaged communities. It was seen as an innovative college in that regard, but it has recently run into difficulties and I understand the board has been threatened with dismissal because the college is not achieving certain academic and quality standards. It will take careful management in terms of ensuring the maintenance of the highest standards while at the same time achieving wide access and participation. They are by no means in conflict; they can be achieved together, but a conscious decision must be made at the outset that both will be run in tandem.</P>
    <P>This relates to the issue of resourcing. There is nothing in the Minister's speech or in the Bill to suggest that innovative funding mechanisms will exist for the new institute in Blanchardstown. It appears the institute is being asked to pour its new wine into the same old skins which the Department offers to all institutes of technology. There is a need for innovative thinking from the Department regarding its funding mechanisms and I am interested to hear the Minister's views on that aspect because his speech was remarkably light in terms of concrete evidence of new policy support mechanisms from the Department for the new institute. He used rhetoric regarding what he wants it to do, but there will be a need for a partnership which will involve resourcing between the Department and the Minister and the authorities of the new college. It is important not to pass the legislation in the expectation that the new institute can be run identically to all the other institutes of technology if it has to take on a more challenging role.</P>
    <P>I welcome the establishment of the Institute of Technology, Blanchardstown. In constituency terms, I would have preferred it to be located further east where it might have been of greater benefit to people in my area. This issue was much fought over in the past and many people advocated Finglas as a more suitable location. However, those debates are long over and the introduction of the Bill is welcome.</P>
    <P>I raised the issue of the participation of parents and teachers in vocational education committees. The Bill provides for a change in the mechanisms of appointment in respect of the vocational education committees in the South Dublin, Fingal and Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council areas. It is extraordinary the Minister did not use the Bill to ensure that parents and teachers are represented from the outset on the new vocational education committees which will be formed soon, following the election of the new county councils. I ask the Minister to outline the agreements he has entered into with the different councils and the appointing bodies for the vocational education committees to ensure that parents and teachers will be represented from the outset.</P>
    <P>The legislation governing the appointment of such persons to vocational education committees will not be published until later in the year. There is a need to put in place an agreement, if it is not <Col N="515" /> already in place, to ensure reasonable arrangements are made now so parents and teachers can participate from the outset and the appointments made on a pro tem basis will not be in conflict with any subsequent legal requirements the Minister may develop later in the year. This is a good time to ensure that everybody knows what the ground rules will be later in the year and that if parents and teachers are appointed on a pro tem basis, it will not necessitate a rerunning of elections when the Minister publishes the legislation. There must be a reasonable indication of what will be required for selection now and there is a need to ensure that those involved in the selection process on a pro tem basis make the correct arrangements.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to outline whether all vocational education committees intend to appoint parent and teacher representatives from the outset. Has he received any indication in that regard? It is important that these arrangements are put in place. Section 11 contains a legislative vehicle where, by amendment, a minimalist requirement on a pro tem basis on all vocational education committees can be signalled in terms of how this area should be handled until the full legislation is introduced.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for introducing the legislation and congratulate those who put such enormous effort into getting the project to this stage. They are recruiting rapidly and are very much involved in the difficult process of getting a college off the ground. I express the appreciation of this side of the House for the efforts which are being made to make the project a reality. The college will open up new avenues for many people who did not have such opportunities in the past. It will forge productive alliances with industry and the community in ensuring that education becomes a lifelong learning experience for an increasing number of people.</P>
    <P>However, I would like more of the footprints of the Minister of State on the Bill in terms of his adult education remit. It appears the legislation is drawn from the word processor of the Department of Education and Science dating back many years and it reflects no new thinking on the part of the Minister of State or others involved in those areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I join the Minister, the Minister of State and Deputy Richard Bruton in wishing the Institute of Technology, Blanchardstown, every success. There should be no doubt that everybody wishes the new institute a successful launch and future. The only issue which divides us is how the vision will be constructed under which the new institute will deliver on its obvious promise and the expectations of the people in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister was cross in his introduction of the Bill, which is short, minimalist and technical. Therefore, whatever contributions we wish to make will probably be made on Committee Stage <Col N="516" /> in terms of adjusting the nuts and bolts of the legislation. However, the Minister said some people had used every opportunity to knock the new institute. I do not know to whom the Minister was referring; I have been the spokesperson for only a short time.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that some people have over the past year sought every opportunity to question this project and seek short-term publicity by misrepresenting or ignoring the level of commitment and dynamism behind the project. He said the bottom line is that they had delivered the funding and support which was missing when Blanchardstown was fast entering mythology as one of those projects which was promised at election time but never appeared. This was perhaps what one might call a post-election flourish informing the Minister's rhetoric. He can be assured that we all wish the new institute well, but some of us have questions about how it will fill the space in education in Blanchardstown, I also agree with Deputy Bruton that, in light of the well meant and thoughtful contributions by the Minister of State on adult, continuing and life long education, this was an opportunity to do more. To illustrate that, when I was Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht we allocated funding for a number of capital projects under the community development incentive scheme to build theatres and multi-purpose arts centres in Longford, Letterkenny, Sligo, Tallaght, Portlaoise, Cork, Limerick, etc. We deliberately allocated funding for Blanchardstown and the theatre cum arts project is an important part of the infrastructure in the area. For that reason &ndash; I say this in a non-partisan and constructive way &ndash; if there is to be a great deal of artistic and creative activity, from both the formal creative and artistic sector and the voluntary sector, it would be useful to have this as another source from which to draw strength for the new institute.</P>
    <P>The Minister listed what the institute would do to provide opportunities, which was welcome, and including its contribution to specialist higher education for leading edge industries in the region, including upgrading specialist skills to higher technical and technological levels; providing continuing education and meeting the needs of mature students; providing in-service courses; retraining and updating of skills in third level education; meeting special needs arising from educational disadvantage or disability and apprentice education and liaison with FÁS. I would also have provided opportunities for linking informal creativity to the educational structure.</P>
    <P>If there is to be a multi-purpose arts centre with a performance space &ndash; not just what we are used to, a formal theatre with a proscenium arch, but also interactive spaces for different formal and informal uses &ndash; it will provide opportunity for dance and movement, the visual arts, aural presentations, etc. These are creative aspects which have informed the best of the audio-visual, <Col N="517" /> information technology and creative design sectors. The new people in computer aided design have strong backgrounds in basic art and architectural training, and there are also people from good informal training backgrounds.</P>
    <P>I have no hesitation in saying the modular approach is worthwhile in constructing informal bridges and links and creating the flexibility through which people who have not gained access through previous methods can do so. I am also in favour of the modular approach for in-service and continuing education. I have doubts about the approach in the mainstream, core education structure because I see a problem with the syllabus. We can debate this matter because it varies from subject to subject and even between different aspects of one subject. Some subjects lend themselves to modular presentation, others involve the cumulative build up of a critical faculty. For theoretical innovation to be possible a different type of training is required.</P>
    <P>Some may ask what this has to do with Blanchardstown IT but that highlights the flaw in much of what is said about institutes of technology in general and Blanchardstown IT in particular. People are inclined to sell these institutes of technology as if something less is good enough for Blanchardstown, whereas I strongly feel the opposite &ndash; something new and exciting, which will combine things in an entirely fresh way, is possible in the new institute. It is, therefore, important to establish this as a fact on Second Stage. It is not that, at the beginning, there was a shortage of skills and a need to upgrade specialist skills, etc., but, unfortunately, that is how it is being presented.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will accept the following constructively. In my brief time as Labour spokesperson on Education, I have found him to be high on energy but short on vision, as can be seen from his contribution. The Department is congratulating itself because this is the lead project of the year which we must finish in two to three years, but so what? We can applaud its administrative ability but we are talking about education.</P>
    <P>How does this institute fit into the educational needs and future of Blanchardstown? I have nothing against it meeting the skills shortage, helping to upgrade skills and prepare for new ones, but it is much more visionary to ask what are the needs of Blanchardstown as an extended group of communities in terms of life long and second chance education, from pre-school through to retired people. Given those needs and human curiosities, let us do all the functional and useful things but let us also locate the institute in the creative educational needs of the region.</P>
    <P>I do not want to use the language of &ldquo;we delivered&rdquo;, for which I have no time &ndash; milk is delivered. What is the meaning of the phrases, &ldquo;we offered&rdquo; and &ldquo;we delivered&rdquo;? We are talking about State moneys and expenditure. For example, I allocated money for the theatre and I am sure it will be delivered by my successor and <Col N="518" /> at least five other Ministers at one stage or another. We fall over each other with that kind of language; it means nothing. For the record, Blanchardstown IT was a Labour project in Government, I am happy it has reached this stage and I congratulate those responsible for the legislation. In fairness to the Minister, he may be referring to the fact that when Blanchardstown was planned 25 years ago an educational facility of this kind was envisaged but it did not happen until now. We all are glad that it is happening.</P>
    <P>I hope there is a vision behind the Government's opportunity on education. Should we get another chance to discuss it, we should ask what it tells us when there are low participation rates in third level education in areas not too distant from third level institutions. What are the nature of the gaps which stand between these areas of huge population expansion and participation in third level education? I was a third level teacher for over 20 years; my previous remarks on this may have upset some people but it is true that much of the third level ethos is not welcoming to people from certain backgrounds.</P>
    <P>The Minister will have to think strongly about what happens during the first year of third level education to people from many different socio-economic backgrounds, who feel a great sense of strangeness and alienation in an institutional setting for which they get little preparation and from which they get little assistance when they experience problems of adaptation. When students passed the hurdle of first year they felt much more secure and part of the system but there was under-provision for the first year. The amount of counselling available in third level is crazy. I believe it is built on a class assumption, which is that students come from well heeled classes that are reproducing themselves and that this is unnecessary. However, it is necessary, though I know there are specific exceptions. There are good libraries which spend perhaps two months showing third level students how to use the library and access information. That is precisely what is needed. Students must be shown how to feel at home in third level institutions.</P>
    <P>If participation rates at third level are improved by this, and they will be, we must not get the new institute labelled at anything less than its full potential. It should also be open to fuller versions into the future as it builds upon the strengths that it will establish in earlier years.</P>
    <P>The business sector is loved by everybody. I respect it as well but perhaps I do not love it as much as those who are moved to ecstasy by mentioning it. That sector is continually telling us of its training needs. I know it has needs that are not in the general public. Irish middle management is one of the most poorly trained in the world. At conferences, it comes out with such a lot of guff that imitates and derives from the latest piece of rubbish published in America, that it would make one weep, given the absence of theoretical rigour in much of the work. The odd brilliant exception quickly moves into higher management or emi<Col N="519" /> grates. Some managers are good but there is a big difference between being lucky at making money and being able to manage well, particularly when it comes to managing human institutions. Leaving that aside, it might be asked if the stakes are being upped all the time in terms of recruitment policies. Put bluntly, the bottom line is that the new institute must provide what is good for all the children of Blanchardstown and for all the adults in Blanchardstown who want to come back to education. It should supply the needs of industry incidentally. I have laboured this point and for that I am sorry.</P>
    <P>I have listened with interest to the competing applications for the location of this institute in Blanchardstown or Finglas. The new institute will contribute to the participation possibilities of all the children in west Dublin and that is good. However, we are moving towards a point at which every child will have to have the opportunity of third level education. There is no longer anything exceptional about seeking third level education. As it becomes the normality of experience, it must become as full and creative as possible.</P>
    <P>Lest it thinks I have shifted my eye off it, apart from the Department of Finance's opposition to many of my projects, including Teilifís na Gaeilge, my memory is of that Department arguing rather strongly against this project. I could be wrong but I do not think I am. I am speaking from memory and not breaching the Supreme Court ruling by referring to conversations I heard on the periphery of Cabinet meetings. There seemed to be great difficulty in getting that Department to agree to this college in west Dublin as it felt there were enough third level colleges there. We can debate that another day.</P>
    <P>If the Minister for Education of the day wants to spend resources on this, the Department of Finance should walk away and get on with its own business, such as trying to get the projected income of the State correct. We will come to a point at some stage at which it will have to back off. For the record, my best memory is that that Department opposed this. If the Minister of State thinks this is an ancient, restrictive matter, my memory also suggests that the present Minister for Finance opposed this. However, that can be clarified later.</P>
    <P>Some of the regional technical colleges that have now become institutes of technology have had the benefit of the same people not just on vocational education committees but on their boards of management for even longer than I was a university teacher. I know some of the same people have been chairpersons for 27 years. There is a great merit in retained wisdom but there is also some merit in occasionally allowing others to replace those who have been in place for quarter of a century. If this is the case, it emphasises the importance that attaches to the Minister giving some indication in the next two to three weeks of the composition of vocational <Col N="520" /> education committees. I accept there will be changes, though I do not want to hear those today but it is very necessary that the Minister indicate to the various local authorities that a new composition is being envisaged so as to create flexibility, if not spaces, for parents, teachers and others on the vocational education committees. Those vocational education committees will nominate people to the boards of third level institutions in turn. It is very difficult to get anyone off a board and some people have clung with dedication to their positions on vocational education committees, which have put them on the boards of regional technical colleges, as they were, and they have in turn been put on selection committees and other bodies. I feel we are confident enough now to be able to dispense with much of this continuity and to open some windows for teachers, parents and those who, in raw innocence, might have energetic innovation to offer rather than the wisdom of a quarter of a century.</P>
    <P>The Minister's reference to 60 acres struck me immediately. It means this is a generous campus in size and would have its own playing fields as well as indicating it would have its own library facilities from the beginning, which many of the regional technical colleges did not have, as well as a restaurant. It should not be the victim of generosity in breadth and planning in terms of what it invites the people of Blanchardstown to do and it should not be the victim of any snobbery either. It is true that when people came to see me in the past they would say &ldquo;but that is the tech.&rdquo;  Much of that mentality has thankfully gone and that is why I feel that rather than limiting ourselves to what is functionally needed by either industry or institutions at the moment, the Blanchardstown Institute of Technology should be broadly and generously conceived to be saying it will be doing new things in terms of recovering those who want to come back into the education system in a way that is not being done anywhere else. I could give an example of what I have in mind at a different level in relation to animation and audio work in the Ballyfermot college. It is not just among the best in Ireland; it is the best in Europe and among the best in the world simply as a result of brilliantly insightful people doing new things in an entirely new way. I hope that is what happens in Blanchardstown.</P>
    <P>All third level institutions depend on the gift, quality and commitment of teaching. It is one of the great sadnesses of my life that countries like Ireland sought to compare themselves in terms of research, publication and promotion models to other countries on the basis that what the other countries were doing had to inherently be the best. I see this as a post-colonial adjustment. No matter what one's profession or job is, and both are work, people recall the dedicated, gifted communicator who was able to listen and to communicate complex material with clarity. That is most important and I hope the Blanchardstown Institute of Technology is staffed by people like that. The Minister said that some of the senior <Col N="521" /> staff have been appointed.  I hope the institute recruits people such as those I have described, that the community responds to it and that it has a generous and broad future. I wish it well.</P>
    <P>Adjustments to the structure and membership of the board of the institute and its relationship with the VEC can be made on Committee Stage. I welcome the fact that the Bill has reached this stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the introduction of this Bill by the Minister. It represents another stage on the way to the successful establishment of the new institute of technology in Blanchardstown. The measure is technical in character, converting the institution which has already been established into an institute of technology within the meaning of the regional technical colleges legislation.</P>
      <P>I was fascinated by Deputy Higgins's outline of his philosophy of education. I detect a change from what I had understood was the general direction of Labour Party philosophy up to the last general election. I was delighted to hear Deputy Higgins extol the virtues of diversity of type in higher education institutions and the idea that such institutions should not be developed according to a rigid plan. I agree with his views regarding the development of a relationship between the new artistic centre in Blanchardstown and the institute of technology. This is a new idea which Deputy Higgins has introduced into today's debate and it presents an avenue which must be explored.</P>
      <P>My single reservation regarding this project has been that in establishing an institute of technology within the meaning of the regional technical colleges legislation, we might impose too rigid a pattern on it. I realise that the educational bureaucrats like to pour the material of new institutions into a definite mould. Given the range of new investment in the Blanchardstown area and its unusual population profile with a concentration of young people, we are presented with an opportunity to establish something new. Whatever legal forms are followed, that is the Minister's underlying intention.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister drew attention to the importance of second chance and adult education in the new institution. The institute will be situated in an area where there have been low participation rates in education and where there is now a great volume of inward investment, so that linkages can be established with the commercial sector for the enrichment of the institute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is my understanding that the last Government made a decision in principle to locate the institute in Blanchardstown rather than Finglas but the task of securing financial approval for the project was left to the current Government. I share Deputy Higgins's view that the Department of Finance expressed reservations about the development of the project, but it is to the Government's credit that it proceeded with it. <Col N="522" /> While it has been recognised by all political interests for a number of years that this was a desirable project, the Minister is to be commended on expediting it. The Minister has brought the project forward so fast that when it was announced last year courses could not be prepared in time for the 1999 CAO handbook. Applications for the courses are being handled by the central applications office and I understand that the four additional courses for next September are already fully subscribed. This is remarkable when one considers that the courses were not even advertised in the CAO handbook. This should put to rest any doubts about the need for this institute.</P>
    <P>The site for the institute is ample and is beside the location of much technological industry and also areas which have experienced some of the worst social problems of recent decades. The location seems to have been chosen during the interregnum between the last Administration and the present one, and it is the right location.</P>
    <P>I wish the institute well and thank the Minister for the work he has done in bringing this project to fruition as quickly as possible. The Minister, the interim board and Mr. Ó Néill who acted as chief executive with the interim board, deserve tremendous praise for the speed and efficiency with which they proceeded with the project.</P>
    <P>The legislation provides for the establishment of a board and for transitional arrangements before the board, within the meaning of the legislation, can be established. I have some reservations about the composition of boards established under the regional technical colleges legislation. The number of members appointed to the boards can make them unwieldy. Smaller boards might provide a more efficient management structure for the regional colleges. That is a small reservation compared to the general welcome which I extend to this measure. I am pleased the Government has allocated the necessary money to ensure that it will proceed as fast as possible.</P>
    <P>The institute will be housed in temporary buildings for the time being. It is felt that, as the institute evolves, it can decide what are the appropriate buildings for its requirements. The original regional technical colleges which were established in the late 1960s were designed in the same format, rather like the old Board of Works or even older Commissioners of Education designs for primary schools. We have moved from that policy. Instead of putting up buildings and making people fit into them, we prefer to motivate people, establish courses in temporary buildings and allow people to decide what surroundings they prefer. This is an appropriate way to develop the physical shape of a third level institute. It is important that the size of the campus is ample. Many of our higher education institutions have not been so. Although in the heart of Dublin city, Trinity College has a variety of playing fields. Many institutions outside major urban centres do not have the same provision. <Col N="523" /> The provision of ample physical space for the Blanchardstown institute is welcome. It is located in an area where land is very valuable. Fingal County Council, the Industrial Development Authority and the Minister for Education and Science worked together on the provision of the site and their co-operation and partnership is to be commended.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 11, inclusive, together and to answer them comprehensively.</P>
      <P>I deeply regret the unfortunate circumstances that have led to Mr. Paddy Duffy's resignation as my special adviser. However, in the absence of the necessary clarity with regard to potential conflicts of interest and given the manner in which politics has to be conducted, it was probably, sadly, unavoidable.</P>
      <P>Mr. Paddy Duffy has been by profession a school teacher. He was a founding principal of the Gaelscoil na Cille school in Ashbourne, County Meath. He was always very interested in cultural matters, including the Irish language, music and sport, and expressed a strong social concern.</P>
      <P>After giving me voluntary assistance over many years, Mr. Duffy first came to work with me in the Department of Finance as press officer and also to assist with the preparation of speeches and to meet delegations on my behalf, particularly in the areas of interest I indicated earlier. He subsequently became my <i>chef de cabinet</i> during my period in Opposition, and joined me as special adviser in the Department of the Taoiseach, where his principal role was writing and co-ordinating speeches. Along with other senior members of the Department, he also helped to meet people on my behalf and to sift, evaluate and process, as necessary, with the help of Departments and agencies, some of the large number of projects, representations and proposals that are brought to every Taoiseach's attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like many people who knew him, I appreciate the service, loyalty, dedication and commitment that Mr. Duffy gave on many occasions not just to me and my party but also in the public interest. At the time of his appointment to the Department of the Taoiseach in June 1997, Mr. Paddy Duffy was on secondment from his teaching post. He subsequently applied for and was given a one year career break with effect from 1 September 1998. The need to resolve this and related matters, including superannuation and remuneration issues, was a reason a formal contract was still under consideration at the time of his resignation, although the standard terms of employment are clear and in some individual instances in the past <Col N="525" /> have been put on the Dáil record. The question of severance and eligibility for it will require further study, so I am not in a position to make any statement about such arrangements at this point.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year Mr. Duffy informed me of his intention to leave the public service and go into the private sector. He did not mention any specific companies or employers. I now gather from his recent statements that he had originally intended leaving at the end of last year but that he then subsequently decided to stay on for a further year. As far as I know, the first time his intentions appeared in print were in <i>Phoenix</i> magazine of 26 February 1999, and I believe that he first spoke to me shortly before that. I understand from further inquiries that his interest in moving into consultancy had been known in some of those circles for some time. I gather Mr. Paul Dillon first raised with Mr. Paddy Duffy the question of coming to work with his company at a lunch on 5 June 1998 in La Stampa.</P>
    <P>I would now like to set out the facts regarding my contact with Cabletel, Mr. Duffy's involvement in Dillon's and the sequence of events, so far as I have been able to establish them. I met with representatives of NTL, which is the parent company of Cabletel, on 21 May 1998 in Government Buildings. NTL was represented by Mr. George Blumenthal, chairman of NTL, Mr. Owen Lamont, managing director of NTL Ireland and Mr. Paul Dillon, managing director, Dillon Consultants. A senior official from my Department and my special adviser, Mr. Paddy Duffy, were also present. I stress that the meeting was essentially with NTL. The representative of Dillon Communications was there as a facilitator.</P>
    <P>I had met Mr. Lamont previously, in Belfast on 23 January 1998, when I addressed the Northern Ireland chamber of commerce, of which Mr. Lamont was vice-chairman at the time. On that occasion, Mr. Lamont, who was seated beside me, briefly informed me of his company's plans to establish a presence in Ireland. Subsequently, he wrote to me on 15 April 1998 regarding the issue of rebroadcasting RTE channels into Northern Ireland, which my office referred to the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands. In that letter he also inquired about arrangements for the sale of Cablelink, which my office referred to the Minister for Public Enterprise.</P>
    <P>As a follow-on to that brief meeting, I understood that NTL wished to arrange a presentation of its investment and development plans both in Northern Ireland and here. To this end Dillon Consultants, on behalf of NTL, wrote to Mr. Duffy by fax dated 23 April 1998, which was the first contact he had from that company, with a view to arranging such a presentation. Mr. Duffy's name was suggested to Dillon's by a public relations consultant who worked mainly on her own account and who would have had some contact with officials in the Taoiseach's office over the years. She believes that the person she first approached was my appointments secretary and she subsequently spoke to Mr. Duffy who hap<Col N="526" /> pened to be available. Both Mr. Duffy and Mr. Paul Dillon have independently corroborated that they had not previously met. The stated purpose of the meeting, according to the letter, was &ldquo;to bring An Taoiseach up to date with Cabletel's significant development plans in the Republic&rdquo;. Departmental officials were consulted with regard to the request for a meeting. The advice was to the effect that it would be a useful briefing. This advice was given in light of the considerable changes under way in the communications market at the time and in respect of which it was felt that there might be merit in meeting with a company with experience of operating on an international basis, including within the UK, where the liberalisation process was somewhat ahead of the Irish situation.</P>
    <P>It is my policy, as it has been of my predecessors, to meet at their request with those undertaking or contemplating major investments of benefit to the economy, usually on the assumption that they are also already pursuing, or intend to pursue, their plans with the Minister or Ministers or other agencies most directly responsible. In addition, like my predecessor, I have taken a strong personal interest in ensuring that Ireland is well prepared for the information society. The importance of a telecommunications infrastructure has been stressed in reports submitted to me by the Information Society Commission in February 1998 and the National Competitiveness Council in March 1998, and on numerous occasions since by other expert groups.</P>
    <P>I have arranged for a report of the meeting, together with copies of other relevant documents, to be laid before the House. This report indicates that it was a short but informative meeting, with, as anticipated, a helpful overview of trends in the sector on a global basis being provided by the company's chairman who also outlined their plans for developing activities here, especially through the completion of a fibre optic ring.</P>
    <P>At the time of the meeting the Government's decision that Cablelink be sold was already a matter of public record, although none of the arrangements regarding the sale had been settled. NTL indicated during the meeting that it would consider bidding for Cablelink when the sale process got under way. Deputies will be aware that, in view of the rigorous EU procurement rules which must be respected in these matters, it was some months later before the advisers handling the sale were even appointed, and some further time again before the tendering process was announced. As the House will be aware, an exceptionally good price has eventually been obtained for the sale of Cablelink.</P>
    <P>Turning to the matter of subsequent correspondence, some months later, in September 1998, NTL invited me to announce the completion of its fibre optic ring in October 1998, which involved the establishment of the first fibre optic links between Ireland and Britain. For the record, this invitation was also made by Dillon Consultants and was sent, in the first instance, to my <Col N="527" /> special adviser. I was happy to accept the invitation and I attended the function which took place at the Portmarnock Hotel on Wednesday, 14 October 1998. The speech prepared for that occasion, which Mr. Duffy would have had some role in drafting, is one of the documents I have laid before the House.</P>
    <P>A number of matters arise in relation to the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995. These matters, by virtue of the Act, are solely the responsibility of the Public Offices Commission. While recognising the primacy of the commission in these matters, as a matter of courtesy to the House, I should deal briefly with them.</P>

From the point of view of cross-examining the Taoiseach on the matter, which people will expect us to do, we are at a decided disadvantage.

What I am trying to do today is to answer these questions comprehensively. I have not had an opportunity of answering any of the questions, which have been listed fairly. I have no objection to these questions being raised in the media or to those that have been carried in the newspapers over the past two weeks. I thought the right place to answer those questions was in this House. I could have answered them at a party meeting, but I thought I should answer them here.</P>

    <P>Under the Act there is a requirement for senior special advisers, whose remuneration exceeds the <Col N="530" /> prescribed amount, to make a statement of interests pursuant to the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995. All such statements were made at the required time and forwarded to the Public Offices Commission at that time also.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of great regret to me that copies of the statements of the two years ended January 1998 and January 1999 were not laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas until last week. This was due to an administrative oversight, and I have taken steps to ensure this does not happen again.</P>
    <P>Other documents required by the ethics Act to be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas include, in the case of senior advisers whose remuneration exceeds the prescribed amount, statements of their qualifications relevant to their functions as special advisers; and in the case of all special advisers, copies of their contracts and statements as to whether they are related to the office holder. Regrettably, the laying of those documents before the Houses of the Oireachtas was also the subject of an administrative oversight.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The documents have now been laid as required and the new administrative arrangements, which I have instituted, will ensure that this oversight does not occur again. Some information about their employment has been supplied in answer to parliamentary questions, and the background, career and qualifications of my senior advisers would be reasonably well known to many in the media and to most Members of the House.</P>
      <P>In relation to contracts, there was an added difficulty that in a number of cases, issues had arisen, which were the subject of clarification and negotiation, and this had the effect of delaying completion of the contracts in those instances, a not unprecedented situation under other Governments. A small number have yet to be completed, chiefly in relation to advisers appointed very recently. I would be very concerned, however, by any implication that, if a contract had not been signed, people would not feel themselves bound by the conditions laid down in it. I think one of the lessons of this episode is that contracts need to be signed at the commencement of employment, and if there are questions that cannot be immediately decided or settled, such as pensions entitlements, then this can be dealt with by way of supplementary contract.</P>

      <P>However, even in those circumstances, the provisions of the proposed contract would have been made known to him, including requirements inserted on foot of the provisions of the ethics Act. The standard contract includes the clause, &ldquo;The position will be wholetime, and you may not engage in private practice or be connected with any outside business which would interfere with the performance of official duties&rdquo;. On any reasonable interpretation, this would preclude becoming involved, even in a non-executive capacity, in any public affairs consultancy business. Subsection 7 of Schedule 2 of the Ethics in Public Office Act is quite explicit in defining as a registrable interest &ldquo;a remunerated position held by the person concerned as a political or public affairs lobbyist, consultant or adviser during the appropriate period aforesaid&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A further fact of which I was not aware at the time was that on 9 December 1998, Paddy Duffy was made a director of Dillon Consultants with effect from that date, on the basis that he would take up employment early in the New Year. Part of the deal was that he would take up a 5 per cent share in the company. Papers with his signature were subsequently lodged in the Companies Office on 12 March 1999. I do not have any documentary evidence showing that he ceased to be a director, nor does Paul Dillon recall any specific request to take him off the list of directors. However, I am informed that after about a week of reflection and consideration, during which he apparently decided to stay on in my Department <Col N="534" /> for another year, he informed Paul Dillon orally that he did not wish to take up the job for another year and returned the shares. I understand those transactions will be shown in the company's accounts, to be filed at the end of this year.</P>
    <P>He apparently believed that returning the shares would <i>ipso facto</i> remove him from any directorship, and furthermore that his signature, while a sign of serious intent to consider the position, was not a definitive or operational acceptance but subject to a final decision. There was, of course, no question of his accepting any remuneration. Mr. Dillon has confirmed to my office that Mr. Duffy was very much in two minds as to what he was going to do at this time. Mr. Duffy did accept in his resignation statement that he should have resigned before accepting, however provisionally, an outside directorship of this character. Without knowing about the website and without checking the Companies Office, Mr. Duffy assumed that the matter had been sorted out and that he was not a director. However, in his resignation statement Mr. Duffy stated that &ldquo;through a series of misunderstandings on my own part, I was still registered as a non-executive director&rdquo; and he accepts that he should have double-checked the register before completing his statement of interests.</P>
    <P>Paddy Duffy signed his statement of interest on 27 January 1999 under the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995. He did not declare a directorship in Dillon's, which he clearly did not believe he possessed. This declaration was sent to the Public Offices Commission on 2 March 1999 within the deadline required by the legislation. A copy was submitted to my office at the same time. In the last week, a revised submission or correction of the record has been made by Mr. Duffy in the light of what has emerged, and the only outside interest referred to is Dillon's.</P>
    <P>In February 1999, a meeting apparently took place in London between Dillon Associates and APCO, a very large international public affairs consultancy. Mr. Duffy attended this meeting, which he claims was not a board meeting in any sense, solely to discuss the role that he would play in Dillon's in partnership with APCO. APCO was represented, as reported in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 4 June 1999, by Bradley Staples, European chairman, and its US head, Margery Kraus. APCO was seeking, in partnership with Dillon's, to establish a base in Ireland and Mr. Duffy was there to discuss the possible shape of the company and what part he would play in it, when he joined, on the termination of his employment as a special adviser. Clearly, Mr. Duffy was seen as a future asset, perhaps a key asset, to the proposed company. I have been informed that there was no discussion on NTL, even though it was a client of both companies, but that, for example, the future prospects of the island under the Good Friday Agreement was discussed. Mr. Duffy paid his own travel and accommodation expenses.</P>
    <P>On 12 March 1999, form B10, lodged in the Companies Office stated that Paddy Duffy was a <Col N="535" /> director of Dillon Consultants from 9 December 1998. On 15 March 1999, Dillon Associates' website was posted on the web. The site contained a fulsome reference to Mr. Paddy Duffy, special adviser to the Taoiseach, as acting for Dillon's. My understanding, based on information from Dillon's, is that this was an experimental website, equivalent to a promotional brochure, advertising the experience available to them and some of their clients&mdash;</P>

      <P>I would like to make the following comment. In general, public affairs companies that wish to have dealings with the State should take steps to acquaint themselves with the rules and ethical requirements governing the behaviour of politicians, civil servants and advisers. If Dillon's had done so, it would have realised that it was totally inappropriate to either appoint or list&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not run Dillon's nor am I responsible for Mr. Duffy. On 28 April 1999, as set out in a note of 8 June 1999 from the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, she was telephoned by Deputy Dukes and she met him in her office that morning. Deputy Dukes told the Minister that he had been given information that Mr. Paddy Duffy was on the board of Dillon Consultants. The Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, undertook to get back to Deputy Dukes on the matter. She then informed the Secretary General of her Department and myself of her conversation with Deputy Dukes. Later in the day, I told the Minister that I had spoken with Paddy Duffy, who told me he had no connection with Dillon's or NTL. He did tell me he knew Paul Dillon and was considering involvement with Dillon Consultants Limited after leaving his position as a special adviser. That evening, Mr. Duffy telephoned the Minister and told her personally and trenchantly that he had no connection with Dillon's or NTL but that at the end of 1999 he was going to go into public relations, without mentioning any specific company. However, he told me and the Minister that he had made no final decisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="536" /> On 29 April 1999 the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, telephoned Deputy Dukes in Bonn and told him that Mr. Duffy had denied any involvement in Dillon's or NTL. Mr. Duffy clearly stated what he believed to be factually correct, but he has acknowledged that he should have put the full facts to me and to the Minister for Public Enterprise.</P>
    <P>When the story subsequently broke in <i>The Irish Times</i>, it created, <i>prima facie</i>, the impression that Mr. Duffy had not been open about previous contacts, future plans and contractual arrangements and that he had placed the Minister in a false and invidious position. That was the most serious aspect of the case. The problem stemmed from the misunderstanding between Mr. Duffy and Dillon's with regard to his status and none of us was in possession of the full picture, in other words, what had happened the previous December.</P>
    <P>On 26 May 1999, Cablelink was sold to NTL for £535 million. On 4 June 1999, <i>The Irish Times</i> revealed a story entitled &ldquo;Ahern aide linked to Cablelink sale advisers&rdquo;. Apropos of that, I emphasise that Dillon's were in no sense financial advisers to the sale, being involved in only a public relations role, not for Cablelink or the sellers, but for one of the bidders. <i>The Irish Times</i> front page article stated that Mr. Duffy joined the board of Dillon Consultants in recent months. It went on state that a B10 form had been lodged in the Companies Office on 12 March and that Mr. Duffy had become a director in the previous December. Mr. Duffy's signature was on the form. It was also stated that Mr. Duffy had attended a meeting between Dillon's and APCO, a major international firm with which Dillon's was forming a strategic alliance, in London in February. Dillon's and APCO had a client in common, NTL. The Dillon-APCO deal was done on 10 May. Mr. Duffy said this meeting was about his future and that he was not there as a representative of Dillon's.</P>
    <P>On 4 June 1999, Mr. Duffy resigned. On 11 June 1999, the <i>Irish Independent</i> lead article stated that Mr. Duffy was also a director of the firm of consultants, Dillon's, that lobbied the Government's millennium committee on behalf of the Gaiety Theatre, which is seeking a £5 million grant. Mr. Duffy was a member of the 15 member millennium committee and part of a smaller group that attended a presentation by the Gaiety, organised by Dillon's. I am informed by Dillon's that it had no involvement in, or knowledge of, any earlier proposal for the State to purchase the Gaiety Theatre. That idea dates back to the autumn of 1997, long before there was any involvement with Dillon's, and relates to the possible use of the Gaiety Theatre as an opera house, and its acquisition by the State for that purpose.</P>
    <P>It was one of dozens of ideas relating to cultural institutions or national monuments, real or potential, being put forward as part of an initial trawl. The idea did not come from the Gaiety or <Col N="537" /> anyone representing it, and the focus was the provision of an opera house.</P>
    <P>Mr. Duffy had no role in preparing the Gaiety's presentation with Dillon's, and he was lobbied like other members of the committee, although he was in a different position to them. The application came to Mr. Duffy on 4 December from the executive director of the Gaiety theatre, Mr. John Costigan. A spokesperson for the Millennium Committee is quoted as saying that he &ldquo;never said that he was a director&rdquo; of Dillon's. For most of the period when it was under consideration, Mr. Duffy did not believe that he was a director of Dillon's. The spokesperson also said that, although some funding had been agreed in principle, many issues remained to be teased out. On the day the article appeared, Mr. Duffy issued a strong statement asserting that his involvement with regard to the proposal was proper and above board, and that the refurbishment of the Gaiety Theatre was a worthy cause.</P>
    <P>While accepting that, there is a potential for conflict of interest where a person is adjudicating on, and maybe backing, a proposal on its own merits but which is, nonetheless, being promoted by a firm with which he expects to have a future contractual relationship. It illustrates the unsatisfactory nature of a long transition period between one role and another, where there is a danger of some overlap or conflict of interest. However, I would not wish to see the Gaiety's application prejudiced, one way or the other, because of what has occurred. I am attaching to my reply to the sequence of events with regard to the consideration of this project, which was not considered suitable in its original form.</P>
    <P>The only other millennium project being promoted by Dillon's is an application on behalf of the &ldquo;Hole in the Wall Gang&rdquo; at Barretstown Castle, which is a very worthy social cause.</P>
    <P>On Monday my office was also informed by Mr. Duffy that he and his wife are directors of a company called The Right Word Company Ltd, which is concerned with the sale and promotion of musical and written compositions. For the sake of completeness, I mention that it is my understanding that Mr. Paddy Duffy is also director of the recently formed Anna Livia Opera Festival, the Seán O Riada Trust. He apparently took legal advice in 1996 and was informed that, since there was no question of his directorship of the Right Word Company Limited influencing his function in employment, on that basis he did not need to declare it. Under the Ethics in Public Office Act, which was passed by both Houses on 14 July 1995, section 19(3) requires a special adviser to declare interests which could materially influence the person in the performance of his functions, by reason that the performance could so affect those interests as to confer or withhold a substantial benefit on that person or his or her spouse or child. While schedule 2 defines all directorships as registrable interests, I am advised that, on a strict construction of the Act, if it can be demonstrated that the interest in question could not <Col N="538" /> materially influence the performance of functions, in the sense just referred to, then it is not required to be declared under section 19(3). That is the strict legal position, but, without going into its merits or otherwise in this particular instance, I think it is advisable to err on the side of caution and declare significant outside involvements</P>
    <P>I will refer to some of the other more general issues raised by this affair, at a time when our ethics legislation is still developing. It is important that advice given to Government, whether from the Civil Service or from special advisers or any agency of the State, should be financially disinterested, or where there is any financial interest of even indirect relevance that it be clear and transparent, so that there is no undue or improper influence.</P>
    <P>The problem that arose in this instance was that a special adviser was arguably in the process of forming a relationship with a private company that would be important for his future career after leaving the public service. That company was, most probably due to a serious misunderstanding, already advertising the special adviser on the Internet as an asset. It underlines the dangers of forming even a tentative relationship with a commercial company dealing with the State prior to leaving the public service.</P>
    <P>There has been a growth, not only of political lobbying and consultancy but an encouragement in some parts of the public sector, to people to continue working on a self-employed contract basis. The whole area requires deeper reflection and debate, including whether some gap needs to be instituted between public and private employment where special knowledge or a regulatory position would give an inside track. These are difficult problems that require much more discussion in the public service by the Dáil and in the media. We have to remember that we are a small country and it may not always be easy or practicable here to construct Chinese walls. Given that many of us believe that more contact and cross-fertilisation between the public and private sectors may be more to the public advantage than its disadvantage, we should not automatically assume that we know the right answers before studying the situation more deeply.</P>
    <P>I regret that I have lost a valued colleague. I wish Mr. Duffy and his family well. Recognising the potential for damaging controversy, he acted very promptly in offering his resignation, which I reluctantly accepted. There have undoubtedly been unfortunate mistakes, misunderstandings and errors of judgment. However, there are also dangers in taking decisions or forming judgments too quickly on the basis of bad appearances, which may have devastating consequences for individuals who have sought at all times, by their own lights, to act with proper honour and integrity. From the point of view of public ethics, that legislation is still in its infancy. We can all learn from the experience, and I believe that there may be cautionary lessons which have an application that go far beyond the individual involved.</P>

My job is to ensure, first, the forms are filled out, which was done; and, second, that the forms are lodged with the Public Offices Commission, which was done. I trust my staff to deal with matters which subsequently arise, as happened in this case. The third procedural aspect is that these matters should have been put by my office, for which I am responsible, into the Oireachtas Library, which was not done. The administrative staff thought that as it was in the Public Offices Commission they did not have to do that. I am responsible for that. I did not do that. I have now made the necessary arrangements for that to be done. It has been done for <Col N="541" /> the past two years and it will be done in future, due to the changes I have made.</P>

Who was responsible for the administrative error that led to these declarations not being laid before the Dáil by him under his signature until 10 June, although most of them were signed back in January?

      <P>In terms of judgment, Mr. Paddy Duffy is a very good official who has worked very hard and far beyond the call of duty for this country, as a teacher and as an official with me. He is a teacher and not a business person and in this case he made a bad mistake in thinking that by giving back the shares and saying he did not want the job his name would be struck off B Form 10.

If the Taoiseach accepts that, why does he not ask his advisers straight out if they have any private interest or involvement in private companies?

      <P>In view of the fact that the Government is shamefully flogging off public companies which are worth billions of pounds, does the Taoiseach accept that there is potential for major conflicts of interest with public servants advising the State on the privatisation, the sale and terms of sale and then, when the privatisation is carried through, perhaps moving to become part of the privatised company or a company which has benefited from the privatisation? Does the Taoiseach accept there should be legislation to prevent people moving from important public service positions into companies with which they have dealt while in the public service?

      <P>On the involvement of Mr. Duffy in the Millennium Committee, is it a fact that initially Mr. Duffy denied that he had made representations on behalf of the Gaiety Theatre, for which Dillon's were acting, for the State to purchase and refurbish it? In the <i>Sunday Independent</i> it was revealed that Mr. Duffy had sent a <Col N="546" /> memo to the Millennium Committee in support of the State purchasing the Gaiety.

      <P>Mr. Duffy was telling the truth on Friday. We are dealing with two separate issues, one of which goes back to 1997 and relates to cultural ideas. One of those ideas was that the Gaiety should be bought by the State and turned into an opera house. Nothing happened with that, it was purely an idea.

He was not aware his name was posted on the website. I believe he was telling the truth. He would not have said that he was a non-executive director if he did not believe he was so. I have known him for 25 years. He is not a person who deliberately tells mistruths but he did make a fundamental mistake in believing that when he had filled up form B 10 his name would somehow get off it without him doing something about it. He did think that. He is a school teacher not a business person. That was an error and he said that in his own statement. He had no involvement with other matters which are attributed to him. He has paid the price. He is a person who does his business. He has been the subject of more front page articles than most Members in the past month. He has paid a heavy price. In my judgment of him, I say to Deputy Rabbitte who knows him quite well, he has been a good friend, a good political friend of mine, has a strong social conscience and is very strong on the Irish language and cultural matters.

Dillon, in the case of the contact with Mr. Duffy, was a press person normally associated with his own agency and was not even a Dillon's person. Nobody from NTL was involved in any of the matters in which Mr. Duffy was involved. On the question of what Mr. Duffy was doing on the cultural aspects, he had a particular expertise which is well recognised outside the House. They were looking at useful proposals and he put forward one in connection with opera. It was not a Government memorandum as such. What was the Deputy's last question?</P>

      <Quest>the steps, if any, he will take to ensure that all providers of commercial accommodation in the tourism area are licensed.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have previously said in the House, there is already in place an extensive system of registration and listing of guest accommodation in accordance with standards set by Bord Fáilte. One of the board's functions under the Tourist Traffic Acts, 1939 to 1998, is the registration of certain types of tourism accommodation such as hotels, guesthouses, holiday and youth hostels, holiday cottages, holiday apartments, holiday camps and caravan and camping parks. The use of these titles is protected by the Tourist Traffic Acts.</P>
      <P>Following the review of Bord Fáilte by consultants Arthur D. Little Limited in 1994, the inspection activities associated with the registration functions were contracted to a third party, Tourism Quality Services Limited. In addition, the Tourist Traffic Act, 1957, enables Bord Fáilte to publish, or cause to be published, lists of other forms of tourism accommodation premises, such as B&amp;Bs, which are not registered titles under the Acts. The system by which B&amp;B accommodation is listed is a voluntary one and operators who do not wish to be listed by Bord Fáilte are not prohibited from carrying on their business. This listing function was also outsourced to industry associations formally recognised by Bord Fáilte as self-regulatory bodies, on the basis that they apply Bord Fáilte agreed standards.</P>
      <P>The issue of compulsory licensing of all tourism accommodation has been examined by successive administrations over the years and they have all reached the same conclusion that any effective compulsory system would require a significant diversion of resources currently devoted to the development and marketing of tourism towards administration and policing. This would be especially burdensome because many accommodation providers only operate for short periods of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent years there has been a substantial increase in the volume and range of tourism accommodation, which has enhanced the choice available to tourists and allows market forces to weed out accommodation which is not of a sufficiently high standard to meet tourism requirement. In light of developments in the supply of accommodation, I share the view of my predecessors that the introduction of a compulsory licensing system would be an inappropriate use of resources. There is no evidence to support the view that such a system would have any appreci<Col N="552" /> able impact on accommodation standards over and above that brought about by market forces.</P>
    <P>In this context, it should be noted that all providers of accommodation for tourists are obliged, whether registered, listed or unlisted, to comply with official requirements in areas such as taxation, planning, fire and safety and hygiene. Meanwhile, Bord Fáilte and the recognised listing bodies will continue to encourage all operators to seek listing status by highlighting, in particular, the benefits to be gained, including access to official marketing through Bord Fáilte, the Gulliver reservations service and the tourism office network. As part of this process I launched an initiative earlier this year by Bord Fáilte to help the small accommodation provider. The initiative involves a fundamental review of how the various groups in this category are branded and marketed overseas.</P>
    <P>Progress has already been achieved in this process with the appointment of a steering committee to oversee the project and a marketing co-ordinator, who will undertake markets research and then develop and implement a marketing plan. I am confident that this initiative will considerably expand the range of assistance and advice offered to the sector, thereby making listing a more attractive proposition. Resources totalling £300,000 have been set aside for Bord Fáilte to support this initiative in 1999.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that approximately 10,000 premises, providing an estimated 30,000 tourism bedrooms, operate outside the standards laid down by Bord Fáilte? Is he satisfied that the standards of quality in terms of the environment, health and safety are being implemented in these outlets? Has he any concerns regarding controls of this area of activity?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the figure mentioned by the Deputy. However, I am not concerned about standards. There has been an accommodation explosion in recent years because of the success of the tourism industry. For example, 117 hotels have been built.</P>
      <P>The standards in these bed and breakfasts are excellent. People do not tend to return to areas with which they are dissatisfied. Market forces are, therefore, dictating standards. It is estimated that it takes only one dissatisfied customer to undo the good work of 20 satisfied customers and 90 per cent of dissatisfied customers will not return.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Mr. Flood)</NameTxt>
      <P>ADM supported area based partnerships have in recent years been developing a new and innovative area based response to the needs of the disadvantaged, both urban and rural. The European Council recently agreed a funding package of community support for the 2000-6 period. While the outcome for Ireland was good, given the extreme difficulty of the negotiations, the level of EU Structural Funds available over that period will be approximately half that available to Ireland under the current Community Support Framework.</P>
      <P>Work has already commenced on agreeing priorities for EU co-funding under the next National Development Plan, NDP, and on clarifying the Commission's new procedures for the next round of Structural Funds. There is also a separate national consultation process to be undergone, inclusive of the social partners. Until such time as this overall process is completed, it is difficult to give any indication of likely levels of EU financial commitments and programme support.</P>
      <P>It is natural that there will be a degree of uncertainty pending the completion of the National Development Plan and the position to be taken by the European Commission as to its funding commitments to certain elements of the plan. The Government is, however, fully committed to the fundamentally important task of tackling social exclusion in deprived areas, and of ensuring that the overall objectives of current programmes remain a priority.</P>
      <P>Whereas I cannot pre-empt the National Development Plan, my Department has made a comprehensive case for local development funding in the context of the drafting of the plan. The submission recognises the fundamental role of area-based strategies in tackling disadvantage.</P>
      <P>The report of the task force on the integration of the local government and local development systems also envisages the continuation of area based local development structures within a more sustainable framework. The future will require the consideration and implementation of a number of recommendations in the task force report and those are, by now, well known to the groups concerned. Issues arising from previous performance, changes in deprivation rankings and the need to ensure that the needs of the real blackspot areas are being addressed are also issues which require consideration when planning for the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am fully aware of the concerns of the area partnerships and ADM-supported community groups. In May, I had formal meetings with two groups from PLANET &ndash; one representing rural partnerships and one representing the chairs of partnerships &ndash; to discuss their concerns. My Department has also met with representatives of <Col N="554" /> the ADM community groups to discuss post 1999 issues.</P>
    <P>Funding for local development initiatives will depend on the financial envelopes available post 1999 under the new National Development Plan. I hope we can achieve clarity on these as soon as possible. Meanwhile the deadline for making commitments under the current Operational Programme for Local Urban and Rural Development is the end of 1999 with the spend continuing until the end of 2001 to ensure the successful completion of the current programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. B. Moynihan-Cronin</NameTxt>
      <P>Why did the Minister of State not keep to the commitment he made on 17 May to officials from PLANET that, regarding their discussions and negotiations, he would return to them prior to their meeting on 10 and 11 June? Is he also aware that the contracts of more than 700 staff expire in December? This is the last opportunity to raise this issue before the summer recess. Given that the House will not reconvene until October, a commitment will have to be made. If 700 jobs were lost in a factory there would be calls for the establishment of a task force.</P>
      <P>This is serious. I ask the Minister to give a commitment that internal funding will be made available to the partnerships to allow them continue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>I have met the two groups from PLANET involved, one representing rural partnerships and the other to which I have referred. I have made it clear that the Government strongly supports and recognises the commitment of the partnership process and the community groups under ADM as being a very successful way of tackling disadvantage.</P>
      <P>I have undertaken to consider carefully the question of the interim funding arrangements to cover the transitional period and we are working strenuously on that issue with a view to reverting through ADM to the partnerships to clarify the position. I am also conscious that those working within the partnership structure require clarification as early as possible so that they can make career decisions.</P>
      <P>I accept that this issue needs to be tackled. My Department has made a comprehensive contribution to the process of drafting the new National Development Plan. Local development is central to that issue.</P>
      <P>Recognising the contribution made by Deputy Moynihan-Cronin, I have met the PLANET representatives and have heard the concerns. Both she and Deputy Allen raised this issue the last time we discussed it and I hope to be in a position to refer to them as soon as possible on the question of transitional funding arrangements.</P>

      <P>It is not known at present because it will be tied into the general framework which will be part of the National Development Plan, which will be published shortly. It would not be guaranteed that every partnership and committee support group would continue in its present format because they clearly would have to make their own applications under any new plan to a body, such as ADM, in order to determine whether they would continue as they are currently structured or there would be any departures from that, bearing in mind the progress made by my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, with regard to the integration of local government and local development.</P>

      <P>The swimming pool programme administered by my Department provides capital funding for local authority swimming pools, refurbishment of existing pools and the cost of new pools. Where a project is undertaken by an organisation other than a local authority, the proposal must be considered, in the first instance, by the relevant local authority. Any such proposal will be considered by the Department only if it is supported by the local authority. In considering whether to support an application, the local authority must be satisfied that the proposal is viable, the balance of funding required to complete the project is available and the project, when completed, will have a satisfactory level of access available to the general public.</P>
      <P>Since 1988, a total of £16 million in grant-aid has been allocated under the programme towards the cost of refurbishment of 25 pools and the construction of three new local authority pools. The budget for 1999 is £3 million, which is already committed to the refurbishment of three pools, the construction of six new pools and outstanding balances on three recently completed projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department has applications on hand for funding for the refurbishment of nine local authority pools and the provision of 13 new pools, seeking a total in grant-aid in the region of £30 million. A number of applications for swimming pool projects have also been received under the 1999 sports capital programme, five of which relate to local authority pools. My Department is currently planning a review of the swimming pool programme, including application processes, funding and technical requirements for grant aid to ensure the most efficient expenditure under the programme in terms of promoting the development of swimming pools and the best value for State investment. I am determined that the development of pools under the programme for the future will be done in a structured and <Col N="556" /> focused way, concentrating on areas of greatest need and based on clearly established priorities.</P>

      <P>The Minister will be aware that he accepted a Private Members' motion tabled by Fine Gael two months ago which called on the Government to set up a capital programme for the refurbishment of swimming pools. He stated in his reply that he has received applications for approximately £30 million in grant-aid for the refurbishment and provision of new pools. What progress has been made on obtaining funding from the Department of Finance towards implementing the decision of this House, which was accepted by the Minister?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Faced with the demand for £30 million in grant-aid for the refurbishment and provision of new pools, including 25 metre pools throughout the country, how does the Minister reconcile that with the demand for a 50 metre pool and its cost implications? How will he square both demands in his capital programme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already dealt with the 50 metre pool. As the Deputy will be aware there were three tenders for it. That number was reduced to two because a High Court action was taken recently by the third interested party. The court made a decision this morning regarding that application and it rejected an application for a judicial review by the third party. I am now reduced to two tenders for the 50 metre pool, pending an appeal by the third party for which it has 21 days. I hope that I will be able to proceed with the 50 metre pool process shortly.</P>
      <P>The Government made available the necessary funding for the 50 metre pool &ndash; £6 million plus £250,000 annually to cover running costs. Swimming pools are a very important part of the recreational aspect of swimming. Thousands of children of all ages participate in swimming and there are 55 local authority pools nationwide, all of which require upgrading but that involves a separate budget. For the first time, I am looking into the condition of those pools and, I hope, with the aid of my colleague, the Minister for Finance, a new programme will be put in place. These are two separate issues. A 50 metre pool is required for our elite athletes but I also agree with the Deputy that a huge refurbishment programme is required for local authority pools.</P>

      <P>CERT is the body with specific responsibility for the provision of training to the catering and tourism industry. Training and human resource development are major elements of the Operational Programme for Tourism, 1994-99, under which CERT contributes to the training of 11,000 people per year on average for the industry. CERT continues to provide entry level craft training which is augmented by a number of programmes targeted at specific groups, such as the long-term unemployed, early school leavers and women wishing to return to the workforce.</P>
      <P>In addition, it operates a number of management training programmes and other courses at advanced and supervisory levels. This training is provided on a regional basis mostly in the ten institutes of technology as well as CERT's own training schools in Cork, Killarney, Limerick, Rosslare and Killybegs. This regional network provides a countrywide supply of programmes and courses which are skills based.</P>
      <P>A special pilot initiative, designed to bring training right to the heart of socially deprived areas, is in operation in Clondalkin and Ballymun and is aimed primarily at long-term unemployed people and those wishing to return to the workforce. The communities in these areas have already enthusiastically embraced the training programmes being offered through this initiative, under which 230 people are expected to be trained.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, with the recent reports of staff and skills shortages in the industry, both the tourism industry representative bodies and CERT continue to work individually and in partnership to promote careers in tourism in a very competitive environment. CERT launched the first National Tourism Careers Roadshow as part of its recruitment drive in November 1998. The roadshow toured nationwide and was supported by a major media and advertising campaign. It featured careers days in 35 prime venues and was backed by similar events in CERT's own centres which together attracted more than 10,000 student visitors. A database of more than 8,000 people seeking further contact and summer jobs in the industry has been compiled.</P>
      <P>A &ldquo;Careers in Tourism Magazine&rdquo;, sponsored by CERT, the Irish Hotels Federation and the Restaurants Association of Ireland, was produced and given to every student who attended any of the career promotion events. A 16 page careers supplement was also produced in a national newspaper and 5,000 copies of the supplement were distributed at career events throughout 1998. Workshops for career guidance counsellors took place in Kilkenny, Carlow and Kerry; 60 school exhibitions were also attended by CERT; and 283 career talks were given to 10,000 students. These talks were targeted at those schools that did not attend the careers roadshows.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="558" /> A tourism recruitment promotion with 2FM radio took place in January and February this year involving participation in street entertainment and radio slots over a three week period. The telephone careers information line on freephone 1-800 produced more than 3,000 inquiries about tourism careers. Careers information was circulated to more than 1,400 schools, FÁS offices, libraries and youth organisations. Information packs were made available to all industry personnel giving career talks. These packs included career brochures and course information, a careers video and overhead slides.</P>
    <P>On many occasions since taking up office, I have urged the industry to become more proactive in addressing recruitment difficulties and labour shortages and to take appropriate steps to counter the perceived poor image of tourism as a career opportunity. In this context I particularly welcome the Irish Hotels Federation's &ldquo;Quality Employer Programme&rdquo;, which is based on best practice in all aspects of employment including recruitment, induction training, ongoing performance assessment, career progression and conditions of pay and employment.</P>
    <P>I understand that in the two years since the programme was introduced, approximately 60 per cent of members of the federation have applied for accreditation and 220 establishments have been accredited so far. The Restaurants Association of Ireland's &ldquo;Restaurant and Customer Charter&rdquo; is another good example of the type of initiative needed.</P>
    <P>As the labour market is expected to tighten, with unemployment levels declining further over the coming years, greater emphasis may well have to be placed on other potential sources of labour for the tourism sector, including married women returning to work, retired people, those wishing to work part-time and non-national labour. The key challenge facing the industry and CERT is how to put in place appropriate policies, programmes and arrangements to attract, motivate and retain a skilled labour force in the face of declining labour availability and increasing competition from other sectors.</P>
    <P>For the industry this will also involve considering internal training requirements and measures which could improve labour productivity. In the context of preparations for the new National Development Plan, my Department is working closely with CERT to identify the most appropriate focus  &ndash; including skills needs and access to training &ndash; for its activities in the future and specific measures which should be undertaken by it to help address the training requirements of the industry, in an increasingly competitive labour market.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that while unprecedented growth is being enjoyed in the tourism sector currently, one of the major obstacles to the continuation of that growth is the shortage of people to take up jobs that are available? Does he further agree that CERT has so <Col N="559" /> far failed to meet the challenge of sustaining the development in tourism which has been experienced in recent times? Does the Minister have proposals to attract more unemployed people into the tourism industry? For example, has he considered in conjunction with the Department of Finance a home makers tax free allowance, which would encourage women working in the home to enter the workforce, particularly in the tourism sector?</P>

      <P>I agree with the Deputy that there is a major labour shortage in the tourism sector. Within the next ten years the number of young people aged between 13 and 18 years will have decreased by approximately 10 per cent and that must be worrying for the industry. Unquestionably, there is a problem, but the industry must become more involved. CERT is finding it more difficult to attract people into the industry for three reasons &ndash; competition from other sectors; decreasing labour market; and the perceived unattractive image of the industry. When all that is taken into account the prognosis is not optimistic because the labour force is expected to tighten further in future years with unemployment levels continuing to decline. A greater proportion of non-national labour will have to be used. In 1997 some 50 new hotels were built. There were 37 in 1998 and 30 this year. There has been a 20 per cent increase in that type of accommodation. I agree with the Deputy that there is a labour shortage, but CERT is doing its utmost to attract people into the industry. However, we need a greater input from the private sector.</P>
      <P>This year instead of asking young people in Clondalkin and Ballymun to come to the CERT training centre in the city we brought the training out to them. The roadshow visited 35 areas attracting 10,000 students. We have workshops in three counties. There were 60 school exhibitions and 283 career talks were given. I could go on and on about what is being done to attract people into the industry. I could not blame CERT for its efforts.</P>

      <P>In his lengthy reply, the Minister did not answer one of the key questions I put to him. Has he discussed with the Minister or the Department of Finance the concept of a homemaker's <Col N="560" /> tax free allowance which would allow persons who have worked in the home for the past four or five years to come into the workforce? Surely that is a pool of labour which could be attracted into this area. Yesterday a person attempted to make a reservation by telephone in a leading Dublin hotel. Unfortunately she could not get her message across because the receptionist did not understand her although she spoke in English. While we may pride ourselves on being cosmopolitan, surely the Minister agrees that is an unhappy position and is a warning sign that Irish people are not at the coalface of tourism. I am not being racist but am talking about basic communication skills.</P>

      <P>We as a Government are trying to deal with the problems created by our own success. The matter raised by the Deputy is one for the Irish Hotels Federation. I agree there is a labour shortage and we must try to target our young Celtic tiger cubs who have emigrated. It is estimated that there are 20,000 of our young students attending universities in the UK and we must target them. I agree with the Deputy that people in their forties and fifties who have reared their families would be an addition to the workforce in this area. That issue was raised last year by the Irish Hotels Federation with the Minister for Finance. I will continue to pursue it this year. There are a number of people in that age group who would be useful to the tourism industry and the addition would be that they are Irish.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 22 and 23 together.</P>
      <P>The sports capital programme administered by my Department provides national lottery funding towards the provision of sports facilities at national, regional and local levels. It is the primary vehicle for promoting the development of such facilities, and funding allocated under the programme assists sports clubs and voluntary and community groups to construct, refurbish, improve and equip high quality, well designed and sustainable sport and recreational sports facilities throughout the country.</P>
      <P>A comprehensive review of the programme was undertaken by my Department in 1999 and as a result a new programme was developed with revised aims and objectives, assessment criteria and terms and conditions for grant assistance. The deadline for receipt of applications under the new programme was 12 February last. Almost 1,900 applications were received by the closing date and these are being examined at present. Given the large number of applications and the level of work involved in evaluating them, I have not been in a position to make announcements on the 1999 round of grant allocations before now. However, I hope to do so in the near future. A total of 111 applications for funding have been received from a variety of sports clubs and community groups in County Donegal. This represents 6 per cent of the total number of applications received.</P>
      <P>While all applications will be treated on their merits, special priority will be given to proposals in respect of facilities in disadvantaged areas in line with Government policy aimed at increasing participation in sport and recreation in these areas. Other factors such as equity in the spread of funding on a geographical basis and among different sports and community groups will also be taken into account in determining grant allocations. The detailed criteria to be applied in assessing applications are set out in the guidelines for the new programme which issued with the application forms.</P>

      <NameTxt>Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister. I am glad that no decisions have been taken yet with regard to grant applications. As the Minister is aware, each of the 111 applications from County Donegal is seeking a significant amount of money. How much money is available this year? Will the Minister clarify that clear rules govern the distribution of funds, for example, in relation to disadvantaged status? He alluded to the fact that disadvantaged status is a criterion and that geographical spread is also important. Will the Minister clarify if disadvantaged status and the importance of individual applications will override the geographical consideration? Does he agree that certain areas lost out in the past although significant local contributions were raised? Does he agree there is a need for serious remedial action, particularly in peripheral disadvantaged areas? Funds should not be allocated <Col N="564" /> solely in terms of geographical spread to satisfy Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>The amount of money available this year will be approximately £9 million or £10 million. New assessment criteria have been rigidly applied and I understand they can amount to anything up to 120 points. The system will operate on that basis and a number of the applications do not come near the criteria for funding. However, emphasis will be placed on disadvantaged areas and the Deputy may be assured that there will be a fair and genuine geographical spread which will take account of what counties received in the past and disadvantage in specific areas. It will be focused on the criteria which will apply on this occasion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney" hpid="Cecilia Keaveney Cecilia Keaveney">
      <NameTxt>Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister is from County Donegal, will he assure me that he will not feel self-conscious when he is considering the criteria and the applications from Inishowen? He is aware of the great needs and level of disadvantage which exist and the fact that money has not been allocated to the region in recent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that all areas, including Inishowen, will be addressed, but there is much overlapping. It is much easier to undertake a large project which involves a number of communities and towns than set up facilities in every town and village. For example, in some areas there may be six different applications from groups within a ten mile radius. This means there would be six sets of toilets, changing rooms and dressing rooms. All the money is spent on toilets, changing rooms, showers etc. There is duplication and a waste of facilities. I am trying to encourage communities to come together. It is much easier to develop one major facility than six or seven smaller projects which involve much duplication.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>Many people have asked why children fail, but perhaps it is more relevant to ask why Governments have failed so many of our children. Our efforts to tackle educational disadvantage are disjointed and lack coherent vision. We in Ireland are too quick to congratulate ourselves on the excellence of our education system. Indeed, the Minister for Education and Science appears reluctant even to engage in the emerging debate about quality in education.</P>
      <P>The truth is that we have steadfastly refused to shine a light into the dark corners where some nasty surprises lurk. Some harsh realities loom out of the shadows. For example, of 24 OECD countries, Ireland is fifth from the bottom in terms of reading scores at age 14. Three times as many children have severe reading difficulties in deprived city areas as in the rest of the country and more than one in six school leavers cannot carry out even the most basic literacy tasks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not an accident that people are largely unaware of these problems. It is a direct consequence of the fact that the Government collects no information about some of the most crucial aspects of our education. For example, the Department of Education and Science does not collect information about literacy and numeracy in schools, truancy and suspensions-expulsions from school or the special needs of children which require appropriate resources. There is no serious body of research in Ireland on the effectiveness of different policy initiatives to tackle educational disadvantage. No real assessment is available on the designation of schools as disadvantaged, although 1,600 teachers are employed in them, and on the allocation of remedial teachers. It is hard to avoid the conclusion that policy makers are fumbling along in the dark instead of basing proposals on hard analysis. The education debate in Ireland almost invariably centres on outputs, not outcomes; on pupil-teacher ratios, capitation and ex-quota staffing rather than on literacy, numeracy, pupil progress and course drop-outs. <Col N="566" /> This focus inevitably overlooks questions of quality. The effectiveness with which resources are deployed is as important as the quantity.</P>
    <P>Quality improvement is the great challenge for every modern organisation &ndash; instead of repeating what it knows, it seeks to become a learning organisation. This involves systematic analysis of what an organisation does, benchmarking against others and re-arranging work so that the organisation operates as a more cohesive team to improve results. This process seeks to engage people in a new way by encouraging innovation, working as a team and taking responsibility for improvement.</P>
    <P>The education system has even more reason to put quality improvement procedures in place but it has been surprisingly slow to do so. Such procedures are stoutly resisted in quarters where one would expect an impetus for reform. We shall never get to grips with educational disadvantage unless we are willing to face up honestly to the reasons some children find enormous obstacles both within and outside the school.</P>
    <P>Despite its limitations, an examination of inputs nonetheless reveals Government priorities over the years. Spending on a third level student is more than three and a half times that on a primary pupil, in stark contrast to the rest of the EU. Some 54,000 primary pupils are in classes of over 35, which the Department describes as the &ldquo;maximum&rdquo;, although there have been improvements in that area. One in three of those in need of remedial teaching gets none at primary level and this rises to two out of three at second level. The entire amount devoted to measures to help tackle educational disadvantage represents less than 5 per cent of the education budget at first and second level.</P>
    <P>Official efforts to tackle educational disadvantage have been disjointed and applied in an <i>ad hoc</i> manner when resources were available rather than as part of a coherent vision. It is not surprising to find that education has been singularly unsuccessful in levelling life chances in Ireland. In fact, it reinforces inequality. Pupils from low income families do substantially worse at each of the significant stages in the education system compared to the children of top earners. Pupils from low income families are 16 times more likely to leave school without sitting the leaving certificate, four times more likely to get insufficient points to go to third level, and three times less likely to get to third level, having achieved sufficient points.</P>
    <P>This Government's declaration that primary education would get priority has been slow to be realised. Third level has manifestly obtained preference and this year the scope for resource improvement at primary level was halved, because the number of teachers released by falling numbers halved. The Minister's present approach, far from giving primary education priority, will see resources for initiative in the sector progressively dry up as the decline of pupil numbers comes to an end.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="567" /> The voices which get attention in the education debate are rarely those of parents and never of those whose children are likely to drop out early. The voices which dominate the debate are those of the providers. This is not to say they do not have a valid case to make, but no one can expect a union, whose job is to win better conditions for its members, to be able to tell the whole story. The resolution of contentious issues in the Education Bill shows how unequal the partnership in education is. Parents lost on the complaint procedures, in getting a role in pilot school evaluation projects, on the appointment of school boards and on the right to an annual report on their schools.</P>
    <P>The quality of education is fast becoming the dominant factor in the success of nations. Modern workers must be capable of continuous adaptation. The ability to work in teams and to embrace change is the most prized asset of an employee. The successful school must recognise these realities. It must seek to transform itself to meet the needs of its pupils. This challenge is greatest for children who experience difficulty in relating successfully to the education system. We cannot continue to allow one in five pupils drop out early.</P>
    <P>Our highly centralised Department of Education and Science metes out resources on the basis of systematic rules. It is not capable of the bold response to the particular problems of a school in a deprived urban area. This must change. The Department must make an act of faith in the capacity of the local community to devise models to confront its needs. Resources must be freed up for schools which forge new forms of partnership to tackle educational disadvantage.</P>
    <P>A wide gulf separates the early school leaver from the conventional school population. Surveys show that none of them regrets the decision to leave because his or her experience was almost invariably negative. One cannot cross any gulf in small steps, least of all this one; it takes bold strides. This is particularly apt to the challenge of tackling educational disadvantage. The Government has a lot to do in this area.</P>
    <P>I welcome the expansion of the institute of technology sector by the provision of the new IT in Blanchardstown. This is a recognition of the pivotal role played by the Regional Technical College-IT sector over the past three decades. The growth of the tiger economy is due to a number of factors, one of which is the timely provision of a skilled workforce to meet the emerging industries of the 20th and 21st centuries. It is appropriate that the western suburbs of Dublin be provided with the training and educational facility of an institute of technology.</P>
    <P>In the bigger picture, however, the Government must take into account the excessive growth in Dublin and the need to create counter balances in other parts of the country. This has become a major issue for companies intending to locate in <Col N="568" /> Ireland as firms are finding that staff are more difficult to get in Dublin. Housing is too expensive and transport is a real difficulty. Such companies are considering the benefits of provincial towns as an alternative. The recently published Fitzpatrick report on the Border, midland and western regions illustrates the advantages of focusing on alternative growth centres. On a line from Dublin to Galway, there is a marked lack of development in the midlands and west. The report strongly recommends the creation of two growth centres, Sligo and Athlone, and the upgrading of their institutes of technology.</P>
    <P>In recent months the Government has put huge investment into Sligo IT. The new engineering block has great potential for creating jobs in the college's immediate catchment area. It is an attraction for industrialists coming to the area. The Fianna Fáil director of elections in Connacht-Ulster, the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Cuív, said the election sent out a clear signal. There is a huge divide between the west and east coasts and Mrs. Dana Rosemary Scallon had put across a simple message which politicians, particularly the Government, must note. The Minister said on radio that there were many difficulties on the peripheries of the region.</P>
    <P>Areas close to the Border have suffered for a generation on account of the perceived dangers of and their proximity to the Troubles. It is time to address this with a major investment in the north-west as part of the Government's macro-planning to alleviate the gross over-development of the east coast. The catalyst effect of having a university in a regional centre such as Sligo should be taken on as a major thrust of the Government. If the west coast gets proper structures and services a huge amount of work can be done. While the new Blanchardstown IT must be welcomed, it is somewhat surprising that new colleges should not automatically become institutes of technology, rather than legislation having to be introduced for that purpose.</P>
    <P>Under the Vocational Education Act, 1930, 38 vocational education committees were set up to establish and maintain a suitable system of &ldquo;continuation education&rdquo; and to supply or aid the supply of technical education in their respective regions. The number of committees has been reduced to 33. Recently I attended a graduation ceremony in the local community college. A teacher mentioned the three types of leaving certificate and said it was regrettable that students were taken into apprenticeship courses without a leaving certificate. vocational education committees are doing a lot of work in the skills area, but they find it difficult to get students to do the leaving certificate applied course because FÁS and other State bodies are taking students out of it. It is very important for students to finish those courses as it is much more sensible to spend another year or year and a half in school rather than taking on an apprenticeship at 16 years. The Minister should look into making it a requirement of apprenticeship training that students be <Col N="569" /> far clearer about the course they are undertaking by doing the leaving certificate applied if they are in vocational schools. Vocational schools find it difficult to keep students once they have done their junior certificate; they drop out and take up apprenticeships. This must be addressed as it is a serious concern for vocational education committees. They are competing with the apprenticeship boards for students.</P>
    <P>In 1979, 49 adult education organisers were appointed to newly created posts to develop adult education services at local level. These organisers are responsible for organising adult education services in VEC areas. Their specific functions include identifying the educational needs of adults, co-ordinating existing activities and liaising with schools and colleges, and with community and economic interests in promoting adult education activity. They are doing a fantastic job with evening classes and lifelong learning activities. Some VEC colleges have degree courses for secretarial skills and it is wonderful that there is now a possibility that their courses will be accredited and that students may be funded when attending these colleges rather than institutes of technology. That is a wonderful idea. Adult education boards were established on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis by vocational education committees in 1984. Their purpose is to draw up and administer a programme of adult education for the VEC areas. The boards receive a separate allocation of funds for the specific purpose of establishing courses in literacy and community education. I appeal to the Minister to look at this area. There are great facilities and committed teachers giving fantastic value for money.</P>
    <P>There are 78 literacy organisers, two thirds of whom are employed on a part-time temporary basis. Their role is to organise the provision of literacy and numeracy services, co-ordinate the work of voluntary and paid tutors and match trainees with tutors. Overall, an estimated 85 per cent of tuition is provided by volunteers, which shows huge commitment. However, in certain cases the vocational education committees are the poor relation, particularly when they do not amalgamate with community schools. There can be much politicising on boards and competition can exist between secondary schools with massive numbers and VEC colleges for classification. In years to come this will have to be examined.</P>
    <P>The vocational education committees operate projects in co-operation with other Government Departments and local bodies and participate actively in the work of area based partnerships, which are doing great work. The partnerships are a very successful vehicle for job creation and retraining. The vocational education committees are responsible for delivery of the adult literacy and community education scheme, the special initiatives for disadvantaged adults scheme, VTOS, the education components of the prison education service, Youthreach, the out of school programmes for unqualified early school leavers as well as the network of junior traveller edu<Col N="570" /> cation centres and senior traveller training centres. In addition, 92 per cent of all PLC provision is in the VEC sector. As part of this work, vocational education committees engage in joint programmes and extensive interaction with such agencies as FÁS, area partnerships, youth services, probation, health and welfare services, the juvenile liaison service, schools and a range of community and voluntary organisations.</P>
    <P>It is very disturbing that approximately 14,000 students, or 21 per cent of the cohort, leave school every year without attempting the leaving certificate. Many of these students take up apprenticeships or take up hotel training, which is very important, but they should have the maturity of spending another year and a half within the VEC structure. That would make them far better qualified for life. It is sad to take people out after just three years in second level, particularly when the facilities and teachers are there and students are being sought. There may be a huge demand for students from CERT and other bodies but some VEC schools have only 20 students in fourth and fifth year. Given the teaching staff in these schools, we are not getting a return on the input of the Department of Education and Science.</P>
    <P>Approximately 6 to 8 per cent of pupils in the school system have severe reading difficulties and it is the same figure for moderate reading difficulties. This problem is twice as bad in disadvantaged urban areas. However, despite the concentration of disadvantage in urban areas, 60 per cent of children who are educationally disadvantaged are in rural areas or small towns.</P>
    <P>Education has become the gatekeeper to a person's progress. Poor education slams many doors. Students who leave school without qualification are ten times more likely to be unemployed than third level graduates. The position is even worse among people with disabilities, with an 80 per cent unemployment rate being experienced. The spending by the State on a child who drops out in the early years of secondary school is only about one third that devoted to the education of a graduate and the State pays for this under investment later. Compared to a graduate, the average early school leaver receives £26,000 more in social welfare payments and pays £70,000 less in tax revenue over the first 20 years. Early school leavers are more vulnerable to sliding into a life on the margins dogged by crime or substance abuse and placing a very heavy burden on the community in both economic and social terms.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to consider the suggestion that it should be mandatory for students to finish the leaving certificate applied before taking up apprenticeships in particular. A vocational school principal raised that point with me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>This legislation will see the creation of a new institute of technology in west Dublin. I was brought up in the greater Blanchardstown area, so I know a great deal about the needs of that large community. This infrastructu<Col N="571" /> ral development is long overdue and I am proud that my party has supported and driven this decision, despite the wavering and significant delays encountered by those looking for an institute of technology when dealing with other Governments. Our Government has delivered on this necessary development for that community.</P>
      <P>I note Deputy Perry's comments on the west and I welcome his general comments on education. It is more fully understood today than it was even ten years ago that education is the key to one's future. It is the key to attainment and advancement in this society. That was not always the case but it is now and is probably one of the most welcome developments we have seen in Ireland in the last 20 years. The hunger for education among the population is second to none and the educational attainment of the Irish people has created the prosperity we now enjoy. As Deputy Perry said, lack of educational attainment by the last 20 per cent of our population, who are experiencing various degrees of disadvantage, is a big problem. Many Members represent areas with high unemployment and disadvantage. This problem cannot be cured in the short-term. The low level of educational attainment is a problem in disadvantaged areas and the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, is preparing a ground breaking Green Paper on adult education. I surprised some senior citizens in Tallaght yesterday when I told them of the adult literacy problem in Ireland. They had assumed, given the great advances made by our society in the past 25 years, that all young people could read and write. Many of the 7 per cent of our population who are unemployed, lack basic literacy skills. Education is the benchmark of progress in society. Deputy Joe Higgins may assert that class is still the essential mark of difference, but social theorists have moved from that old Marxist perception and now hold the view that educational attainment is what designates a person as advantaged or disadvantaged. The advertising industry increasingly designates target groups on the basis of educational attainment. This indicates an important shift in thinking in liberal democratic states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to Deputy Perry's remarks about Dana Rosemary Scallon's success in the European elections, the west has been left behind and there is an eastern tilt in our economy. This imbalance was addressed by the Government in the debate on Objective One status. The west has disadvantaged itself by concentrating too much on the question of Objective One and on European subsidies. The west and the Border counties would achieve more by lobbying actively for the development of the road and rail infrastructure. Good roads will have a greater effect on western prosperity than handouts from central Government or Europe. Much was achieved by the two Delors packages of Structural Funds. We live on a very small island where no place is more than 70 miles from the sea. We should aim to reduce all journey times within Ireland to a maximum of <Col N="572" /> one and a half hours. If that were achieved we would have no difficulty bringing investment and educational facilities to peripheral areas. An executive from a multinational company should be able to reach any part of Ireland within an hour and a half of landing at Dublin, Shannon or Belfast airports. Attempts have been made to reduce peripherality. The IDA, in its latest annual report, declares the authority's policy to redirect investment to peripheral regions. We must not concentrate physical and educational resources in the Dublin and eastern region.</P>
    <P>I welcome the institute of technology for Blanchardstown. Some, perhaps like Deputy Currie, may feel a Deputy who represents Tallaght should not welcome the establishment of a rival institution in the west of County Dublin. Deputy Currie knows Tallaght welcomes the institute of technology in Blanchardstown. All of west Dublin cannot be served by the institute of technology in Tallaght although, when it was first planned, the policy makers thought it could serve the needs of the entire west Dublin connurbation. Population analysts could not have predicted the massive growth of the past four or five years.</P>
    <P>There is an early plan for four institutes of technology in the Dublin area. Notwithstanding my comments about the need for development in the west, Dublin has a greater requirement of third level places than any other area in the country. The institute of technology in Tallaght is obliged to turn applicants away.</P>
    <P>The Government has given the institutes of technology greater status. They have been given a new role and a psychological upgrade. In the past regional technology colleges were regarded, in a snobbish way, as second class educational institutions. That is no longer the case. The new institutes of technology are bringing practical qualifications and jobs to students who have already come through the school system. They are a long overdue addition to our economy and society and I hope they continue to develop. Linkages between educational attainment and employment must be developed.</P>
    <P>We have neglected the question of lifelong learning. The Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy O'Dea, will address this matter in his Green Paper. We must foster the idea that education does not end when one leaves school or a third level institution. Industry must be persuaded to spend money on training and on developing the human capital which drives successful companies. Ireland will never be a low wage economy and we will never build economic success on that basis. I support the Government's introduction of the minimum wage and I do not agree with lobbyists who claim a minimum wage will make us uncompetitive. The introduction of a minimum wage will lift people's aspirations and oblige industry to invest in the development of its human capital. The institutes of technology are ideally placed to fulfil that function. It is important that linkages between them and industry are continually <Col N="573" /> strengthened because knowledge based industries will bring about economic progress.</P>
    <P>In the last general election campaign I advocated increased investment in the institute of technology in Tallaght and I am glad the Minister for Education and Science has sanctioned the spending of £12 million towards that end. At its inception in 1992 the institute had 900 students and there are now 2,500. We need to invest more in the institutes of technology and we need to do so faster than at present. I do not say that as a criticism of the Government's policies, but by way of exhortation.</P>
    <P>Five or ten years ago all the economic predictions about population growth and our success were wrong in terms of what was required. Investement has been sanctioned for the institutes of technology, including Tallaght, and they are slowly developing a new infrastructure and expanding their capacity for students who are hungry to learn. Unfortunately, such colleges cannot take students in quickly enough and must turn them away. Blanchardstown will be catering for 1,000 students and while that is a great start it will not be enough. Within five or ten years that figure could increase by up to tenfold.</P>
    <P>There were plans originally to have four institutes of technology in county Dublin and there are now three: Tallaght, Blanchardstown and Dún Laoghaire. We must build up the capacity for part-time programmes in these institutes. The Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, is fully committed to this in the Green Paper. I recall that years ago, when I studied at University College, Dublin, the physical infrastructure of that university lay idle throughout the summer and to a large extent in the evenings. The UCD library was a very quiet place in the evenings, but that is no longer the case. We must build part-time education programmes into institutes of technology because increasingly people wish to return to work. Retired people and women who have been working in the home and have reared their families, want to study and re-enter the workforce. We are not doing enough to encourage such people. They should be encouraged because there are huge skills shortages in the economy.</P>
    <P>One of the oddest features of our country is that one is more likely to be served in a tobacconist's or newsagent's shop by a young person, while in developed economies on the continent predominantly older, more mature people are working in such low-skilled retail jobs. It is very odd, given the economic success we are achieving with the Celtic tiger, that we still have young people working in such retail sector jobs. We need to examine that situation and encourage older people to get back into the work force to undertake such tasks. That is the pattern in other countries.</P>
    <P>Part-time education programmes are very important. I welcome the fact that the Minister for Education and Science has sanctioned dedicated staff for this purpose at the Institute of <Col N="574" /> Technology in Tallaght. That represents a seismic shift for the Department whose officials up to now have taken the view that one cannot sanction specific staff for part-time evening programmes. That is now being done and it is an indication that the Department is moving with the times, and realising the huge benefits that part-time and adult education provides for people who are not only trying to get a job but are also trying to improve themselves intellectually.</P>
    <P>The Institute of Technology at Tallaght is awaiting Government approval for its campus development plan. It is an amazing fact that Tallaght started in 1992 with 900 students and now has 2,500. The plan envisages an intake of 5,000 student places, which is an enormous development in a short period. It shows that there is an enormous hunger for further learning and education in the new suburbs which both I and Deputy Currie serve.</P>
    <P>One would imagine that a large institute like the one at Tallaght would take students from all over Dublin. I am reliably informed, however, that 93 per cent of the student intake comes from the adjacent postal districts of Dublin 22, 24, 12, 16 and the county Dublin area of Lucan where Deputy Currie resides. While the general perception is that Tallaght is serving the needs of the whole Dublin area, the institute is trying to cater for the demand for education in its immediate surrounding areas. That is a remarkable fact.</P>
    <P>The south western corner of Dublin is fast becoming a city itself, with the remarkable City West business campus which ultimately will employ 6,000 people. It will have a huge impact in bringing skilled jobs to that area, in addition to which it will have a big impact on the Institute of Technology in Tallaght. Some of the world's leading digital technology companies are based in the region which will become a hub for such activity.</P>
    <P>We should go ahead with a second airport for Dublin at Baldonnell and the Minister for Public Enterprise should examine that matter which would be a positive development for the region. Such infrastructure is needed to build upon the success of City West, the Institute of Technology and Tallaght Hospital.</P>
    <P>Deputy Perry gave credit where it was due &ndash; to the Government's focus on education. The Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Martin, is one of the most successful Ministers in the Government. Many people might say that it is easy to be successful when one has the support of a Taoiseach and a Government that are putting money into one's hands. The Minister is playing a developmental role, as is the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State should examine seriously the issue of literacy. The country is in a period of full employment. Although the unemployment rate is 7 per cent the real percentage is of the order of 5 per cent and many people cannot get work because they are illiterate. It is a serious problem. When conducting my constituency clin<Col N="575" /> ics I am surprised at the number of times I have been confronted by this phenomenon. I have asked people to write their names and addresses in my notebook, but they sheepishly hand it back, asking me to write down the details instead because they cannot do so. The problem of illiteracy must be addressed. This society cannot progress while leaving 15 to 20 per cent of the population behind who are either illiterate, unemployed or uneducated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I wholeheartedly welcome this Bill as an honest step towards the establishment of an institute of technology at Blanchardstown. We have come a long way since the idea of a regional technical college was first mooted for Blanchardstown. I was involved in other matters elsewhere at the time, but I understand that the proposal was first made as far back as 1985. It was cancelled in 1987 by the Government, before being revived in the early 1990s. I hope we are now well on the way towards its establishment.</P>
      <P>I understand the Minister's reference to false dawns, but not his references to &ldquo;much inflated rhetoric&rdquo; and &ldquo;no real commitment&rdquo;. Why does he not tell us specifically who he is accusing of repeated rhetoric and lack of commitment? Neither do I understand the references in his speech where he stated that</P>
      <P>Some people have, over the past year, sought every opportunity to question this project, to seek out short-term publicity by misrepresenting or ignoring the level of commitment and dynamism behind the project. The bottom line is that we have delivered the funding and support which was missing when Blanchardstown was fast entering mythology as one of those projects which was promised at election time but would never appear.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister or the Minister of State will be more specific about those very serious allegations. Who are these people who were responsible for these dastardly acts? I have not heard anyone questioning the project.</P>
      <P>When we left office instead of the Blanchardstown institute fast entering mythology, it was becoming a reality on the ground. That is the factual position. The facts are that it was during the term of office of the rainbow coalition, in which I was privileged to be a Minister of State at the Department of Education, that a decision was made to have an institute and that it should be located in Blanchardstown.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened with interest to my colleague, Deputy Richard Bruton, who told us that it could have been located elsewhere. It did not follow inevitably that it would be located in Blanchardstown and I and other colleagues fought hard to make sure it was established there. Under that Government the exact location of the institute was decided and a strategic planning group was established. Having regard to some of the comments <Col N="576" /> made by the Minister, maybe I should remind Members, particularly members of the Government, of the terms of reference for the strategic planning group which were announced in May 1997.</P>
    <P>The terms of reference state:</P>
    <P>The task of the Group would be to prepare a strategic plan for the college, having regard to the existing provisions in the region; to advise on the specific needs and functions of the college; and to advise on the sources of funding for its development and operation.</P>
    <P>Specifically the Group should address the following issues:</P>
    <P>(a)Policies, objectives and strategies;</P>
    <P>(b)Courses to be provided/selected on the basis of appropriate criteria;</P>
    <P>(c)Student numbers/courses, entry standards, qualifications, research and industry support;</P>
    <P>(d)Areas of special focus and excellence;</P>
    <P>(e)Industry links, support services, research and consultancy;</P>
    <P>(f)International links;</P>
    <P>(g)Funding sources &ndash; public, private and EU, (Current and Capital);</P>
    <P>(h)Provision for governance, executive/ management, staff structures academic and administrative).</P>
    <P>The Group should also consider proposals/submissions for potential partnerships or co-operative arrangements etc. with other institutions in the Dublin area.</P>
    <P>The findings of the Steering Committee on the Future Development of Higher Education should be regarded as the policy framework for the strategic plan.</P>
    <P>The Group will report not later than six months from the date of the first meeting.</P>
    <P>They are the terms of reference that were given by the then Minister for Education, Niamh Bhreathnach, when she established the strategic planning group.</P>
    <P>Other instructions were given and suggestions made which, to a large extent, have been followed through. It was envisaged that the new Blanchardstown Regional Technical College would develop a flexible framework related to regional and national requirements with an emphasis on specialist higher education for leading edge industries in the region; upgrading specialist skills to higher technical/technological levels; continuing education and the needs of mature students; short or part-time courses to meet specific occupation needs; in-service courses, retraining and up-dating of skills in third level education and special needs arising from educational disadvantage or disability.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="577" /> It was also envisaged that the proposed new institute would provide relevant education and training responsive to the economic and social needs both locally and nationally. Its aim would be to design and deliver a range of high quality courses for full-time and part-time students to certificate and diploma levels initially and to degree level in areas of excellence to be determined through development. The courses would focus on the needs of the human resource requirements of leading edge high technology industries and on the languages, business, science and engineering fields.</P>
    <P>Flexibility in the provision of courses would include co-operative education with work experience, modularisation and credit accumulation. The learning strategy should be aimed at guiding students towards the levels of knowledge and skills acquisition for a variety of areas of working life. Inherent in this approach would be the essential attitudinal development for increasing motivation and for promoting self-management, critical analysis, decision making, problem solving and entrepreneurship.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the growing importance of the EU, cross-cultural and global trading, the proposed college should also place special emphasis on producing graduates with proficiency in EU languages and a sound knowledge of social, cultural, economic and business practices throughout the world. This dynamic should be developed and an active basis for relevance should be maintained through a multiplicity of links with public and private enterprise, educational institutions and research and development, especially in regional, national and EU contexts.</P>
    <P>Essential links should include those required for the education of workers to the highest international standards; the development of co-operative education with provision for work experience for both students and lecturers; lecturer exchange with enterprises including advice and support for in-company training; consultancy and joint R&amp;D projects with enterprises and information, knowledge and technology transfer.</P>
    <P>Concern for those with special needs should be a feature of the mission and activities of the new college. Appropriate measures should be introduced to facilitate their entry and to co-ordinate and channel necessary support, including research, to ensure that they can optimise their potential for achievement.</P>
    <P>The courses in the new regional technical college should be designed to take account of the portability of qualifications. This approach should ensure that due account will be taken of courses and qualifications, particularly in the institutions of the EU so that transfer, recognition and progression will be readily facilitiated.</P>
    <P>I referred to those recommendations to indicate what was contemplated by those in the previous Administration who were responsible for setting up the strategic planning group and to underline the extent to which that which the Minister claimed for himself in his speech yester<Col N="578" /> day had been done and was a commitment of his predecessors. I do not understand why the Minister should talk in these terms. Why do Ministers do that? I have often wondered about the attitude of Ministers from all parties, including Ministers with whom I served, who were not prepared to give credit to their predecessors and would only mention them if they could blame them. What is the reason for such begrudgery, pettiness and small-mindedness? They pretend that credit for successful projects rests entirely with themselves even when a project &ndash; as projects do &ndash; span two or more Administrations. It is like a builder putting a roof on a house and pretending no one else was responsible for the rest of the work. I find this attitude particularly incomprehensible and reprobate in a young Minister, one whom we are told will represent the new Fianna Fáil of the future. I do not understand it. I point the finger at all Administrations and some Ministers in all Administrations who have had such a petty attitude.</P>
    <P>I was present at the opening of the new Garda station in Blanchardstown, which was officially opened by the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue. During his speech he made no reference to his predecessors. He made no reference to the part played by the former Minister, Deputy Owen, or the former Ministers of State, Joan Burton or myself. Everyone recognises the reason that Garda station was built so quickly owed something to the fact that the three of us were Ministers in the vicinity of Blanchardstown. Are we so small-minded and so petty that matters of that nature cannot be referred to? The Minister said he expects the new campus to be completed in 2000 or 2001. I hope it is &ndash; although these projects have a habit of being extended &ndash; and that the official opening will take place in 2000 or 2001. However, the current Minister may not be the one who officiates at the official opening. He would have the right to be annoyed if the contribution he has made was ignored by the Minister who officiates at the opening in 2000 or 2001. If a different Minister is in office, I hope he or she will not be petty and openly admit the Minister, Deputy Martin, played a part, in the same way I would expect the Minister to say previous Ministers made a contribution. I do not understand this small-minded attitude.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister that it is not often a Minister for Education and Science gets the opportunity to Iaunch a project capable of changing the educational and social landscape so dramatically and that the new institute in Blanchardstown is one of those projects, although he should have said he is one of those responsible. This is one of the reasons I am so strongly in favour of the proposal. The Minister referred to the innovative role of the institute, which was included in the original terms of reference given to the policy committee. He said:</P>
    <P>It will help to meet the skills needs of emerging industries. It will also devote itself to improving the level of participation in third <Col N="579" /> level education and training in north west Dublin. This is an area with one of the lowest participation rates in the country, a situation which we cannot allow to continue. The institute will only have achieved its mission if it succeeds in making a significant impact on the level of participation in the region.</P>
    <P>I agree with those sentiments. The new institute will be judged by the extent to which it enables that participation.</P>
    <P>I strongly believe in educational opportunity as a means of breaking out of social disadvantage, partly because of my experience. Except for the much maligned eleven plus in the North, I would not have received a secondary education and certainly not a university one. I do not agree with the eleven plus. It should not be decided that some children are good and others are bad, that some are to be successful and others are to be failures at 11 years old. However, it gave an opportunity to those of my background to receive an education. On my visits to third level educational institutions in this State, I am often struck by the fact that the majority who attend them are from privileged backgrounds. When I hear Members talk about their education experience, I am often reminded that they also come from backgrounds of some advantage.</P>
    <P>Social disadvantage is becoming an issue which could cause serious problems if we do not take the necessary measures to tackle it. Some candidates in the recent local elections claimed that if people voted for them they would ensure their houses are not broken into and that drugs will not be peddled in their areas. Those promises are attractive to people who are harassed and intimidated by gangsters in their areas. However, those ordinary decent people should remember that by trying to get a monkey off their backs they may end up with a gorilla. We must be careful about this. Educational opportunity is the way out of this disadvantage, which we should continue to reiterate.</P>
    <P>I visited the Vatican some years ago and wondered how all the jewels and wealth were accumulated over the centuries before coming across the slums and the obvious poverty a couple of hundred yards away. I wondered whose responsibility it ought to be to do something about that. Having visited the wonderful new town centre in Blanchardstown or the new Liffey Valley Centre, one is often reminded of similar deprivation and social disadvantage close to those areas of relative opulence.</P>
    <P>I hope that will not be the case when the wonderful new campus is opened at Blanchardstown and that it will be a symbol of the end of second class citizenship in our State. If so, it will have performed an enormous role, not only in the Blanchardstown area and Dublin 15 but in doing something about social disadvantage and deprivation which is a real threat to political life.</P>

      <P>I join the Minister in complimenting Mr. Donal Connell of 3 COM and the other members of the establishment board. They willingly gave their time and made a major contribution to this desirable facility and project. It reminds me of an interview given by Val Doonican when he had a couple of songs in the hit parade and was asked how he liked being an overnight success . He said it took only about 17 years.</P>
      <P>We have long awaited the possibility of making a third level facility available to the widest possible number of young people. This project dates back to when I was first elected in 1977, eight general elections ago, when Blanchardstown was a rural village. Education has been the biggest issue during those years. A young student from Trinity College was in the House today interviewing Members. His aim is to interview 40 or 50 Members with a view to writing a thesis on our priorities. When I was asked that question I had no hesitation, looking back over those years, in answering &ldquo;education&rdquo;. I started out in Blanchardstown with meetings about a primary school, other than the original village school. Today in Blanchardstown and the greater Dublin 15 area there is a mushrooming network of primary and post-primary schools.</P>
      <P>My recollection of the beginnings of this project is that the first steering committee report from the Higher Education Authority recommended placing it further over on the north fringe. I asked to meet the Higher Education Authority. Colleagues, such as Deputy Currie, and other elected members in the area came together in a spirit of broad consensus on what we thought was best for our constituency. We did not just do so because it was our constituency but because we believed the relative demographics of Blanchardstown and the north fringe would justify selecting Blanchardstown, which was the second choice.</P>
      <P>We convinced the Higher Education Authority at that meeting that, as I had suggested, it should meet the planners from Fingal County Council to get a clear understanding of the current and projected population of Blanchardstown. That turned out to be a very worthwhile exercise for the Higher Education Authority. Fingal County Council was able to articulate in great detail the potential build-up and age profile of the projected 100,000 plus population of Blanchardstown.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no hesitation in paying warm compliments to my parliamentary colleagues and Ministers on their contributions. The then Minister for Education, Niamh Bhreathnach, met us and other members of the establishment board during the summer recess some years ago. We made an urgent case to her that we needed a specialised institute of technology that would produce the sort of courses which, thankfully, were detailed in the Minister's speech &ndash; electronics, computer engineering, information technology, business studies, information technology with French and <Col N="581" /> information technology with German. Those were the specific subjects identified by the establishment board.</P>
    <P>Academic qualifications are desirable across a broad range of subjects. However, due to the success of the IDA and Fingal County Council in attracting companies such as IBM, Intel, Hewlett Packard and others to the wider area, there is an enormous base of job opportunities for young people. The then Minister, Niamh Bhreathnach, played a key part in making third level education available to young people. The then Minister of State, Deputy Currie, also played a part.</P>
    <P>We laid the foundation for what we have today. This has always been a collective effort on the part of public representatives in Dublin West. We may disagree on policy and Deputy Joe Higgins may disagree with us in terms of ideology, but everybody wants to see projects such as this succeed and for third level education to be made available to the widest possible cross-section of young people.</P>
    <P>I agree it is disturbing that, although this will be a wonderful project, there is a large young population in parts of west Blanchardstown or north Clondalkin to whom this type of facility will not be available. That issue is probably for another day and another Minister. However, today the ESRI produced a report on housing estates. Deputy Currie referred to the management, standard and quality of life in some of those housing estates in Blanchardstown, Clondalkin, Lucan and Tallaght.</P>
    <P>This is a welcome day. The facility is within its budget of £20 million and the architectural work is under way. Temporary accommodation, which was given urgent priority, accommodates 450 pupils. Eventually, the new campus will accommodate 900 pupils. It is very welcome that the site was changed because if the project had been built on the original site at the town centre its potential for expansion would have been severely limited. It is now being built on a 60 acre site. I do not know the detailed demographics but I think 900 places will not be enough, given the intended further rise in the population of the Dublin 15 area, particularly in Clondalkin and Lucan.</P>
    <P>This project, Tallaght Regional Technical College and the other third level facilities will give young people in Clondalkin, Lucan and their environs access to third level education. With the new motorway links, Tallaght Regional Technical College and the Blanchardstown Institute of Technology will be readily accessible to people in the greater eastern catchment area.</P>
    <P>I hope that, in parallel with the provision of a third level facility in Blanchardstown, greater emphasis will be placed on the post-primary feeder schools and colleges, to ensure parents and pupils realise the potential opportunities in these facilities. If one goes to primary and post-primary school and on to a third level college, such as the institute of technology in Blanchardstown, one's job prospects, potential for a good income and <Col N="582" /> opportunities in society are substantially enhanced.</P>
    <P>I conducted a study when Ballyfermot was part of my constituency and I produced a paper highlighting the very low percentage take-up of third level opportunities by post primary pupils on the west side of Dublin, in comparison to those on the north side and south side. I identified in great detail the need for such facilities. The decision taken by the previous Government to make third level education available on a non fee paying basis was important. As resources have become available to the Government &ndash; and the previous Government was endeavouring to go in this direction &ndash; we are in a position to ensure all sectors of society can share in the country's economic growth. Where better could one put capital investment than into a third level institute of technology?</P>
    <P>The need for a further facility or the expansion of the existing facility in Blanchardstown will depend on the decisions of the local authorities. Naturally, with the revision of Dáil electoral boundaries, I will be putting a greater emphasis on the mid-west part of the constituency and Clondalkin and Lucan, where it is proposed, given the current population build-up, a further 5,000 or 6,000 houses should be provided, which will mean an increase of between 10,000 or 20,000 in the population. It will also depend on whether the facilities in Tallaght and Blanchardstown, the other facilities in the greater Dublin region and the specialised regional colleges in Dundalk and Waterford can provide those young people with third level opportunities.</P>
    <P>The emigrants who are returning to this country were fortunate to get a third level education before they left. I would like to see a targeting of pupils who are currently not going on to third level education. We brought together, in this case, the principals of the post-primary schools in Coolmine, Hartstown and Blakestown and the new Castleknock community college because they had first hand knowledge of their enrolments and the number of pupils going on to third level. They were able to identify in great detail the pupils who were getting the opportunity of third level education. That is why the Government has decided to rigorously press on with this project. As it is a 60 acre complex, if places are still unavailable at third level, we can expand this facility rather than starting with another green field site. The number of pupils &ndash; 950 &ndash; is reasonable for a campus but could and should be expanded if the opportunities we want to provide are not being made available to the widest possible catchment of pupils.</P>
    <P>Often it is financial constraint at home which prevents young people from going into third level education. That unfortunate situation should be examined. Teenagers who must earn money for the household cannot spend the extra years availing of the third level opportunity. We must devise a scheme so young people are not denied this opportunity because of financial circum<Col N="583" /> stances at home. That may mean tax adjustments or local authority rent adjustments but if the problems in cost areas such as crime can be minimised and young people become involved in the completion of third level education, and the sporting and related activities which go with it, they will go on to contribute to society.</P>
    <P>I welcome this proposal and compliment the previous Government and the public representatives who co-operated with those representing the Blanchardstown area for so many years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill. It is necessary. I was a member of the previous Government when this matter was discussed and certain decisions were taken to set this in train. It is critical for the future development of the State that this institute is set up and that it makes its presence felt from the word go. I take cognisance of what the Minister said about the commitment and dedication of the personnel in the Department of Education and Science who drafted this Bill.</P>
      <P>In welcoming this Bill, I will make a parallel case which does not receive the same attention as Blanchardstown. This city has expanded at a phenomenal rate in the last ten years and will probably increase by the same proportion in the next ten years. From my time in trade, I know that investors wishing to site in Ireland are anxious to site near mainline markets, major airports and communication facilities. This has led to an explosion of investment and housing with all the consequential requirements. This means that the city is gridlocked. This is causing serious delays, leading to stress and disappointment for thousands of people every day; it also hampers the fluid growth of the State which everyone in this House wishes to see.</P>
      <P>There have been difficulties in the west for some time with recognition and delivery of facilities. When one has the opportunity at Government level, one tries to help one's own area as best one can. I am struck by the fact that the Minister refers to the Blanchardstown area and surrounding region as having one of the lowest levels of participation in third level education. It is perfectly in order to make every effort to change that statistic and to provide the depth and breadth of excitement which is present in education and learning to young students, to expose them to that potential and to face them toward that challenge so they can rise with the new century to better themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The European Parliament and Commission recently confirmed that 13 western counties are entitled to Objective One status, bringing with it a higher level of facilities and grant attractions for industries to set up there. One can see the problems caused by lack of infrastructure for mainline companies wishing to site there. Baxter Health Care Products recently announced a £30 million expansion in its plant in Castlebar, County Mayo, and Coca Cola earlier this year proposed an <Col N="584" /> investment of £100 million in Ballina, County Mayo.</P>
    <P>Senior ESB personnel, however, recently said that it is practically impossible, not because of a lack of money but because of lack of capacity in the loop system, to site major industry in a broad belt of the west. One can then see the difficulty county development agencies have in attracting such levels of investment to the 13 western counties. As public representatives from that region we support efforts in this area.</P>
    <P>There was a campaign in County Mayo to site a regional technical college or institute of education in Castlebar to serve the county. A decision was taken that this should be an adjunct to the Galway/Mayo Institute of Technology, formerly the regional technical college in Galway. I pay tribute to the principals involved in the former Regional Technical College in Galway for their flexibility and consideration of what has proven to be an outstanding success for County Mayo in Castlebar. The principals of GMIT allow a separate budget for the running of that campus. The very fine principal there, Dr. Richard Thorne, provides a range of courses enabling the college to achieve its targets three years ahead of schedule.</P>
    <P>In direct contrast to the Blanchardstown area referred to by the Minister, County Mayo has the highest level of participation in third level education in the State. That meant that students from that region wishing to involve themselves in third level education had to travel to places like Blanchardstown, areas outside their own locality,because they did not previously have that facility. The institute in Castlebar occupies a portion of the grounds of St. Mary's Hospital, a former psychiatric hospital owned by the Western Health Board. It is a magnificent building which, when acquired fully, will prove to be not only a beautiful campus but of immense attraction to students from outside the region. The area of ground leased from the Western Health Board in that complex is approximately 75,000 square metres on 18.5 acres of land. About 6,000 square metres have been refurbished and are currently occupied. The master plan for this complex involves the eventual occupation of the entire St. Mary's hospital building, which is planned to be divided into 10,000 to 12,000 square metres for the academic and administration requirements of the campus and the remainder to be used for on-campus student accommodation.</P>
    <P>I understand that contrary to the praise the Minister lavished on officials dealing with Blanchardstown, which is making its mark and its presence felt from the word go, that agreement has been reached between the GMIT and the Western Health Board, not only for the purchase of the leased section but for the purchase of the entire complex of St. Mary's hospital, that is 18.5 acres. I am concerned to hear in the past fortnight that it would appear to be the intention of the Department of Education and Science to allow only sufficient moneys for the purchase of the <Col N="585" /> section of that complex currently leased by GMIT. That would be a retrograde step of great magnitude for the region given its Objective One classification and that it has the highest participation rate in third level education.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to confirm that moneys will be provided to buy out the entire complex of St. Mary's hospital, Castlebar, at the price agreed between GMIT and the Western Health Board and that he will give full authorisation to the development of the master plan envisaged for that fledgling institution. The institution has reached its target number of full-time students three years ahead of schedule. The number of students registered with GMIT Castlebar in September 1998 was 630 full-time and 888 part-time students. Many of these are from the Dublin area, represented ably here by Deputy Joe Higgins and some come from his native County Kerry.</P>
    <P>There are full-time courses leading to a national certificate and a national diploma in business studies; a national certificate and a national diploma in computing; PC software development: a national certificate and a national diploma in engineering; a national certificate in construction studies; a national diploma in humanities and a national diploma in business studies, tourism and languages. In continuing education there are seven single subject courses, 13 college certificate courses and a range of others, all of which are validated by either NCEA, GMIT, NCIR or Teagasc and GMIT together.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister put an end to my concerns in that matter. The campaign went on for a very long number of years and was supported by the previous Government and it is supported, at least in principle, by this Government, but I would not like to see a restriction put on the expansion of that college because of the passage of this legislation. I fully support Blanchardstown and every pound invested in educational facilities for the young pupils and students of this country. Having reached the current point in our economic expansion it is more critical and important than ever that they are given such opportunities. I wish good luck to those who can rise to the level envisaged in Blanchardstown.</P>
    <P>The Government will spend more money on all levels of education, but we face an enormous challenge in the next 15 years. Industry now wants a labour supply with the necessary level of skills, the necessary research and development facilities and the infrastructure to compete successfully in the global market. Given that the next round of GATT negotiations and the expansion of world trade will be a serious issue for the recently elected members of the European Parliament, these issues are critical if Ireland is to maintain its forward momentum.</P>
    <P>We need far more flexibility and an awareness in the third level institutes of where we are heading. It is time to develop the potential of enterprise. I propose we set up a western edu<Col N="586" /> cational authority, comprising UCG, GMIT, the Regional Technical Colleges in Athlone, Castlebar, Sligo, Letterkenny and Derry, the fledgling Catholic university in Ballina and the outreach facility to be located in Kiltimagh under UCG, which would have a capacity on an all-Ireland, cross-Border, north western area context. It would have the resources available to it in terms of student numbers for economies of scale and breadth of courses, and students could start in any one of these institutes and finish in another. It would be a clear direction from the British-Irish Agreement that education knows no borders and that Ireland can compete in terms of attracting industry and producing goods with an ability to market and sell on a world scale. It would attract resources from the Peace and Reconciliation Fund, from the European Union on account of Objective One status and the North-South element. I also see its enormous potential to break down the stultification in universities that are not flexible and open to receiving new ideas and new initiatives. I look forward to the Minister examining my proposal in this regard.</P>
    <P>I see a bright future if the same level of application is applied to that proposal as to the regional college in Blanchardstown, we are on the way to making our mark in education in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>Fáiltím roimh an mBille seo mar creidim go láidir sa saghas sin oideachais, an t-oideachas atá á chur ar fáil ag na hinstitiúidí, ar nós Baile Blainséir, ar fud na tíre. Tá siad ag dul amach sa sochaí agus ag tarraingt daoine isteach nach bhfreastalaíonn de ghnáth ar choláistí mar sin agus ar chúrsaí mar sin. Sin an fáth go bhfáiltím roimh an coláiste nua agus roimh an Bille a thugann staid dleathach don choláiste. The main basis of education is that it should be accessible and attractive. Courses which are being offered in third level colleges, whether universities or institutes of technology throughout the country, have changed drastically in the past number of years to ensure they offer not just an education &ndash; which is crucial in any education course and is of value in itself &ndash; but also training for employment, giving people the necessary technology and technical skills. It is important that the courses and the colleges respond to economic and social needs in their various constituencies and throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The development of the institutes of technology has in no small way added to this development. It is through them that the participation rate has increased. People are coming from a variety of backgrounds and ages to participate in a wide range of courses. However, there is some concern when one reads the Clancy report and the updated surveys and other data which show there are still areas in the city of Dublin and throughout the country where there is a very low participation rate. People from areas of economic disadvantage, social deprivation and educational <Col N="587" /> disadvantage do not get the opportunity to participate in any form of third level course. One of those areas, according to the statistics, is the north-west Dublin region.</P>
    <P>For that reason the development of the Blanchardstown Institute of Technology is particularly welcome. It means this college will have to respond to the challenges of its surrounding area. The campus must be and, I understand, will be attractive. It must not be behind closed gates where people are afraid to enter &ndash; it needs to be accessible and open. I understand the facilities which will be provided in this college will be of top quality &ndash; laboratories, libraries, audio-visual facilities and lecture theatres.</P>
    <P>The courses on offer will give people skills but they will also train them for the industries in the surrounding area. These industries are among our greatest employers, for example, Intel, which is only down the road from Blanchardstown. The close links between industry and the colleges will allow a close relationship to develop between industry and education.</P>
    <P>The courses which have already been approved for that college and which will commence in September 1999 will cater for leaving certificate students and for mature students. They will allow for in-service courses for people currently in employment and they will also facilitate retraining in the constantly demanding science and technology sectors. It is always appropriate that people should be given an opportunity, within their work time, to retrain and to update their skills. It is sad that FÁS must go abroad to recruit young people to take up jobs in Ireland but welcome that our own people are returning. If those currently unemployed could train for skills and get access to courses, such as those which will be offered in Blanchardstown, and if the apprenticeship sector was developed, we would avoid having to recruit abroad.</P>
    <P>One of the other colleges which is opening this year, on the same lines as Blanchardstown, is the Tipperary Rural Business Development Institute. This is close to my own heart, being in my home town, particularly since my late aunt Binkie was on the initial working group many years ago to fight for a college for the town of Thurles. When I look at the campus there and the one on offer in Blanchardstown I must commend the designers because we seem to have moved away from the flat-roofed, two storey building model used for every regional technical college in the country. These colleges will offer courses which are appropriate to the area.</P>
    <P>I spoke of the high-tech courses which will be on offer in Blanchardstown, suitable to that area and the needs of industry there. I have already referred to the name of the college in Thurles, which includes rural business. It will focus on agriculture, the rural area and link with the business development of the town and the surrounding counties. These are examples of how the new <Col N="588" /> institutes of technology are responding to the needs of local areas.</P>
    <P>I am fortunate that in my constituency of Dún Laoghaire we have such a institute of technology. What was formerly the Dún Laoghaire College of Art and Design has been upgraded as well. That college has seen a major development in its building programme in the past year and in the range of courses it is offering. Two new schools opened last September to add to the school of art, design and media which had long been in existence and which was well established. The two new schools are the school of business and humanities and the school of science and technology. The variety of courses on offer in these schools shows the range which any institute can offer in its own area. The school of art, design and media offers five degree, five diploma and five certificate courses as well as a visual education certificate which can be taken at night. The science and technology school has a diploma in each of those two sectors and a diploma course in both business and humanities. There are also art diplomas and, most importantly, something which should be emulated in all the colleges, access courses which can be full-time and at night.</P>
    <P>It is these access courses which will allow people the opportunity to test a third level course, to see whether they would be able to bridge the gap between whatever level of education they have had and the challenge of third level education.</P>
    <P>The courses in Dún Laoghaire include a national certificate in technology and a national diploma in electronic commerce, which are at the cutting edge of skills needed. The college and the institutes aim at people who, perhaps, have not had third level or second level education. New buildings, and the new building which the Minister opened last year, will encourage and invite people to try the courses, perhaps through extra-mural courses or the welcome summer school.</P>
    <P>I look forward to 2002 when the Dún Laoghaire Institute of Technology will have grown to 2,000 students, having started at 500 in a school of art. While the purpose of the Bill is to deal with the Blanchardstown college, section 11 refers directly to the Dún Laoghaire VEC. This is only a technical provision because there seems to be some doubt as to how the vocational education committees in the Dublin and Dún Laoghaire areas can be appointed following the local elections.</P>
    <P>The Dún Laoghaire Borough Vocational Education Committee is in existence since 1930. Initially there were three vocational education committees &ndash; Dublin city, Dublin county and Dún Laoghaire. The council situation has changed. The 1993 Act altered the local authority structure for the county and Dún Laoghaire and we now have South County Dublin, Fingal and Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown local authorities. This should have given rise to three new vocational education committees but this was not the case. There seems to be some doubt as to whether or <Col N="589" /> not there is a mechanism by which to appoint members to these new committees. It is crucial that each of these vocational education committees should be appointed immediately. There are staffing arrangements to be considered, interviews waiting, principals to be appointed and courses to be run. The provision in this Bill at least will ensure that the vocational education committees can be appointed. In the context of Dún Laoghaire the future of its VEC is important. It does not have a second level school within its remit but it has a very large post &ndash; leaving certificate element with a large number of courses on offer in three different colleges.</P>
    <P>We propose that the Dún Laoghaire VEC be established as the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown VEC and that those areas in Rathdown, Dundrum and Stillorgan should be included in the Dún Laoghaire VEC under a new format when it is re-established. This will have resource implications but, because of the services which are on offer, I believe it will be well worthwhile.</P>
    <P>The Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown VEC has a number of students taking leaving certificate, junior certificate and apprentice programmes. It also reaches out to the community in the way that a vocational committee should. For example, there are five community education projects with over 100 people employed and a Youthreach programme with 25 places. It is not just any old Youthreach workshop &ndash; it is a &ldquo;sportsreach&rdquo; workshop, which is largely football-oriented and is led by Pat Devlin of Bray Wanderers Football Club, whose success is known to all since last year. It reaches out to the very young people who need to be gainfully occupied, to get a skill and training and to be given the discipline along with the enjoyment of sport.</P>
    <P>The Dún Laoghaire VEC also has a travellers' training centre reaching out to the disadvantaged and to people who need to be encouraged to participate in the most basic education. More particularly, it gives a service to over 130 youth clubs, is directly linked to the youth service, which is led by the most able Peter O'Brien and is funded by the Catholic Youth Council. This group is such that over £1 million is being channelled largely through the VEC from the drugs task force funding for the range of courses and projects it developed.</P>
    <P>Many of the courses which are on offer, for example in the Dún Laoghaire Senior College, the Dún Laoghaire Community College and in the Senior College, Sallynoggin, are IT based. Surely that is responding to a need in industry and employment. This year many young people were trained as Microsoft certified professionals. As soon as they finished their course they were able to take up employment.</P>
    <P>We have spent many hours discussing adult education and adult literacy. and following publication of the White Paper we will spend many more hours debating these issues. The work of the adult education organiser in the Dún <Col N="590" /> Laoghaire area and in areas of social deprivation cannot be underestimated.</P>
    <P>There are 185,000 people in the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown area, which I propose should be included in this full VEC. It merits having its own VEC so that it can continue to provide the post-leaving certificate service, the Youthreach programme, the youth service, the travellers' programme and adult education to the needs of the area.</P>
    <P>I hope the present committee, which, under the terms of the Bill, can be re-appointed, will be able at least to continue to link with the psychological services, the administration and the technical supports on offer from the other vocational education committees. However, this needs to be resourced directly to the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown VEC if, and when, it is re-established.</P>
    <P>The schools and colleges in Dún Laoghaire provide a very high level of service with excellent links to the local agencies and they are recognised as major providers of vocational training and vocational preparation. They are involved not only with industry but also with the statutory and community agencies. They have a capacity to respond quickly to the needs of the area, they are flexible and are able to provide a range of services. It would be a logical progression for the VEC to mirror the council as it is now established.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated he would look at the long-term structure of vocational education and would consult with the various bodies in formulating the new committees over the coming year. Section 11 ensures that there will be no gap in the formation of the committees and their constitution following the successful local elections, and I welcome that.</P>
    <P>I hope the models presented in our regional technical colleges and the institutes of technology throughout the country can continue to grow and that they can continue to offer access and support, not just to local industry and to employers, but especially to those who deserve a break in education and who deserve to have access, particularly in those areas of disadvantage and low participation. I also hope we will continue to make it our priority as a Government to ensure that these people get the most access to education. I welcome the Bill as another step in providing services for them.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Minister of State is smiling, but his county still has to play Counties <Col N="591" /> Galway and Sligo. I welcome the Bill and commend it to the House. Its purpose is to establish the Blanchardstown Institute of Technology. I wish it every success and hope it will meet the targets the Minister is setting for it.</P>
      <P>I also welcome the emphasis put on upgrading specialist skills, which will be part of the new institute's remit. About 97 per cent of small firms are experiencing serious recruitment difficulties, yet there are nearly 200,000 people unemployed. Two-thirds of companies state that the lack of basic skills, such as literacy, numeracy and inter-personal skills, are some of the main reasons they cannot fill vacancies.</P>
      <P>Ireland is in danger of falling behind many other European countries which have recognised the economic importance of further education and training. The Minister's initiative is, therefore, welcome, and I hope it will come to fruition in the development of such activity. The inability of industry to recruit people with technical skills is the biggest issue facing it. This applies even to small industries in the west, which, it is suggested, have not been developed to the extent they should be.</P>
      <P>The Minister said the new institute will initially accommodate 450 students. The Government is committed to providing student accommodation on campuses, yet the Minister failed to indicate if accommodation would be provided on the 60 acre campus. There is a housing crisis, especially for students. There will be pandemonium again next September because as soon as the CAO results are published the streets will be full of students seeking accommodation with the <i>Evening Herald</i> in one hand and a call card in the other. Some of the accommodation let by landlords amount to nothing more than glorified pigsties I experienced a number of them when I was a student.</P>
      <P>Given the increasing cost of accommodation throughout the country, especially in Dublin, the Minister must look seriously at the current level of the maintenance grant because it is unacceptable. It will not even pay for accommodation. If we are committed to tackling educational disadvantage we must ensure that students who may not have the same financial support as others receive a basic grant to cover the cost of accommodation, travel, etc. The Minister for Public Enterprise is to approve an increase in the cost of train fares, which is an additional cost that will need to be taken into account by students next September. The Minister is not shy about talking but, sadly, little action has been seen to date. I hope that he will comment on this in his reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister did not mention research in his contribution and I believe it to be crucial to any institute of technology. He referred to the liaison between industry and the institutes of technology but research did not enter the equation. It is important that there should be investment in research. Ireland has been notoriously bad at providing funding for research. We are extremely <Col N="592" /> lucky if 1 or 2 per cent of funding for research is provided and that is provided only by major indigenous and multinational companies. All industries need to realise, whether they employ five, 500 or 5,000 people, that they must invest in research if they are to keep up to date and remain competitive. I hope the Minister will address this issue also when he replies.</P>
    <P>Related to this issue are the postgraduate students who study for masters degrees and PhDs, especially in applied research. If one is lucky to get a place on a postgraduate course in a third level institution, one receives approximately £75 per week; one would be better off drawing the dole. FÁS is looking for 10,000 people abroad while postgraduates students are paid £75 per week. Unless we look seriously at this issue over the coming months there will be a serious problem over the next year or two which will be exacerbated because people will not get involved in postgraduate research. They will be attracted into industry because the money and other incentives are there for them to take up a job. If we are serious about developing third level institutions, research staff are needed and the backbone of research is postgraduate students who carry out a great deal of the donkey work. I hope the Minister will examine this issue. It is essential that postgraduate students carry out research but they will not continue to do so for the amount of money they receive.</P>
    <P>The Minister also said that state-of-the-art computers and electronic laboratories would be provided in Blanchardstown and I welcome that. It is crucial that such basic infrastructure is provided. However, he has failed to realise that there are serious problems in many institutes of technology in terms of the provision of computers, for example. He announced funding to provide additional computers but it is only a drop in the ocean.</P>
    <P>I spoke recently to a student attending an institute of technology in Dublin. He had to submit 20 projects during the academic year. He had access to a computer for two hours on one morning per week. It is unacceptable that a student should be expected to produce such a number of projects while only having access to a computer one morning per week. There were queues outside the computer room and unless he was outside it ten or 15 minutes before the time allotted to him, he would not have been able to use a computer. If information technology is to be developed and graduates with the required technological knowledge produced, basic facilities, such as computers, should be provided because in every walk of life they are important.</P>
    <P>The Minister also said that it will be a policy of the new institute of technology to encourage students from disadvantaged backgrounds to take up courses. The problem is that students from such backgrounds cannot enter third level unless they have a basic level of education. It is crucial that funding is provided to ensure these people have the required education. There is no point <Col N="593" /> bringing a student from a deprived area into an institute of technology unless it can be ensured that he can make his way through the system. It is also pointless to take 20 students from any disadvantaged area, enrol them in college only to have them fail at the end of the year. They will return home and no one else from their community will participate because they failed dismally and returned home hanging their heads in shame. Funding must be committed to the third level sector in order to ensure that these people survive the courses into which they enrol and pass with flying colours. It requires a great deal of commitment from the institution involved to ensure they pass through the system. They are as well off not to take them in as to do so and have them fail because the wrong message is sent out.</P>
    <P>In terms of ensuring that such students have good comprehension and a basic level of education before they enter third level I wish to raise the issue of the remedial service. The Minister announced a remedial service for every school but, sadly, that is only the case in name only because the service provided currently does not meet required standards. Remedial teachers teach in broom cupboards and hallways. If children are to be encouraged to take up remedial education, the last thing one wants to do is stigmatise them by putting them in hallways, where there are no radiators and the wind is blowing through the school. If we are serious about providing a remedial service the funding and facilities required must be provided.</P>
    <P>At yesterday's meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Science, a teacher outlined that she had six schools on her rota. There are 13 schools in County Roscommon which are covered by eight remedial teachers. It is unacceptable to consider that those students are provided with a remedial service. A teacher calls to the school but a service is not provided. The Minister is disingenuous when he says that he is providing a remedial service for every school. The wool is being pulled over the eyes of many parents and it will take them a while to realise what exactly is happening.</P>
    <P>Serious consideration needs to be given to the promotion of adult education in rural communities. Dublin has a myriad of vocational education committees, institutes of technology and universities, but that is not the case in rural areas. We need to look at innovative projects and projects that have been successful. We must work from the basic levels of literacy upwards. In County Tipperary a literacy programme operates through a local radio station. In County Roscommon a mobile computer training unit is run by Roscommon partnership in conjunction with the Leader company. People are queuing up to join these courses. Such initiatives should be encouraged and promoted. While such programmes are provided by vocational education committees access remains a problem.</P>
    <P>We need to develop a programme of adult education with specific education targets for disad<Col N="594" /> vantaged people. The Minister spoke yesterday about encouraging people from disadvantaged backgrounds to attend the institute at Blanchardstown. However, we are only talking about a small percentage because if people do not have a basic level of education they will not be able to take up those places and even if they do they will not have come through the system. One is as well off not bringing them in as doing something like that.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister on the facilities that will be available at Blanchardstown institute. Facilities in many third level colleges are poor. There is a great shortage of accommodation in UCC for lectures and tutorials. The Minister knows the Lough Rovers centre well. It is unacceptable to have to go there for lectures, particularly on a wet winter's morning. There is no heating in it and on many a morning I was drenched on the way there. While I welcome the facilities for the Blanchardstown institute it is unacceptable to talk about providing them all in one college while there is such a serious deficit in this regard in other colleges. Some students operate machinery that is 20 years out of date and students go into industry where they must use the most high-tech equipment. If we are serious about the liaison the Minister speaks of between industry and institutes of technology we must ensure that the standard of equipment is similar. While it will never be as up to date as that in industry, because we do not have that level of funding, a certain standard must be maintained.</P>
    <P>The campus at Blanchardstown comprises 60 acres. While that is fine, many other institutes of technology do not have sufficient room for expansion. In Athlone the buildings are on top of each other due to lack of space. We must look at the type of buildings erected and the layout of campuses. There is a shortage of building land around many institutes of technology, not just in Athlone and Galway. One way to solve the problem is for institutes to spread their wings. That was done successfully with the Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology where part of the campus is in Mayo. The same could be done with other institutes. For example, part of the institute in Athlone could be located in County Roscommon, which badly needs such a rejuvenation and an injection of young people. On a Monday morning young people leave the county to travel to the major centres of population for employment or education purposes. If we could keep a percentage of them in the county perhaps some of them might remain there and open their own businesses. Sadly there is a huge brain drain out of County Roscommon and other counties</P>
    <P>With regard to the drop-out rate which averages 20 to 25 per cent, I hope this new institute will enable us to break the cycle. It costs the Exchequer a phenomenal amount of money to pay a student's fees for the first year. We must examine this issue to ascertain whether we need to provide additional support or better guidance counselling at second level. Something must be <Col N="595" /> done because as matters stand money is going down the drain which could be better targeted towards those students.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House and ask the Minister to reply to the points I raised.</P>

      <P>The institute of technology in Blanchardstown is long overdue in what is a greatly expanding area in north-west Dublin. Some areas more than others in Blanchardstown have been seriously neglected for many years by successive Governments and the political and industrial establishments. As a result, serious problems have emerged in parts of Blanchardstown with which the local population is attempting to deal and live. The issue of educational disadvantage leading to long-term unemployment among a sector of the population is one of the problems that has arisen from the shameful neglect of areas of greater Blanchardstown, Finglas, which is also in north-west Dublin, and Clondalkin, which are within the catchment area of the new institute of technology. There is a need for special measures to rectify the damage that has been done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="596" /> The population of greater Blanchardstown was initially scheduled to reach 100,000 but, astonishingly, following decisions made by Fingal County Council in recent weeks on the rezoning of further land for housing, it will now reach at least 120,000. Therefore, it is obvious that a third level institute of technology is urgent and overdue. However, I demand special measures to assist local youth coming through second level education in greater Blanchardstown, Clondalkin and Finglas to avail in a real way of the new institute of technology. There must be structured intervention and an interaction from the beginning between the new college and the second level schools in the areas I outlined to target, from first year on, the interests of students who can set goals and be primed and assisted by programmes into third level education in the Institute of Technology, Blanchardstown.</P>
    <P>I also want definitive action to enable people who did not have the opportunity to avail of a proper second level education up to now to avail of this new facility. This would give them a new lease of life, and it means structured intervention in working-class communities to enable people in that position to recreate their lives and to give them a chance of an entirely new future. This will not happen by accident. The Minister promised it when he announced the opening of the facility and he referred to the fact that the level of participation in third level education there was among the lowest in north-west Dublin, including parts of greater Blanchardstown. This is to the shame of the major political parties which have dominated this country since the foundation of the State. They have presided over a situation that has left generations of working-class people behind as society moved forward. We must have definite intervention to ensure the wrong which was done against a section of the people is set right.</P>
    <P>I am not happy with the structures put in place for the governing body of the new institute. It is more of the same &ndash; instead of coming up with an imaginative new management structure to reflect the new realities and the type of targets that representatives like me talk about, in terms of real participation by the community, there is more of the same old, time-worn formulas. For example, six people will be appointed initially, three of whom will be members of local authorities.</P>
    <P>This gives me cause to be disheartened because there is potential for a continuation of the same old system of political hacks being appointed by the Minister of the day to the latest local facility which comes on stream. There is nothing about the qualifications the six people should have. Will they be members of a political party, the Government of the day in this case, who are appointed because they are on local authorities or because somebody owes them a political favour? This is a reprehensible way to approach this new third level institute. The people put into management should have qualifications. They should be up to <Col N="597" /> date on the needs in education and the demands that will be made on the institute.</P>
    <P>Another aspect is the lack of provision for input from the community in the management structure. It is extremely vague and if the Minister is serious about using the facility to allow second chance education for working-class people who have been forgotten by the system to date, there should be a real possibility and provision for the community to be represented on the board. People who have been forgotten and others who are active in the community should be represented on the board so there is a real knitting together of the institute of technology and the local community.</P>
    <P>I intend to keep a close eye on this aspect. The institute must not be an ivory tower which might as well be 1,000 miles from the people of Blanchardstown, Finglas and north Clondalkin. I want the fine words in the Minister's speech regarding openness and accessibility to be put into action. I want a real advance in an urgent sense and a change around in the participation rate in third level education by the people of north-west Dublin as a result of this facility.</P>
    <P>With regard to the subjects which will be offered, the institute will be a technological college. As such, it will be geared towards industries in the greater Blanchardstown area and other industries which are developing, particularly the new technological and computer operations. This is necessary and the students should be expertly equipped with the most modern technological education to enable them find employment and participate in the modern technological economy. However, it is vital that there is also a place for arts and literature in the syllabus of the new institute of technology.</P>
    <P>We must remember that the people who will attend the college are not primarily means of production. They should not be seen merely as cogs in the production wheel of the so-called Celtic tiger to enrich the profits of multinational companies and others which will employ them. They are humans and they have imaginations, sensitivities and feelings. I want a prominent place given to, for example, the study of literature, poetry and the arts as part of what must be a rounded education for the students. These courses should be made available to complement the technological aspects. It is incumbent on the Department to ensure that happens in the college.</P>
    <P>On the occasion of provision being made for Blanchardstown IT, it is appropriate to address the question of student accommodation. This has been shamefully neglected by successive Governments and, against the background of the housing crisis, people are paying a heavy price for this neglect. Student accommodation should be provided on every third level campus, including that at Blanchardstown. Students should have the right to decent, good quality accommodation at a price they can afford, but with the rack-renting landlordism which has taken over in the last three <Col N="598" /> to four years, they are put to the pin of their collars to afford somewhere to stay. This factor is keeping many potential students away from third level education. Conversely, by taking over thousands of units of accommodation, flats and houses, in this city and elsewhere, students are a big factor in allowing private landlords to rack-rent their properties. Workers are competing with students for accommodation because, scandalously, they are priced out of the house buying market and are at a huge disadvantage. Providing student accommodation would free up rented accommodation.</P>
    <P>There is a serious accommodation crisis in greater Blanchardstown and the position in the private rented sector is catastrophic &ndash; working people are being asked to pay up to £1,000 per month. If students will soon be competing with workers in greater Blanchardstown, the market will be so landlord-driven that it will be impossible for local people. I demand that student accommodation be provided with the IT, for the sake of the students and the people of Blanchardstown, particularly those dependent on private rented accommodation.</P>
    <P>Apart from the necessary measures to target schools and raise the sights of the community about who can benefit, the questions of accessibility and grant levels must be addressed. Many people are unable to afford college because grants are not adequate and many families in Blanchardstown are dependent on the income of their children when they reach working age. The pressure on young people in these circumstances is to get a job rather than to enter further education. Grant levels, therefore, must be increased greatly to provide a genuine living grant for students in this and every other third level facility. This is crucial in making third level education more accessible, especially to those who have lost out in the past.</P>
    <P>We must also address the transport issue. The institute will be located on Blanchardstown Road North. There is a terrible crisis in public and general transport in the greater Blanchardstown area at present and while a facility for an extra 1,000 people is extremely welcome it will greatly add to transport problems unless investment is provided to upgrade public transport, that is, providing proper train and bus services.</P>
    <P>We must take a holistic view of the institute. We cannot simply provide prefabs followed by the permanent building and set up the courses. The management, the Department and the Minister must take account of all aspects raised so that the facility can enhance the lives of the people of greater Blanchardstown and north-west Dublin. It can realise its potential but only if attention is paid to areas outside the strict definition of the courses to be provided.</P>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill but I hope it is not an indication of a piecemeal approach on the Minister's part to third level education, specifically the institutes of <Col N="599" /> technology. During the debate on the Qualifications (Education and Training) Bill, I expressed serious reservations about the ITs. This legislation will establish a new college, which I hope will be fully resourced and adequately staffed, but it is essential that the Minister carries out a root and branch review of the other ITs. Many of them are in terminal decline and I have evidence of this.</P>
      <P>The root of the problem is staffing. I ask the Minister to make the case urgently at Cabinet for the provision of resources to make permanent those staff currently in temporary or part-time positions. This has led to a decline in staff morale and a lack of continuity.</P>
      <P>A primary reason for the establishment of regional technical colleges was to provide technical training for students leaving second level and to prepare them for work. Many of the regional technical colleges, now ITs, were established in areas which needed high quality technical staff for the many industries which required such a labour force. However, if one asks students how long they have spent on placements in industry, they will ask what a placement is. In the vast majority of cases they have not had access to the technological industries which exist beside them. The ITs were established to provide a link between education and industry and if no such links exist the position must be reviewed urgently. That link only exists in exceptional circumstances at present. With temporary staff one will not have the links between industrial management and colleges, or various faculties within those colleges. Neither will one have a link between the student body and the college staff, as a new member of staff means a different emphasis on the information that lecturer communicates. He or she may also orient students in a different way towards industry.</P>
      <P>Students often leave a very sheltered home environment when they leave second level education. At third level, their study management is in disarray because it is not monitored and a high number of students drop out, as other Members said. If we were to analyse students who have dropped out of institutes of technology in particular, we would see that they have had very little access to counselling, guidance or job placement services.</P>
      <P>Few colleges have professionals readily accessible to the student body and those who are in place are either invisible or inaccessible. Students who are told to come for guidance often find that when they do, the professionals to whom they were directed are involved in the teaching process, which duplicates their work. When there is not a relationship between students, staff and industry, we have a recipe for a serious problem which will need urgent attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister of State, as a matter of urgency, to initiate a review of the entire structure and management of the institutes of tech<Col N="600" /> nology. We can then reclaim some of those institutions' glory days. I am not saying we have not had major successes in this area but there is a decline in the numbers of effective graduates from these institutions. It will be necessary to tackle this up front.</P>
    <P>Management in some institutions may have become less forward thinking and may not be reaching the high standards initially set. Some institutions may be more determined to dispense degrees and become universities rather than retaining the focus they had when first established. That said, I hope it is not too late to rescue these colleges. It is not all bad news.</P>
    <P>Many colleges have established tremendous records in certain disciplines. The Galway Institute of Technology has established a reputation that is second to none for hotel training and management. That is natural, given its situation in an area with high tourism activity. Letterkenny Institute of Technology also has a national reputation for marine and fishing specialisation. However, if these are the only ones that immediately come to mind, the others have lost their focus.</P>
    <P>It is important that the institutes of technology develop links with industry. This is not just for placement of students for work experience but to ensure that we find a way to tap the huge resources of industry for investment in the institutes. Many industries benefit enormously from the expertise of these institutes' graduates and have given nothing back. However, they would be willing to do so if approached. Some might find it unacceptable and suggest that if large companies became involved with the institutions there would be further dismantling in some areas but there must be a way to convince industrialists that there is a way for them to work in partnership with the institutes' authorities to resource them. There is a great need for facilities and machinery to be updated. This may be the only way to get resources. The Government has failed to adequately resource the institutions, provide full-time staff and raise morale. It is necessary to act in this matter quickly. Students who leave secondary education and enter these institutes with high expectations quickly become disillusioned and leave to get jobs. They may not be high flyers who are determined to stay in the education system but it is a pity that resources and facilities that benefited others have been denied them.</P>
    <P>We must find out why the drop out rate is so high. I believe the reason is that resources and manpower are not readily available to this sector. I would hate if, on the eve of an election, a Minister for Education yielded to a pressure group demanding an institute of technology for another area. In that way we will disperse the limited resources that are available.</P>

      <P>I support Deputy Rabbitte's Bill and I welcome the fact that the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, has agreed, on behalf of the Government, to support the legislation.</P>
      <P>Recent exposures of scandals in banks and other institutions have led to the need for legislation of this sort. It is difficult to believe that people did not know of the horrors which were being perpetrated against very young people in residential institutions but were afraid to speak out about them. Irish people have an abhorrence of being called a tell-tale or of informing on another. This stems from our history when we were, for 800 years, under the yoke of the British crown. We must not persist with the frame of mind which prevents us from reporting criminal activities which affect the health and safety of others or which pollute the environment. We must ensure that if an employee feels the need to make a complaint about his employer or co-worker, he will be protected. Deputy Rabbitte's legislation will do that.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Minister of State that parts of the Bill need to be re-examined. The list of those to whom a complaint may appropriately be made must be carefully drawn up. When Deputy Rabbitte's legislation was published a newspaper reported that complaints to Deputies and to the media would be covered by it but I see no reference to that in the Bill.</P>
      <P>The need to protect whistleblowers was recognised and legislated for in the United States in the 1970s and 1980s. Many of us remember the name of Karen Silkwood, a nuclear power station worker who saw that procedures in the power station where she worked were liable to cause great danger to the people of her area. Karen Silkwood succeeded in publishing evidence of this danger and subsequently died in an alleged car accident. A television programme was made about Frank Serpico who spoke out about the activities of corrupt police officers. These two cases led to changes in the law in the United States.</P>
      <P>When legislation to protect whistleblowers was being enacted in the United States, the US Congress said, &ldquo;the best source of information about what a company is actually doing or not doing is often its own employees and this amendment will ensure that an employee could provide such information without losing his job or otherwise suffering commercially from retribution&rdquo;. Deputy Rabbitte's legislation attempts to ensure that anyone who feels he must make a complaint about his employer will be protected from civil action by the employer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="602" /> We must include in this legislation the possibility of a public servant who has made a complaint about his employer being allowed to transfer to another Department or section. Legal protection may not be sufficient to prevent such an employee being discriminated against or suffering abuse from a superior if it is known that he or she has made a complaint.</P>
    <P>How many of us remember the name of Paul Van Buitenen, the EU official who leaked a report about corruption in the EU Commission? He was suspended for four months on half pay for breaking Commission rules by handing over information which led to the suspension of the entire EU Commission and highlighted enormous abuse of EU funds. Last November the European Court of Auditors laid bare mis-spending of £3 billion through fraud and mismanagement in the administration of the 1997 budget. If employees had felt they were protected, they might have reported at an earlier stage and may have prevented some of the misuse of EU funds. It was thought at the time that some of Mr. Van Buitenen's allegations could not possibly be true but the subsequent investigation showed that most, if not all, of what he said was true. His allegations included the awarding of contracts, involving great amounts of EU taxpayers' money, to members of Edith Cresson's family and to people with family links to staff in her Department. We must get over the sense that if we report wrongdoing we will be called cranks or tell-tales and we must make sure that people who report wrongdoing are protected.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to believe the people in the banking system were not deeply concerned at some of the actions they were obliged to take. I am quite sure that the internal auditor who reported wrongdoing bore the brunt of his superiors' criticism when he began to disclose information. It is difficult to imagine that some junior bank staff did not wish to make information available when the wrongdoing was in progress. The information was eventually given to the media but it is a sad state of affairs when an employee must give information to a journalist whom he knows will not reveal his source.</P>
    <P>People often come to public representatives with incomplete information about wrongdoing but will not reveal the full facts because they do not wish to be identified. Public representatives are often unable to stop wrongdoing for this reason. I recall a constituent speaking to me of a concern about a very young child in a household where the mother had died. Although I reported the complaint to a social worker, I did not have sufficient information to enable the social worker to deal with the case and it took more than two years for action to be taken and the child taken away from the source of danger. At the time, I felt that if somebody would give me the information something could be done, but they were afraid it would come back on them, that they would be prosecuted and would be accused of doing something they should not have done. It is <Col N="603" /> a sad state of affairs that children continue to suffer because of people's silence, although at times that silence may be understandable.</P>
    <P>I also want to raise the issue of contracts of employment. Today's Question Time with the Taoiseach was more like long statements with a very small period for asking questions. Contracts for people in public offices, such as PR people, political advisers or programme managers, often require them not to discuss their work with outsiders. I am not sure that Deputy Rabbitte's Bill affords any protection for somebody who is hired under such a contract which contains confidentiality clauses. They may be precluded from protection under this legislation and we should investigate this aspect on Committee Stage. Such a person may be the only one with access to knowledge about wrongdoing, but their contract may prevent them making the information available.</P>
    <P>With regard to qualifying information for disclosure, I note that in some instances the Bill is quite similar to the UK's Public Interest Disclosure Act which came into force in July 1998. There does not seem to be anything in Deputy Rabbitte's Bill which protects the discovery of privileged information between a lawyer and a client. It is important that such information should not be disclosed because we must protect client confidentiality. Information will have to come in a different way.</P>
    <P>Overall, I welcome the legislation and Fine Gael will support it. We will examine it closely on Committee Stage to make sure it is tightly drafted and does what Deputy Rabbitte seeks, which is to protect the civil and human rights of people who are willing and have the courage to bring forward information that will prevent criminal activity as well as protecting the environment, health, safety and perhaps the lives of individuals.</P>

      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Briscoe. The novel title of the Whistleblowers Protection Bill conjures up various images. Perhaps it would be better to consider the title of the UK legislation &ndash; the Public Interest Protection Act. The term &ldquo;whistleblower&rdquo; immediately puts the employee in the wrong and may achieve the opposite of the legislation's aim, which is to protect them. We are trying to give such employees credibility in a vulnerable situation, but by calling them whistleblowers we are automatically adding a connotation of their being somehow in the wrong. Perhaps Deputy Rabbitte could re-examine the title.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I welcome the concept of improving employees' conditions, either by direct or indirect action, I am disappointed that we have to discuss the need for such a Bill. In an ideal world workers should be automatically entitled to a positive working environment free from any form of harassment or intimidation. They should not be put in a position where they feel compromised by dubious practices. It is unfortunate that there is a <Col N="604" /> need, however qualified, for such protection. I trust that the vast majority of employers in the country are good and have no fear of this measure. On the whole, employers respect the practice of consulting and informing workers. Anyone who has ever interacted with employees, or colleagues, will know that one gets the best responses and results from an open consultative approach where people are treated as equal partners and information is not withheld from them.</P>
    <P>The Bill offers an opportunity for employees to blow the whistle on their employers by giving them protection to report to the appropriate authorities, including the Central Bank, the Revenue Commissioners, the Garda Síochána, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Health and Safety Authority. I presume, however, that the relevant Government authorities and the bodies listed in section 1 will have to be consulted so that their views will be taken into account before Committee Stage. The approach should be similar to last year's legislation protecting those who report child abuse, so that no one is excluded who might have an important bearing on the matter.</P>
    <P>If one is going to blow the whistle on employers about any dubious business practices, I agree with the Minister of State that safeguards must also be included to ensure the legislation does not become a stick for cranks to beat the establishment. One of the most important points that has been made in the debate is the need for the legislation to be balanced. On Committee Stage there will be opportunities to ensure that it is so balanced. The term &ldquo;crank's charter&rdquo; must never be applied to this Bill. As far as possible every effort must be made to ensure it is not used as a vehicle for dissatisfied employees to spread rumours or make false accusations against their employers for unfounded or personal reasons.</P>
    <P>We are all aware of cases where employers can be put under extreme pressure by baseless accusations. In examining the Bill, particular care will have to be taken to guard against such false information. Unfortunately, malicious people will go to extremes to ensure their message gets across. The Bill offers protection to employees who make certain disclosures reasonably and in good faith, but what constitutes &ldquo;reasonably and in good faith&rdquo;? We must closely examine what that phrase means. It does not appear to address the question of disgruntled employees or ex-employees who deliberately set out to cause bother with malicious intent.</P>
    <P>There are also cases where business clients have been let down and their faith in organisations has been undermined. It would seem that had employees felt safe to bring the matter to the attention of the appropriate bodies earlier, action could have taken place to avert the outcome. People in my constituency have lost their savings, but the discrepancies that caused this to happen were only recently discovered and brought to public attention. Such matters may have gone unnoticed in other institutions and organisations.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="605" /> It is reasonable to assume that employees would be fearful of losing their jobs and, therefore, protect themselves with a veil of silence. I hope, however, that the advent of this Bill will offer security to such employees, thereby offering a greater sense of confidence to those who deal with such establishments. Nobody in my constituency wants to see a similar situation arising. They do not want to have their sense of confidence diminished in establishments they have always looked up to and felt were solid and dependable. If this Bill offers people sufficient protection to enable them retain confidence in establishments, organisations and institutions, it will play a positive role in their lives.</P>
    <P>The consultation process with the social partners and other interested bodies is a key component of establishing a fair and balanced approach. This aspect of the matter will be dealt with on Committee Stage. We are all aware of the important role played by the social partners in every aspect of our lives and it would be, therefore, unfair and wrong to ignore their role in this legislation.</P>
    <P>It is also important that all aspects of unfair dismissal are brought under legislation. Given that some forms of dismissal are dealt with in the manner that one wins some and one loses some, it does not always encourage the genuine people to clear their name and have their position reinstated. I hope this Bill will ensure genuine people believe that there is something stronger to back them. As Deputy Owen said, we all know that constituents visiting our clinics who are the quietest and who do not fight their corner often have the most genuine cases and those who make the most noise often are not as genuine. I would like if this Bill enabled people with genuine cases to believe they are protected.</P>
    <P>Unfair dismissals legislation currently provides protection against unfair dismissal for certain employees if their dismissal results wholly or mainly from civil proceedings, whether actual, threatened or proposed, against the employer to which the employee is or will be party or in which the employee was or is likely to be a witness, and criminal proceedings against the employer, whether actual, threatened or proposed, in relation to which the employee has made, proposed or threatened to make a complaint or statement to the prosecuting authority or to any other authority connected with or involved in the prosecution of the proceedings in which the employee was or is likely to be a witness.</P>
    <P>Existing legislation affords protection to persons who report child abuse, and sections of this Bill will mirror the protections in that legislation. This Bill will protect persons who make reports in good faith and it will provide protection and an avenue of redress for employees against penalisation up to and including dismissal. It will cover all employees, including agency workers, with no minimum service requirement, which is very important. It will also include those at present <Col N="606" /> excluded from the provisions of the unfair dismissals legislation.</P>
    <P>I question the use of the word &ldquo;whistleblowers&rdquo; in the title, although that word easily identifies such people. At present employees who are whistleblowers are penalised short of dismissal. They are limited in the action they can take. That position is not fair and it must be addressed. Under the Industrial Relations Act, 1969, it is open to employees to refer their disputes with their employers to a rights commissioner. An employer cannot be, however, compelled to attend and an employee may then refer the matter to the Labour Court under section 20(1) of the same Act. The employee must agree, however, to be bound by the findings of the court, which may not be legally enforceable. Irrespective of how we view the situation, it is not ideal at present; the rights of the employee need to be considered.</P>
    <P>All employers and employees have a right to their good name. It is important that our constitutional rights in this area are upheld. Article 40.3.2º of the Constitution states that &ldquo;The State shall, in particular, by its laws protect as best it may from unjust attack and, in the case of injustice done, vindicate the life, person, good name and property rights of every citizen.&rdquo;  The Supreme Court held that the State has a duty under this Article by its laws to prevent infringement of personal rights. We must ensure that employers and employees can work free from harassment, intimidation or any situation that may cause a person to feel they are being compromised.</P>
    <P>While we are dealing with legislation to ensure that employees will have the right to work free from the threat of harassment from their employers, people &ndash; I refer particularly to my constituency &ndash; must have the right to work. I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, to inform the Tánaiste and his fellow Ministers that people have the right to work in places like Inishowen and Donegal. The right to work has implications in terms of job creation. More and more companies are closing in places where they should not be closing. Our area is very accessible and we have a great labour force. This Bill should address the rights of employees and it should also ensure people have access to employment in their areas.</P>
    <P>The IDA announced its 1998 report today, which shows &ndash; 2.5 per cent change in employment by region for the north-west region. We want to take on board this Bill and to ensure employees have the protection provided in it, but we also want to ensure jobs are created.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and congratulate Deputy Rabbitte on introducing it, although he might reconsider its title. I assume there will be maximum consultation with the social partners and the Government agencies to establish who will and will not be included in it. I hope all reasonable and good employees will have nothing to fear under this Bill. It should ensure that all employees have a basis and strength to move for<Col N="607" /> ward confidently and to be able to assert their right to work in a free and harmonious environment. That happens in the majority of cases at present, but we must protect the minority who may be at risk.</P>

      <P>Column 1181 of the Official Report of 13 May 1999 indicates that the Minister for Education and Science made the following statement on abuses taking place in industrial schools:</P>
      <P>On 28 February 1968 most of the members of the committee visited Daingean Reformatory School. Their impression of it was of a dismal place which should be closed as soon as possible. In the course of their discussions with the manager he was asked about the corporal punishment procedures. According to the account on file, &ldquo;He replied openly and without embarrassment that ordinarily the boys were called out of the dormitories after they had retired and that they were punished on one of the stairway landings.&rdquo;  The manager was asked if the boys were stripped and he replied that at times they were. &ldquo;Some other committee member asked why he allowed boys to be stripped naked for punishment and he replied, in a matter of fact manner, that he considered punishment to be more humiliating when it was administered in that way.&rdquo;  That is a direct extract from the file.</P>
      <P>District Justice Kennedy wrote to the Department of Education on this and other matters and received a reply which dealt with everything but the punishment. While giving assurances about the closure of Daingean, assurance about the punishments stopping seem, only to have been as a result of significant disputes, the exact details of which do not seem to be documented. The exception to this is an April 1970 letter from the Secretary of the then Department of Justice to the Secretary of the then Department of Education. The Secretary of the then Department of Justice wrote that the official of his Department who was a member of the committee had signed the report on the basis of assurance which their Department had received that the Daingean punishments would be stopped.</P>
      <P>He wrote:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To sign a report which made no reference to the situation about punishment in Daingean would, in the absence of evidence that the practice had ceased, be to appear to acquiesce in a practice which is indefensible and for the continuance of which the Minister for Justice could not avoid some official responsibility arising out of his having registered Daingean as a suit<Col N="608" /> able place of detention under the Children Acts.</P>
    <P>His next comment reveals much about the approach to abuse even of concerned people:</P>
    <P>On the other hand, to make any reference, however oblique, to this particular method of punishment in Daingean would be likely to lead to a disclosure of the situation and, in this way, to cause a grave public scandal.</P>
    <P>The Minister continued:</P>
    <P>This episode demonstrates, I believe, the need for everything to come out in the open. I have no doubt that there are many other such incidents in official records and that official neglect and ignorance was commonplace.</P>
    <P>The issue here is the net moral point &ndash; what was in the public interest? Was it in the public interest that the inhuman abuse of children in the care of the State &ndash; which shocked people even then &ndash; should be made known to the public and stopped? That is not what is referred to as the basis of a grave moral scandal in the correspondence between two secretaries of Departments. What is referred to in this communication is the fact that it might come out and cause a grave public scandal.</P>
    <P>Thankfully we have moved on to a time when there is freedom of information legislation, in the introduction of which my former colleague, Eithne Fitzgerald and the then Government, with the support of all sides of the House, played a leading role. It is in the context of that legislation that Deputy Rabbitte's Bill is proposed. It strikes a balance, leaving aside the cultural ethos which said that if we did not know about it, we might be better not knowing about it. I hesitate to say it, although I am afraid I must, but many of those who drew attention to terrible abuses in that awful system were referred to as cranks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>There will always be people who will want to draw attention to terrible abuse, whether in public or private and they will always be dismissed as cranks. However, Deputy Rabbitte's Bill explicitly cites the grounds on which disclosures should be made. He quoted the English Law Lord, Lord Wilberforce and said of the Bill:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Its purpose is to provide protection from civil liability to employees who make disclosures in categories listed in the Bill, so long as those disclosures are made &ldquo;reasonably and in good faith&rdquo;. I stress those words and reiterate that I am not advocating a free for all for rogues or malcontents in our business and commercial world, still less in the public services...Many Members will agree with the views of the English Law Lord, Lord Wilberforce, expressed in a case involving British Steel and Granada Television. He pointed out that <Col N="609" />&ldquo;there is a wide difference between what is interesting to the public and what is in the public interest to be made known&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I agree with Lord Wilberforce because there is a huge distinction between taking both the spirit and letter of freedom of information legislation, including this legislation, and making it work in the public interest and a kind of voyeurism that seeks to find information on someone's public or private life on the basis that it was not known before, and for that reason and that reason only must be put into the realm of sensational comment. That is a responsibility which falls on those who use the legislation and those who operate it. However, it cannot be used as an excuse for obstructing this legislation.</P>
    <P>It is accepted on all sides of the House that in one area of life after another, and right across the State system, it is important that we proceed to complete the process of accountability and openness in public office. To stop that process would be something for which the public would not forgive us. It must be extended and the procedures put in place. After that, the public must support the balance restored between the ethics required in public life and the right to privacy and one's good name to which those in public life are as entitled as any other citizen. It is important to bear that in mind.</P>
    <P>The balance has been struck correctly in this legislation. I will not refer to recent publications, but there is a huge distinction as regards the voyeuristic pursuit of the detail of a person's private life, which is only of incidental interest to those who want to shift their gaze away from matters where public accountability is correctly required and insisted upon.</P>
    <P>It is welcome that the Government parties are willing to lend their support to this legislation which I am also pleased to support. Those who might be worried about this legislation must consider that if, so long ago, there had not been such a requirement to hide matters and keep them away from the public gaze, how many abuses would have been prevented and how many lives would not have been scarred? Would it not have been much better if at that time the civil servant involved could have, although under terrible pressure, gone to the Secretary of the Department and said &ldquo;I know you will want to make this known to your Minister and publicly&rdquo; instead of exchanging correspondence which suggested &ldquo;we must make sure this does not come out&rdquo;? We are in a different era now and this legislation is of that era.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the publication of this Bill which, when enacted, will help end the culture of secrecy which has permeated much of business and public affairs for far too long. I also welcome the decision of the Government to accept the Bill on Second Stage. I am sure there is not a Deputy in this House who has not at some stage in his or her political life been approached by an individual with information of wrongdoing <Col N="610" /> in the public or private sector, only to be told by the informant not to use the information or his name because if it gets out it will cost him his job. The enactment of this Bill will at least allow people who are approached in this way to be assured the person coming forward cannot be punished by an employer for acting in the public interest.</P>
      <P>The Bill will ensure that any employee who blows the whistle on illegality, fraud or malpractice will be entitled to protection against dismissal or any other sanction an employer may wish to impose. There have been many instances in public life where society would have benefited if people who must have known of wrongdoing had come forward and notified the authorities. My colleague, Deputy Michael D. Higgins, pointed out how difficult it was in cases of child abuse, which are most serious and most deserving of intervention and courage as regards reporting, for good people to come forward and for people in public positions to take action.</P>
      <P>Many Irish women may have avoided unspeakable suffering and, in some cases, premature death had some of the employees of the blood bank been able to speak out against the poor standards which led to the hepatitis C scandal. It is a matter of record that employees of the beef industry approached Deputies with certain information, although in some cases Deputies could only put that information to limited use because of the fear of endangering the livelihoods of those who had come forward. There have been many instances where it has been difficult, if not impossible, for people to come forward in such situations. This legislation will change that.</P>
      <P>There must have been people in the planning system who were aware of the irregularities which are now being highlighted by the Flood tribunal. Perhaps they might have come forward with information, which would have avoided a costly tribunal, if the protection afforded by the Bill had been available in 1989. There must also have been people in the banking and commercial sectors who, while not directly involved, knew of the extraordinary arrangements made to finance the lavish lifestyle of the former Taoiseach, Charles Haughey. Perhaps if the protection of this Bill had been available to them they might have come forward with information and saved politics from the corrupting influence of that golden circle of Mr. Haughey's cronies. There is no doubt that some people in the financial services sector were aware of the extraordinary lengths to which certain banks went to facilitate tax evasion through, for example, the opening of offshore accounts. Would they have come forward, and saved the State the loss of hundreds of millions of pounds in tax revenue, had the protection afforded by this Bill been in place?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is to encourage a culture of compliance with the law and with the highest possible standards in all walks of life. Its purpose is to move away from a culture where those who highlight illegalities or irregularities <Col N="611" /> are seen as informers to one where they are recognised as civic spirited citizens. The Bill will change that culture because it will create an atmosphere where, even if no complaints are made, there is a feeling that a complaint could be made. That will put employers on their guard.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated in his response last night that he will be consulting with the social partners. He will probably receive some opposition from employers' representatives. However, I hope he will resist that opposition because it is in the public interest that those safeguards are present to create that culture in companies. Given the enormous amount of money which is to be made in property development and construction because of the housing crisis, it is particularly important to have that culture in that area, so that there are safeguards for employees who highlight wrongdoing and the cutting of legal corners and bring it to the attention of the proper authorities.</P>
    <P>This Bill can be seen as another part of the package of legislation, introduced largely by the Labour Party, which is designed to promote the highest possible standards in public life. The package includes the Freedom of Information Act, which has given the public unprecedented rights of access to official files and documents; the Electoral Act, which placed limits on the amounts candidates and parties can spend on election campaigns and set strict standards in regard to the disclosure of donations to political parties; and the Ethics in Public Office Act, which, for the first time, placed obligations on Ministers, Deputies and those working within the political system to make public declarations in regard to donations they receive or interests which could conflict with their public duties. It was ground-breaking legislation but, as we have seen from recent events, it is still not being fully complied with.</P>
    <P>I found it astonishing to hear the Taoiseach this afternoon dismiss as an administrative oversight his failure to comply with the clear obligations placed on him under section 19 of the Ethics in Public Office Act. This is the sort of feeble excuse put forward by people who fail to make proper tax returns. This is, after all, the same Taoiseach who is constantly talking about introducing new codes of conduct, tougher legislation regarding ethical matters and so on. Surely, before introducing any new measures, the first thing he should do is to ensure that everyone, particularly himself, is complying with the existing requirements and obligations.</P>
    <P>I found it even more astonishing to hear the Taoiseach's account of the so-called investigation he initiated when the matter of a conflict of interest involving his closest political adviser was brought to his attention by the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, following representations to her by Deputy Dukes. This is clearly a matter of enormous importance, given the role of Dillon Consultants as advisers to NTL, a firm that was being allowed to acquire a prized State asset with a value of more than £500 million. Yet the Taoi<Col N="612" /> seach's inquiries seem to have been about as probing and effective as the one he initiated when serious allegations were made about the former Deputy Ray Burke, when he asked, &ldquo;Anything bothering you, Ray?&rdquo;. Despite the importance of the matter being drawn to his attention, he simply asked Mr. Duffy if he was a director of Dillon's. He took no steps to verify Mr. Duffy's denial, yet a simple telephone call to Dillon's by any member of his staff would have confirmed that Mr. Duffy was not being truthful. The Taoiseach must accept responsibility for his failure to comply with his legal obligations and for the consequences of appointing someone to such a key position whose judgment has been shown to be flawed and who was, at best, casual with the truth.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach's performance in the Dáil this afternoon seemed to reflect a resentment of the Opposition even raising these matters. We are now living in a different political climate, where everyone is accountable. The Taoiseach will have to get used to it because, whenever we have evidence of questionable activities by him or anyone in his employ, the Labour Party will demand answers and will not be silenced.</P>
    <P>I listened with interest to the debate last night and I welcome the generally constructive approach of both Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael Members. A number of speakers raised concerns about frivolous or vexatious matters being raised under the protection of this Bill, both last night and this evening. I suspect these comments may have been designed to disguise a more general unease with the sort of principles the Bill is promoting. In any event, I believe these concerns are groundless as there are protections built into the legislation to prevent it being misused or abused.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, the preventive aspect of the Bill &ndash; the fact that it changes the culture &ndash; will, in itself, achieve a great deal, perhaps without people having to report anything. That aspect will make a very big difference to people's approach when they see something being done in their places of employment which they feel is not in accordance with the law. The Bill does not just cover those aspects, it also covers other important areas such as health and safety and the environment. If someone feels what is happening in their place of employment will endanger people's lives or the environment they can come forward without being punished.</P>
    <P>All these aspects of the Bill are important. I welcome the Government's decision to allow the Bill to go to Committee Stage. Any concerns can be raised at that stage. I commend my colleague, Deputy Rabbitte, for introducing the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak on this Bill, which I support for the very good reasons outlined by its proposers last night. I also acknowledge the Government's acceptance of the Bill and its principles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill contains sufficient protection for employees with genuine grievances or those with access to information which gives them cause for <Col N="613" /> concern about the operation of their place of employment. It is understandable that people working in such sensitive positions may feel that if they do not disclose such information they may later find themselves in an embarrassing difficulty. It is in the public interest that that be known.</P>
    <P>The Bill also contains sufficient safeguards to prevent vexatious, frivolous or mischievous reports being made in an attempt to get even with someone. Such people will not receive the protection of the Bill and they make such reports at their own risk. The existence of that risk will protect those who are going about their business in the normal way. It is important to have such a section in the Bill in order to protect the legislation's integrity; otherwise, it could become the instrument of groups or individuals whose only purpose is sensationalism. The previous speakers made some interesting comments. Deputy Michael D. Higgins referred to a number of issues that take us back a few years. It is interesting if we project our minds forward and ask ourselves will it have the desired effect, I certainly hope it will, but Deputy Michael D. Higgins also noted that people who raised so-called sensitive issues in the past were deemed to be dangerous cranks. Anybody who has anything to do with institutions, for example, in a visiting capacity, will know of what I speak. When it was suggested that such places would be closed, there was a fearful outcry that the economic viability of the region would be permanently interfered with and that no such measures should be taken. It was purported that those who raised questions on the activities in these institutions were in some way subversives.</P>
    <P>I can remember debates in the mid-1980s when the then Minister for Health introduced legislation in respect of some institutions there were deputations to health boards and local authorities from local interest groups and well meaning people who had at their disposal clear knowledge that things were not in accordance with what is intended in such places. The public outcry was that the<i> status quo</i> might be affected and somebody's turf might be invaded. We also saw where well meaning delegations met the various institutions and pointed out all the very good reasons that nobody should interfere. Public meetings were called at which hundreds attended and it was suggested that the interference of the then Government was not in the interests of the general public and the people of the area. There were countless occasions in the past 20 years when well meaning people deliberately brought to public attention evidence of wrongdoing, but nothing happened for the simple reason that it was presumed that the person drawing attention to the wrongdoing was a crank. I hope when well-founded information is brought to the attention of the responsible authorities, action will be taken, otherwise people will say that they did not know it was happening, that they had insufficient evidence to deal with it or they did not want to <Col N="614" /> do anything about it even though they knew the matter had been raised.</P>
    <P>I can guarantee that in future the general attitude will be that we did not feel we should do something about it and consequently we did nothing about it. Let us ponder on the issues that affected the lives of many people 25 years ago and ask ourselves did we know about it? There are issues that the dogs in the street knew about, yet everybody is astounded that things were going on that were not in accordance with good practice. People will say now that they would have condemned it if they knew it had been happening, but that is not what happened.</P>
    <P>This legislation is necessary. If it is used in the spirit intended, it will be effective. General public attitudes can be measured by the turnout in the recent elections. I saw where a scribe saw it fit to justify the low turnout on the basis that it was the thing to do. If that is the case, there is no sense in having legislation on any subject. If that cynicism is allowed to prevail or go unchallenged, we are wasting our time. Unfortunately it is likely that the cynical response to which I have referred will become the norm and people will only respond in that fashion. Consequently this will damage institutions and the quality of life in this country. We have a responsibility in relation to the matter within the ambit of this Bill. It will be no defence to say &ldquo;It was not the right thing to do at the time&rdquo; or &ldquo;I could not do it because I did not have protection&rdquo;. It will not be sufficient for the scribes to say we knew about it and made an oblique reference to it, but it was not the political thing to do at the time. It will not be sufficient for the general public to say we knew about it but we did not respond. Everybody has a role to play in this arena. I hope the proposed legislation will put in place the necessary measures to ensure this House plays its role. It is up to those who are in a position to respond outside this House, including the scribes, to do their job.</P>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate and thank Deputy Michael D. Higgins for sharing his time with me. I congratulate Deputy Rabbitte on bringing this Bill forward. I feel angry when I think of the many examples which we know about and which when they flash across our memory we ask why somebody did not say or do something to protect those who were so obviously abused, particularly in the workforce.</P>
      <P>Deputy Rabbitte has made a list of regulatory authorities, but I would have preferred if the Bill provided for a single authority to regulate complaints in so far as it would give greater focus to the threads of the Bill, to highlight the injustices that have been inflicted on so many people. Members know people whose lives have been destroyed because they had no protection and felt isolated on occasions in the past. For that reason Deputy Rabbitte is to be congratulated on bringing forward this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="615" /> If trust and openness was the main thrust of the workplace, this Bill would not be necessary, but alas they are not present in many workplaces. I cringe when I think of the horrific experiences related by so many workers who were intimidated to such an extent that their lives were shortened by their experiences.</P>
    <P>Mining companies established themselves in the early 1960s and prospered throughout the 1970s before closing their doors on the communities such as happenned in Tynagh in County Galway. Northgate Exploration Company must go down as the most monstrous employer in Ireland ever. I am being charitable to it when I say that. That company was responsible for scarring the environment. The results of that still affect east Galway.</P>
    <P>The company was untouchable in its day. No organisation could go after it for recompense for its treatment of the environment or the workers of the area. It threw poison into the earth. It did not care what water flow it entered. One of the processes it carried out involved the use of cyanide. That was done without planning because the company came at a time when we encouraged multinationals to come to the State and there were no regulations to curtail their activities.</P>
    <P>Northgate Exploration then abandoned the site. Deputy Michael Higgins was a member of Galway County Council when we tried to put a package in place which asked it to rehabilitate the site. It withdrew from agreeing such a package, giving two fingers to the local authority which tried to draw it back.</P>
    <P>Many workers will say that if they had opened their mouths about some of the activities going on there, they would have been fired. Various organisations in the area were seriously affected. Farming organisations with land adjacent to the site found that poisonous dust was blowing over the lands and cattle were dying. Farmers lost their income as a direct result. The strongest organisation in the State, the IFA, was intimidated by the company into withdrawing and pretending nothing was happening. The company saw that farmers' livelihoods were being affected but because of its size and determination, it could steamroll away from it without accepting responsibility.</P>
    <P>I tried to bring An Taisce into the matter as a last resort to highlight the terrible damage the company was inflicting on the environment but it had to withdraw as a result of blatant intimidation. It threatened that it would annihilate An Taisce if it crossed the company.</P>
    <P>There is another example which makes me very angry, that of a female teacher in County Wexford who, because she had an affair with a married man, was sacked by a religious congregation. The case was taken to the highest court in the land and it upheld that what she did was wrong because it affected the religious ethos of the environment in which she worked. I wonder <Col N="616" /> would that still happen in such a situation today. Would such a person have any protection under law in this State? That person's life and the lives of her extended family have been destroyed. Despite the fact that she was a colleague in my union, we were helpless to do anything.</P>
    <P>If this Bill is to do anything, I hope it will rid this State of such examples and people suffering as a consequence. I congratulate Deputy Rabbitte for introducing it. The Hanrahan family was pushed to the extreme by a multinational because of its insistence that it was right. They were the whistle blowers but it fell on deaf ears. How many more examples of this are there? I hope that those who feel they are muzzled in their places of work can now come forward and say that enough is enough and will have an opportunity to present their case and bring to justice those who have perpetrated such injustices on individuals and families.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Deputy Rabbitte for bringing this Bill before the Dáil. As a Mayo man he got his wish a few weeks ago to wear the green and red but he let us down and did not turn out on the day. We will forgive him that. He had the best interests of the State at heart when he brought this Bill before the Dáil.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ulick Burke mentioned the mining companies. One such company came to my county and ran a road up through Croagh Patrick. Big business talked and got the licences. I believe the licences are being requested again. I hope the Government will be more careful when dealing with such licences on this occasion.</P>
      <P>I wish this Bill could cover the past 20 years. It could perhaps cover the 14 or 15 inquiries going on now. If the Garda Síochána and previous Governments had done their jobs, there would be up to 300 investigations ongoing in this State. There would be an investigation for instance into how people could get IDA land, paid for by the taxpayer and build a small factory, close it after 12 months, reopen it 12 months later, sell it off and build houses or hotels on the land.</P>
      <P>That is still going on. My council in recent years has sold industrial sites supposedly for young people starting out in life. What happened? Of the 15 or 20 purchasers, there were five or six genuine buyers and the rest of the land was bought by investors, the money merchants &ndash; those who got money from the IDA in the past. Every time they wanted to upgrade their factory or machines, they would threaten the IDA that they would close and more taxpayers' money was thrown to them. They live in big mansions, drive around in BMWs and close the factory doors after a few years.</P>
      <P>Where were the workers? The workers used to tell us, politicians, and the IDA, that this was going on. What was done about it? A blind eye was turned to it. I welcome this Bill and I hope it goes further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the workers will speak out about another sector in society. I am talking about a <Col N="617" /> new craze that has developed in recent years. I hold regular clinics and speak with people when travelling throughout my constituency and during the recent election campaign I was delighted to meet people on the doorsteps. Many people asked if I would do something about the scanners used in supermarkets. If the price of an item is £1.25, £1.75 or £1.85, housewives discover when they go home it is £11.85. If that lady stole £10 from that supermarket the Garda would be called, she would be taken to the Garda station and charged. If she was unlucky to appear before a judge in Dublin or in the west she may be sentenced to a month in prison. I have asked repeatedly the following question, what is the penalty if Tesco, Dunnes or any of the multiples make mistakes on a regular basis? This does not happen once, twice, three times or four times. If those stores are not caught and the housewife does not seek a refund they are rewarded, they have stolen the money out of that lady's pocket. If they are caught they say they are very sorry and that this should not happen.</P>
    <P>Legislation should be introduced and if Tesco, Dunnes or any other company is found operating a faulty scanner on a regular basis they should be prosecuted in the same way as a lady who steals a pound of butter. What is wrong is that there is one law for the rich and another law for the poor. The rich are rewarded while the poor are penalised or sent to prison.</P>
    <P>When this Bill is enacted I hope the people who are making the reports will have the same protection as the employers. There is no point in having a law for one group and no law for the other.</P>
    <P>For years, many people knew what was happening but the relevant laws were not enforced. We are great for passing legislation but the problem is that there is nobody to implement it. The same applies in regard to the legislation dealing with safety, health and welfare at work. When I encountered a problem in my own town some months ago I discovered that there is no safety officer in County Mayo; the nearest one is in Galway or Sligo. It is pointless passing legislation if it cannot be implemented. If this legislation is to be enacted&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, and others on this side have listened with interest to the comments made by Deputies and these will be taken into account in the examination of the Bill and the preparation of amendments for Committee Stage. It is clear that many <Col N="618" /> of the provisions of the Bill will need more in-depth examination.</P>
      <P>In his opening speech Deputy Rabbitte recalled the Freedom of Information Act which came into force over a year ago. This was the most far-reaching legislation as regards dealing with the public sector and marked an important first step towards a new era of openness in Government and in public affairs. This Bill contributes further to the culture of openness and transparency. It is an important addition to the protective labour legislation already in place. Most employees will think twice before bringing their employers to book if they detect some serious fraud or malpractice at work. Employment contracts are frequently drawn up so that an employee is required to have a duty of confidentiality to their employer. Exposing such fraud or malpractice takes courage and they are putting their jobs at risk. Such actions would not be taken lightly by conscientious employees and such employees must be protected if they expose wrongdoing.</P>
      <P>However, while the Government supports the Bill in principle, care must be taken as the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, said to ensure this does not become a crank's charter. Employers must be protected from malicious allegations which might be made by disgruntled employees. False accusations can damage both the business and the employment relationships in the workplace. Good employers, however, who have an open and transparent relationship with their workers need have no fear of the implementation of the measures envisaged in this Bill. While the employee's rights must be protected the personal rights of the employer must also be protected from unsubstantiated attack.</P>
      <P>In examining the Bill further care will be needed to guard against the possibility of false information being given maliciously in the context of the proposed protection of the Bill. While the Bill offers protection to all employees who make certain disclosures, reasonably and in good faith, the question of dealing with those who deliberately and with malicious intent provide false information about their employer to any or all of the regulatory authorities must be borne in mind at all times.</P>
      <P>The Bill also allows for disclosures of an exceptionally serious nature to be made to some other person. This provision needs to be examined in more detail. Safeguards must be put in place to ensure this protection is not abused. The Bill lists a wide range of regulatory bodies to which disclosures may be made. These include the Central Bank, the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Public Offices Commission and the Revenue Commissioners, all of which come under the aegis of my Department. The Bill will have major implications for these bodies and consequently my Department as well as other Government Departments will need to examine its provisions thoroughly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question as to which officers in a public body are appropriate officers under the Bill or <Col N="619" /> whether appropriate officers must be designated as such for the purpose of the Bill will need to be considered. Section 4 provides protection for an employee from civil liability for having made a protected disclosure. This provision must be examined to ensure it provides full civil protection for an employee while ensuring that this statutory immunity will not change in any way the defences already available to persons under common law.</P>
    <P>I also note there is no provision in the Bill for a statute of limitations. This is a matter which will have to be addressed. I do not think the stringent provisions of the Bill could be applied retrospectively without any regard to time limitation. We also must examine the provision regarding the persons to whom protected disclosures may be made. This issue will have to be discussed in detail with the chief regulatory bodies concerned. Consultations will also be necessary with the relevant Government Departments, the parliamentary draftsman's office and the social partners.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to the maximum co-operation on this Bill to ensure we have the best possible legislation on this important issue. We look forward to an interesting and lively debate on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all the Deputies who contributed to the debate on this Bill. In particular I thank the Government and the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, for agreeing to permit the Bill to proceed to Committee Stage. That is the correct decision and I acknowledge the Minister of State's generosity in facilitating that.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to the main points raised by the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, some of which were repeated by the Minister of State, Deputy Cullen. It is fair to say no major points have been raised on the Government side. I know civil servants do not like to have major items of legislation sprung on them and therefore tend to protect themselves in terms of the language used. Having read the Minister of State's script again today, it is extremely cautious but it does not say what are the major problems. I have no difficulty with his view that various provisions will have to be closely examined on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>The Minister said there must be provision for consultation with the social partners and allowance must be made for consultation with the various regulatory authorities listed in the Bill. I accept that. It is desirable that there should be consultation with the social partners. It would also be desirable if they were to agree to enshrine in a code of conduct the principle of the Bill and to implement it at the place of work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I see no reason the Bill should not have the allegiance of both sides of industry. Reference was made to this by Deputy Stanton and others. Deputy O'Flynn expressed concern about the terrible wrong that might be done to employers. I accept his remarks in the spirit in which they were offered. They appear to have been made with <i>The <Col N="620" />Examiner</i> and the ISME members in Cork in mind. The Deputy can advise them he told me what they would or would not accept and that while the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Tom Kitt, might have accepted the Bill, it was emasculated by the Deputy's intervention and was no longer the kind of legislation that would bring employers in Cork to their knees, and that on that basis the Deputy should be re-elected. That approach is fair enough.</P>
    <P>However, the Government side has yet to point out where the Bill is a crank's charter. The Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Cullen, mentioned the phrase again tonight. The Bill expressly provides that such people do not have the protection of the legislation. If people are blowing the whistle for vengeful, malicious reasons or for personal gain they take the consequences. Given the disclaimer, they cannot fall back on the protection of the legislation. I do not know what is contemplated by the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment in elaborating on that point and I accept and appreciate, in the spirit in which it is offered, his gesture that his officials and I maintain optimum contact on the progress of the Bill on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The Bill does no more than put the original decision in the case of Gartside <i>v. </i>Outram on a statutory footing and provides the employee who acts in the civic and public interest with the cloak of protection. It takes every care to ensure it is not a crank's charter and that it is only the publicly minded and civic purpose that attracts the protection proposed. Furthermore, the real blackmailers would be companies that deliberately damage or neglect the environment. Deputy Ulick Burke provided an excellent example in the case of the activities of Northgate at Tynagh, County Galway. I suspect the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Kitt, is familiar with the case. I and my colleague, Deputy Michael D. Higgins, are familiar with it. I dealt with the workers concerned in the late 1970s. It is extraordinary that any company can do what has been done at Tynagh, where the land has been poisoned, cattle and sheep cannot graze on it and the health and safety record, referred to by Deputy Ring, is even worse than that of the building industry.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, rightly said we must consult with, for example, the Health and Safety Authority. However, the mining and building industries must be mentioned. Huge profits are being made in the building industry and corners are being cut. There were twice the number of fatalities in the industry in 1998 as in the previous year. In that situation workers know what is going on and they ought to be protected when they bring the cutting of corners to the attention of the relevant authority.</P>
    <P>What is the answer to the question raised by my colleague, Deputy O'Sullivan, regarding the Blood Transfusion Service Board? Is it credible <Col N="621" /> that over all those years nobody in the service knew or suspected what was going on? The cost of various ongoing inquiries has arisen because nobody shouted. Despite the human cost of the problems in the Blood Transfusion Service Board, nobody spoke about what was happening. Workers are fearful for their careers and livelihoods and the implications in terms of raising their families if they raise matters. That is why this protection is necessary.</P>
    <P>Deputy Michael D. Higgins raised the question of the Daingean Reformatory, which is another vivid example. The kind of macabre punishment imposed there could not be inflicted on young children without right-minded people knowing it was going on, yet nobody came forward. Last night I paid tribute to the legislation sponsored by Deputy Shatter in this regard.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ulick Burke's reference to the Northgate example at Tynagh, County Galway, has left a permanent, ugly and poisonous sore on the landscape in east County Galway, yet nobody was able to shout stop. Deputy Conor Lenihan dealt with the question of beef. I recall his party colleagues taunting me in this House to say who told me about massive tax evasion in the Goodman organisation. I could not respond because the people concerned who presented that information to me would have been fired.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Or worse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Or worse. That is the plight of the whistle blower in international experience. Across the US and in Britain where whistle blowers have exposed wrongdoing, for conscientious reasons or whatever, they may have been ultimately vindicated, but at a terrible cost to themselves and their families.</P>
      <P>The record of the House will show that the outcome of the Hoffmann Liroche case was not as Deputy Conor Lenihan indicated. The law enforcement agencies of the Swiss Government supported the business organisation to the extent that the whistle blower, Stanley Adams, the first widely known whistle blower of the European Union, was maliciously imprisoned, resulting in his wife's suicide and his conviction for treason. The tears shed by my constituency colleague for Hoffmann Liroche must be viewed in that context.</P>
      <P>The question of to whom these protected disclosures can be made and the Minister's point about an authorised or appropriate officer being designated within the regulatory authorities is a fair one. I do not have much difficulty with it. It is not intended that in making complaints to their regulatory authority, the Central Bank, about wrongdoing in their places of work, bank employees approach the bank's doorman. I do not have a problem with the designation of an appropriate officer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of the Statute of Limitations, I was under the impression when the Bill was being drafted that the normal six year rule would apply. I do not envisage that it would be retrospective. <Col N="622" /> I did not know, and I am still not persuaded, that explicit provision is needed in the Bill to provide for the Statute of Limitations.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the exceptionally serious situation where, for whatever reason, the regulatory authority was unable or unwilling to deal with a disclosure. In that circumstance it may be made to another person. However, that is only in the most grievous situation, which I dealt with last night. I thank the Members who contributed and I appreciate the Government permitting the Bill to go through to Committee Stage where I look forward to working with the Minister of State to ensure that this legislation, which will contribute to changing the culture that all of us have lived with for a long time, becomes law.</P>

      <P>Giro Ireland Ltd. announced on 11 May that it intended to close its bicycle helmet assembly facility located in Newcastlewest on 16 July. The reason given by its American owners was worldwide manufacturing consolidation and restructuring. A total of 33 employees will lose their jobs and six will be retained in the customer service area. I recall being critical in the early 1990s of the lack of overseas industrial development in Newcastlewest. I have no doubt that due to my efforts at the time the IDA attracted Giro Ltd. and it commenced assembly operations in 1991.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State may also recall that following the closure in 1995 of Neodata, an American company located in Newcastlewest, there was a consequential loss of jobs. The town is expanding and there is concern about the lack of overseas industrial development in the area. The last overseas industry to locate there was Giro Ltd. I read the IDA document and it stated that it was committed to spending 50 per cent of Objective One funding on greenfield projects. However, Limerick did not receive Objective One status. To what degree is the Minister committed to establishing further overseas companies in Newcastlewest?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Currently, there are extensive road works <Col N="623" /> between Limerick city and Adare, with the city being bypassed. There will not be a difficulty with regard to the infrastructure in the area. Newcastlewest is the county capital and the ideal location for further industrial development. It is a matter of urgency that the IDA and Shannon Development provide new industry for the town and its surrounding area. I hope in his response the Minister of State will reassure me that there is determination to find an attractive industry to replace the company which is closing down.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Deputy's concern and disappointment over the recent decision by Giro Ireland Ltd. to close its plant in Newcastlewest. It is a manufacturer of bicycle helmets and a wholly owned subsidiary of Bell Sports Inc., an American company located in San José, California.</P>
      <P>The facility in Newcastlewest was established in 1991 to serve the needs of the European marketplace. On 16 July 1999, Giro Ireland Ltd. will close its bicycle helmet assembly facility with the loss of 35 permanent jobs. Its customer services office, as the Deputy said, will remain in the Newcastlewest area and employ approximately five people. The closure of the Irish plant is part of a worldwide manufacturing consolidation and restructuring programme.</P>
      <P>Its parent company, Bell Sports Inc., has adopted a global strategy of outsourcing its product lines in order to focus on research and design and sales and marketing to respond to the increasing competitive cost pressures of the marketplace. As part of this strategy 105 manufacturing jobs were lost at the company's plant in Santa Cruz in recent months and the closure of its plant in Canada was recently announced with the loss of 120 jobs. Bell Sports Inc. is outsourcing its products from companies it does no own in lower cost locations, for example, China.</P>
      <P>I am informed that the company will provide severance packages and an outplacement consultancy service for its employees, which will give advice on the transition to other employment and interview skills. FÁS will also assist the workers through its programmes to seek employment in the many developing and expanding companies in the wider Limerick area. While the recent job loss announcement in the Newcastlewest plant is clearly a major blow to the workforce affected, overall employment prospects remain very positive in the Limerick region.</P>
      <P>Fortunately, the region has both shared in and contributed to economic growth in Ireland and has seen tremendous development across a range of sectors and activities. Manufacturing employment in the region has increased by more than 30 per cent since 1993. The area has a quality infrastructure and its proximity to Shannon Airport and the University of Limerick is a strong attraction for overseas investment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Plassey Technology Park, Raheen Indus<Col N="624" /> trial Estate and the Shannon Free Zone are the chosen locations for a growing number of high technology companies. Moreover, it is expected that the strong level of recruitment by existing companies in the Limerick area will continue due to the high level of industrial grant approvals in recent years. For example, last year Dell Computer announced a major expansion of its Limerick operation which will bring total employment at its facilities to almost 6,000 by 2002.</P>
    <P>In addition, in 1998, in nearby Abbeyfeale, Component Inter Technologies, CIT, Ireland Limited announced a £2 million expansion which has led to more than 40 additional jobs. Abbeyfeale is the location of one of the region's largest employers, Kostal Ireland Ltd, which employs more than 1,000 people in the manufacture of automotive components. We also announced in November 1998, that HADCO Corporation, USA, was to establish an operation at the National Technological Park, Limerick. The company has initially established its customer and engineering services centre, with 70 jobs, and plans, in a phase II development, to establish a manufacturing facility, which will account for up to 80 new jobs.</P>
    <P>These latest job opportunities for the Limerick region will add to the substantial numbers of new jobs provided by other Limerick-based companies such as PKS Systems, Martin Dawes and Fullerton, which continue to build up their employment in the Limerick area. I assure the Deputy that both Shannon Development and the IDA are committed to ensuring that these advances continue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have this opportunity to raise on the Adjournment the Ombudsman's report, and, specifically, lost pension arrears. As Labour Party spokesperson on older people's issues I compliment Mr. Murphy on the conclusions of his report which are both frank and hard hitting. Given the importance of the decision of our Ombudsman, I believe that it is imperative that we, as legislators, take account of his reports and that, obviously, includes the Government. It is obvious that from 1985 to 1997 the Department of Social Welfare disregarded the legitimate concerns of the Ombudsman on behalf of pensioners and widows. The changes in the system following the 1997 Ombudsman's report could have been implemented at any stage from 1985 if the will to do so existed. It is my considered view that the changes were not made because the Department believed it was dealing <Col N="625" /> with a small vulnerable group in society, the elderly, who due to its circumstances was unlikely to initiate political lobbying.</P>
      <P>The report clearly identifies why claims were late: ill-health; lack of knowledge of the social welfare system; widows who, bearing the trauma of their widowhood, were unable to look after their financial affairs for some years following the death of their spouses; prior to 1997 a claim had to be made within three months; incorrect advice on entitlements and so on. I put it to the Minister that none of these justified non-payment of entitlement.</P>
      <P>Recently in regard to abuse against children in State controlled institutions the Taoiseach resolved to make good the neglect suffered by too many of our people. A number of years ago women who were denied their just social welfare entitlements as outlined under EU directives were awarded by the previous Government paying the back money to which they were entitled. The Ombudsman's report, published yesterday, on the entitlement of pensioners to receive back money on delayed pension claims is another such case where there is an obligation on the State to right what is wrong.</P>
      <P>This country is going through a difficult period. Many of our most important institutions, including the State itself, have been undermined by revelations of wrongdoing or neglect in the past. Standards, although they will never be perfect, had been clearly found to be less than they should be. The positive fallout is a readiness on all sides to confirm that what occurred in the past must now be put right. Fortunately we are living in a period when we can afford to do so. The innate stinginess on the part of the Department which ultimately gave rise to this report no longer has a place in society. If economic growth means one thing surely it is that we can afford not to be mean-fisted. The Minister is not at fault for the current position but the obligation to right it is on him. Ultimately the State has denied members of the public what they are due &ndash; a proportion of a pension towards which they contributed all their working lives. The report has identified a number of these cases and I note that the Department has made limited compensation for the unpaid arrears. However, as was the case in respect of equality payments, when a decision is taken in principle it should be vigorously pursued. If I recall correctly the Department, at that stage, placed advertisements in the national newspapers calling on the women who had not initiated claims to do so. A similar approach is appropriate at this stage.</P>
      <P>The elderly have made a great contribution to society. Like others they have not been treated well in the past but the excuses which prevailed then no longer apply.</P>

      <P>I hope he will deal with the matter. The importance of the issue should not be underestimated. It is clear from the Ombudsman's report that many late applicants for contributory pension had been cheated by the State. That is the long and short of it. We are talking about vulnerable people, the elderly and widows. We are talking about those who made contributions to the social welfare fund or on whose behalf contributions were made by spouses and or employers. We are talking about these people who, in many cases, were not fully aware of their rights and others who might not have been able to exercise those rights following the trauma of the death of a spouse, etc.</P>
      <P>Government responses to date on this issue have been partial and niggardly. Many pensioners, particularly those who applied prior to 1997, have been left with a huge shortfall. It is an issue that we must confront and address as we all bear a certain amount of responsibility for it. In October 1986 when this issue was raised in the Seanad I stated, on behalf of the then Government, that the Department of Social Welfare indicated that the question of amending the time limit for contributory pension claims was under examination. That was the brief I received from the Department when the issue was first raised in 1986. The matter has not yet been fully resolved.</P>
      <P>It is time for the State to face up to its responsibilities fully and properly. Lack of funds is not an excuse. There is a surplus in the social insurance fund to which these contributions have been made. Unfair, unjust, immoral, mean-minded, fraudulent and duplicitous are some of the adjectives used by the affected pensioners. It is now clear that these expressions of opinion are justified. The Ombudsman has done a major public service in highlighting this gross injustice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Earlier this month the Minister, Deputy Ahern, attempted to defend the indefensible in reply to a question tabled by my colleague, Deputy John Browne. I am glad that my Labour colleague is to the forefront on this issue as well because there should be a united voice coming from the Oireachtas that it is now time to right this injustice. It is time to confirm that all the money due to those cheated by the State will be paid. What I am seeking from the Minister is confirmation that all outstanding arrears will be paid to pensioners forthwith. That is the least we can do. This issue has been going on for some time and I say this without pointing the finger at this Govern<Col N="627" /> ment. An attempt was made by the last Government in early 1997 to deal with the problem which brought partial relief to some. A further attempt was made in 1998. Let us forget the partial solutions and resolve the matter now.</P>
    <P>The Ombudsman, a former Secretary of the Department of the Public Service, rightly highlighted the dangers inherent in the kind of system that led to this gross abuse by the State &ndash; the dangers of secondary legislation being put through without debate in the Dáil or Seanad, of having secret arrangements in place where there was discretion but it was like the star chamber court where people were not made aware of the discretionary arrangement in the Department. As they were unaware of it they could not claim it. This is a sorry saga as far as the State is concerned. Let us now face up to our responsibilities and pay all arrears to those justly entitled to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs regrets that he cannot be present because he is currently abroad on Government business. I am happy to respond to the Deputies' comments and I share their concerns about this issue which I have followed for some time.</P>
      <P>The issue at the heart of these matters and the report by the Ombudsman to which they relate is the requirement on people with pension entitlements to make their claims within a specified period and the fact that failure to make claims in time results in the loss of arrears of pension. As I am sure the Deputies are aware, these requirements and the attendant penalties were long standing, going back to the inception of the contributory pension schemes. They have been around for over 60 years in the case of widows' pensions and since 1961 and 1970 in the case of old age contributory pension and retirement pension respectively. It will be clear, therefore, that the arrangements have been accepted by successive Governments over a prolonged period.</P>
      <P>In recent years, these provisions came in for criticism and generated a volume of complaints to the Ombudsman from pensioners who were adversely affected by them. These complaints culminated in a formal investigation by the Ombudsman under section 4(2) of the Ombudsman Act, 1980, of complaints by three pensioners who were adversely affected by the arrangements. The Ombudsman's report of his investigation in these cases and of the general issues arising therefrom was published on 14 March 1997. In this report, the Ombudsman made a number of recommendations, all of which were accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current report by the Ombudsman on this issue presents an overall account of his engagement with these issues since 1985. The report deals with the various improvements which have been made up to now and presents an analysis of the manner in which the Department has responded over time to the complaints and criti<Col N="628" /> cisms raised by him. It is important to emphasise that the report is not the opening chapter on a new problem, but the culmination of a process that has spanned a number of years.</P>
    <P>The Ombudsman says that the issue dealt with in this report represents an historical problem which, in the light of developments in the past few years, has now been significantly ameliorated. He also accepts that because of improvements made since 1997, the pensions arrears issue is unlikely to be of major concern to his office, and that his report marks the end of his office's involvement with the issue.</P>
    <P>The Department is actively engaged in identifying potentially eligible pensioners under the latest improvement affecting claims made prior to January 1997 and has already made payments to more than 700 pensioners. The extra-statutory provisions relating to contributory pensions covered by the Ombudsman's reports on late claims have now been replaced by statutory provisions. It is intended to deal with the remaining instances of extra-statutory provisions in the same way. The report will be carefully examined and the Ombudsman's findings will be borne in mind in the context of the future development of the social welfare system.</P>
    <P>The latest report from the Ombudsman gives detailed information on the various improvements, legislative and otherwise, which have been made in relation to the late claims issue. In particular, I refer the Deputies to pages 11, 12 and 13 of the report in this regard. In doing so, I draw their attention to the fact that the Ombudsman's first special report on this issue was published in March 1997 when they were in Government and that the Government which they supported had the opportunity to deal fully with all the issues. This was not done. I acknowledge changes were made by that Government in response to the 1997 report, but they were confined to claims made in that year or thereafter and left all other cases, which comprised the bulk of the complaints received by the Ombudsman, untouched. These changes were made in the 1997 Act, which extended the limit on back-dating payments in contributory pension claims from six to 12 months.</P>
    <P>Since coming into office, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs made regulations in February 1998 under which a proportion of arrears due in respect of the period beyond 12 months may also be paid. These regulations also provide for the possibility of full arrears in cases where claims are delayed due to <i>force majeure</i>, proven incapacity on the part of the applicant or to departmental error, and also to alleviate current financial hardship. These provisions were designed to strike a balance between the need for effective management of the system and appropriate recognition to be given to cases of genuine hardship or difficulty.</P>
    <P>While these provisions represented an improvement on the previous position, the Government was concerned that a significant <Col N="629" /> number of pensioners who applied for a pension prior to 1 January 1997 did not benefit from these improvements. I am happy to say, therefore, that provision was made in this year's budget for the payment of proportionate arrears of pension in the case of late claims made prior to 1 January 1997 in respect of retirement, old age contributory, widow's and widower's contributory pension and orphan's contributory allowance. Payment of proportionate arrears of pension due under these new arrangements is continuing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise this important matter concerning the future position of the State owned ferry service to Oileán Chléire. This lifeline must not be sacrificed. The people of Cape Clear Island, off the south-west Cork coast, have sent out an SOS to save their ferry service from privatisation.</P>
      <P>The 140 people living on the island currently depend on a State owned vessel and I understand the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands is considering leasing the existing ferry to private enterprise or seeking tenders for a new service. Effectively, as far as islanders are concerned, this means the Government plans to abandon a remote sea bound population whose only access to the mainland is on board <i>An Naomh Ciarán</i>. The greatest fear of the people on the island is that in winter, when the flow of Irish language students and tourists to the island ends, a private operator could suspend the ferry service on financial grounds. While a value for money policy may be prudent, it would be extremely shortsighted on the part of the Department if the islanders' vital lifeline was sacrificed on the altar of commercialism. It would be a penny spared but pound foolish.</P>
      <P>Cape Clear is situated nine miles off the west Cork harbour village of Baltimore. It, Tory Island, Clare Island and the Aran Islands are regarded as Ireland's Atlantic islands. The remaining islands are regarded as inshore islands. I appeal to the Minister to abide by the unanimous decision of the entire island population to maintain the service as it stands and thereby alleviate any anxiety which has arisen from the threat of privatisation of the current ferry service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="630" /> I am sure the Minister of State received a postcard from a disgruntled islander which states:</P>
    <P>Help save our public ferry service. It is going to be privatised. Threat to four jobs. Threat to the economy and ecology. Islanders to be dependent on someone not committed to the island. No control on cost to islanders. People will have no other alternative but to leave Cape Clear as life will no longer be possible.</P>
    <P>The card, which shows a picture of the State run island ferry service, <i>An Naomh Ciarán</i>, entering the north harbour in Cape Clear, is signed by the islander concerned.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to listen to the results of a public meeting which was held on the island last week. This was attended by 55 concerned islanders and a petition contains their names and signatures. Their livelihood is at stake and the people are completely disgusted with the idea of privatisation. The time is right for the Minister to uphold the wishes of the people of the island. I appeal to him not to throw the islanders to the mercy of the wind and privatisation. He should dispel the fear on Cape Clear and Oileán Chléire, allow the present State-run service to continue, and improve it if possible. Will he consider providing a helicopter or light aircraft service as well as the ferry? The island's population is 144, which rises to 1,000 in the summer. There is an air service between County Galway and the Aran Islands and the people off the south-west coast deserve similar treatment to those in the Minister's constituency. I appeal to him to listen to my plea and dispel the suggestion of privatisation, because those people dread it.</P>

      <P>As he is aware, soon after my appointment as Minister of State I visited all the inhabited islands and discussed their problems directly with the island communities. One issue raised time and again, both by islanders and by their representatives, was that of safe access to and from the mainland. This involves two elements, the infrastructure and the ferry services, and in line with my commitment before the election, I decided to address these issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With this in mind we carried out a detailed analysis of the access requirements of the inhabited offshore islands with the intention of providing a minimum level of secure service between the islands and the mainland. The question of infrastructure is being addressed not only by my Department but in conjunction with the local authorities and the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources. I pay tribute to Cork <Col N="631" /> County Council, which has been an exemplar, and to my predecessor, who encouraged that local authority. The county council has drawn up a comprehensive pier programme which I have been delighted to fund. As the Deputy knows, I have committed in the region of £1.7 million to it. This is proceeding apace and I hope it will be completed this year on the islands. We are looking at further piers on the mainland. In this way we are dealing with the infrastructural problem. The Deputy will have to accept that never before has such money been spent in providing that necessary part of the infrastructural requirement.</P>
    <P>As to access transport, I looked at those Atlantic islands, Inishturk, Inishbofin and Clare Island, which had no State-guaranteed winter service. I was delighted that within two years of entering office I was able to put in place a subsidised and guaranteed winter ferry service to those three islands, the last such Atlantic islands with a significant population to be without such services. All the major populated islands now have a service.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy knows, Oileán Chléire has been served since 1975 by a State-owned ferry, <i>An Naomh Ciarán</i>. The service appears to me to be satisfactory, generally speaking. I was surprised to receive persistent requests over the past two years from the islanders and their representatives to review this service. The Deputy might also be surprised if he saw the correspondence. My Department is, therefore, currently examining the service as part of the analysis of the access requirements of inhabited islands in this region. This examination is being carried out in consultation with the island co-operative and community. As part of this analysis, officials of my Department met the island community on Oileán Chléire on 27 May 1999.</P>
    <P>Until all the necessary consultations have taken place a decision will not be made regarding the future subsidisation of the ferry service between Oileán Chléire and the mainland. I can guarantee that the level of service will not be reduced while I am Minister. I have dramatically increased the <Col N="632" /> level of service to the islands on which I have already made decisions. To confirm this, the Deputy can ask the people of Inishmaan, Inishmore, Inisheer, Inishturk and Inishbofin what we have done. We are now starting on the Cork islands.</P>
    <P>At the AGM of Comhdháil Oileáin na hÉireann I made a commitment that a decision in principle on the ferry services to the Cork islands &ndash; not just to this island &ndash; would be made before the end of June. Work is progressing on this matter, my officials visited all the Cork islands recently and within the next three weeks I will make an announcement on what I intend to do in principal for these islands.</P>
    <P>The Deputy mentioned air services. That is not a problem for the in-shore islands, which can be reached in five minutes in almost all weathers. I have accepted the principle that there is a case to be made for services to islands far offshore. This, however, depends on mainland terminals. In that connection I am working with Údarás na Gaeltachta. I have set up a programme of priorities based on a number of factors.</P>

      <P>When such services are being provided, they will have to go to public tender, because that is the process. I have no doubt that many people will be willing to provide such services, depending on the subsidy available. I would see this going in that direction.</P>
      <P>As long as I am the Minister with responsibility for the islands, there will be a continued investment in the improvement both of infrastructure and of the level of service to the island, and there will not be a diminution of those services. The review currently being carried out on Oileán Chléire was at the request of the islanders.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 24, 30 and 47 together.</P>
      <P>The Deputy, and indeed all Members of the House, will be well aware of my abhorrence of drug taking within sport and my commitment to do all within my power to help eliminate this scourge.</P>
      <P>To this end, I announced details of Ireland's first ever national sports anti-doping programme last year. The programme was circulated to interested parties, including the national governing bodies of sport who will be responsible for applying sanctions in accordance with their own rules and regulations to any player-athlete found in breach of anti-doping regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The programme has been designed with refer<Col N="635" /> ence to the Council of Europe Anti-Doping Convention 1989, which seeks a three strand approach to the reduction of doping in sport &ndash; namely testing, research and educational programmes and information campaigns.</P>
    <P>Implementation of the national anti-doping programme will be the responsibility of the new statutory Irish sports council. The sports Act was signed by the President on 18 May and Deputies will be pleased to know that I have just signed the order designating 1 July as the establishment day for the council.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile, to facilitate early start-up of testing, tenders were invited last February for sample collection services and laboratory analysis services. The tenders are currently being assessed by a tender assessment board. The recommendations of the board will be ready for submission to the first meeting of the statutory Irish Sports Council.</P>
    <P>NGBs have been asked to outline their current provisions regarding anti-doping and the adequacy and appropriateness of their constitutions, rules and regulations in the context of their role under the anti-doping programme.</P>
    <P>Education has a very important role to play in creating a sporting environment that fosters the pursuit of excellence and fulfilment in sport by fair and ethical means &ndash; as recognised by the Council of Europe Anti-Doping Convention 1989.</P>
    <P>As I have mentioned, the programme has been designed to encompass broad educational programmes and informational campaigns emphasising the dangers to health inherent in doping and its harm to the ethical values of sport.</P>
    <P>It is expected that the new sports council will be developing campaigns in co-operation with the national coaching and training centre, Limerick, the NGBs and the health promotion unit of the Department of Health and Children to take advantage of that unit's considerable experience in promulgating health education campaigns.</P>
    <P>Education programmes and information campaigns will, of course, need the fullest co-operation and support from all those involved in sport if the scourge of drug taking is not to be carried on through future generations of sports boys and girls, men and women.</P>
    <P>In this regard I will be asking for the fullest and wholehearted commitment from all those involved in sport &ndash; parents, schools, sponsors, trainers, coaches, doctors and, most importantly, high profile athletes &ndash; to work with the Irish sports council and the national governing bodies in actively promoting the qualities of genuine sporting endeavour and educate our young people involved in sport about the very real health risks associated with the taking of performance enhancing drugs and, indeed, the potential health risks in the misuse of other products such as food supplements.</P>
    <P>While my core objective is the introduction of the national sports anti-doping programme, <Col N="636" /> which is predicated on the active participation of autonomous national governing bodies of sport, I have also felt that the measures in the programme might be complemented through the application of certain legislative based measures.</P>
    <P>A number of options have been identified which I and my officials are pursuing &ndash; most specifically in the area of possession and supply of certain performance enhancing drugs.</P>
    <P>In this regard, I have had discussions with my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, with regard to incorporating certain substances used within sport under Ireland's general drugs legislation.</P>
    <P>The Minister was supportive of my overall proposal and discussions are currently under way with regard to the types of drugs used for the enhancement of sports performances that may be suitable for inclusion in the schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act.</P>
    <P>I consider that amending general drugs legislation to include certain performance enhancing drugs will send a very strong signal to those coaches, trainers, athletes and any other persons found in possession of such specified drugs that they will, in future, be committing an offence under Irish law and be subject to the full rigours of that law.</P>
    <P>Drug abuse in sport, of its nature, cannot, of course, be tackled at just the national level. Doping in sport is an international problem which requires a concerted and co-ordinated response at international level.</P>
    <P>This has also been acknowledged at European level where the EU has committed itself to work together with sports organisations in the fight against doping in sport. At the instigation of EU Sports Ministers, the European Commission has established a working group composed of officials of the member states to assist in preparing a report on harmonising both national and European assistance for doping control.</P>
    <P>I believe strongly that we should work together collectively to address these issues.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 25, 40 and 46 together.</P>
      <P>I have, on many occasions, highlighted the critical importance of overseas tourism marketing to our continued competitiveness as a tourism destination. With the assistance of EU Structural Funds, successive Governments, in partnership with industry and the appropriate State agencies, have overseen an investment of over one billion pounds in tourism marketing, training and product development over the past decade. This investment, aided by other factors such as the liberalisation of access transport and the general competitiveness of our economy, has contributed to a doubling in overseas visitor numbers to 5.7 million last year and a trebling of foreign exchange earnings to £2.3 billion.</P>
      <P>While I am fully committed to putting an adequate tourism marketing fund in place for the new millennium, I cannot, for very practical reasons, be specific at this time as to the level of funding that will be available. Final decisions in relation to departmental Estimates of expenditure for the year 2000 will not, as is usual, be taken until the autumn.</P>
      <P>Work in relation to the preparation of the national development plan is being advanced and while I and my Department are seeking a continuation of EU funding for international tourism marketing activities, a final decision on this bid will not be known for some time.</P>
      <P>I have answered questions on a number of occasions in relation to the suggested introduction of a modest visitor levy in line with practice in many other countries. This, as I have stated previously, is but one proposal put forward for the future financing of tourism marketing programmes and is without prejudice to possible future EU support. I expect that a final decision in relation to this proposal will be taken in the context of future deliberations with my Government colleagues on tourism marketing funding arrangements generally.</P>
      <P>The Deputies will also be aware that it is proposed that an all-island tourism marketing company will be established under the proposed new North-South political structures. Developments in this area, which will depend on further political progress in relation to the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, will also have to be considered in the context of future funding arrangements.</P>

      <Quest>the discussion, if any, he has had with the FAI or UEFA arising from the cancellation of the Ireland v Yugoslavia European championship match, following the decision of the Government to refuse visas to the Yugoslav party; if he will urge UEFA that Ireland should not be penalised in terms of loss of points arising from the cancellation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid)</NameTxt>
      <P>The responsibility for the organisation and management of matches in the European championship is ultimately a matter for UEFA and the national football federations. The Deputy will be aware that in this competition, a qualifying match between the Republic of Ireland and Yugoslavia was scheduled to take place in Dublin on Saturday, 5 June 1999.</P>
      <P>In view of the illegal and appalling actions of the Yugoslav regime against the people of Kosovo, the EU Foreign Ministers at their meeting on 26 April and again on 31 May 1999 encouraged member states and international sporting bodies not to organise sporting events with Yugoslavia. In spite of these resolutions, the briefing which the FAI gave to UEFA at a meeting on 24 May 1999 and my meeting with representatives of UEFA in Germany on 2 June 1999, UEFA refused to alter its decision and confirmed that the match should go ahead on 5 June.</P>
      <P>In the light of UEFA's decision, the unacceptable situation in Kosovo and the indictments of the international tribunal against the highest authorities of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the Government was convinced that it would not be appropriate for the match to take place in Ireland. Accordingly, the Government decided to refuse visas to the members of the Yugoslav team to enter Ireland for the purpose of playing the match and subsequently communicated this to the Football Association of Ireland.</P>
      <P>The following day, at the European Council meeting held in Cologne, the heads of Government reaffirmed the European Union position in connection with sports events with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.</P>
      <P>My officials have been in contact with the FAI and remain available to meet with it although no formal meeting has been requested by the association. The only contact with UEFA since my meeting with their Secretary General earlier this month in Paderborn was to forward, for his information, a copy of the text of the Government's statement refusing the visas to the Yugoslav party.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the FAI has stated publicly that it is currently engaging with UEFA in relation to the cancelled fixture and that it has the support of a number of national football federations in its efforts to ensure that no action is taken by UEFA to penalise the FAI for the cancellation of the fixture. UEFA indicated to me in Paderborn that it would not be in a position to make a decision on this matter until it had been considered by the appropriate committee within UEFA having received a report from the FAI.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that at a meeting tomorrow the control and disciplinary committee of UEFA will consider the issues arising from the cancellation of the June 5 fixture. In preparation for its presentation to the meeting the FAI sought clarifica<Col N="639" /> tion from the Government of its attitude to the refixing of the match for Dublin and the question of the granting of visas to the Yugoslav party. This clarification has been provided in a letter issued yesterday to the FAI by an Taoiseach.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 27 and 42 together.</P>
      <P>The Government, in line with the commitment given in the joint programme, An Action Programme for the Millennium, decided in November 1997 to initiate a tender procedure to invite proposals for a national 50 metre swimming pool. The tender procedure is being conducted in accordance with EU Council Directive 93/37/EEC, concerning the co-ordination of procedures for the award of public works contracts. A project team was established by my Department to assist with the preparation of invitation to tender documentation and to oversee the tendering process. This team comprises representatives of a number of Departments and other organisations.</P>
      <P>The tender procedure notice for the project was published in the Official Journal of the European Communities and in the Irish media in January 1998, and was open to both the public and private sectors. Developers were requested to come forward with proposals for the design, construction, financing and management of a 50 metre swimming pool, capable of meeting the training requirements of Ireland's high performance swimmers for international competition. Such developers were required to demonstrate that they had the necessary financial status, technical knowledge and experience to undertake the development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has agreed to provide capital assistance, up to a maximum of £6 million, and annual operational assistance up to a maximum of £250,000, for a maximum period of 20 years, towards the cost of implementation of the successful tender. The deadline for submission of full tenders from qualified candidates was 27 November 1998, and three tender proposals were received on that date. Two tender proposals, one with a location in Dublin and the other in Limerick, were deemed by the project team, on the advice of independent professional consultants, to have met the qualification criteria and these <Col N="640" /> proposals have proceeded to the evaluation and assessment phase of the project. The third tender was disqualified on the basis of its ineligibility in terms of its compatibility with a fundamental element of the tender framework: the capital grant limits.</P>
    <P>However, on 18 January 1999 the third tenderer applied for and was given leave by the High Court to seek to have their disqualification set aside and their tender considered. This case was heard in the High Court between 12 and 14 of May last, with judgment being reserved.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile, the detailed evaluation of the two remaining tenders, which is being undertaken by an independent multi-disciplinary consultancy team, is well advanced but effectively stalled pending the outcome of the High Court proceedings. The High Court gave its ruling this morning that there was no grounds for a judicial review of the disqualification.</P>

      <P>Of the 214 separate projects contained in the action plans of the local drugs task forces which were approved for funding, 198 are currently drawing down or have drawn down the money allocated to them from the sum of £10 million which was provided for this purpose. Of these, 57 projects have already used up their original allocations and are now in receipt of interim funding to enable them to continue, pending evaluation of their impact and assessment as regards suitability for mainstreaming. In this instance, mainstreaming would mean that the projects remain community based but funded directly through the relevant statutory agencies.</P>
      <P>The principal factors which have impacted on the start-up of projects are that many projects are designed to address gaps in current service provision and, as a result, have had to be planned and designed <i>ab initio</i>; in many instances, local management structures have had to be put in place to ensure community ownership, as well as sustainability, of the projects; and the shortage of premises and appropriately trained personnel to deliver the proposed programmes and services.</P>
      <P>The promoters of the 16 projects which have not yet commenced are being assisted by the local drugs task forces, the national drugs strategy team and relevant statutory agencies in their efforts to get them up and running.</P>

      <P>One of the Government's key priorities is to ensure a more focused and better co-ordinated response by the statutory authorities in addressing the needs of severely disadvantaged urban communities.</P>
      <P>To that end, the interdepartmental committee on local development, which I chair, has been given a mandate to pilot a process which aims to produce a model of best practice that is suitable for extension to other deprived urban areas.</P>
      <P>The first phase of that project involved a close look at the situation on the ground in four areas &ndash; Dublin's north east inner city, the four flats area of the south inner city &ndash; Fatima Mansions, St. Teresa's Gardens, St. Michael's House, Dolphin House &ndash; Jobstown, Tallaght and Togher, Cork.</P>
      <P>Following a decision by the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion, the implementation phase of a pilot integrated services project for each of the four areas was launched by the Taoiseach on 4 December last at a special meeting of Secretaries General and chief executive officers of relevant Departments and statutory agencies.</P>
      <P>Individual officials have since been designated at national and at local level, responsible for driving the project within their respective Department or agency.</P>
      <P>Persons designated at local level in the four areas have commenced the process of identifying local priority actions to address the needs of each area, as part of local implementation teams. They are being assisted in this process by a national co-ordinator based in ADM Ltd., who is looking after operational aspects of the project, and by four development and monitoring officers, one based in each of the target areas.</P>
      <P>Progress reports by the development and monitoring officers indicate a commitment from all agencies, at local level, to participate fully in the ISP.</P>
      <P>Community consultative forums which allow local people the opportunity to participate in a meaningful way in the process, and in some cases task groups to focus on specific priority issues, have been established in each area. By the end of this month I will have attended working meetings of the officials of State agencies and community representatives involved in the ISP process in all of the four ISP areas.</P>

      <P>Following a comprehensive review of the provisions of the existing programme, applications were invited at the end of 1998 under a new revised sports capital programme funded from the national lottery surplus.</P>
      <P>While allocations will continue to be made on the basis of applications made under the programme, special priority will in future be given to proposals for facilities in disadvantaged areas, in line with Government policy aimed at increasing participation in sport and recreation in these areas. Disadvantaged areas are defined as those designated under the operational programme for local, urban and rural development 1995-1999.</P>
      <P>Applicants are now required to consult with other clubs and community groups, including schools, with sport and recreational facilities in their areas, and the local authority, before making an application for funding and to show the outcome of such consultations. The purpose of this is to ensure that regard is had to the identified requirements of individual areas and that the proposed development does not result in overlap with and/or duplication of existing facilities. Sports clubs developing projects at national and regional levels are also required to ensure that their proposals are consistent with the priorities of their national governing bodies with regard to training and competition requirements. In addition, my Department will consult, as appropriate, when assessing applications with other relevant Departments and agencies, including the Irish Sports Council, with a view to ensuring co-ordination in the provision of sport and recreational facilities at local level.</P>
      <P>I expect to make announcements on the 1999 round of grant allocations under the new sports capital programme in the near future. While no decisions have yet been made on what national facilities, if any, will be funded under the programme in 1999, the Deputy may wish to note that I recently decided that an in-depth feasibility study should be commissioned in relation to a proposal to develop an indoor athletics facility at Morton Stadium. The study will examine a number of issues, including the demand for such a facility and the optimum scale and projected costs of the proposed facility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that a tender competition for a 50 metre pool is well advanced. The competition was suspended pending the outcome of a High Court case taken by a tenderer challenging their disqualification from the compe<Col N="644" /> tition. The High Court gave its ruling this morning that there were no grounds for a judicial review of their disqualification.</P>
    <P>Finally, the Government agreed, in October 1998, to the commissioning of a feasibility study for the development of a national stadium and to the establishment of a stadium steering committee to conduct the feasibility study and to make recommendations based on the findings of the study. Following an open tender process, a consortium led by Pricewaterhouse Coopers was selected by the steering committee to carry out the feasibility study. I understand that the finalised study, and the recommendations of the steering committee established to oversee it, are expected to be available for consideration by the Government by September of this year.</P>

    <P>(Dr. McDaid): Bord Fáilte and CERT are participants on my Department's year 2000 monitoring committee, which has already met on a number of occasions to ensure achievement of year 2000 compliance.</P>
    <P>My Department has already completed work and reported year 2000 compliance to the interdepartmental year 2000 monitoring committee, which reports every two months to Government. Bord Fáilte and CERT have indicated that their respective organisations will be year 2000 compliant by the end of next month. Bord Fáilte is also in the process of contacting companies that provide services to the tourism industry such as Fexco, Gulliver and TQS Hotel Grading and Inspections to help ensure that they achieve compliance in good time.</P>
    <P>Enterprise Ireland year 2000 information service offers a guide to year 2000 compliance, a directory of consultants and services as well as awareness and training events for small business on year 2000 compliance. This is provided through an information pack which is readily available, a low cost telephone line and information on the World Wide Web. The Irish Hotels Federation has provided an information pack on year 2000 problems for its members while the Irish Hotel and Catering Institute, with support from CERT, has included the year 2000 issues and implications for the tourism industry in its annual conference.</P>
    <P>CERT, in responding to industry inquiries, has been focusing attention on awareness of the need to consult with IT suppliers, getting year 2000 compliance certification from equipment suppliers, and under the industry training support scheme, provides support towards training in new technology.</P>

      <P>The Department's website was last upgraded during 1998. Having successfully completed its work on securing year 2000 compliance, my Department will now be giving priority attention to further upgrading of this site. It is proposed to extend the range of information available and to improve the navigational system. Tender proposals have recently been sought from a number of web design firms to modernise and revamp the site. The deadline for receipt of these proposals is 25 June 1999 and it is hoped to complete the redesign work as soon as possible after that stage. Because of the increasing importance of the Internet as a major informational and educational tool for the public, it is planned to update the site thereafter on a regular basis.</P>

      <P>URBAN is a Community initiative of the European Commission under which assistance is made available for integrated development programmes for a limited number of geographically defined deprived urban areas throughout the EU. The operational programme for URBAN in Ireland has total funding of about £21 million over the period 1994-1999 and operates in three areas: north Dublin &ndash; Ballymun, Finglas and Darndale; south Dublin &ndash; west Tallaght and north Clondalkin; and northside of Cork city. While all commitments under the current programme must be made by the end of 1999 spending can continue until the end of 2001.</P>
      <P>Although the Commission's Agenda 2000 proposals did not originally contemplate the continuance of the URBAN initiative after 1999, the Commission has decided to retain the URBAN initiative, to be known as URBAN 2, in the next round of EU Structural Funds. The decision will come into force as part of the overall regulation for the next round of EU Structural Funds being published at the end of this month.</P>
      <P>The Commission intends to publish a framework for URBAN 2 by the end of the summer. Until such time as the framework is published, it is impossible to anticipate how exactly the initiative will operate in Ireland. It is known that cities and towns with a population of 50,000 and over will be eligible for inclusion in URBAN 2 whereas the current URBAN initiative stipulates that only cities and towns with populations of 100,000 and over meet the eligibility criteria.</P>
      <P>The Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation is taking account of the experience being gained from the implementation of the current URBAN initiative in the cities of Dublin and Cork, in the context of the formulation of its strategy for local development post-1999.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="647" /> In my response I indicated that I set up a sporting ambassadors programme last year in order that the international profile of Ireland's more prominent sporting personalities might be harnessed to contribute to our overseas tourism promotional efforts.

    <P>Under the terms of his contract with Bord Fáilte, Mr. Jordan will undertake a variety of tourism promotional appearances and will display, as appropriate, Bord Fáilte-Ryder Cup logos.

    <P>Finally, I indicated in my reply to ASH Ireland that as a medical doctor, I am all too aware of the perils of tobacco use and am fully supportive of the work of the health promotion unit and organisations such as ASH Ireland in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 41 and 80 together.</P>
      <P>Under section 9 of the Tourist Traffic Act, 1957, Bord Fáilte is empowered to publish or cause to be published, lists of tourism accommodation premises, including bed and breakfast operations, which are not registered titles under the Tourist Traffic Acts. The system by which bed and breakfast accommodation is listed is a voluntary one and operators who do not wish to be listed by Bord Fáilte are not prohibited from carrying on their business.</P>
      <P>Operators who are listed experience a number of advantages such as access to official marketing through Bord Fáilte, the Gulliver reservations service and the tourist information office network, and access to special support schemes, such as tax incentives, which are only available to the listed sector. All providers of tourist accommodation are obliged, whether listed or unlisted, to comply with official requirements in areas such as taxation, planning, fire and safety and hygiene.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue of mandatory licensing or registration of all tourist accommodation, including bed and breakfast establishments has been examined by successive Administrations over the years <Col N="648" /> and they have all come to the same conclusion that any mandatory system, in order to be effective, would require a significant diversion of resources currently devoted to the development of tourism towards administration and policing. This would be particularly burdensome as many accommodation providers only operate for short periods of the year.</P>
    <P>In recent years there has been a substantial increase in the volume and range of tourist accommodation which has enhanced the choice available to tourists and allows market forces to weed out accommodation which is not of a sufficiently high standard to meet tourist requirements. In light of developments in the supply of accommodation, I share the view of my predecessors that the introduction of a compulsory licensing system would be an inappropriate use of resources. There is no evidence to support the view that such a system would have any appreciable impact on accommodation standards over and above that brought about by market forces.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile Bord Fáilte and the recognised listing bodies will continue to encourage all operators to seek listing status by highlighting the advantages of being listed. As part of this process, earlier this year I launched a new initiative targeted primarily at the small listed accommodation provider. Bord Fáilte is carrying out a fundamental review of how the various groups in this category are branded and marketed overseas.</P>
    <P>Progress has already been achieved in this process with the appointment of a steering committee to oversee the project and a marketing co-ordinator who will undertake market research and then develop and implement a marketing plan. I am confident that this initiative will considerably expand the range of assistance and advice offered to the sector, thereby making listing a more attractive proposition. Resources totalling £300,000 have been set aside for Bord Fáilte to support this initiative in 1999.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In line with the commitment set out in the Government's An Action Programme for the Millennium, Bord Fáilte, at my request, initiated a review earlier this year of the regional tourism <Col N="649" /> authorities which were established by the board under the tourist traffic Acts for the promotion and development of tourism on a regional basis.</P>
    <P>The objective is to review the role and operations of the regional tourism authorities and recommend how they can optimally contribute to the achievement of national tourism objectives and targets set by Government in line with the focus of Bord Fáilte's strategic plan and taking into account regional priorities and customer focus.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte is being assisted by independent consultants and the review is expected to be completed this summer. My Department has met the consultants as part of the review process.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 44 and 45 together.</P>
      <P>ADM supported area based partnerships have in recent years been developing a new and innovative area based response to the needs of the disadvantaged, both urban and rural. This was strongly evidenced by the launch of Dublin Inner City Partnership two year programme report, which outlines its holistic approach to social inclusion in an urban context.</P>
      <P>The European Council recently agreed a funding package of Community support for the 2000-2006 period. While the outcome for Ireland was good given the extreme difficulty of the negotiations, the level of EU Structural Funds available over that period will be approximately half that available to Ireland under the current Community support framework.</P>
      <P>Work has already commenced on the process of agreeing priorities for EU co-funding under Ireland's next national development plan and on clarifying the Commission's new procedures for the next round of Structural Funds. There is also a separate national consultation process to be undergone, inclusive of the social partners. Until such time as this overall process is completed, it is difficult to give any indication of likely levels of EU financial commitments and programme support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="650" /> It is natural that there will be a degree of uncertainty pending the completion of the national development plan and the position to be taken by the European Commission as to its funding commitments to certain elements of this plan.</P>
    <P>The Government is, however, fully committed to the fundamentally important task of tackling social exclusion in deprived areas, and of ensuring that the overall objectives of current programmes remain a priority. Whereas I cannot pre-empt the national development plan, I can say that the Department of Tourism Sport and Recreation has made a comprehensive case for local development in the context of the drafting of the plan.</P>
    <P>The report of the task force on the integration of the local government and local development systems clearly also envisages the continuation of area based local development structures within a more sustainable framework.</P>
    <P>There are a variety of issues which need to be considered arising from the task force report itself which are, by now, well known to the groups concerned. Issues arising from previous performance, changes in deprivation rankings and the need to ensure that the needs of the real blackspot areas are being addressed are also issues which require consideration when planning for the future.</P>
    <P>Copies of recent speeches made by both the Taoiseach and myself at Dublin inner city functions will be made available in the Oireachtas, Library for Deputies' information.</P>

      <P>Under the operational programme for tourism, 1989-1993, a total of £330 million, including £136 million from the European Regional Development Fund, was invested in the development of Ireland's tourism product.</P>
      <P>It is expected that, under the current operational programme, a further £442 million will be invested under this heading, of which £225 million will be contributed from the European Regional Development Fund. Under these two programmes, covering the decade 1989-99, more than £1 billion is expected to have been invested in tourism, on a range of measures leading to a transformation in the quality and standards of the tourism product.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over recent months, my Department has been developing an outline strategy for the continued development of tourism in the context of the next round of EU Structural Funding, covering the period 2000-06. The strategy includes a vision for <Col N="651" /> the future, key objectives and targets and a proposed strategic approach under the product, marketing and training headings. The development of a partnership approach between the Exchequer, the European Union, the State agencies and the private sector, which has proved so successful in the context of the two operational programmes for tourism to date is the key to sponsoring a more self sustaining high quality tourism product.</P>
    <P>Recent initiatives undertaken by CERT, the State tourism training agency, and the Irish Hotels Federation have been specifically targeted at customer service issues. CERT has recently introduced the &ldquo;Ireland's Best Service Plus&rdquo; programme to introduce a company service philosophy with the aim of improving and exceeding customer expectations. Customer service skills also feature prominently as an integral part of all CERT's training programmes for recruits and employees. The introduction of this programme has resulted in a huge reduction in the levels of guest complaints. Meanwhile, the Irish Hotels Federation has launched a quality employer programme which aims to improve quality and customer service in hotels throughout the country.</P>
    <P>For my part, I will continue to encourage full participation by hotels in such initiatives as a vital element in their strategy to ensure that Ireland continues to be regarded as a high quality destination.</P>

      <P>I welcome the high ratings on year 2000 compliance which Ireland has received from the Gartner Group in its report of March 1999. According to this report, Ireland was in the highest ranking group, along with countries such as Australia, Canada, Sweden, the UK and USA.</P>
      <P>In relation to the position of Irish companies trading in countries where compliance is not as far advanced as in Ireland, the position for such companies is the same as for any enterprise regardless of the marketplace in which they operate. The onus is on all businesses to evaluate their supply chains and ensure that their suppliers and customers will be able to continue in business without interruption into the new millennium.</P>

      <P>Passport fees are set by statutory instrument with the consent of the Minister for Finance. The standard fee is £45 but persons under 18 and over 65 years of age may have three year passports for £10. In addition, as a special concession, groups of between five and fifty invalids travelling to Lourdes may share a single collective passport for one £45 fee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as is practicable, taking into account the <Col N="654" /> desirability for administrative reasons of not allowing too many exceptions to the standard fee, the current passport fee structure accommodates potential hardship cases.</P>

      <P>The person named was paid on 12 suckler cows under the 1998 suckler cow premium scheme that is, 12 Lus. He also applied for, and was paid on, one animal under the bull premium scheme. This animal was under two years and was therefore equivalent to 0.6 Lu. He lodged an area aid application for 16.97 hectares. According to the Department's records he had a milk quota of 10,178 gallons which divided by the national average yield of 897 gallons per cow is equivalent to 11.34 Lus. The total of 23.94 Lus divided by 16.97 hectares gave a stocking density of 1.41 Lus/hectare.</P>
      <P>On investigation with his milk co-operative it has since been established that this milk quota was sold on 1 April 1997 and should not be counted in the stocking density calculation. Arrangements are being made to pay the 1998 extensification premium to the person named.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has not abandoned pensions parity.</P>
      <P>In June 1997, in An Action Programme for the Millennium, the Government undertook to protect public service pensions. In November 1997, the Government announced that the benefit of the restructuring pay deals under the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i>  would apply on the basis of parity to public servants who had retired before the commencement dates; however, in order to protect those retired public servants who would have received less than 3 per cent had parity been applied in the normal way, the Government decided that pensioners should be guaranteed a minimum increase of 3 per cent or 2 per cent in the case of any pensioners who have already received an advance payment of 1 per cent. It also announced that the refinement on traditional parity, which met the particular complexities of the PCW restructuring deals, was a once off measure to address those particular circumstances and that the policy in relation to any future restructuring deals will be determined in the light of the recommendations in the final report of the commission on public service pensions. I look forward to receiving that report in the coming months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also point out that officials of my Department have met representatives of pen<Col N="657" /> sioner groups on a number of occasions, most recently in March 1999. The issues being pursued by these pensioner groups dispute aspects of settled pensions parity policy. For example, they want personal long service increments paid to certain serving staff on a personal basis under their PCW restructuring pay deals to be passed on to retired personnel. My Department has made it clear from the beginning that it is a core element of pensions parity policy that such payments are not passed on to pensioners because they are not a permanent feature of the pay scale.</P>

Under section 15 of the Bill, a local authority would be empowered to make its consent subject to conditions including reduction in the number of telecommunications related road openings by ensuring that road openings are co-ordinated, trenches are shared and spare ducts are laid for future use by other operators. Non-compliance with a direction given by a local authority under the Bill would be an offence. In the case of a summary conviction, the penalty would be a fine not exceeding £1,500 and-or a prison term not exceeding 12 months; in the case of a conviction on indictment, the penalty would be a fine not exceeding £10,000 and-or a prison term not exceeding two years.</P>
      <P>Finally, the concept of lane rental will be introduced by the National Roads Authority in connection with new urban road works contracts. Similar arrangements for the control of other operations involving occupation of road space may arise for consideration in due course.</P>

This requirement was examined as part of the review of the carer's allowance, published in October 1998 and it was proposed that this rule be relaxed to introduce greater flexibility into the scheme.</P>
      <P>On foot of this, new arrangements will apply from 5 August 1999. Guidelines are currently under consideration and details will be announced shortly.</P>

      <P>The tender procedure organised by Bord Fáilte, under the direction of the independent management board for product development and conducted in accordance with EU Council Directive 93/37/EEC, culminated in June 1998 in the selection of the proposal submitted by Spencer Dock International Convention Centre Limited, to develop the conference centre, with European Regional Development Fund assistance, at a site in Dublin's docklands.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the operational programme, decisions on grant applications in respect of amounts at or above 15 million ECU must be made with the agreement of the Government and the EU Commission on foot of a cost-benefit analysis conducted in accordance with community law. This cost-benefit analysis, which was favourable towards the project, was undertaken by independent consultants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In September 1998 the Government agreed to the making of a submission to the EU Commission recommending formal approval for a 33 million ECU grant towards the cost of developing the project. The European Commission examined the grant application and concluded that, in prin<Col N="663" /> ciple, the conference centre justifies 33 million ECU of European Regional Development Fund support, subject to compliance of the tender procedure with public procurement rules and compatibility of certain proposed preferential tax reliefs with EU state aids rules.</P>
    <P>The Commission has since examined a third party procedural complaint and decided to close the case in relation to this complaint. Meanwhile, the Department of Finance is pursuing the issue of the taxation regime applying to the development, while the developers have themselves being pursuing an application for planning permission from Dublin Corporation for the project.</P>
    <P>On the basis of the most recent projected timetables for the planning and construction of the development, I have now made a formal submission to the Commission, on behalf of the Government, requesting an extension to the time limits for implementation of decisions on grant assistance under the operational programme for tourism grant from 31 December 2000 to 30 June 2003. A decision on this matter is awaited from the Commission.</P>

      <P>The deadline for receipt of applications under the new sports capital programme was 12 February last. Almost 1,900 applications were received by the closing date and these are being examined at present. Given the large number of applications received and the level of work involved in evaluating them, I have not been in a position to make final announcements on the 1999 round of grant allocations before now. However, I hope to do so in the near future.</P>
      <P>While all applications will be treated on their merits, special priority will be given to proposals for facilities in disadvantaged areas, in line with Government policy aimed at increasing participation in sport and recreation in these areas. Other factors such as equity in the spread of funding on a geographical basis and among different sports and community groups will also be taken into account in determining grant allocations. The detailed criteria to be applied in assessing applications are set out in the guidelines for the new programme which issued with the application forms.</P>
