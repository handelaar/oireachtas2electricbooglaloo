      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, I express my appreciation to colleagues in the House for ordering today's business so that we can pay tribute to the life and contribution of the late Deputy Pat Upton.</P>
      <P>The untimely and shocking death of our friend and colleague, Pat Upton, is a devastating blow to his wife, Anne, and his children, Henry, Paddy, Lizzie and Robert. I acknowledge the presence of his son Henry in the Distinguished Visitors Gallery this afternoon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On behalf of his friends and colleagues in the parliamentary Labour Party, and the Labour Party as a whole, I offer my sincerest and heart-felt condolences to his family at this sad and sor<Col N="1442" /> rowful time. Everyone who knew Pat Upton knew his political life, as much as his family life, was a partnership between himself and his wife Anne. Anne was his closest friend, confidante and adviser. Their entry into political activism and public life was a joint and equal venture. Pat and Anne also passed on their passion for politics and ideas to their children. Pat's sons Henry and Paddy, in particular, have a passion for politics and elections. Anyone who has seen Pat's boys direct a tally for a Dáil or Seanad election will be in no doubt of that.</P>
    <P>The news of Pat's death yesterday came as a great shock to me and to the entire parliamentary Labour Party, to our party staff and membership and to his constituents in Dublin South-Central. Pat was in the prime of his life. As someone who is only two years younger than him, I still find it very hard to comprehend that he will no longer occupy a place on these benches.</P>
    <P>I will miss the independence of thought and mind he brought to Dáil Éireann and his unique and individualistic approach to political life. As everybody in this Assembly will testify, Pat Upton was a skilled and capable Dáil Deputy. He attached equal importance to promoting the interests of his constituents and to his work as a legislator. He fought a number of memorable parliamentary battles, particularly during his time as Labour leader in the Seanad between 1989 and 1992. During this session, Pat was the most active member of the parliamentary Labour Party on Committee Stage debates where, I am proud to say on his behalf, he achieved some major improvements in the legislation within his brief. He also highlighted a number of issues which became more popular after he raised them, such as his call for more flexibility in the licensing laws, particularly in the greater Dublin region.</P>
    <P>As a Dublin TD, Pat had a tremendous love for Dublin and its people. He was a frequent visitor to Croke Park to watch Gaelic games and to Richmond Park to watch his favourite soccer team, St. Pat's. Even though he represented a Dublin constituency, he still had very strong ties with his native County Clare, of which he was immensely proud. He and his family visited Clare many times each year to keep in contact with family and friends in Kilrush. I know Pat, like his fellow county men and women, was immensely proud of the Banner County when it won All Ireland hurling titles in 1995 and 1997.</P>
    <P>It will come as no surprise to all of you in this Assembly that Pat's personal style was both unique and individual.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1443" /> In a curious and wonderful way, he brought both the skills and the keen mind of an academic to politics. He was not only successful in his own field of science but had a wonderful common touch. He saw beyond the futility of opposition for its own sake, which enabled him, for example, to pursue a committed bipartisan approach on the Northern Ireland aspects of his justice brief. That supportive approach was generously acknowledged by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform at the time, and I pay tribute to him for that.</P>
    <P>Pat took his own course in politics and was not afraid to be a minority voice at times. However &ndash; and I am proud of this &ndash; he was also always a team player and a loyal friend. He preferred to persuade others of his position with wry and ironic humour rather than rhetoric. For me, one of his great defining characteristics was his great passion: he was passionate about County Clare, about sport, about his politics and most of all, passionate about his family, of whom he was immensely proud. As political colleagues, we truly feel a great sense of loss, but it cannot compare with the sense of loss that Anne and his children must feel for the loss of a loving husband and father.</P>
    <P>If Pat held passionate views on politics, his politics were always the politics of ideas and not personalities. He believed in a clash of policies but not in political argy-bargy. He will be remembered as a man interested in the substance of politics and in getting practical things done for the welfare of the people. Our political life is greatly impoverished with his passing.</P>
    <P>The premature death in mid-life of a Deputy who had all the appearances of a fit and healthy man is an indication of the pressures public representatives operate under. The combination of the demands put on Deputies by the public and the manner in which we organise our business in this House is not conducive to a healthy lifestyle, nor can it be considered family-friendly. Despite the impression sometimes created by an uninformed minority in the media, most if not all Deputies work hours each week that few outside this Chamber would tolerate. I respectfully suggest that perhaps we need to look at the way we organise our business and to devise new structures and systems that will both reduce the pressure and make us more efficient.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party, Pat's family and I were all deeply moved by the tributes paid to Pat yesterday by the President, the Taoiseach, who called <Col N="1444" /> me &ndash; which I acknowledged and appreciated very much &ndash; the leader of Fine Gael, who was in contact with me and other friends and colleagues of Pat. They have communicated to me a sense of shock and empathy with not just the political process that we are all committed to, but with the unique tragedy of a family which has lost its standard bearer in mid-life and mid-career, the father who was devoted to them and to whom they were devoted for all he had brought to that household. We will struggle on without him, but we will not forget him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Is le fíor-bhrón im chroí a sheasaim anseo inniu ar ócáid bhás An Teachta Dála Pat Upton, Gaeilgeoir, polaiteoir, fear léinn agus fear lách. Ró-luath ar fad a d'imigh sé uainn.</P>
      <P>I join in the expression of sympathy by the Leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Quinn. It is with a sense of deepest shock and great regret that I utter these words of sympathy to the family, friends and colleagues of the late Dr. Pat Upton. It is always a sad occasion when one of our parliamentary colleagues passes away, but it is truly tragic when someone like Pat, in the full bloom of his life and career, is snatched suddenly from our midst.</P>
      <P>If I recall correctly, a Cheann Comhairle, with your agreement he raised questions on the Order of Business on two separate days last week to which I replied.</P>
      <P>Dr. Pat Upton brought many personal gifts to the principal tasks to which he devoted his life. This highly cultured and genial Clareman, who represented the people of Dublin South-Central with such pride and passion, was a person of tremendous ability, energy and commitment.</P>
      <P>His love of learning, in particular his great love for our native language and culture, marked him out as very special. He had the undoubted respect of his parliamentary colleagues on all sides of the House for his straight speaking and his strong sense of the value of public service. As a councillor, as a Senator, as a member of the Council of Europe, and as a Teachta Dála, Pat's contributions were always of the highest quality and conviction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the Cabinet meeting today, there was an <i>aide memoire </i>on social welfare matters for the Social Welfare Bill, 1999. It showed an anomalous restriction which the late Deputy Upton had come across in his constituency for people who, at a certain age, were losing out on deserted wife's benefit. He had come across this anomaly, raised it, followed it through and convinced the Minister <Col N="1445" /> it should be amended. It is ironic but not unusual of the man that he would follow this matter in detail. This, as with many other things he did, will form part of modern legislation and remove these anomalous restrictions.</P>
    <P>His loss will be felt most keenly by his wife Anne and by his family. I acknowledge the presence here today of his son, Henry, and ask him to convey our sympathies to the other members of the family. On behalf of all the members of the Government and all the members of my party, Fianna Fáil, I express our deepest condolences to them on this very sad occasion. To all the members of the Labour Party, his colleagues, we extend our regrets and sympathies. It has lost a fine and active colleague.</P>
    <P>Is mór linn go léir cailliúint thobann an Teachta Pat Upton, agus déanaimid comhbhrón lena chlann, lena cháirde, lena chondae dúchais, agus lena pháirtí.</P>
    <P>Ar dheis láimh Dé go raibh a anam fíor-uasal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to understate the sense of shock Members felt yesterday when they got the news, first that Pat was very seriously ill and finally that he had passed to his eternal reward. It is such a shock that most of us in this Dáil will remember to the end of our days exactly where we were when we heard the news that Pat had died.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I admired him immensely. He was somebody who was not just an academic with a brilliant mind but also had a sense of tolerance and practicality which made him an extremely effective politician. He was able to bring to bear on politics the resources of his brain and of his training in a tolerant way. He was &ndash; as I said yesterday in my statement  &ndash; one of the most original thinkers in the Dáil. He was not in any way confined by any political ideology in the way he approached problems. He was eclectic in the best sense of the word &ndash; he could draw from different sources of knowledge and apply them to practical problems and political life. I concur with the Taoiseach about the changes to the Social Welfare Bill which Pat Upton brought about. From talking to people since his death, I have heard of a case when he rang, on five or six occasions, an institution caring for a sick child to inquire how she was progressing. That level of personal interest in the cause of a constituent was entirely private and would never have come to public knowledge, or to my knowledge, had he not <Col N="1446" /> died, and that was typical of the politician he was.</P>
    <P>Having said that the Dáil as a whole feels a deep sense of shock and loss, the sense of trauma felt by the Labour Party must be almost unbearable. Knowing that party and Pat Upton's place in it, and knowing his capacity to disagree without ever causing hurt, his lovely character and his humanity, I can only imagine how traumatised all members of the parliamentary Labour Party feel. As the Taoiseach has done on behalf of Fianna Fáil, on behalf of my party I extend deep and heartfelt sympathy to Labour Members on what must be an awful day for them.</P>
    <P>It is worth repeating that Pat Upton was proud of his heritage as a west Clare man. He was committed to the Irish language, in which he was fluent. Throughout the early part of his political career, he was associated with another man who died prematurely, the late Frank Cluskey, and it is sad that both those close political friends and associates had their careers cut short. I believe there was no limit to what Pat Upton could have achieved in this House and it is a great tragedy that he will not see his role fulfilled, but on the other hand, his political heritage will be of immense and lasting benefit.</P>
    <P>On behalf of Fine Gael I convey our sympathy to Pat's widow, Anne, and his children Henry, Patrick, Lizzie and Bob. There is an empty space in their lives which will never be filled, but they can be proud that their husband and father has done his State, country, party, and his beliefs great service in an all too short life.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I join the Taoiseach and the Leaders of Fine Gael and Labour in expressing my sympathy and that of the Progressive Democrats to Pat Upton's wife Anne, his four children and his Labour Party colleagues. Deputy Bruton said everyone would remember where they were when they heard the news; I was at a function in west Dublin where I received word shortly after lunchtime, and it was difficult to believe that someone with whom I had a humorous conversation last week about future political events was now gone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Pat Upton was a decent, affable, honourable man, without pretension or ostentation. He reserved his most trenchant political criticism for the Progressive Democrats but he did so in a colourful way, devoid of personalised politics. There was nothing like a new Progressive Democrats initiative to get him firing on all cylinders. <Col N="1447" /> At a time when it was often discredited Pat Upton brought great distinction to the profession of politics &ndash; a profession in which we are honoured to serve. As Deputy John Bruton and others stated, he had an enormous store of knowledge. He was an academic but he was an academic who could see the big picture. Sometimes academia and political life do not marry well but in the case of Pat Upton it was a perfect marriage.</P>
    <P>I first encountered Pat Upton during the period 1989 to 1992 when, as a Senator, he was very interested in and made an enormous contribution to the Environmental Protection Agency legislation which was initiated in the Seanad at that time. I formed a view of him then which has remained with me. Pat Upton took politics and his job as a legislator seriously and he was always very thoughtful. However, he was also a compassionate and decent person. One of the issues on which he took a strong and courageous stand in recent times was that of refugees. More recently, when speaking in the House on local government reform, notwithstanding the fact that he was from west Clare, he spoke about this wonderful city he was so proud to represent and he looked forward to the day when there would be a modern system of local government in Dublin under which the lord mayor could be directly elected.</P>
    <P>The sense of loss everyone in the House feels about the passing of a colleague who was so young, popular and good humoured is nothing in comparison to the loss felt by members of the Labour Party and Pat's wife, Anne, and his four children. Henry who is with us this afternoon can be proud of the fact that he had a wonderful father who was an honourable politician and who brought great distinction to this House and to politics in general. He and his family can always be proud of that view which, I believe, is unanimous. It is right that that should be the view of somebody with whom we were proud to serve.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Green Party I offer my deepest sympathy to Anne, Henry, Patrick, Lizzie and Bob, the wife and children of Dr. Pat Upton. I acknowledge the presence of Henry in the House today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For Pat Upton's many friends, his family and his colleagues in the Labour Party, it is difficult to contemplate a day like today. The sadness felt at the loss of a colleague or friend is enormous when he dies in his prime but it is all the more <Col N="1448" /> shattering when he dies so suddenly. For a Deputy as hardworking as Dr. Pat Upton, many opportunities to relax, spend time with his family or pursue academic research would have been placed on the back burner in the hope that eventual retirement would provide him with more time away from the pressures of politics. That is what makes it so difficult when somebody dies so suddenly.</P>
    <P>Dáil Éireann will be much poorer for Pat Upton's passing. For the Labour Party, the loss will be unbearable. Pat had many friends in the Seanad and the Dáil and I have spoken to a number of them since the tragic news of his death. Some of them recalled how he lectured them academically in microbiology and other subjects. Others would have been lectured politically, something Pat always did in a very entertaining way. Indeed, he had a naturally entertaining manner which ensured that any resistance was weakened when he engaged in political debates. He had a friendly way of talking, as Gaeilge agus as Béarla, and like other Members I enjoyed many conversations with him.</P>
    <P>Pat Upton also educated many of us. He had a comprehensive knowledge of agriculture and science and was well versed in many other areas of expertise, areas about which only his family and friends would know in great detail. Outside the House he served many people through his hard work. Among them were my parents, constituents of his in Dublin South-Central, who speak fondly of him, as do many of his other constituents. He is at rest.</P>
    <P>The public and the media should reflect on the workload of those who take public life seriously. We should do likewise and ensure we do not sacrifice ourselves. We were proud to have Pat Upton as a colleague and to have served with him. I ask his son, Henry, to convey this message to his family. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam dílis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Many compliments have been paid to the memory of Pat Upton. We share the grief of the Leader of the Labour Party and the members of his party. Pat was a personal friend, a wonderful father and husband and a great loss to his constituents. An old judge in America once said to me that we should aspire to earn the esteem of our fellow human beings. Long before the end of his life Pat had deservedly earned the esteem of his fellow men and women. His memory will live on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I visited his wife, Anne, this morning and was full of admiration for her strength in putting her <Col N="1449" /> grief on the back burner to protect her family. Pat was lucky, he had a wonderful wife in Anne. She and her children will have a contribution to make.</P>
    <P>Pat had three qualities which it is so important for those in public life to have. He had dignity, decency and kindness which he recognised in his fellow human beings. He will be remembered for a long time. We will miss him. I extend my deepest sympathy and condolences to Anne and his children. May his soul rest in peace.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with others in paying tribute to our late colleague, Pat Upton. I was shocked when I heard the terrible news yesterday. Knowing how close he was to his wife and children I cannot even begin to imagine the effect on them of having lost a loving husband and father. They regularly accompanied him and they were always good company. When I met him in the corridor last week we exchanged stories and banter. That was the last I saw of him. Even though he was not well, he attended a function in the constituency on Friday evening which I did not attend. Not alone was he decent, hard-working, straightforward and good company he was always in great humour. He was devoted to his wife, Anne, and his children. His untimely death deprives Dáil Éireann and the people of Dublin South-Central of a man of great honour.</P>
      <P>I considered him to be more than a political colleague. He was a workmate, the kind of colleague who could keep a confidence and whom one could talk to in confidence. He was a man of his word. He was not all things to all people. One knew where one stood with him and he was capable of speaking his mind. That was a great side to him. He did not have an ounce of pretension or pride, even though he had much reason to be a proud man.</P>
      <P>His family has lost a loving father and husband, the Dáil and Dublin South-Central have lost an illustrious Member of Parliament and I have lost a good friend. I will miss him dearly. To Anne and the family I extend my deepest sympathy. I have no doubt that he is at eternal peace. He was a man who had justice in his heart. May his soul rest in peace.</P>

      <P>I extend my condolences to Anne and to Henry and his brothers and sister and to all Members of the House who are shocked and saddened by the untimely and sudden death of Pat Upton. He was a friend of mine, a constituency colleague and a neighbour. I knew Pat since <Col N="1450" /> his election to South Dublin County Council in 1991 and latterly here in the Dáil when I joined him as a Member in 1997.</P>
      <P>Pat was an exemplary Deputy. He was the type of role model who could be presented to any young person. He may have had one failing in that he worked hard, possibly too hard. One hopes that the lesson regarding the amount of work placed on the shoulders of a Deputy may be taken on board and that something will be done about it, as Deputy Quinn has mentioned.</P>
      <P>Pat always made incisive contributions and he was very witty. I especially recall the motion on the licensing laws when he sat through the debate for three hours often listening to tongue in cheek contributions. He was able to respond both seriously and tongue in cheek.</P>
      <P>He was a great numbers man. We often met in the constituency and swapped polling figures to see how we were doing. On the occasion of a count Pat did not need to get to the end of a tally because he could tell the order in which people were going to be elected within 15 to 20 minutes of the count commencing. He had a great facility in that regard.</P>
      <P>Politics was a family affair for the Uptons. Anne, Pat and the boys were often out in the constituency delivering leaflets and talking at various sporting and social occasions. The family enjoyed and loved what they were doing. It was a reason for being together, which they loved. It was great to see for other families in the constituency.</P>
      <P>There is a great sense of loss in Dublin South-Central. A number of community meetings have been postponed as a result of Pat's death. Deputy Gay Mitchell and I have met a number of community leaders and there is heartfelt sadness throughout the constituency.</P>
      <P>Pat was a marvellous storyteller. There were many social occasions during which constituency colleagues would meet. Pat would regale us with stories about the GAA, Clare and politics in general. I will miss him, as will the Dáil and his constituents. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam.</P>

The tributes paid by those who knew the late Deputy Upton so well and intimately show that his wife and family have lost a wonderful husband and father, someone of whom they have grown to be proud. I extend my sympathy to Deputy Upton's son, who is in the Distinguished Visitors Gallery, and to his wife and family. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam dílis.</P>

We served together as members of Dublin County Council from 1991 to 1994 when the councils were split into three separate bodies. My impression of Deputy Upton as a quietly effective politician, an extremely hard working man and a thorough gentleman was confirmed when I later became his constituency colleague. I express my deepest sympathy to his wife and family and to his colleagues in the Labour Party.</P>

      <P>There are 5,666 bodies in total on the Revenue list, but the number of those who are incorporated bodies is not to hand. In fact, the information requested by the Deputy would involve a very large amount of work of many weeks' duration. This is because it is only possible to interrogate the database of companies in the Companies Registration Office one name at a time. It is also the case that the name on the Revenue list may not precisely reflect the name of the associated registered company which would require additional searches of like names in individual cases, in order to be as thorough as possible.</P>
      <P>Our Department has very limited staffing resources in the company law administration area, and these are heavily committed at present on priority work dealing with the present spate of company law investigations.

      <P>The Butlers Engineering Group, Portarlington, County Laois, of which the person in question was a director availed of cover under the State export credit insurance scheme. Such cover was provided by ICI, acting as agents of the Minister. I understand that the only significant case involved a contract in Oman, for which cover was provided in 1984. This gave rise to claim, in respect of which an amount of £0.558 million was paid to the company in 1994.</P>

    <P>Loans granted by ICC are not a matter for my Department. However, in so far as State agencies under my aegis are concerned, I am informed by <Col N="1454" /> Enterprise Ireland that the following financial assistance was provided to the Butlers Engineering Group:</P>

      <P>This question refers to the medical evacuation of a fisherman with an eye injury from the MFV Nozdie on 21 January 1999. I do not consider that the evacuation was delayed though this allegation was made in inaccurate media reports following the incident.</P>
      <P>In medical evacuation situations at sea the Irish Marine Emergency Service, IMES, gives priority to speedy delivery of on scene first aid, life saving, <i>en route </i>support and provision of professional medical attention as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>In this particular incident, IMES called out Courtmacsherry Lifeboat as this was the quickest way to get medical attention to the injured fisherman. It was also the quickest way to get the casualty to professional medical attention ashore as a doctor and ambulance was arranged, by IMES, to meet the Lifeboat on its arrival ashore.</P>
      <P>The Courtmacsherry LB is a Trent Class with a 25kt speed and its estimated time of arrival, ETA, to the scene of the incident was calculated at 37 minutes.</P>
      <P>ETA's are calculated on the basis of response times plus the fastest speed capability of the various emergency response resources. ETA to the scene of the incident for the marine emergency service helicopter from Shannon Airport was 54 minutes and for the Air Corps helicopter from Waterford Airport was 55 minutes.</P>
      <P>The Air Corps helicopter was on the ground at Waterford Airport when the incident commenced for the Marine Rescue Control Centre, MRCC, Dublin. It had earlier that morning carried out training flights in the Waterford area.</P>
      <P>As Kinsale was closer to Cork Hospital and 11 nautical miles from the scene, it was decided to land the causalty there and a doctor met the Courtmacsherry Lifeboat on arrival. The casualty was immediately treated by the doctor and subsequently transported by ambulance to hospital in Cork.</P>

      <P>Section 9 of the 1959 Fisheries (Consolidation) Act as amended empowers the Minister to make by-laws in relation, <i>inter alia</i>, to open and close seasons in the interests of effective management protection and improvement of fisheries. Requests for such by-laws are made from time to time by the regional fisheries boards in the interests of fisheries in their regions.</P>
      <P>I understand that the South Western Regional Fisheries Board is formulating a proposal for a by-law in relation to the autumn closing date for trout fishing on all rivers and certain lakes in the South West Region. The board has confirmed that it has been engaged for some time in public consultation on this conservation measure and is currently working with Munster Regional Trout Angling Council to ensure that there is consensus in the region on the proposals prior to making a formal request for a by-law to my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The usual practice is that a regional fisheries board consults with local interests prior to application to me for the introduction of secondary <Col N="1459" /> legislation such as by-laws, and that I consult the Marine Institute and the Central Fisheries Board before coming to a decision. If I feel it necessary in particular instances I may also ask the regional fisheries board to advertise its intentions in local newspapers so that all local interests are aware of the proposal.</P>
    <P>I do not have an application from the South Western Regional Fisheries Board in relation to the close season on lakes in its area, but I understand the board is formulating a proposal in relation to rivers and certain lakes.</P>

      <P>The Government's Action Programme for the Millennium identifies as a key priority &ldquo;transferring small harbours to local control to develop marine leisure activities&rdquo; in the context of securing and enhancing the livelihoods of the coastal communities who depend on the sea for their future. Partnership 2000 commits to &ldquo;review the strategic options for the future development and management of declining commercial regional ports&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Strategy Statement 1998&ndash;2000 of the Department lists as a key objective a commitment &ldquo;to facilitate the restructuring of the roles of sub-regional ports&rdquo;. Within these contexts consultants have been contracted to undertake a review of State regional ports and harbours with a cargo throughput of less than 250,000 tonnes. The intention is to develop a general strategic framework for these ports and harbours, having regard to their differing conditions and potential, and to recommend generic and port/harbour related models and options which will best deliver the objectives of the strategic framework.</P>
      <P>The review of the 16 State regional ports around the country includes Ballyshannon Harbour. The regional ports and harbours covered by the study currently operate under the 1946 Harbours Act and range from those with busy commercial traffic to others catering for a mix of uses including seafishing and marine leisure as well as some which have experienced a severe decline in terms of commercial and seaborne trade. The intention is to chart the way forward for these ports and set out a long-term, coherent and sustainable development plan for their future and for the people whose livelihoods they support as well as identifying the best development options, including local authority control in terms of ownership, financing and activities/operations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Consideration of any development proposals and options for future ownership and management, use of assets and activities and operations <Col N="1460" /> of the regional harbours will follow the outcome of the consultants' review, which is expected to be completed in a matter of months. An extensive consultation process has been undertaken as apart of the review to incorporate the views of all interested parties prior to determination of the nature of restructuring of the ports concerned.</P>
    <P>In relation to the ownership of the harbour, I do not wish to pre-empt the outcome of the review of State regional ports under the Harbours Act, 1946. While I acknowledge that Donegal County Council, at a meeting on 14 December 1998, agreed to take over ownership of the harbour, any such transfer can only be executed with the consent of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, in accordance with section 8 of the Harbours Act, 1996. I consider that it would be prudent, however, to await the outcome of the review before proceeding to determine the most beneficial option for the future of the harbour.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The establishment of an emergency response unit under the direction of the Central Fisheries Board is an important element in my six point water quality action plan. I have already given details of this action plan to this House. The emergency response unit was included in the action plan to ensure that the resources of the Central Fisheries Board would be available in tackling in particular serious pollution incidents.</P>
      <P>Each regional fisheries board is responsible in its own area for both pollution prevention and response measures. Under my action plan, a regional board can rapidly augment its own resources to deal with any pollution incidents by availing of the expertise and other necessary resources of the Central Fisheries Board and, if necessary, other regional boards at very short notice to ensure that the incident is dealt with both swiftly and thoroughly.</P>
      <P>The number and type of people deployed by the central board to assist will depend on the gravity and nature of the incident. Since my action plan was announced the Central Fisheries Board has supported the regional boards in a number of pollution incidents. In 1998 the central board provided specialist support and analysis in some 25 pollution incidents cases, seven of which involved fish kills, and already in 1999 the central board has responded to four pollution incidents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I informed the House last autumn that I <Col N="1462" /> approved the appointment by the Central Fisheries Board of an environmental and catchment management co-ordinator to co-ordinate delivery of my water quality plan and the catchment management pilot projects. The co-ordinator took up appointment in early January and one of her priority tasks is to ensure effectiveness of the emergency response arrangements now in place.</P>

      <P>The current Common Fisheries Policy regime was adopted by Council Regulation in 1983 to the end of 2002 with provision for a mid-term review in 1992.</P>
      <P>The Irish negotiating position on the mid-term review was informed by detailed consultation with the fishing industry, and the 1991 Report of the Advisory Group on the CFP Review established by the then Tánaiste and Minister for the Marine, John Wilson, as well as the report by the Oireachtas Committee on Secondary Legislation.</P>
      <P>As Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, I began the negotiating process by tabling to the Fisheries Council in April 1992 a memorandum highlighting the issues of critical importance to Ireland in the mid-term review and continued to press the Irish case up to the end of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The outcome of the mid-term review was the adoption in December 1992 of Council Regulation No. 3760/92 establishing a Community system for fisheries and aquaculture. The regulation explicitly assimilated the concept of sustainable <Col N="1463" /> development. It also included an equally explicit commitment to relative stability, including the Hague Preference, to the restriction on access within the 12 miles, to technical conservation initiatives, to the need for an enhanced Community control system and to the restructuring of the industry to bring capacity in line with available resources. The outcome of the review also produced for the first time and under Irish pressure an explicit acknowledgment by Council that the costs of fisheries protection can fall disproportionately on member states and a commitment that this would be addressed was subsequently delivered on in the EU surveillance package 1994 under which the Irish fisheries protection service has benefited considerably. The retention of the restriction on access to coastal waters was another key objective delivered for Ireland in the review. Fundamental to the Irish position during the negotiations was that under the CFP the overall share of the fish stocks allocated to Ireland fell short of a fair and equitable level and that remains the Government's position as we begin the process of preparation for the CFP Review 2002.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the case mentioned by the Deputy, which concerns an independent journalist in Cuba who was arrested on 19 January and brought to trial the next day, when he was convicted of endangering the socialist constitution and sentenced to four years in prison. I am concerned that this trial did not conform to international standards of fairness, and, in particular, that his lawyer did not have adequate time to prepare his defence. The imprisonment of this <Col N="1465" /> journalist follows a number of warnings to him that Cuban journalists must be employed only by the State, as well as harassment for his independent activities and his contacts with opposition groups in Cuba.</P>
      <P>This person is one of a number of journalists working for independent press agencies which challenge the State monopoly in news dissemination. Like him, many have been threatened with detention and arrested. Some of these have been asked to leave the country, while others have been tried and imprisoned for their independent activities.</P>
      <P>In the case mentioned by the Deputy, this journalist is regarded by Amnesty International as a prisoner of conscience, imprisoned solely for peacefully exercising his right to freedom of expression. The EU will continue to press the Cuban authorities for the release of all such persons imprisoned.</P>
      <P>The EU has made numerous representations to the Cuban authorities designed to secure the release of dissidents. In the course of the past year, we have seen an improvement in the human rights record, in particular a steadily reducing number of political prisoners. It is all the more disappointing therefore that, during the same time, new cases of imprisonment should have occurred &ndash; especially after unsatisfactory trials. These include the case to which the Deputy refers.</P>
      <P>The EU's common position on Cuba makes clear that wholehearted co-operation with Cuba is unavoidably inhibited by the persistent absence of fundamental human and political rights. In its fourth evaluation of the common position, the General Affairs Council on 7 December last reiterated that our objective remains the encouragement of a peaceful transition to pluralist democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. As well as sustainable economic recovery and improvement in the living conditions of the Cuban people. In this regard we look to Havana for sustained evidence of progress in human rights. The Cuban Government has been made aware of the EU's insistence that full membership of the EU-ACP Convention will depend on full respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.</P>

      <P>On 1 December 1998, the Government approved changes to the operating arrangements for the National Emergency Plan for Nuclear Accidents. The revised arrangements, which are in the process of being implemented, will result in a streamlining of responsibilities among the Government Departments and agencies concerned and will ensure a more efficient and co-ordinated response to a nuclear emergency, should such an event occur. I hope to update the 1992 booklet entitled &ldquo;National Plan for Nuclear Emergencies&rdquo; to take account of these changes as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 138 and 139 together.</P>
      <P>My officials were kept informed of the situation with regard to the recent unofficial industrial action in Cork by Bus Éireann.</P>
      <P>Under its normal fleet replacement programme Bus Éireann hopes to purchase a total of 40 buses this year, of which 30 would be city type buses and ten would be suburban type buses. These will be allocated to a number of the cities served by the company. It is hoped that the first ten buses will be in place by May. As Cork is the largest of the cities served by Bus Éireann it will be allocated the highest proportion of these vehicles.</P>
      <P>In addition, CIE has submitted to me comprehensive proposals for public transport projects, including bus and rail, in its investment needs review for the greater Cork area. The proposals in the review are being considered in the context of the preparation of Ireland's application for post-1999 EU funding.</P>

      <P>The Road Transport Act, 1932, as amended, is the legislative basis for the licensing of scheduled bus services in this country. This legislation governs the provision of passenger services, other than those provided by Bus Éireann and Bus Átha Cliath.</P>
      <P>In considering an application for a licence under the Act, my Department is required to have regard to whether the proposed service is &ldquo;required in the public interest having regard to the passenger road services and other forms of passenger transport available to the public on or in the neighbourhood of the proposed service&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>My Department recently received a licence application from the bus operator concerned to provide a passenger service from Lucan to Ballsbridge. This application is currently under consideration and a decision will be communicated to the applicant as soon as possible.</P>

As evidence of this, the company has recently announced that it plans to purchase a further 20 fully accessible 33 seater midi buses as part of its 1999 fleet replacement programme.</P>
      <P>Regarding the additional 150 double decker buses, these are required urgently to meet the traffic congestion problems in Dublin as part of the Government's commitment to implementation of the Dublin Transportation Office Short-term Action Plan. They are of key importance in providing adequate services on the quality bus corridors which are now being developed.</P>
      <P>When orders were being placed last year for the additional buses, low floor double decker buses were only beginning to come into operation in the UK. In the circumstances Bus Átha Cliath did not have a sufficient degree of experience with the new designs to justify the placing of such a large order for the purchase of low floor double decker buses.</P>
      <P>However, progress is being made. Models which may be suitable have increasingly been brought into service in London in the past few months. Bus Átha Cliath is currently arranging to obtain vehicles from DAF, who are supplying the London buses, and from Volvo and Dennis, with the objective of conducting six month pilot trials. Details of the testing programme are being developed by Bus Átha Cliath. My Department has already discussed the pilot testing proposals with the EU Commission who share our commitment to accelerating the improvement in accessibility to public transport.</P>
      <P>These trials are scheduled to take place over the coming months and, depending on the results of the pilot tests, Bus Átha Cliath should be in a position to begin ordering accessible double-decker buses from 2000.</P>

      <P>In accordance with EU regulations, extensification premium is paid to herdowners with a stocking density of less than 1.4 LUs per hectare. The person in question applied for and was paid suckler cow premium on 59 suckler cows. Each cow is equivilant to 1 LU. He applied for special beef premium on 34 animals under the ten month scheme and one animal under the 22 month scheme. All these animals were under two years, therefore they were each counted at 0.6 livestock unit each i.e. 35 × 0.6 = 21 LUs. He also submitted and was paid on a ewe premium application for 18 ewes each at .15 LU 18 × .15 = 2.70 LUs. The total livestock units are 82.70-59 + 21 + 2.7. The total area declared by the person in question on the 1997 area aid application was 57.77 hectares. The total livestock units of 82.70 divided by the hectares of 57.77 gives a stocking density of 1.43 LUs hectare. As the stocking density is not less than 1.4 LUs hectare the person named has no entitlement to 1997 extensification premium.</P>

      <P>To qualify for aid under the 1994-97 scheme of installation aid a valid application had to be lodged in my Department showing that the applicant was under 35 years at the date of first setting up as a full-time farmer. The farm had to be owned or held on lease for a minimum period of five years. Where the land was owned, the transfer documents were required to be stamped by the Revenue Commissioners and lodged for registration in the Land Registry by 7 August 1997 and subsequently registered in the applicant's name before the premium  was payable. In the case of leased land, the lease had to be stamped by the Revenue Commissioners and, where necessary, approved by the Irish Land Commission by 7 August 1997. The applicant was also required to have the herd number registered <Col N="1472" /> in his/her name by that date. Since the applicant was allowed up to two years from the date of setting up on the farm to achieve the minimum labour requirement of one man work unit and to satisfy the occupational skill and competence criteria, evidence of meeting these criteria was accepted by my Department subsequent to receipt of an application.</P>

      <P>The person concerned submitted a ten-month special beef premium application in respect of four animals on 5 August 1997. Three of the animals have been paid in full. In the case of the fourth animal, LDZQ0002J, the date of birth entered on the application form &ndash; April 1996 &ndash; is inconsistent with the date of birth registered on the Bandon database &ndash; May 1996. The person concerned was written to on 15 May 1998 with a view to resolving this matter. However, we have had no response to date. Payment on the animal in question can only issue when the date of birth on the cattle identity card is consistent with the date of birth on the Bandon database.</P>

      <P>Under EU regulations governing the quota regime, farmers holding suckler cow quotas greater than seven premium rights are required <Col N="1476" /> to use at least 90 per cent of that quota every year, otherwise the part not used will be forfeited and returned to the national reserve.</P>
      <P>In 1997, the person named used only six of his nine premium rights and as he did not use at least 90 per cent of his quota, the unused quota, i.e., three premium rights were returned to the national reserve. However, on appeal, the three premium rights were restored to him and he was allowed retain his full quota of nine premium rights for 1998 as he gave an undertaking that he would fill his quota in 1998. In 1998, he again used only six premium rights and again, the unused quota, i.e., three premium rights has been returned to the national reserve. He has, therefore, a quota of six premium rights available to him for 1999.</P>

      <P>The headage schemes are open to registered herd owners who occupy and farm at least three hectares, 7.5 acres, of agricultural land, including rough grazing, commonage and-or mountain grazing, or have equivalent grazing rights in a designated area and who reside in the designated area in which their holding is situated. A farmer resident outside the disadvantaged areas but whose holding or part of &ndash; at least three hectares &ndash; is within a designated area may be eligible for grants under the scheme if he or she resides within 70 miles of his or her disadvantaged area lands. As the person named does not live within 70 miles of his disadvantaged lands he is not eligible under the headage schemes. If the person can provide evidence to my Department that he is living on a permanent basis within 70 miles of his holding, any applications he makes under the 1999 headage schemes will be considered.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 253 and 254 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new REPS measure on the conservation of natural heritage applies to natural heritage areas, special areas of conservation, and special protection areas and commonages. In order to qualify for the new measure, farmers or successors in title who own commonage shares and/or grazing rights must have declared the commonage for area aid in 1997 or 1998 and either held quota rights or <Col N="1483" /> lodged an application for livestock premia/headage. In the case of farmers with less than 15 livestock units (LUs) who have not made an area aid application, they must provide evidence acceptable to the Minister that in 1997 or 1998 they farmed the commonage and either held quota rights or lodged an application for livestock premia/headage.</P>
    <P>Young farmers who have taken over the family farm since 1997 will continue to be eligible to participate in the REP scheme subject to meeting the terms and conditions of the scheme.</P>
    <P>Leased commonage is not eligible for payment under the scheme. However, farmers who held commonage on lease and who had included this in their area aid applications in 1997 or 1998 and have now purchased the commonage will be eligible for payment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>In accordance with the EU regulations, extensification premium is paid to herdowners with a stocking density of less than 1.4LUs per hectare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The person named applied for special beef premium on 34 animals under the ten month scheme. Four of those animals had already been applied on and are therefore counted for stocking density but are not eligible for payment. He has been paid special beef premium on the remaining 30 animals. He also applied and was paid for 41 animals under the 22 month scheme and seven animals under the bull premium scheme. All these <Col N="1484" /> animals were under two years, and therefore were each counted at 0.6 livestock unit (82 × 0.6 = 49.2LUs). He also held a milk quota on 1 April 1997 for 31,158 gallons. In order to establish the livestock units equivalent of the milk quota it is necessary to divide by the defined national average milk yield  &ndash; 897 gallons. Therefore, 31,158 gallons gives 34.7357LUs. The total livestock units are 83.9357 (49.2 + 34.7357). He submitted a 1997 area aid application for 58.92 hectares. The total livestock units of 83.9357 divided by the hectares of 58.92 gives a stocking density of 1.42LUs/hectare. As the stocking density is not less than 1.4LUs/hectare the person named has no entitlement to 1997 extensification premium.</P>

      <P>The use of methyl bromide is to be phased out by 2005 under proposals currently under consideration by EU Council of Environment Ministers. The proposals provide for a reduction of 60 per cent in the use of methyl bromide by 2001 and 75 per cent by 2003 on the 1991 reference levels. It is hoped that this timetable will allow sufficient time for the horticulture industry to adapt to economically feasible alternative pest and soil control measures.</P>

      <P>I propose taking Questions Nos. 259, 260 and 261 together.</P>
      <P>Under the relevant EU regulation governing the disadvantaged areas schemes in all member states, a farmer must farm at least three hectares of utilized agricultural land in a disadvantaged area in order to qualify for payment of disadvantaged areas livestock grants. Farmers may qualify for ewe, suckler cow, special beef and extensification premia, however, if they have less than three hectares, as there is no corresponding minimum area prescribed in the EU regulations governing these schemes.</P>
      <P>There were 497 applicants in 1998 under the disadvantaged areas schemes who were deemed ineligible for payment of  headage grants because they declared less than three hectares of land.</P>
      <P>There are no proposals to remove the requirement that applicants under the disadvantaged areas schemes must farm at least three hectares.</P>

      <P>The Secretary-General, public service management and development, in the Department of Finance met Mr. Andreas D. Mavroyiannis, the Cypriot Ambassador at his request on Tuesday, 9 February. In a wide ranging discussion, the ambassador referred to the needs of Cyprus in the context of preparing for membership of the European Union. In particular, he asked about the possibility of Irish assistance in the areas of agriculture, environment, finance and justice. He also sought assistance in arranging familiarisation visits to this country by Cypriot officials.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1487" /> The Department of Finance is anxious to assist countries applying for membership of the European Union, wherever feasible. The particulars of any assistance would be a matter for each individual Department to determine taking account of the exigencies of ongoing work. For this reason the Department of Finance has written to the appropriate Departments and asked that they nominate an officer to consider the matter further and to respond directly to the ambassador. Consideration is being given by the Cypriot authorities to a more specific definition of their needs in the four areas.</P>
    <P>On the question of familiarisation visits, I would support relevant Departments who may be able to arrange short-term visits for senior Cypriot officials and the ambassador was informed that my Department would act as a conduit for these arrangements where necessary.</P>
    <P>Since then, on 15 February at the request of the Embassy of the Republic of Cyprus officials from the finance division of the Department of Finance met with the Cypriot ambassador and a representative of the Cypriot Central Bank to discuss the financial services sector and in particular the transposing of EU directives in this area into national legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have stated in replies to previous parliamentary questions on this issue on 9 and 16 February 1999, Irish excise duties do not discriminate between large and small breweries and the tax system is not a source of competitive distortion. In addition, the excise duty on beer was last increased in the January 1994 budget. So, in <Col N="1491" /> effect, all breweries have been advantaged by a relative decline in the share of its price which is attributed to tax. The share of price represented by total tax, including VAT, has declined from 37.6 per cent in 1994 to 35.6 per cent in 1998.</P>
      <P>Under Article 4.1 of Council Directive 92/83/EEC, member states may apply reduced rates of duty, which may be differentiated in accordance with the annual production of the breweries concerned, to beer brewed by independent small breweries within the following limits: the reduced rates shall not be applied to undertakings producing more than 200,000 hectolitres of beer per year, the reduced rates, which may fall below the minimum rate, shall not be set more than 50 per cent below the standard national rate of excise duty.</P>
      <P>I understand that Austria, Belgium, Germany, Denmark, Finland, Luxembourg and the Netherlands avail of the provisions of Article 4.1 of the directive.</P>
      <P>Any proposed low or staggered regime would also have to apply to imports of beer produced in small breweries in other member states in accordance with the provisions Article 4.3 of Council Directive 92/83/EEC.</P>
      <P>At present there are 13 micro breweries approved by the Revenue Commissioners. I believe that the overall package of measures announced in my recent budget, particularly in relation to income tax and corporation tax, will help to stimulate growth in employment in all sectors, including that of the brewing industry.</P>
      <P>I have no plans to introduce a zero, a low or a staggered system of excise duty on beer brewed in small scale breweries.</P>

    <P>Section 29 provides that certain child care facilities made available by employers on a free or subsidised basis will no longer be subject to a charge to tax in the hands of employees as a benefit in kind.

      <P>There are no proposals in the Finance Bill, 1999 to reduce vehicle registration tax on wheelchair accessible cars.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy is aware of the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations, 1994. The reliefs available under this scheme include the repayment or remission of VRT in respect of vehicles specially adapted for the transport of qualifying disabled persons &ndash; whether as a driver or as a passenger &ndash; and the repayment of VAT on the cost of the vehicle and also on the cost of adaption. The requirements and conditions pertaining to these regulations are set out in Statutory Instrument No. 353 of 1994, copies of which are available in the Library.</P>

      <Quest>the reason for the anomaly in the VAT regime whereby VAT on energy consumption is lower than that on conservation; the reason VAT on gas and electricity is 12.5 per cent while VAT on lagging jackets and other forms of insulation is 21 per cent; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no anomaly here. Ireland applies a reduced rate of 12.5 per cent VAT to all solid fuels, electricity, gas and oil for domestic or industrial heating. We have availed of a provision in the sixth EU VAT directive which gives member states the option of applying a reduced rate of not less than 12 per cent to items not on Annex H of the sixth VAT directive, but which were on a reduced rate in the member state concerned on 1 January 1991. The possibility of standard rating of energy products was considered by the environmental taxation group, which is chaired by my Department, in advance of this year's budget. To do so would create, <i>inter alia</i>, a huge difference between rates in Ireland and Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>As regards energy conservation products, such as lagging jackets and other forms of insulation, these were not on a reduced rate on 1 January 1991 and are not listed in Annex H of the sixth directive and must be standard rated at 21 per cent. Under EU VAT law, with which Irish VAT law must comply, it is not possible to zero rate or apply a reduced rate to such products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should say, however, that where energy conservation products are fitted to a property or <Col N="1493" /> dwelling they could qualify in certain limited circumstances for the reduced VAT rate of 12.5 per cent which is the VAT rate for construction, repair and maintenance of property.</P>

      <P>In the Finance Act, 1998, I provided for a new relief for corporate investment in certain renewable energy projects. The relief is in the form of a deduction for tax purposes from a company's profits. To qualify for the relief the energy project must be in the solar, wind, hydro or biomass technology categories including those successful in the Third Alternative Energy Requirement competition (AERIII-1997) and be approved by the Minister for Public Enterprise.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this measure is to encourage investment in renewable energy with the aim of facilitating the growth of electricity generation capacity using these alternative sources of energy. The measure is aimed at protecting the environment and reducing CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions. The Government's current target is to increase renewable energy based electricity generating capacity from 5.3 per cent in 1997 to 10 per cent by the year 2000.</P>
      <P>The relief is capped at the lesser of 50 per cent of all capital expenditure or £7.5 million for a single project. Investment by a company or group is capped at £10 million per annum, and unless the shares are held for at least five years by the company the relief will be withdrawn. The relief will be available for a period of three years commencing from the date of EU approval. EU state aid approval was given on 18 January 1999 by the Competition Commissioner, Mr. Karel Van Miert.</P>
      <P>It would be premature to consider further tax incentives for alternative energy until the operation of and benefits of these new schemes have been fully evaluated.</P>

In October 1997 the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr. Gordon Brown, indicated that the UK is unlikely to join in the lifetime of the current Westminster Parliament, barring some <Col N="1494" /> unforseen change in economic circumstances. The Chancellor also stated that, if the single currency is successful, and the economic case for Britain is clear and unambiguous, the UK should be part of it.</P>

This does not apply in the case of TSB or any of the State companies such as ACC or ICC. The proceeds from the sale of the TSB and public assets will accrue to the Exchequer. The question of reserving a specific number of shares at the offer price for long standing customers of ACC/TSB when floated on the Stock Exchange is something I will consider at the appropriate time.</P>

      <P>I would expect public service pensioners to have an interest in the outcome of the deliberations of the Commission on Public Service Pensions which is due to report within the next few months. As the Deputy is aware, the Commission was established in 1996 to carry out a fundamental review of public service pensions arrangements. Pensions increases policy is clearly an important element of the pensions system and as such it is appropriate for the Commission to examine it as an integral part of its review.</P>
      <P>As far as Government policy is concerned, the Government undertook &ndash; in its Action Programme for the Millennium &ndash; to protect public service pensions. On foot of this commitment, I announced in November 1997 that public servants who retired before the commencement dates of restructuring pay deals under the Programme for Competitiveness and Work  would benefit from those pay deals on a parity basis subject to a minimum adjustment on 3 per cent in their pensions, or 2 per cent in the case of those pensioners who had already received an advance payment of 1 per cent. The announcement also indicated that the decision to apply parity with a floor increase in the context of PCW restructuring deals was a one-off measure which was designed to meet the Government's commitment in full and to resolve the complex issue of pensions parity in relation to those deals. The announcement went on to say that the policy in relation to any future restructuring deals would be determined in the light of the final report of the Commission on Public Service Pensions. I would point out that parity has continued to be applied in relation to subsequent pay increases. I have no plans to change the policy.</P>
      <P>The Government welcomed the interim report of the commission which was published in November 1997 and looks forward to receiving its final report in the coming months.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 293 and 306 together.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for the transportation of foodstuffs spans a number of Departments. My colleague, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment is responsible for the Dangerous Substances (Conveyance of Scheduled Substances by Road) (Trade or Business) Regulations, 1980 (as amended). The transport by road of hazardous substances must comply with the provisions of the ADR Agreement &ndash; European Agreement concerning the international carriage of dangerous goods by road. The agreement provides that certain substances shall be kept apart from foodstuffs in vehicles and at places of loading, unloading or transporting. These regulations are enforced on the Minister's behalf by the Health and Safety Authority.</P>
      <P>My Department has responsibility for the European Communities (Hygiene of Foodstuffs) Regulations 1998 (S.I. No. 86 of 1998) which gave effect to Council Directive 93/43/EEC on the hygiene of foodstuffs. These regulations lay down obligations on proprietors of food business, including the requirement that such business is operated in a hygienic way. Under these regulations, proprietors are obliged to identify steps in the activities of the business which are critical to ensuring food safety and ensure that adequate safety procedures are identified, implemented and reviewed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Controls on the transportation of foodstuffs, including protection of foodstuffs from the risk of <Col N="1498" /> contamination, are specified in Article 20 of these regulations. This Article provides that conveyances and/or containers used for transporting foodstuffs must be kept clean and maintained in good repair and condition in order to protect foodstuffs from contamination and must, where necessary, be designed and constructed to permit adequate cleaning and/or disinfection. Where different foodstuffs or anything in addition to foodstuffs are transported together there must be effective separation of products, where necessary, to protect against the risk of contamination. Foodstuffs in conveyances and/or containers must be so placed and protected as to minimise the risk of contamination. Receptacles in vehicles and/or containers must not be used for transporting anything other than foodstuffs where this may result in contamination of foodstuffs. Bulk foodstuffs in liquid, granular or powder form must be transported in receptacles and/or containers/tankers reserved for the transport of foodstuffs. Such containers must be marked in a clearly visible and indelible fashion, in one or more Community languages, to show that they are used for the transport of foodstuffs, or must be marked &ldquo;for foodstuffs only&rdquo;. Under EU legislation, derogations currently exist for the bulk transport in sea-going vessels of liquid oils and fats and the transport by sea of bulk raw sugar.</P>
    <P>The regulations also provide that, where necessary, conveyances and/or containers used for transporting foodstuffs, must be capable of maintaining foodstuffs at appropriate temperatures and, where necessary, designed to allow those temperatures to be monitored. These regulations are enforced on my behalf by the Environmental Health Service in the health boards.</P>

      <P>I am aware that most of the health boards pay enhanced rates of subvention in particular cases. However, I understand that no priority waiting list for enhanced subvention is in operation in any health board area and that all applications are assessed in the normal way. I am satisfied that a sympathetic view is taken of cases where personal funds are exhausted, by increasing the level of subvention where possible. Where this does not solve a problem, a health board will try to provide accommodation in one of their own extended care facilities.</P>
      <P>The additional funding provided this year to fund the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, brings the total amount available for the scheme to £33 million. I expect this funding will cover the costs of subvention under section 7 of the Act, together with the costs of increased demand for subventions, enhanced subventions and contract beds.</P>
      <P>Under sections 52 (1) and 53 (1) of the Health Act, 1970, there is a statutory obligation to provide subject to charges where relevant, in-patient services to persons who have full eligibility. In-patient services are defined as &ldquo;institutional services provided for persons while maintained in a hospital, convalescent home or home for persons suffering from physical or mental disability or in accommodation ancillary thereto.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>However this obligation is qualified by section 2 (1)(a) of the Health (Amendment) (No. 3) Act, 1996 which states:</P>
      <P>2.&ndash;(1) A health board, in performing the functions conferred on it by or under this Act or any other enactment, shall have regard to&ndash;</P>
      <P>(a)the resources wherever originating, that are available to the board for the purpose of such performance and the need to secure the most beneficial, effective and efficient use of such resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a situation of finite resources it may not be always possible for a health board to meet all demand for its services immediately &ndash; hence a <Col N="1500" /> need for identification of priorities and assessment procedures which can result in waiting periods for services.</P>

      <P>The provision of services for people with physical and sensory disabilities in the Waterford area is a matter for the South-Eastern Health Board. I am aware that the board has been discussing with all those concerned the establishment of a regional assessment and treatment centre for children and adults with physical and sensory disabilities in the Waterford area.</P>
      <P>With a view to the coherent future development of services, the report of the Review Group on Health and Personal Social Services for People with Physical and Sensory Disabilities, &ldquo;Towards an Independent Future&rdquo;, recommended the structured involvement of voluntary services providers in the planning, co-ordination and identification of priorities for the development of services in this sector. To this end, co-ordinating committees for physical and sensory disability services, on which the voluntary agencies are represented, have been put in place in each health board. One of the functions of the co-ordinating committees is to advise the health boards on priorities for the allocation of funds available for the developments of services. Of £3 million &ndash; £6 million is the full year cost in the year 2000 &ndash; revenue and £4 million capital made available this year for the development of these services, £0.3 million revenue and £0.3 million capital has been allocated to the South-Eastern Health Board. The board will decide on priorities for the allocation of this funding in consultation with its co-ordinating committee.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 302 and 303 together.</P>
      <P>The provision of health services for people with physical and sensory disabilities in County Sligo is a matter for the North-Western Health Board. Voluntary agencies providing services on behalf of health boards may be grant-aided by a board under section 65 of the Health Act, 1953. The report of the Review Group on Health and Personal Social Services for People with Physical and Sensory Disabilities, &ldquo;Towards an Independent Future&rdquo;, recommended the structured involvement of voluntary agencies in the planning and co-ordination of services and in the identification pf priorities for the development of services. To this end, co-ordinating committees for physical and sensory disability services, on which the voluntary agencies are represented, have been put in place in each health board. One of the functions of the co-ordinating committees is to advise the health boards on priorities for the allocation of funds available for the development of services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1503" /> This year, a total of £13.4 million additional funding is being provided for the maintenance and development of services in the sector. Of this, £3 million &ndash; £6 million on a full year cost basis in the year 2000 &ndash; is for development of services and £4 million is for capital projects. From this, the North-Western Health Board was allocated £0.18 million for development of services and £0.18 million for capital projects in its functional area. The allocation of this funding is a matter for the board in consultation with the co-ordinating committee. Accordingly, the matters raised by the Deputy should be taken up, by the agency in question, with the North-Western Health Board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 304 and 310 together.</P>
      <P>The primary purpose of the new drug payment scheme is to bring about important improvements in the existing community drug schemes by merging the best elements of two existing schemes, the drug cost subsidisation scheme and the drug refund scheme and by replacing these schemes with a more user friendly scheme with added benefits to individuals and families. It is expected that the uptake for the new scheme will be broadly in line with the combined uptake of the drug cost subsidisation scheme and the drug refund scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scheme will commence on 1 July 1999 and will be facilitated by the introduction of information technology and the use of magnetic cards which will give pharmacists on-line access to the General Medical Services (Payments) Board and so enable them to ascertain when the threshold of £42 is reached by any member of a family, even though they may be using different pharmacies. While it was planned to introduce this technology at a later date, it is now being brought forward to enable the smooth introduction of the scheme. The need to comply with EU tendering requirements for the supply of the magnetic cards has meant a delay in the planned introduction of the scheme. However, the introduction of the neces<Col N="1504" /> sary IT at the initial stages will ensure a much more user friendly and efficient service for patients. The costs of the supply of cards will not be available until the tendering process is completed.</P>
    <P>A common medicines list will be introduced for both the drug payment scheme and the General Medical Services scheme in relation to the range of medicines paid for by the State under both schemes. While the detail of this list is under review, my position is that the comprehensive range of the most modern therapies currently available on the the GMS will continue to be paid for under the new scheme. As with medicines currently on the GMS scheme, the common list will be revised on a regular basis to take account of therapeutic developments and changes in products.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Health and Children</askee>
      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that an MRI scan identified by a neurosurgeon as necessary at the earliest opportunity involves a wait in Dublin of eight months for a public patient but for a private patient can be done in two days; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Magnetic resonance imaging facilities in the public hospital sector are available at Beaumont Hospital, where 5,587 patients are scanned per annum. This scanner services in-patients, out-patients and referrals from other health boards and hospitals. The service is provided during normal working hours and the current average waiting time is seven months for neurosurgery patients and three months for orthopaedic patients.</P>
      <P>I understand that requests for MRI scans at Beaumont Hospital are prioritised using strict protocols based on medical need. I have been advised by Beaumont Hospital authorities that there is no discrimination between public and private patients for this service. I have been further advised by the authorities at Beaumont Hospital that its MRI scanner is leased to the hospital's private clinic outside of normal public hours. The booking arrangements for patients are a matter for the private clinic and do not interfere with prioritisation of public patients during normal operating time. The income generated by leasing the MRI scanner to the private clinic goes towards funding the normal operation of the MRI scanner. If an emergency MRI scan needs to be performed outside normal hours, these patients get priority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has been aware of the need to monitor and evaluate overall MRI requirements in the public hospital service. Accordingly, an expert study of the existing arrangements for the <Col N="1506" /> provision of MRI facilities nationwide and likely future demand in this area was commissioned from Professor David Banta, an international expert in health technology assessment. Professor Banta's findings were announced in 1997. As I have already outlined to the House, he identified the need to develop MRI facilities at University College Hospital, Galway, St. James's Hospital and the new Tallaght Hospital. All three hospitals have now submitted applications to my Department for the development of MRI facilities on the foot of the acceptance of Professor Banta's recommendations. My Department is currently in discussion with the management of the three agencies concerning the installation and operational requirements for their facilities. Once these discussions have been satisfactorily concluded, I am committed to making the necessary resources available for the provision of MRI facilities at the three sites. I am confident that this will have a positive impact on the overall waiting list and waiting times for MRI scans throughout the public health sector.</P>
    <P>I am conscious that the pace of developments in this area is fast moving, both in terms of the technologies involved and their applications. I can assure the Deputy that the evolving needs of the acute hospital service for high-technology imaging facilities will be taken into consideration in implementing the commitments set out earlier.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board. Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Income guidelines have been drawn up by the chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these are revised annually in line with the consumer price index. However these guidlines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that his/her medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. Medical cards may also be <Col N="1507" /> awarded to individual family members on this basis.</P>
    <P>The guidelines, which are based on gross income less PRSI, currently allow for outgoings on rent in excess of £16 per week and expenses in excess of £14.50 incurred in travelling to work. Outgoings in excess of these amounts would have the effect of increasing the medical card guidelines for the applicant.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed that the Eastern Health Board does not have a specific budget for electric wheelchairs and these items are provided from the board's overall budget for aids and appliances. Since this Government took office an additional £9.325 million has been made available for aids and appliances, of which approximately one third would have been spent in the Eastern Health Board area. While specific figures for electric wheelchairs are not available, it is safe to assume that the additional funding would have enabled a substantial number of such items over and above the norm to be supplied. Persons seeking wheelchairs or other aids and appliances from the board are assessed by an occupational therapist. I understand that, as of November last, there were some 2,100 persons awaiting assessments. Persons awaiting assessment for a wheelchair are dealt with by the board on a Priority 1 basis and, once assessed, the order is processed immediately.</P>
      <P>Statistics on the numbers of people awaiting assessment for electric wheelchairs in the Eastern Health Board area are not routinely gathered by my Department. I have asked the board to provide the information sought by the Deputy and I will communicate further when this becomes available.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 315 and 316 together.</P>
      <P>The Expert Medical Group on Whooping Cough Vaccination was established in 1977 by the then Minister for Health with the following terms of reference:</P>
      <P>To examine persons who, it is claimed, have been permanently damaged by whooping cough vaccination, review the medical information available in relation to them and indicate whether, in their opinion, the damage is attributable to the vaccination.</P>
      <P>It was not within the group's terms of reference to make overall recommendations as its work was confined to the consideration of individual cases who presented themselves to the group.</P>
      <P>The group found that of the 93 cases, there was a reasonable probability that the vaccine was responsible for damage in 16 of these. The Government approved the making of an ex-gratia payment of £10,000 in each of these cases on condition that the persons concerned waived any further claims against the State or any public authority. The intention was to protect the State from further liability. Subsequent to the Government decision oral advice from the Attorney General's office was obtained in relation to the letters to be issued to the families concerned. There was no reference of a waiver in favour of manufacturers of whopping cough vaccine in the letters which issued to parents.</P>

In December 1998 the Eastern Health Board informed my Department that it had completed the trawl of its immunisation records for the period concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In October 1998 the Southern Health Board informed my Department that it had examined approximately 25 per cent of its immunisation records. This represented the records which were <Col N="1510" /> immediately available to it, bearing in mind that vaccinations, at the time, would have been carried out by staff of the then Cork Health Authority and by general practitioners. The board also began a process of collection of other relevant records from a number of locations. The board has informed me that this process is almost complete and that a medical team is beginning a clinical review of the records to determine whether they contain any of the lot numbers produced from batch 3741.</P>

This application was refused on the grounds of excess means. The applicant was advised of this decision in a letter of 1 April 1998. This decision was appealed later that month. The appeals officer in the Southern Health Board upheld the board's decision to refuse the subvention and advised the applicant accordingly. The applicant was also advised that it was open to her to reapply after three or four months, should there be a change in her circumstances. I understand that, to date, no new application has been received.</P>

      <Quest>the proposals, if any, he has to relocate the Children's Hospital, Temple Street, Dublin 1, on the campus of the new Mater Hospital, Dublin 7; when the work is due to commence; the timescale and cost of the construction; if the children's hospital will continue to have a full range of specialist and non-specialist paediatric services in the meantime; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[5313/99]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The relocation of the children's hospital, Temple Street, to the Mater Hospital campus has been under consideration by the religious orders who own the two hospitals. There is general consensus that the transfer would greatly enhance the quality of the paediatric hospital accommodation and would prove beneficial to both hospitals in terms of shared infrastructure support and complementary clinical services.</P>
      <P>My Department is also strongly committed to the amalgamation of the two hospitals on a single site, particularly in the context of the urgent need to address the critical service issues in both hospitals of the overall development of paediatric services, and also the proposed establishment of the area health councils within the context of the eastern regional health authority.</P>
      <P>In November 1997, I was pleased to be in a position to convey approval for the development of phase I of the Mater Hospital project at a cost limit of £25 million. In May 1998, I gave the go ahead for the appointment of the design team. Its initial task was the preparation of a development control plan for the entire Mater site, including the relocation of the children's hospital, Temple Street, followed by phase I of the development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that to date it has not been possible to give a firm commitment to the timing of phase II, incorporating the children's hospital, but there is a general acceptance that in the interest of ensuring that paediatric services for north Dublin are maintained to a high standard, phase II should proceed as quickly as possible after the completion of phase I. My Department is currently in discussion with both agencies regarding the relocation of the children's <Col N="1512" /> hospital on the Mater Hospital campus. I am conscious that pending the implementation of the above proposals it is vital that existing services for children on the north side of the city are maintained to a high standard. For this reason, in June 1998, my Department approved funding of £1.6 million for the refurbishment of Temple Street hospital's accident and emergency department. Work is well advanced on the planning of this development.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that the chairmen of the three Dublin paediatric hospitals recently undertook, at my Department's request, an examination of the role of the paediatric hospitals in the delivery and organisation of acute services in Dublin. The review group's report, submitted to the Department last year, contained a number of welcome proposals, in particular the establishment of a joint council comprising members from the three hospitals that would &ldquo;identify specific actions needed to facilitate necessary changes and development&rdquo;. The intention is that they will work together on the policy and delivery of national and regional services in order to avoid duplication and get added value from pooling their resources.</P>
    <P>My Department formally affirms its commitment to its continuing support for the three hospitals. In return, the Department will require that each of the three hospitals co-operate to the fullest extent in the provision of tertiary paediatric services and work closely to meet the regional needs of the east.</P>
    <P>I am confident that these developments are evidence of this Government's commitment to the enhancement of paediatric services both on the north side of Dublin and at national level.</P>

      <P>My Department's priorities for future investment in water supplies to serve the Dublin region are guided by the strategy set out in the greater Dublin water supply strategic study. This study has made a series of recommendations aimed at ensuring that the demand for water will be met and that satisfactory levels of service and standards will be complied with over the next 20 years. The study indicates that the total capital investment required to implement the recommended works over the period is in the order of £489-£566 million &ndash; 1996 prices. A copy of the study is available in the Library.</P>
      <P>A major investment programme has been put in place to ensure that the needs of the expanding Dublin area can be met. The programme consists of the expansion of the Leixlip water treatment works, a major water conservation programme and a number of other major projects to upgrade and refurbish treatment works, reservoirs and the distribution system. The expansion of the Leixlip works will add significant extra capacity to Dublin's water supply from next June onwards but will result in supply disruptions in certain areas in the meantime as part of the process of bringing it on line. Consumers will be kept aware of the position through notices in the media.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied that useful progress has been made in Ireland towards achieving the objectives of Directive 94/62/EC on packaging and packaging waste. In particular, the proposal by Repak Limited to develop its operations during 1999, and to enter into contractual arrangements for the recycling of up to 112,000 tonnes of packaging waste, will go a long way towards the achievement of Ireland's interim packaging waste recovery targets under the directive. The European Commission has not yet reported on the implementation within the European Community of Directive 94/62/EC.</P>
      <P>Packaging waste recycling and recovery targets to be attained by member states under the Directive do not apply until 2001 and 2005. In accordance with Article 12 of the directive, member states are required to provide specified annual data to the European Commission concerning packaging and packaging waste, commencing with data for 1997. Such reports are required to be made within 18 months of the end of the relevant year, that is by 30 June 1999. Member states are also required to report to the Commission on the application generally of this directive, in accordance with Council Directive 91/692/EEC standardising and rationalising reports on the implementation of certain directives relating to the environment. The first such reports will cover the period 1998-2000, and are required to be made within nine months of the end of that period, that is by 30 September 2001.</P>
      <P>It is understood to be the Commission's intention to publish, later this year, a draft proposal for the amendment of Directive 94/62/EC. This proposal is expected to focus on the scope for increasing recycling and recovery targets for member states, but may also address other elements of the directive.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the concerns of the National Council for the Blind referred to by the Deputy. Part M of the building regulations, which came into operation in June 1992, deals with access for people with disabilities including people who have an impairment of hearing or sight. Part M applies to the construction of new public buildings and to extensions of, or works in connection with material alterations to existing buildings.</P>
      <P>I intend to publish a consultation document later this year outlining my proposals for an amendment of Part M to make new houses commencing on or after 1 Janaury 2000, visitable by persons with disabilities. A copy of the document will be circulated to organisations representing the disabled, including the National Council for the Blind, for comments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A traffic signs manual was published by my Department in December 1996, and was issued to all road authorities. This provides guidance to local authorities on various aspects of the provision and maintenance of all classes of road signs and markings  including the provision of audible pedestrian or tactile signals and pelican crossings at particular locations for the benefit of the visually impaired. The provision of traffic management measures, including the provision of traffic lights, is a matter for the relevant local authority, in consultation with the Garda Síochána and-or <Col N="1516" /> the National Roads Authority in the case of national roads.</P>
    <P>With regard to non-national roads, including footpaths, my Department's memoranda on grants for non-national roads 1996-99 urge local authorities to pay particular attention to the needs of the mobility impaired, including the visually impaired, when planning and executing road works and particularly when planning and designing pedestrian facilities. Measures recommended include the avoidance of steep or irregular gradients or sharp changes in the alignment of footpaths, the dishing of kerbs, the provision of wheelchair ramps at pedestrian crossing points where possible and consultation with representatives of people with disabilities where appropriate.</P>

      <P>Essentially, occupational pension arrangements are a matter between employers and employees and, as such, there is no legal requirement on employers to provide a pension scheme for their employees. As far as employees and employers are concerned, the <Col N="1519" /> PRSI system is the major mandatory element in relation to pensions coverage.</P>
      <P>However, the main recommendations of the pensions board report, &ldquo;Securing Retirement Income&rdquo;, arising out of the national pensions policy initiative, involve the development of strong first pillar, social welfare pensions, based on social insurance, and major improvements in our second pillar, occupational and personal pensions, with the ultimate objective of increasing the number of people at work with supplementary pensions coverage to 70 per cent from less than 50 per cent currently.</P>
      <P>In the context of achieving this coverage target, the board addressed the issue of compulsory second pillar provisions. A considered approach was deemed appropriate, balancing the risks and costs of compulsion with the practical constraints involved.</P>
      <P>In the short-term, the board recommended introducing mandatory provision of access by employers to secondary pensions coverage for all employees. While other options were examined, namely mandatory contributions by employees, the self-employed and employers; the board felt that these should be held in reserve pending a progress review of the first measure after five years of implementation.</P>
      <P>The Government broadly accepted the approach taken by the board and I hope to publish a comprehensive pensions Bill later this year giving legislative effect to many of its recommendations.</P>

      <P>The free travel scheme is available to all people resident in Ireland, aged 66 years or over, to all carers in receipt of carer's allowance and also to certain people with disabilities under that age who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments. The other free schemes such as free electricity allowance, free TV licence and free telephone rental allowance are available to people living in the State, aged 66 years or over, who are in receipt of a social welfare type payment and to certain people with disabilities under the age of <Col N="1520" /> 66 who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments. In addition, widows-widowers aged from 60 to 65 whose late spouses had been in receipt of the free schemes retain that entitlement. This is to ensure that households do not suffer a loss of entitlements following the death of a spouse.</P>
      <P>The free schemes were originally designed to benefit mainly older people in receipt of a social welfare type payment who were living alone and required additional assistance. However, over the years, additional categories of people have been included. It is proposed to undertake a fundamental review of the free schemes, commencing in March 1999, to assess whether the objectives of these schemes are being achieved in the most efficient and effective manner and the issue which the Deputy has raised will be examined as part of this review process.</P>
      <P>Other supports which are available to the recently bereaved include the death grant which is a payment made to certain insured people and their families based on their PRSI contributions to assist in the payment of funeral expenses. From 6 April 1999, the death grant scheme will be redesigned and upgraded in the following way: increasing the amount payable five-fold from £100 to £500; and improving the coverage by easing the qualifying contribution conditions and extending the scheme to other PRSI contributors; These improvements, at an estimated cost of £10 million in a full year, are the first step in the development of a new and improved bereavement allowance. Other schemes, including the six week payments after death arrangements will be reviewed further in 1999.</P>
      <P>A widow or widower in receipt of a widow's or widower's &ndash; contributory or non-contributory &ndash; pension may be entitled to receive half the personal rate of: unemployment benefit, disability benefit, health and safety benefit, occupational injuries benefit, maternity benefit and adoptive benefit.</P>
      <P>In addition, a widow or widower may qualify for a fuel allowance and treatment benefits. They may also be entitled to assistance under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme and a medical card, both of which are administered by the health boards.</P>

      <P>My Department administers a range of payments for people who are ill and people with disabilities. Some of these payments are primarily designed to cater for people who are temporarily absent from employment due to illness, while other schemes cater for those who have more long-term or permanent incapacities and for people with disabilities. While there is a general rule that people who are temporarily absent from employment due to illness are not allowed to engage in work, it is nevertheless recognised that support and encouragement should be provided for people with disabilities and those with long-term incapacities to become more self-reliant and less dependent on the social welfare system by facilitating them in taking up available employment and training opportunities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Considerable progress has been made in this regard in recent years. For instance, 1,000 places on the back-to-work allowance scheme have been designated for people with disabilities who are receiving disability allowance or blind person's pension. Participants on this scheme can retain their social welfare payments on a sliding scale <Col N="1522" /> for three years where they take up employment or for four years where they engage in self-employment Participants can also keep any additional benefits, such as the medical card, rent allowances, free travel, etc. The 1999 budget provides for the introduction from July 1999 of a special pilot scheme for the very long-term unemployed, i.e. those unemployed for five years or more. Under this pilot programme, participants will be placed with employers for a period of five or six weeks while continuing to receive their full social welfare entitlements, together with a special allowance of £25 per week towards travel and meal costs. At the end of the trial period, they can then proceed automatically on to the back-to-work allowance. This pilot programme will also be open to those who have been in receipt of disability allowance or blind person's pension for five years or more.</P>
    <P>These measures, which complement the existing employment supports which are currently available through the National Rehabilitation Board and FÁS, are of particular importance to people with disabilities who can access the open labour market. However, it is recognised that many people with disabilities are not in a position to engage in such employment. Accordingly, additional measures are required to facilitate people with disabilities so that they can engage in other forms of employment and training such as sheltered or rehabilitative employment. In this regard, a significant weekly income disregard of £50 is provided in the case of the disability allowance, blind person's pension and supplementary welfare allowance schemes where the person engages in rehabilitative employment.</P>
    <P>In addition to the above measures, recipients of disability benefit are, with the prior approval of the Department, allowed to engage in part-time work which is of a rehabilitative or therapeautic nature or in occupational training courses. Invalidity pensioners are similarly allowed to engage in occupational training courses and in rehabilitative or therapeutic work on a full-time basis.</P>
    <P>While there is a range of incentives currently available to facilitate people with disabilities and those with long-term incapacities in taking up available employment and training opportunities, it is nevertheless recognised that more needs to be done. In this regard, the potential for further enhancements to the system will continue to be examined in the light of the recommendations contained in the report of the commission on the status of people with disabilities and having regard to the available resources.</P>

      <P>Funding is available from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs towards the cost of staffing and equipping of local resource centres which provide a focal point for community development activities in disadvantaged areas under the community development programme, family and community services resources centre programme and the annual once-off grants schemes. The community development programme, CDP, was established in 1990 in recognition of the role of community development in tackling poverty and disadvantage. The programme provides financial assistance to projects towards the staffing and equipping of local resource centres which provide a focal point for community development activities in an area and to other specialised community development projects and initiatives having a strategic importance.</P>
      <P>The CDP is aimed at addressing all areas of poverty and disadvantage. Projects are concerned with the needs of women and children, those with disabilities, the homeless, lone parent families, the elderly, the unemployed, young people at risk, travellers and other disadvantaged groups. At present there are more than 100 projects participating in the programme or in the process of being set up. The level of funding available to individual projects varies from £40,000 to £61,000 subject to the specific circumstances and the needs of the project. The allocation for the programme in 1999 is almost £8 million, most of which is committed to existing projects.</P>
      <P>Funding is also available towards the staffing and running costs of community resource centres under the family and community services resource centre programme. The aim of a family and community services resource centre is essentially to help combat disadvantage by improving the functioning of the family unit. Centres can provide special services for lone parent families, young mothers and others considered in need of extra support and can act as a first step to community participation and social inclusion for the most vulnerable and marginalised families. Centres funded under the programme generally receive an allocation of between £15,000 and £40,000 although this varies in the light of specific circumstances and needs. The family and community services resource centre programme has received an allocation of £2.13 million for 1999. There are currently 31 centres participating in the programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Community groups wishing to apply for inclusion in either of the above programmes can receive further information from, or make applications directly to, the voluntary and community <Col N="1524" /> services section of my Department. Small once-off grants may also be available under the scheme of grants to voluntary organisations to locally-based voluntary and community groups working with disadvantaged groups or in disadvantaged areas which operate from community centres towards the cost of equipment and renovations. The actual grants paid vary in the light of individual circumstances and needs and takes account of the overall demands that must be met. I might mention that funding for community centres which are primarily engaged in providing social and recreational activities is the responsibility of the local authorities.</P>

      <P>Rent supplements are normally calculated to ensure that the person, after the payment of rent, has an income equal to the weekly supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) rate appropriate to their household's circumstances, less £6. This £6 represents the minimum contribution which recipients are required to pay from their own resources.</P>
      <P>In addition to the minimum contribution, recipients are required to contribute any assessable means in excess of the appropriate SWA rate. The current SWA rate for a couple is £109.60 per week. Any increase in income over and above that rate will result in a decrease of that amount in the rent supplement rate payable.</P>
      <P>When the couple in question were in receipt of invalidity pension, personal rate plus qualified adult, at £129.50 per week, the contribution they were required to pay towards their rent was £25.90 per week in total, leaving them with £103.60 per week to meet their other needs.</P>
      <P>As the rent supplement recipient and his spouse are now in receipt of invalidity and old age non-contributory pension at current weekly rates of £83.00 and £72.50 respectively, their total income is now £155.50 weekly, an increase of £26 per week. As the appropirate rate of SWA for a couple is £109.60 weekly, their personal contribution towards their rent has increased by £26 to £51.90 weekly, £45.90 excess plus £6 minimum contribution.</P>
      <P>The couple concerned have appealed the decision to the appeals officer in the Southern Health Board. The decision was upheld by the appeals officer and the couple were informed of this decision on the 21 December 1998.</P>

    <P>Every effort is made to recover overpayments having regard to the capacity of the individuals concerned to make repayments. In some cases it may be possible to recover the overpayment immediately. It is not possible to say what percentage of overpayments in a year is recovered in the same year as details are not kept in that format. However, in 1997, £8.9 million was recovered in respect of both fraud and non-fraud overpayments, some of which occurred in that year and some in earlier years. Separate figures are not maintained for amounts recovered in respect of fraud overpayments.</P>
    <P>Following a review of the procedures for recovering overpayments a new debt management strategy was developed in early 1998 to focus on a more effective system of recovery, with particular emphasis being directed at ensuring that those who have the capacity to repay are required to do so over a timeframe which reflects their financial situation.</P>
    <P>Overpayments should be viewed in the context of the scale of operation of my Department. In 1997 the value of overpayments represented approximately half of one percent of total scheme expenditure. There were some 870,000 recipients of a weekly social welfare payment at the end of 1997 and over half a million families were in receipt of child benefit.</P>

      <P>My Department has no functions in relation to the activities of performing arts examining bodies. Interaction with such bodies would appear in the main to be more appropriate to my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that I recently published Succeeding Better, an independent and extensive review of the arts plan 1995-98, copies of which are in the Oireachtas Library. As part of the review process, the consultants by way of newspaper advertisement invited submissions from all interested individuals and groups. I have forwarded a copy of the review to An Chomhairle Ealaíon with a request that it take the conclusions and recommendations of the report into consideration in the preparation of a new arts plan, which I understand is at an advanced stage and I expect will be submitted for my consideration in the near future.</P>

      <P>The level of cross-Border co-operation in relation to artistic activity generally is already significant. An Chomhairle Ealaíon is the statutory body charged, <i>inter alia</i>, with the promotion of the practice of the arts here. An Chomhairle and the Arts Council of Northern Ireland have a long tradition of cross-Border co-operation. I would be fully supportive of both bodies in any initiatives they may develop to further increase the level of co-operation that already exists.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the preparation by An Chomhairle Ealaíon of a new arts plan is at an advanced stage. I expect that this plan, when submitted for my consideration, in setting out a strategy in relation to the development of the arts for the next number of years, will include proposals in relation to the continued development of arts activity with a cross-Border dimension.</P>

      <P>Tógfaidh mé Ceisteanna Uimh. 349 agus Uimh. 350 le chéile.</P>
      <P>It is a matter for IUCN, the World Conservation Union, to decide the category of protected area under which a site should be registered. Wicklow Mountains National Park is registered by IUCN as a Category II protected area and any alteration to its status is ultimately a matter for that organisation. The IUCN guidelines for Category II are being forwarded to the Deputy under separate cover.</P>
      <P>Following concern expressed some time ago by another Deputy about the implications of Category II status for activities within the National Park, I asked Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department, to clarify with IUCN whether or not activities such as traditional grazing practices are consistent with the criteria for Category II, and particularly with the requirement to &ldquo;prevent exploitation or occupation inimical to the purposes of designation&rdquo;. While it is the view of my Department that these practices are not inconsistent with conservation of the area, if IUCN are of the opinion that such activities make it more appropriate to register the National Park in another of their recognised categories rather than in Category II, they are entitled to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Wicklow Uplands Council was established as an independent body in 1996. Neither I nor my Department has any function in relation to <Col N="1529" /> its operation. The regional manager of Dúchas, National Parks and Wildlife, has, on invitation, attended meetings of the Wicklow Uplands Council as an observer.</P>
    <P>In October 1998, following consideration of the RPS Cairns report, I announced my decision to establish a council for Wicklow Mountains National Park. All interested parties will be invited in the near future to attend a convention which will be independently chaired and which will nominate people for appointment to the council. I further propose that, when the national park council is formed, it initiates the development of a wider uplands partnership in co-operation with Wicklow County Council.</P>

      <P>An amendment to these regulations by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government in August 1998, relaxed the requirements in relation to applicants in full time employment. Consequently, there was an increase of in excess of 20 per cent in September 1998, in the number of applications &ndash; 610 &ndash; compared with the previous year &ndash; 503. The number of applications in December &ndash; 432 &ndash; was similar to the number in the previous year &ndash; 429.</P>
      <P>In addition, the accomodation which was normally used for the holding of the examination for the granting of these licences became unavailable and it was necessary to seek an alternative venue.

      <P>My responsibilities in disability matters relate to the development of a Government strategy to give effect to the Report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities &ndash; A Strategy for Equality. In this regard an interdepartmental taskforce, chaired by my Department, is currently drafting a plan of action on the rights of people with disabilities based on this report. The issue of access to public transport for people with disabilities is being considered by the taskforce in the context of this work. It is intended, on completion, to submit the plan of action to Government.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, responsibility for public transport rests with my colleague, Deputy Mary O'Rourke, Minister for Public Enterprise, with whom he may wish to raise the matter.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that, like all operational matters, community policing is kept under constant review by the Commissioner. As part of this process, a formal review of community policing was recently undertaken by the Garda authorities to ensure that its effectiveness and efficiency is maintained and improved. As a result of this review, a number of policy changes were recommended. I understand that the Commissioner is currently examining these recommendations, and having examined them, will make any changes to existing policy which he deems necessary.</P>
      <P>I am assured by the Garda authorities that community policing in the Whitehall area of Dublin is operating effectively and efficiently and is meeting the needs of the community. The local gardaí and the local community are in continuous contact. These links can be informal, through, for example residents associations; and formal, through such initiatives as Neighbourhood Watch, Business Watch, Campus Watch and the Garda Schools Programme.</P>

      <Quest>if consideration will be given towards increasing the monetary limit from the present £600 to £2,500 in relation to the current review of the small claims court regime in view of the fact that the limit in this jurisdiction is considerably lower than that in the United Kingdom; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>In line with the established policy in this issue, I propose that the monetary limit on small claims will be increased on a phased basis to £1,000. I expect to address the issue of increasing the monetary limit on claims which may be made under the procedure, which currently stands at £600, when my Department's review of the procedure is completed shortly.</P>
      <P>In the context of the review my Department has, in recent months, reached agreement on the operation of the small claims procedure with the main staff interests involved.</P>
      <P>Any move to increase the monetary limit above the £1,000 target should, I believe, be considered in the context of an examination of the experience of the procedure at the £1,000 level.</P>

Interviews for the four development and monitoring officer posts, to assist in advancing the Integrated Services Project in the target areas and report centrally on progress being made, are now complete and successful candidates selected. Formal contracts are being drafted and, when these have been signed, I will provide the Deputy with the information which he has sought regarding the officers' names and contact numbers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Meanwhile, participating Government Departments and statutory agencies have nominated officials at national and local level to drive the project within their respective Departments and agencies. It is envisaged that officials at local level <Col N="1540" /> will work together as a team with development and monitoring officers, in consultation with the local communities in the target areas.</P>
    <P>These same Departments and agencies have also been asked to examine more specific proposals for local or sectoral action in the target areas and it is expected that establishment of implementation arrangements on the ground will facilitiate early completion of this examination, and final decisions as to priority actions to be initiated.</P>
    <P>It will probably be the end of this year or early next year before the Inter-Departmental Committee on Local Development will be in a position to consider lessons from the first phase of the project, and potential for application of these lessons to other urban areas of extreme disadvantage.</P>

Under this programme, while special priority will be given to proposals for facilities in disadvantaged areas, in line with Government policy aimed at increasing participation in these areas, other factors, e.g. geographical spread of the allocations, will also be taken into account in determining the grant allocations. Disadvantaged areas are defined as those areas which have been designated under the Operational Programme for Local, Urban and Rural Development 1995-1999.</P>
      <P>The terms and conditions for the new programme provide that grant aid up to a maximum of 70 per cent of the total project cost may be allocated in the case of local projects. In the case of disadvantaged areas, local projects may be funded up to a maximum of 80 per cent.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 385 to 387, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of the case made by the parents of children attending Scoil an Spioraid Naoimh <Col N="1546" /> (cailíní) in support of their application for disadvantaged status. The primary mechanism for addressing educational disadvantage is the disadvantaged areas scheme. As a result of the inclusion of Scoil an Spioraid Naoimh (buachillí), in this scheme it is in receipt of additional funding. Scoil an Spioraid Naoimh, buachillí, gained entry to the disadvantaged areas scheme when it amalgamated with Scoil Columbhain, which already had disadvantaged status.</P>
    <P>A study of educational disadvantage conducted by the Combat Poverty Agency and the Education Research Centre in 1996 concluded that disadvantaged status should be confined to 16 per cent of the school-going population. The study noted that such status had already been granted to 17 per cent of pupils. As an alternative to extending the disadvantaged areas scheme to additional schools, the study recommended that available resources should be targeted on the most disadvantaged schools already in the scheme.</P>
    <P>The breaking the cycle of disadvantage pilot project was subsequently introduced to deliver the sort of targeted support recommended in the study. The Department's overall response to the problem of educational disadvantage is currently under review. The objective is to ensure that all available resources are properly targeted so that children who are educationally disadvantaged  receive the support they need to maximise their potential in the education system.</P>
    <P>As the Deputies will be aware the staffing of a national school for a particular year is determined by the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous year. The enrolment of Scoil an Spioraid Naoimh (cailíní) on 30 September 1997 of 259 pupils warrants a staffing of a principal and nine mainstream class teachers for the 1998-99 school year. This is the correct staffing in accordance with the above agreement. In addition, the school has the services of a remedial teacher for the 1998-99 school year.</P>
    <P>The school authorities have been in contact with me concerning the resources available to the school. I am having the issues raised by them examined and will be in touch with them shortly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 390 and 391 together.</P>
      <P>Three of my Department's psychologists share the task of providing a psychological service to the primary schools in Killinarden. They decide at the beginning of each school year how many visits they may realistically make to each school. They then discuss with each school principal how their time in each school may best be used. This will vary from year to year. For example, during the previous school year, 1997-98, a large number of assessments was carried out in the Killinarden schools for the purpose of placement in special classes.</P>
      <P>The psychologists assigned to the Killinarden schools are aware that teachers have identified a large number of students as possibly being in need of individual assessment. However, psychological assessment is just one part of the process of consultation about an individual child. Helpful recommendations about remedial treatment of behavioural management can sometimes be made on the basis of a teacher's description of the child's classroom behaviour. In some cases, it may be felt that individual psychological assessment may not contribute significantly to the child's welfare.</P>
      <P>Individual assessment is only one aspect of the work of an educational psychologist. Each assessment involves, on average, approximately 1.5 days work, devoted to the child concerned. Other types of psychological support can be effective in indirectly helping larger numbers of children. For example, the psychologists also engage in group screening tests, in consultation work with remedial, resource and support teachers, in staff development and in work with groups of children or parents. School principals may decide that time spent in this kind of work is a higher priority for their school at a particular time than individual assessment work. This has been the case in Killinarden from time to time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am about to establish the National Educational Psychological Service Agency in order to provide an adequate and helpful psychological service to schools. In planning the development of the agency, it will be important to draw on the experience of those schools that have had access to the psychological service in recent years. The school principals in Killinarden will be contacted shortly by senior members of my Department's psychological service to discuss the various issues <Col N="1549" /> and needs which they have identified and to discuss possible future strategies.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 392 and 393 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the position regarding the two schools in question. Both schools are included in my Department's disadvantaged areas scheme and as a result are in receipt of supplementary capitation funding and have enhanced staffing entitlements.</P>
      <P>In addition, Knockmore senior national school is included in the home-school-community liaison scheme; the support teacher pilot project; and the Breaking the Cycle scheme.</P>
      <P>Scoil an Croí Ró Naofa is included in the home-school-community liaison scheme; the support teacher pilot project; and the early start project.</P>
      <P>The Early Start pre-school project is currently operating on a pilot basis in 40 locations. The locations in question were selected on the basis of priority of need following a detailed assessment of need across disadvantaged areas. The operation of the Early Start project is currently being reviewed in my Department as part of the preparation of a White Paper on Early Childhood Education which will set out my proposals for the future development of services in this area. It would not be my intention to expand the Early Start project in advance of the White Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that Scoil an Croí Ró Naofa applied for inclusion in the urban phase of the Breaking the Cycle scheme. Unfortunately, the school was not placed high enough in terms of priority of need to secure inclusion in the scheme. The operation of the Breaking the Cycle scheme is being monitored by my Department and is being evaluated by the Education Research Centre. The question of any extension of the scheme <Col N="1550" /> will be considered in the light of experience gained with the present phase of the scheme.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputies that the needs of the schools to which they refer will be considered in the context of any further expansion of support services for disadvantaged schools which may be undertaken.</P>

      <P>The last formal extension of the disadvantaged areas schemes took place in 1994 when an additional 54 primary schools and 55 second level schools were included in the schemes.</P>
      <P>On that occasion applicant schools were assessed as to priority of need by reference to a range of criteria which had been agreed between the Department, schools' management and the teacher unions. At primary level, the criteria in question took account of such factors as the levels of unemployment; local authority housing and rented accommodation occupancy; and medical card holding among the families of the pupils concerned. The total points scored by schools under the above headings were then weighted by a factor which took account of the prevailing pupil teacher ratios among the applicant schools. At second level, account was also taken of rural disadvantage, lone parent households, literacy-numeracy difficulties and lack of formal educational qualifications.</P>
      <P>Arising from this exercise, the highest and lowest values scored by the selected schools under the criteria were as follows:</P>

      <P>Bullying in schools is an issue of particular concern to me. It is a most complex and difficult problem and this is recognised in the depth and detail of our national policy. This policy was prepared by an expert working group and was put in place in 1993 following consultation with the partners in education. The policy includes guidelines which were issued to all schools and are available to the public from my Department. The purpose of the guidelines is to assist schools in devising school based measures to prevent and deal with instances of bullying behaviour and to increase awareness of the problem among school management, staff, pupils and parents. I feel sure that they have been of very real assistance to schools in dealing with this issue and that schools take their responsibilities in this area very seriously.</P>
      <P>A central aim of the new subject of social, personal and health education currently being developed for second level schools is the promotion of positive mental health in young people so that they will neither perpetrate nor condone any sort of violence against others. The programme also includes training in tolerance and assertiveness so that students may cope with situations where they are being pressurised or bullied.</P>
      <P>In situations where it is not possible to resolve difficulties arising from bullying behaviour locally, it is open to parents to bring these matters to my attention and I will arrange to have appropriate inquiries made.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 396, 407 and 408 together.</P>
      <P>I have received representations from student teachers at the University of Limerick regarding their expenses while engaged in teaching practice and the position is that teaching practice is not a paid activity in any institution and is viewed as training rather than employment. It is an integral part of the curriculum of the degree programmes in education and there is no special financial assistance available to students for this aspect of their course.</P>
      <P>I would point out that the four year second level teacher education programmes in the University of Limerick are approved courses for the purposes of the higher education grants scheme. Under the terms of that scheme, grantholders who are required to participate in off-campus placement as an integral part of their course may have their grant entitlement paid in the normal manner. Accordingly, student teachers who are eligible for grant assistance continue to receive their entitlements while undertaking teaching practice.</P>
      <P>On the general question of placement programmes, I understand that all students attending the University of Limerick undertake some form of experience learning placement during the course of their degree programmes. I further understand that some placement programmes are remunerated while others are not. Students on work experience placement under the university's co-operative education programme, such as those placed in the Civil Service, are generally paid. Student teachers are not included in the co-operative education programme.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 399 to 401, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>In dealing with public contracts for the confidential printing of examination question papers my Department's policy is to obtain the services of reputable and reliable firms in the context of fair commercial competition with the objective of obtaining full value for public funds.</P>
      <P>The tender for the confidential printing of the examination papers each year is competitive and my Department receives tenders from outside Ireland in this regard. This approach is in accordance with the fact that we are operating in the Single European Market which brings considerable benefits to this country by giving access to EU markets for Irish companies and opens our markets to our EU partners in the reciprocal arrangements that apply.</P>
      <P>While I am not at liberty, for security and commercial reasons, to divulge details of the companies that were awarded the confidential printing contracts, I can confirm that in 1996 all examination question papers were printed in Ireland; in 1997 the majority were printed in Ireland with the balance undertaken by a company outside Ireland; in 1998 all were printed in Ireland; and in 1999 the majority will be printed in Ireland with the balance being printed by a company outside Ireland.</P>

      <P>During the current school year, I have received six written requests for the psychological service to be extended to north Kildare and have answered two parliamentary questions on the subject. I understand that approximately the same number of requests have been made directly to the psychological service, by letter or telephone.</P>
      <P>I am well aware of the need for students, parents and teachers to have ready access to the support of educational psychologists. The expansion of provision is one of my priorities as Minister. On Thursday, 11 February, with the Taoiseach, I announced Government approval for the establishment of a National Educational Psychological Service. Financial provision has now been made for the first two years of a five year implementation phase. At the end of the five year period, it is envisaged that every school in the country will have access to a schools psychological service.</P>
      <P>My Department will shortly be recruiting 25 additional psychologists, who should take up their appointments during the school year 1999-2000. A detailed analysis is currently being made of the needs and resources available in all parts of the country in order to set priorities for the expansion of the National Educational Psychological Service. This analysis is taking account of such factors as student numbers, level of educational disadvantage and the availability of other resources. Data included with the writen requests which have been received will be added to the other data being examined.</P>

      <P>Forty-five psychologists employed by my Department are working in schools, in addition to six psychologists in senior, supervisory posts. Nineteen psychologists work in second level schools and 26 are deployed in primary schools.</P>
      <P>All second level schools are assigned to one of my Department's psychologists. At this level, the vocational education committees in the city and county of Dublin also employ psychologists. In the primary sector, my Department provides a psychological service to all primary schools designated as disadvantaged in the cities of Dublin, Cork and Limerick and to all primary schools in Tipperary South Riding. During the past year, the service has been greatly enhanced by the recruitment of 15 additional psychologists to work in primary schools. This has made it possible to initiate a service in counties Clare, Cork, Galway, Kerry, Kildare, Limerick, Louth, Mayo, Meath, Offaly, Sligo, Tipperary North and Wicklow.</P>
      <P>At present, the situation in County Kildare is as follows. All post-primary schools are assigned to a psychologist of my Department. In addition, 19 primary schools in the south of County Kildare now have access to the psychological service, as do six schools in Leixlip.</P>
      <P>However, I am aware that there are many primary schools in the country, including many in County Kildare, which do not yet have access to my Department's psychological service.

      <P>My Department provides funding towards the cost of secretarial services in primary schools under two separate schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the scheme for the employment of sec<Col N="1560" /> retaries, which was introduced in 1978, my Department meets the full cost of salary and employer's PRSI. This is the scheme under which St. Joseph's junior school and St. Joseph's senior school qualified for the shared secretary arrangements. However, this scheme is being phased out as posts become vacant and there is no provision for the appointment of full time secretaries in posts which are being shared. In the circumstances it will not be possible to sanction the appointment of an additional full-time secretary to either school.</P>
    <P>Under the Programme for Economic and Social Progress, a second scheme was introduced in 1992 whereby my Department provides additional capitation grants for primary schools towards the cost of secretarial services.</P>
    <P>Should the existing shared post fall vacant, my Department will provide both schools with a grant of £15 per pupil per annum towards the cost of secretarial services, subject to a maximum grant of £7,500 to each school, in accordance with the current terms of the PESP scheme.</P>
