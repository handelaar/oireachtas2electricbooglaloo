      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business, I propose to deal with a number of related notices of motion under Standing Order 31 from Deputies Quinn and De Rossa and Deputy Joe Higgins. I propose to call on the Deputies in the order in which they submitted their notices to my office. I call first on Deputy De Rossa to state the matter of which he has given notice to me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I request leave to move the adjournment of the Dáil to discuss the following specific matter of public interest: the decision by NATO to launch a series of air and missile attacks on targets in Serbia and Kosovo; and the need for the Government to urge a suspension of the attacks and for renewed efforts, through political and diplomatic means, to secure a peaceful settlement to the crisis in Kosovo. I hope in view of the seriousness of the matter, A Cheann Comhairle, that you will grant the request.</P>

        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> I seek leave to have the Dáil adjourned to discuss the following matter of extreme public importance: the position which the State should adopt regarding the bombing of Serbia by NATO forces; the political consequences of the bombing for the people of the Balkans and the rest of Europe; and the extreme danger of loss of life of innocent civilians.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the first time that a war has been declared in Europe since 1945. It seems extraordinary that this House cannot even discuss the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The House had over an hour's discussion yesterday afternoon and I will <Col N="1118" /> allow brief comments from either the party leaders or the foreign affairs spokespersons on the Order of Business in view of the seriousness of the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the view expressed by Deputy Quinn. The Government would be prepared to provide time to have statements on this matter and perhaps the Whips could discuss that. Perhaps we could sit later to facilitate it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make it quite clear that on the Order of Business it will be a contribution from either a party leader or alternatively a spokesperson on foreign affairs. We could not have a prolonged discussion on the Order of Business. It would be brief. Is that acceptable?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the attitude being taken by you, a Cheann Comhairle, and by the Tánaiste and others to try to facilitate a debate. However, statements confined to the party leaders or spokespersons on foreign affairs might not meet the genuine interest of those in this House who are opposed to the indiscriminate and unauthorised actions of NATO and their consequences.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair is trying to facilitate the House. Obviously we cannot have a long discussion on the Order of Business, but the Tánaiste has offered to allow time later today for fuller statements.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>My point is that it should be a matter for the Whips to decide on the length of the debate. I am not interested in disrupting the Order of Business &ndash; the matter is too serious. Equally, it is too serious to be confined to short set pieces. That would be unacceptable to me.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Tánaiste for the offer. As far as the Labour Party is concerned, given the logistics the matter should be discussed by the Whips. We should try to accommodate the scheduled business for today and perhaps consider extending the sitting this evening.</P>

        <b>:</b> The statements on Telecom Éireann will conclude at approximately 11.30 a.m. and between then and 1.30 p.m. the Sea Pollution (Amendment) Bill, 1998, will be debated. I suggest that is the time to take statements on the war in the Balkans. That means statements on the genetic modification of food can also take place.</P>

      <P>Because we have not come to the Order of Business I find myself in an awkward position. It is not impossible. Everybody is trying to be helpful. In my view, we should have a debate today. The most satisfactory way to deal with the matter is for the Whips to meet after the Order of Business and to agree the schedule of that debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree. This matter is extremely urgent and the House should express its view on it. We should not wait and I will be surprised if the Tánaiste will not be able to express the Government's view on this matter this morning and is not ready to do so now. It is not appropriate to wait until this afternoon to debate this matter. The Opposition is ready to debate it now.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take No. <i>a</i>28, statements on resignations from the board of Telecom Éireann; No. 3, Sea Pollution (Amendment) Bill, 1998  &ndash; Order for Second Stage and Second Stage; and No. 32, statements on genetically modified organisms, to be taken not later than 1.30 p.m. The order shall not resume thereafter. It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, (i) that the following arrangements shall apply in relation to No. <i>a</i>28: statements shall be confined to the Minister for Public Enterprise and the main spokespersons for the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party whose statements shall not exceed five minutes in each case; following statements, the Minister for Public Enterprise shall take questions; and the proceedings, including questions, if not previously concluded shall be brought to a conclusion after 30 minutes; (ii) the following arrangements shall apply in relation to No. 32: the opening statement of a Minister or Minister of State and of the main spokespersons for the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party shall not exceed 20 minutes in each case; the statement of each other Member called upon shall not exceed ten minutes in each case; Members may share time; and the Minister or Minister of State shall be called upon to make a statement in reply which shall not exceed ten minutes.</P>

      <P>It is useful to have a debate on genetically modified organisms but we should agree that, immediately after the debate on Telecom Éireann, we will debate the situation in Kosovo. This matter cannot wait. Rather than require a new order to be made, we should agree to interrupt business at 11.30 or 11.45 a.m. to allow a discussion on the situation in Kosovo which has the possibility of creating a general war in the Balkans.</P>

      <P>I appreciate and respect your suggestion, although I would have preferred your first suggestion about dealing with Kosovo. Once the order providing that we go from discussing Telecom Éireann to discussing genetically modified organisms is made, the order must subsequently be amended to allow us to debate Kosovo. I suggest that the Tánaiste agree that we discuss Kosovo after the debate on Telecom Éireann and that her agreement be incorporated in the order.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be as quick as possible because we want to give time to other people.</P>
      <P>The primary focus of Government in recent years in regard to communications has been on the introduction of strong and effective competition in the marketplace. Effective competition is rapidly being achieved and with the Government's decision last year to bring forward the date of full liberalisation to 1 December 1998, the pace of change is even faster. As the competitive landscape unfolds, the Government looks forward to Telecom Éireann expanding along with the industry in an increasingly competitive market.</P>
      <P>The Government decided to proceed with the IPO of Telecom Éireann at the same time as it announced the full liberalisation of the market. Ireland's ambition to be a lead player in global e-commerce is dependent on a strong and internationally competitive telecommunications sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With all these changes it has been important to respond quickly and effectively. Different skills are required to drive this process forward and board changes are and have been part of this process. Mr. Brian Thompson was appointed as a <Col N="1126" /> director and chairman of the board of Telecom on 20 January 1999. Mr. Ray MacSharry and Mr. Jim Flavin were also appointed as directors effective from the same date. They were each appointed to the board for three years.</P>
    <P>I learned on Friday, 19 March, of Mr. Thompson's impending appointment as chairman and chief executive officer of Global TeleSystems. I immediately instructed officials to discuss the matter further with Mr. Thompson and that took place over the weekend.</P>
    <P>There is a limited amount of competition between the Irish operations of Global TeleSystems &ndash; ITL &ndash; and Telecom Éireann in that ITL resells minutes which it buys from Telecom at wholesale rates. Going forward, as both companies develop their businesses there are likely to be other areas of potential competition. The competitive interests of GTS and Telecom Éireann required that Mr. Thompson resign from his position as chairman to remove any potential or actual conflict between his roles as chairman of Telecom and his potential position in GTS.</P>
    <P>Brian Thompson has made a substantial contribution during his tenure as chairman of Telecom. He has played a significant role in positioning the company for its forthcoming flotation. While I am disappointed he is not in a position to continue the role, I would like to wish him every success in his new post. We greatly appreciate his contribution to Telecom Éireann and his invaluable work in chairing the Advisory Committee on Telecommunicatons, which reported to the Government last November and which has become a blueprint. In addition to Mr. Thompson's work with the advisory committee, he has been an active member of the Ireland-United States Economic Advisory Board.</P>
    <P>Following Mr. Thompson's departure I have appointed Mr. Ray MacSharry as chairman.</P>
    <P>On Tuesday, 23 March, Mr. Ron Bolger, vice-chairman, tendered his resignation. It is with great regret that Mr. Ron Bolger has chosen to resign from the board. He has served Telecom Éireann well as a director and as a chairman and I thank him for his contribution.</P>
    <P>I have appointed Mr. Pat Molloy as non-executive director with immediate effect. He is a former group chief executive of Bank of Ireland, chairman of Enterprise Ireland and a non-executive director of CRH. I am very pleased that a person of his calibre has accepted the position.</P>
    <P>I am glad Mr. MacSharry has agreed to steer the company through the remainder of this process. I do not need to outline Mr. MacSharry's CV for the House.</P>
    <P>I have also appointed Mr. William Ferguson as non-executive director. Mr. Ferguson is a former chairman and chief executive officer of the NYNEX Corporation in the United States. He has more than 40 years experience of the communications industry.</P>
    <P>Mr. MacSharry's contribution as chairman, together with the other directors, will successfully steer the company through this historic phase of <Col N="1127" /> its corporate development. I also welcome the appointment last week of Mr. Malcolm Fallen as finance director.</P>
    <P>The board met yesterday and the plans are advanced. I will be glad to take questions.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with this matter professionally and in a non-personalised manner. My concerns relate to Mr. Thompson's terms of appointment, what happened at the time of his appointment, the circumstances which led to his departure, the subsequent departure of Mr. Bolger and the circumstances relating to the appointment of Mr. MacSharry in the context of the largest ever flotation and IPO in the history of this State and the fact that the largest ever return to the Exchequer of up to £5.5 billion is at stake in terms of its valuation. These are matters of very serious public interest.</P>
      <P>What concerns me most is that in January, the Government set out a criteria for the new board of Telecom Éireann in the context of the IPO. It meant a former Governor of the Central Bank, Mr. Maurice Doyle and an eminent professor of information technology, Gerry Wrixon, were not fit. Leaving aside any political appointments because they were apolitical people, we had to have a super-duper new board with very high standards of qualifications. The <i>coup de grace</i> in that regard was Mr. Brian Thompson.</P>
      <P>When the Minister's officials were in discussion with Mr. Thompson, he was between jobs and had left Quest. This was a non-remunerated job, and I tabled a parliamentary question on whether he had share options, which would not be unreasonable in the commercial world, or extra remuneration relative to the previous chairman. Were there any discussions about his future employment? Did he give the Minister to understand, explicitly or implicitly, that he would or would not be seeking employment and if the conflict of a new job might conflict with his appointment as chairman? Did the Minister agree any tenure of office, any loyalty or exclusivity? It has been suggested to me that Mr. Thompson was very much above board and indicated that he may well take up another job. I do not know whether that it true so we need to establish that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I assume Merrill Lynch and the advisers in AIB Capital Markets advised the Minister to make the board changes. Did they raise any questions in this vein about the loyalty and exclusivity of Mr. Thompson's appointment? I understand the dis<Col N="1128" /> cussions with GTS were going on for some considerable period before his appointment in the past week. Therefore, the period in which he was exclusively separate in terms of working for Telecom Éireann was perhaps a few weeks. So soon after his appointment, his resignation raises serious questions.</P>
    <P>Does Mr. MacSharry's appointment meet the criteria the Minister set in terms of global telecommunications experience? It seems that it is reasonable to conclude that Mr. Bolger's actions show he was not consulted about Mr. MacSharry's appointment. My understanding from Mr. Bolger is that he resigned as managing partner of KPMG in 1995 to devote his full energies to his chairmanship of Telecom Éireann. He was appointed by Deputy Cowen originally and was reappointed by a non-Fianna Fáil Administration, so he is an apolitical figure. His record was impeccable and he perhaps deserved consideration for appointment. Was Merrill Lynch consulted about Ray MacSharry's appointment?</P>
    <P>My point is that Ray MacSharry did not meet the criteria set out by the Minister and I do not believe KPM/Telia, the other shareholders, or Merrill Lynch were consulted prior to his appointment. Therefore, it was a hasty decision and more to do with his political CV. Remember Ron Bolger was involved in the flotation of Greencore and has an impeccable track record not only with Telecom Éireann but with flotations.</P>
    <P>I now come to Mr. Mackay's comments. It was a cause of upset to some people that not everybody resigned from the board in January. Mr. Mackay said yesterday or the day before that Mr. MacSharry was the wrong person to appoint and that there was a crisis in the board. Is his position tenable? The Minister made one unsuccessful attempt to get rid of him. Will she make another? He is, as I understand it, the Tánaiste's nomination, so what is his position on the board?</P>
    <P>The key issue is the sensitivity of investor confidence. Resignations so immediate and imminent to the draft prospectus being issued and the road shows taking place is not inspiring. I regret this has occurred and believe it would have been avoidable if prior care had been taken as regards the appointments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister is here and am sure she has good news.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Eight weeks ago with great fanfare a gentleman of whom I had not heard of before, Mr. Brian Thompson, was hand picked by the Minister and imposed on the board of Telecom Éireann as chairperson. In so doing, she pushed aside the existing chairman, Ron Bolger, and forced the resignation of other board members, except Paul Mackay, the PD nominee, who told the Minister to take a running jump and that he had no intention of resigning. Of course, he had the full sup<Col N="1129" /> port of the Tánaiste in giving that message to the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>He gave it to me himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure he did and he had plenty of support in so doing.</P>
      <P>New smart people were appointed to replace the people who had brought Telecom Éireann from quite a low level to a very high one, and that included the outgoing chairman, Ron Bolger, and the other board members. They were pushed aside for these smart people. It is now clear the old fashioned money grubbing we associate with American capitalists was very evident in the character of Mr. Thompson and that he was indeed no ragged trousered philanthropist who wanted to give public service for £7,500 per year, less than the amount he would get on the dole. That was not the reason he took the job.</P>
      <P>Mr. Thompson took the job because there was something on offer and there was a deal which he would get to do the job. I want to find out what the deal was. Obviously, the deal he got from the American company was better than the one he got here. However, he wanted to hold on to both and the Minister was effectively forced to sack the man she had hand picked and imposed on the board of Telecom Éireann. He left the Minister who had hand picked him in the lurch. I really wonder what attracted him to the position in the first place.</P>
      <P>Most of all this is an indication of the Minister's poor judgment. I tie in somebody else I know very well into that poor judgment and that is the Secretary-General of the Department of DTEC, as we used to call it. I am certain his fingerprints are all over this appointment as well. That bad judgment was followed by a knee-jerk reaction decision to give the vacant job to a political crony. Mr. Ray MacSharry has many fine qualities. I remember selling him a calf at a fair in Ballinrobe a long time ago. He struck a hard bargain then and paid me £3 and five shillings for it. He has come a long way since then and fair play to him. However, he does not fit the CV which the Minister set out clearly on what was required for the chairman of Telecom Éireann. Again she passed over the man who stood aside previously, and humiliated him by appointing this person without the required CV. Ron Bolger had to resign immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am worried the new appointee, who is also a director of Ryanair, might bring the rabid anti-union ethos of that company into Telecom Éireann as well. I say to the Minister that to lose one board member might be described as unlucky but to lose two is careless in the extreme. In the face of the flotation with which we are now dealing, serious damage has been done. Independent observers like Senator Shane Ross have had to agree that damage has been done to the valuation of Telecom Éireann, to the actual worth of the company. The Minister should take time to rethink the strategy and postpone the proposed <Col N="1130" /> flotation of Telecom Éireann. Given that it cost £40 million to put this roadshow in place, this debacle, chronicle of ineptitude and series of bad judgment calls lies squarely at the door of the Minister and the Secretary General of her Department. Those two people must carry the can for this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister used four of the five minutes allocated to her and she indicated she would share one minute of her time with Deputy Sargent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for sharing a minute of her time with me. Many people are concerned about the issue of sensitive information being passed to the private sector. It must be clarified whether any conditions attached to the term of Mr. Ron Bolger as chairman of Telecom Éireann which would prevent sensitive information being used against Telecom.</P>
      <P>I heard that people who attended a recent event in Westmeath, at which the Minister was present, said one would not want to catch the eye of the Minister as one might end up on the board of Telecom. I found that of interest. As Ray MacSharry is chairman of Coillte, that suggests Coillte is going down a certain road, which will also have implications.</P>
      <P>The KPN Telia partner was not informed about the appointment of Mr. MacSharry until after his appointment, which seems to have been a gross discourtesy. Has that been clarified and does that partner accept the appointment of Mr. MacSharry? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Minister, her Secretary General or any senior official of her Department ever discuss with Mr. Brian Thompson his plans for future employment while he was chairman of Telecom Éireann? Did she have an agreement, implicit or explicit, as to his tenure, loyalty and terms of appointment and, if not, why not?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am extremely sorry to lose Brian Thompson. Ron Bolger has voluntarily retired, as did Brian Thompson. The appointments of Brian Thompson, Ray MacSharry and Jim Flavin were for three years. One cannot impose exclusivity or loyalty in the capacity of non-executive. Perhaps those issues should be addressed by Government in the future as we face privatisations of various kinds. For the £7,500 emolument offered, it would be incorrect to have made such assumptions. One could not provide for that commercially or financially. I was aware Brian Thompson had considerable experience and, therefore, was likely to be hit upon by other firms which might ask him if he was free or what could he do. I have no way of tying down anyone in that situation. We checked all other appointments at various times. Where an appointment is made for three or five years or for whatever tenure, both sides agree that in good faith, hope the friendship will continue and they <Col N="1131" /> will work together, but that was not to be in this case.</P>
      <P>Mr. Thompson made every effort over last weekend, as did the officials who talked through with him exactly what he would be doing &ndash; I do not fault him &ndash; to check if this could be in accord with his job in Telecom. He even went so far as to check if the subsidiary could be offloaded or something of that nature, but that was not possible as it has been only set up. That shows how keen he was to keep the Telecom position, but that could not be done. If he had remained in that position, perhaps in two weeks' time we would be debating a far more serious matter, which I could not and would not allow.</P>
      <P>The Deputy also asked about whether there was loyalty and exclusivity in the terms of Mr. Thompson's agreement, but that was not possible in those circumstances. It is not possible for a Government to impose that on any chairman. As soon as the potential conflict arose, there was no way I could allow it. It was put to me in good faith by Brian Thompson, but I would not allow any contrivement that would lead to such conflict.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>From the Minister's answer, it seems it was foreseeable that Mr. Thompson could get another job offer. Surely his resignation was avoidable, if the Minister concluded he would jump ship. We are not talking about a period of three years, but a matter of months for the IPO.  Was it not imprudent to appoint him in those circumstances, when he could and did quickly jump ship?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I never used the term &ldquo;jump ship&rdquo;, the Deputy used it. Let us be clear on that. I neglected to say that Mr. Thompson chaired the e-commerce committee for six months in a voluntary capacity, apart from his travelling expenses, which he would have to be given. He gave two months of his time to Telecom and I understand from worker representatives and other directors that during that period he did enormous planning and strategic work on the board. That is generally recognised.</P>
      <P>One would not expect a man aged 58 or 59 with his experience to refuse an offer of the magnitude made, having given eight months <i>pro bono publico </i>here and continuing on the Taoiseach's advisory committee. I would not have expected he would say no to this in that he had a tenure for £7,500. I expect he had hoped that any offers that would be made to him would not be conflicting. Last weekend we teased out whether there was a potential conflict and found there was one. Having discovered that, I did not react in a knee-jerk way. I could not and would not have it on my conscience or that of my Department that at this very important time a potential conflict of interest might arise in a week or two weeks' time. That would be wrong. If there was a potential conflict, it had to be immediately cut out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is recognising a bad decision she made. Nobody believes this man was working for £7,500 a year. Will she tell the House the deal for Mr. Thompson at the end of the period when the flotation would occur? Was he going to get a packet of shares, an enhanced salary or a contract for life? There was something there to attract him. What was there to attract this man, who can seemingly command millions in other areas?</P>
      <P>When he did a bunk and left her in the lurch after she hand-picked him, will she agree she made another bad decision in not reappointing Ron Bolger, who had brought the company from a very low level to a point where it is worth £5 billion? Will she agree that arising from that serious damage has been done to the valuation of Telecom and that she should postpone or, at least, defer the flotation until the effect of what must for her be a nightmare, with the house of cards coming tumbling down around her, is corrected? I would like to see it cancelled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This Bill is an important component in the body of measures which have been constructed to protect and enhance the marine environment. It will make the reporting of oil pollution incidents or potential incidents mandatory. Harbour authorities, ships carrying oil as cargo, operators of offshore installations, oil handling and producing facilities and, in certain circumstances, local authorities, will now have to put in place oil pollution emergency plans.</P>
      <P>It also extends Ireland's jurisdiction for dealing with pollution incidents from the current 12 mile limit to 200 miles. This is a vital step in the further protection of our marine environment and the valuable maritime and coastal resources which depend on it. This Bill also proposes tough new penalties of up to £10 million for non-compliance.</P>
      <P>The Irish Marine Emergency Service, IMES, will be designated as the national agency which will have the power to direct the preparation of these emergency plans as a statutory requirement. Individual plans will be co-ordinated with the overall national plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Increased co-operation with other coastal states, in the event of oil pollution, is also provided for. International co-operation and support is a vital part of responding to major marine emergencies all over the world. Services from neighbouring countries willingly assist each other in situations where geography and separate administrations are of secondary importance. The Bill will create a framework for co-operation between the Irish Marine Emergency Service, IMES, harbour authorities, local authorities and the operators of oil tankers, offshore installations and oil handling facilities. Our extensive coastline makes us vulnerable to oil pollution accidents. <Col N="1136" /> The devastating effects that spillages can have on the marine and coastal environments have been made all too clear by the <i>Braer</i> and the <i>Sea Empress</i> accidents. The measures in the Bill provide strong safeguards for our seas and shoreline amenities and the communities which depend on them in the event of any such incident.</P>
    <P>The Bill gives effect to the Oil Pollution Preparedness Response and Co-operation Convention, OPRC, 1990. This convention is designed to ensure proper arrangements are in place in each member state of the International Maritime Organisation, IMO, to deal with emergencies arising from oil spillages into the sea. It calls for member states to have a major national emergency plan to deal with major spillages and a designated response agency and to co-operate with the IMO and adjoining states in planning for and dealing with oil pollution incidents.</P>
    <P>There is a requirement on all ships carrying oil as cargo and all installations producing or handling oil products to have emergency pollution plans in place and for anyone becoming aware of a spillage to notify the national agency. The Irish Marine Emergency Service, IMES, which was set up in 1991 as part of the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources, was designated the Irish response agency and has made the necessary arrangements to give effect to the convention. However, it is necessary to provide a statutory basis for action by the designated response agency in implementing the convention; to enable that agency to direct the preparation of emergency plans by others as a statutory requirement and to make reporting of oil pollution incidents or potential ones mandatory. The Bill fulfils this legislative requirement.</P>
    <P>Since becoming Minister I have accorded a high priority to the protection of the marine environment. The high quality of our marine environment is an important element of Ireland's natural endowment, both for its intrinsic value and as a major resource for marine tourism and leisure and the marine food sector. Ireland has consistently argued at EU meetings and international fora for the highest possible international standards in this area. It has a corresponding responsibility to ensure that it introduces both the appropriate legislation and the measures necessary for implementation. Small countries as well as large have serious obligations in this regard. The Bill complements a number of other measures which have been introduced in recent years or are currently being prepared.</P>
    <P>The Oil Pollution of the Sea (Civil Liability and Compensation) (Amendment) Act, 1998, was enacted in May. It strengthens the law in regard to oil pollution by bringing it into line with current international conventions and increases the level of compensation in the event of an oil spill to a maximum of £195 million. In 1997 four sets of regulations were made under the Sea Pollution Act, 1991, to give effect to provisions of the IMO Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from <Col N="1137" /> Ships, known as the MARPOL convention. Work is under way to adopt further provisions of MARPOL concerning the prevention of pollution by sewage from ships and the prevention of air pollution from ships.</P>
    <P>In March 1998, the Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North East Atlantic, OSPAR, came into force internationally following ratification by all the contracting parties. In July 1998 I led the Irish delegation to the first ministerial meeting of the OSPAR Commission in Portugal. It adopted a new annex to the convention dealing with biodiversity, a series of strategies and an action plan for the OSPAR commission. It also adopted a decision governing the disposal of disused offshore installations. Under the auspices of OSPAR the drafting of a comprehensive quality status report, containing essentially a health check of our adjacent marine environment, has been completed and will be published shortly. My Department, in conjunction with the Marine Institute, and in consultation with industry representatives, has continued to develop a strategy for the environmental regulation of offshore oil and gas activities. This will take account of the strategy on offshore industry, which is currently being prepared under the auspices of the OSPAR convention.</P>
    <P>I established a task force on the dumping of radioactive materials in the maritime area in 1997, in the wake of revelations by the UK Government that radioactive waste had been dumped at a number of locations around the coast of the UK during the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. I expect it to report during the coming months. A total of 28 phosphorus devices washed up along the east coast between 3 and 8 June 1998. A further device washed ashore on 19 July 1998. These devices apparently originated in the Beaufort Dyke dump site, which lies between Scotland and Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>My Department immediately contacted the UK authorities to express the Government's serious concern at these developments and, subsequently, meetings were held with senior officials from a range of UK Departments and agencies to discuss the problem; I had discussions with the Ministers concerned. In addition, I raised the issue at the ministerial meeting of the OSPAR Commission, and OSPAR subsequently agreed to examine the issue of dumped munitions in the waters around Europe. It asked Ireland, as lead country, to prepare a paper on the problems posed by dumped munitions. This will form the basis for future action on the subject.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that 1998 was designated International Year of the Ocean by the United Nations. I signed the Ocean Charter, which was sponsored by the International Oceanographic Commission of UNESCO to mark the occasion. In December I also opened the Oceans Conference at Dublin Castle, which was hosted by the Marine Institute. In addition, my Department was represented at the second <Col N="1138" /> London Oceans Workshop. The purpose of the workshop was to mark the International Year of the Ocean and also to prepare for the 7th session of the UN Commission on Sustainable Development, CSD 7, in New York next month. Oceans and seas will be the major sectoral theme of CSD 7, at which I will represent Ireland. The shoreline protection strategy was recently completed by IMES. It is intended to commence testing this plan during the coming months. Local authorities and harbours have been requested to compile contingency plans and are finding the strategy extremely useful in assisting them in this regard.</P>
    <P>Following agreement at the IMO Assembly, which I addressed in November 1997, to make mandatory the INF code which governs the transport by sea of irradiated nuclear fuels, my Department is developing unproved reporting arrangements governing the carriage of nuclear materials by sea both within the context of the IMO and, bilaterally, with the United Kingdom and France. Of course, we would be much happier if they were not transported.</P>
    <P>My colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Byrne, continues to serve on the ministerial committee on Sellafield and on radiological protection generally under the chairmanship of the Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise, Deputy Jacob. The measures to which I have referred set out the context in which the Bill is being introduced. The marine environment is an issue of concern to all Deputies and, indeed, to the community at large. It is a subject to which considerable attention has been paid in recent years, but which requires vigilance from all parties involved. I look forward to Deputies' contributions in the matter and commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>The introduction of the Bill is timely. I watched a programme on television last night which marked the tenth anniversary of the <i>Exxon Valdez</i> oil spill off the Alaskan coast. It illustrated the systems that had been put in place to ensure a similar incident did not occur again in the area. It showed the great lengths people went to in terms of preparedness. The Bill is a step in the right direction. Many international vessels pass through Irish territorial waters and we have often been reminded of the hazards of large tankers. Many tankers are old and that was brought home to us when the <i>Sea Empress</i> ran aground off the Welsh coast in 1996. Indeed, oil from that spillage reached the east coast of Ireland and but for the prevailing favourable conditions much more damage would have been done. It is only right that everything is done to prepare for potential oil spills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1139" /> In 1990 the forerunner to this Bill, the Sea Pollution Bill, which this Bill amends, was published. There has probably been a dramatic increase in the size of vessels since then. Much of the fleet is quite old. However, there is increased technology on many of our vessels now, particularly the new ones. It is often the case that financiers are based in one country and the vessels are owned and crewed by people from other countries. This gives rise to many complications. The people who man the vessels often tend to come from Third World countries. Communications difficulties add to the potential for problems arising. We are clearly vulnerable when it comes to marine casualties involving oil.</P>
    <P>The measures envisaged in the Bill seem to be confined to ships in the main. How does one define a &lsquo;ship'? Perhaps the Minister will clarify whether the measures would apply to fishing trawlers as well as tankers, larger vessels and luxury cruising vessels which travel to Lough Derg and other places. All vessels have the potential to create waste. Over the weekend, I visited many fishing ports in Donegal to get an on-the-spot assessment of the situation which prevails there. Many ports are under the control of local authorities. Do they have the necessary facilities when a vessel sails into them to dispose of oil and other waste? Are those facilities provided by the harbours themselves and, if so, what is the situation in regard to harbours which are financially constrained? Do they have to provide equipment?</P>
    <P>The measures contained in the Bill are laudable. We should implement the measures contained in the Oil Pollution Preparedness Response and Co-operation Convention, 1990. However, a financial commitment is also required. While it may be possible for many of our commercial semi-State ports, which operate as strong financial entities, to put oil preparation programmes in place, many other ports remain under the control of local authorities. It may be necessary for us to provide guidance to them and to provide equipment and funding to allow them to implement the measures required. I contend that a great deal of waste is being dumped at sea by vessels which use these ports.</P>
    <P>Recent statistics show that more than 6.5 million tonnes of waste are dumped at sea each year. That is a huge amount of waste, a large proportion of which is plastic. When a person buys a six pack of beer cans, the plastic packaging poses danger to fish and mammals which consume it. Many of us are not sufficiently responsible in regard to waste disposal. Many people seem to view the seas as a large receptacle for potential waste. One need only walk along our coastline to see the amount of debris washed ashore. A recent statistic revealed that 1,600 miles of monofilament nets were washed ashore in the south-east Pacific, 600 miles of which came from Japan. That is a frightening statistic.</P>
    <P>There is a clear necessity for us to improve the environment as the younger generation will <Col N="1140" /> assess us on the manner in which we have treated it. They cannot assess us favourably at this stage. Many of the laws we have implemented recently have been positive. However, it is very easy for us to introduce legislation in this House, but the Department needs to guide, cajole, advise and provide funding to people in order to effect the legislation's implementation. That is crucially important in regard to what we are trying to achieve through this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill states that the Minister may require a local authority within such a period as is specified by the Minister to prepare and submit to him or her a plan for the prevention and minimisation of damage arising out of an oil pollution incident to any area or seashore which lies wholly or partly within its functional area or contiguous thereto. If a vessel becomes aware of an oil slick 200 miles off our coastline, it may notify the Minister. I presume the vessel owner will not know the Minister's name but will possibly contact a local harbour or the vessel's port of destination. Perhaps many of the issues on which I require clarification might be more appropriately dealt with on Committee Stage. Interpretations could be teased out at that point.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the report of the task force he established on dumping off the Irish coast, particularly in the Beaufort Dyke. We have awaited the publication of that report for some time. Parliamentary questions have again been tabled on it today. Every time the Minister attends Question Time, we wait in eager anticipation of details of the report's publication and are informed it will be published shortly. The Minister stated it will be published in the next few months. We are all anxious to see the report as the Irish Sea has been identified as one of the most radioactive in the world. Concern has quite rightly focused on Sellafield and the nuclear pollution which is affecting the seaweed and fish life off the Welsh coast.</P>
    <P>The Minister also referred to the phosphorous devices being washed up on Irish coasts which have possibly been dislodged from an old munitions dump in the Beaufort Dyke as a result of storms. An investigation has been established on that matter and submersible equipment was to be sent down to establish what quantities of material existed in the dump and what kind of turbulence resulted in dangerous phosphorous devices being washed ashore. I presume the report, when it is published, will refer to this matter.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill but I hope the Department will provide the appropriate assistance to harbours which may not have the necessary wherewithal to implement the Bill's measures. We must ensure that the waste dumped at sea is dumped in appropriate facilities when vessels come ashore. This Bill, together with preceding legislation on oil pollution, will hopefully lead to improving the environment we all value so much.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune" hpid="Ms Clune Ms Clune">
      <NameTxt>Ms Clune</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome the Bill. Anything which brings us a step closer to protecting our marine environment and recognising its importance is to be welcomed. There is a perception that our seas and oceans are vast, and an out of sight, out of mind attitude appears to prevail in regard to them. We have a great deal of knowledge about the effects of pollution in our seas, be it oil pollution, sewage waste, nuclear waste or general domestic and municipal waste. Their effects on our marine environment have been well documented. The Irish Marine Emergency Service is in charge of organising and directing the response to oil spills at sea. The service co-ordinates the functions of other authorities involved in on-shore response. When notified of a spill the Irish Marine Emergency Service can mobilise its marine pollution response team which will proceed to the scene and establish a local headquarters. They take control of the response and look to the body responsible for the spill for resources and assistance.</P>
      <P>Recently there was an accident at the refinery in Cork Harbour. There was much confusion at the time of the spill which was caused by a leak from an oil pipe. Cork County Council, the responsible local authority, responded immediately using booms in an effort to contain the spill. However, after two days it was found this was not sufficient and they called in additional resources from the UK. Much time was lost in the delay and much damage was done in the area.</P>
      <P>The Department of the Environment and Local Government has a general responsibility for shoreline clean-up arrangements and a co-ordinating and supporting function for maritime local authorities which undertake the clean-up of oil from beaches and near-shore waters. Under the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act, 1997, local authorities have the authority and means to deal with spills in their jurisdiction. Harbour authorities deal with spills in harbours, although the Office of Public Works becomes involved in the case of State harbours. The Department of the Marine and Natural Resources has overall responsibility for the protection of fisheries and wildlife in major fishing ports.</P>
      <P>We do not favour the use of dispersants, especially inshore, in rivers and estuaries. However, the Irish Marine Emergency Service may consider their use off-shore if untreated oil is likely to reach the shore. Dispersants are not stock-piled and if their use is necessary, stocks and aerial spray contractors are brought in from overseas. I understand the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources has small amounts of sorbents, booms and skimmers stockpiled at Cork, Dublin and Limerick. Most harbour and local authorities also have small equipment depots which hold booms, skimmers, sorbents and work boats.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The oil industry has a variety of equipment for dealing with spills at terminals. Bantry Terminal Limited has an inshore recovery vessel based in <Col N="1142" /> Bantry Bay. There are no specialist oil spill clean up operators in Cork, and a UK based company is contracted by Irish National Petroleum Corporation to provide back-up resources on a 24 hour basis in the event of a major spill at Whitegate crude oil terminal in Cork Harbour. This was put into action when the oil spill occurred in Cork in 1997.</P>
    <P>One would need to visit an oil spill to see the way in which oil floats on water. The day of the Cork spill was calm and it caused a smell in the area. The local authorities in the area tried to contain the spill with booms. However, the tides worked against this approach and some of the oil which had been contained was washed up on shore with every change of tide. The sand had to be dug, put in black sacks, washed and cleaned and then returned to the shore. It was a very labour intensive, slow and expensive operation in response to what was originally described as a relatively minor spill. The spill also effected fish and wildlife in the area. The recovery from such an oil spill is very slow. Birds have to be washed, cleaned and returned to their habitats. None of us should underestimate how disastrous an oil spill can be.</P>
    <P>Every day approximately 31 billion gallons of oil are transported at sea via tankers, storage tanks, pipelines, oil wells and vessels used for cleaning out tanks. Oil is used for fuel, electricity generation, etc.</P>
    <P>Accidents are often caused through carelessness, something which is well documented but sometimes there are unavoidable spills because of weather or earthquakes while on occasion there can be intentional spills in cases of terrorism, war, vandalism and dumping.</P>
    <P>Oil floats because it is much lighter than water, with between 30 per cent and 40 per cent evaporating in the first 24 to 48 hours. This accounts for the most poisonous and noxious portion, the most soluble and flammable portion. It floats and spreads into a very thin film on the water surface, usually only about 0.1 mm thick. It then spreads even thinner to a sheen, which is only one tenth or one hundredth of this thickness. Sheens are often seen as rainbow like or silvery puddles. It is very rare for oil to sink in seawater, although it may sink in freshwater. Oil adheres to heavier particles, such as sand, algae or silt, before it will sink. The only exception to this is oil used for burning in electric utility plants which can sink in water.</P>
    <P>The environmental impact of oil spillages can be exaggerated. Some scientists say that, given plenty of time, the environment can recover from oil spills. However, the immediate effect of an oil spill is quite alarming, particularly to the local population when it is washed up on the shoreline. The response teams often protect the sensitive areas with floating booms. Immediate containment is very important in the event of an oil spill. The response to the spill in Cork Harbour in 1997 was delayed and we are still seeing the effects of this.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1143" /> There are many methods of cleaning up oil spills which have been well documented, including shoreline clean-up which is a long, slow and laborious task.</P>
    <P>While concerned with oil pollution the Bill also deals with sea pollution in general and I welcome the fact that dumping at sea, including the dumping of sewage sludge, will be banned. This poses problems of how to deal with such waste on land. For years the practice has been to dump sewage sludge at sea on the basis &ldquo;out of sight, out of mind&rdquo;. However, eventually such waste mixes with the sea and has an effect somewhere. Sewage and chemical outflows must now be documented and registered with the EPA. A sewage treatment facility is being built in Cork Harbour and there are no longer direct discharges into the harbour, something we must welcome.</P>
    <P>The EPA plays a role in terms of controlling oil pollution and pollution in our harbours and seas and I would like the Minister in his response to refer to its role in this context.</P>
    <P>Deputy Finucane mentioned discharges from Sellafield, which affect us as is evident from seaweed samples and fish caught on the east coast. Another issue is the dumping of general municipal waste at sea, a practice which has been going on for some time. The practice of dumping sewage sludge and domestic and municipal waste at sea will come to an end with the new landfill directives and waste management regulations.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and it is good to see we are taking a positive step and co-ordinating the emergency responses of those involved in the clean-up process. Prevention is probably a better part of the cure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I am from an inland county. While it may be strange to hear Deputies from inland counties speak on marine pollution, we visit the sea and witness the pollution around the coast. We also have a greater appreciation of the sea because we do not see it very often, except perhaps when we come to Dublin.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill because it provides an opportunity to examine a number of issues concerning pollution of the seas around the coast. I will deal with one issue, ballast water, which is becoming a major environmental risk to our ports. Large tankers carry sufficient ballast water to fill 2,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools. However, it can be a Trojan horse. Ballast water is taken on board ships to maintain their stability when they are partially laden. When a ship is loaded with cargo, it empties its ballast tanks. In this way, ballast water is sucked up in one port and transported across the ocean to another port where it is discharged with any tiny stowaway organisms which may be present in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the most part, these organisms fail to gain a foothold in their new environment. However, there has been a handful of cases where serious <Col N="1144" /> ecological and economic damage has been caused. The American comb jelly, similar to the jellyfish, is believed to have been transported in ballast water from the east coast of America to the Black Sea in the 1970s. It soon began competing with indigenous organisms for food, eventually crippling the local anchovy fishing industry. Similarly, in the 1980s the European zebra mussel, native to the Caspian and Black Seas, found its way to the Great Lakes of north America, where it proliferated widely causing serious fouling problems around water intake pipes in power plants and factories. In 1990, the US federal Government pledged $11 million per year to tackle the problem.</P>
    <P>Ballast water can be a form of bio-pollution, a problem which is as old as travel itself. Research shows it has increased rapidly in recent decades as growing trade and faster transport shrink the world. It is suspected that, as ships become faster, organisms are more likely to survive the shorter journey times. Some scientists believe pollution around ports may destabilise natural ecosystems, thus enabling exotic organisms to thrive. The issue of tiny aliens in ballast water may have major implications for the aquaculture industry. It is crucial, therefore, that we recognise the problem and set about putting in place the necessary safeguards. The Minister is well aware that oil tankers carry ballast water and that this is covered by the Bill.</P>
    <P>In 1991 the International Maritime Organisation issued guidelines on ballast water management which were updated in 1997. These included not loading ballast water in shallow water or in areas where propellers could stir up sediment or discharging ballast water unnecessarily. The guidelines suggest that, in some cases, ballast water should be exchanged in the open sea, pumping out water drawn from the port in the deep ocean and replacing it with water from the deep ocean. Deep ocean water does not contain as many organisms and the few which are present usually will not survive in coastal and freshwater environments. Other means of tackling the problem are also being investigated. These include the use of heat from the ship's engines to treat the water, chemical treatment and filtration. It is crucially important these guidelines are put in place on an international statutory basis to ensure the protection of the aquaculture industry which is worth £60 million per annum to this country.</P>
    <P>We are fortunate to have escaped in the past because of our poor trade links and the lack of port utilisation. However, these are now beginning to develop. We have spoken of developing all our major ports and I welcome the initiative the Minister is taking in that regard. However, as they develop, there will be a greater risk of ballast water pollution and part of the aquaculture industry could be destroyed because of, for example, the zebra mussel coming into estuaries. It is crucially important we examine these issues now and not in ten years' time, when it is a serious problem. There has not been the opportunity for this <Col N="1145" /> to happen in the past because our ports have not been developed to the same extent as others around the world. However, major research is being conducted in the UK on this issue and we need to invest more in marine research and biology to examine such issues.</P>
    <P>It is crucially important that we invest more in research on micro-organisms which can tackle oil pollution off the coast. Deputy Finucane mentioned the <i>Exxon Valdez</i>, which is a prime example of micro-organisms being used to break down oil. It is environmentally friendly with lasting side effects. Deputy Clune mentioned the reluctance to use detergents or dispersants in the sea, especially around coasts. This is an ideal example of where micro-organisms could be used. As Deputy Sargent is present, I remind him that one way of developing these microbial dispersants and detergents is through genetic engineering.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not eat them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>Genetic engineering is the best way to develop micro-organisms to break down oil. Although the Green Party might assume some of these organisms might enter the fish stock which we would later eat, we must nonetheless examine the potential of genetic engineering in tackling these environmental concerns. Perhaps the Minister could ensure investment is made in this type of research because it will become more significant in future.</P>
      <P>There is huge potential in inland waterways and sea inlets, but there is also a problem with oil pollution and even rubbish and diesel getting into rivers. What controls are in place and what Department deals specifically with the control and regulation of pollution in inlets around the coast? Is it dealt with through local authorities or has the Department an overall role to play in relation to inland waterways? The Leas-Cheann Comhairle would be familiar with the largest, the Shannon-Erne Waterway, which will be developed dramatically in years to come. Resources need to be made available not only to tackle pollution but also to ensure a proper and co-ordinated safety approach to inland waterways.</P>
      <P>It is fine to introduce legislation such as this Bill, but many small harbour commissions and authorities cannot afford to buy the necessary equipment to tackle oil pollution. There is no point in the Minister introducing the legislation unless he is willing to provide resources to the harbour authorities, especially the smaller ones, to combat these pollution problems.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>As a member of two local authorities and chairman of a harbour authority for a long time, I join the two previous speakers in emphasising to the Minister the reliance of local authorities on finance given to them in the Estimates. While harbour authorities may be controlled indirectly by the Department, they are commercial entities which have to provide their own finance. There is no point, therefore, in introducing legislation, no matter how good it may be, if the necessary finance will not be provided. I will not refer to the explosive devices washed ashore on the east coast to which the Minister referred. I have tabled a detailed question on the subject which is due to be taken this afternoon.</P>
      <P>The focus of the Bill, which I welcome, is primarily on increasing the responsibility of the Government in controlling, preventing and dealing with pollution at sea. As an island nation, we have an important relationship with the sea in terms of the fishing industry, sea transport, heavy industry and tourism. It is crucial that we have the ability to ensure our seas are not left open to pollution and mismanagement and that we are in a position to deal effectively with pollution.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides for some important safeguards. Unless the necessary resources are made available, however, to the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources it will amount to nothing more than a farce. It is accepted by all sides that the Department is underfunded and under-resourced. If the provisions of the Bill are to be effective, it is essential that it is treated differently.</P>
      <P>One of the key sections of the Bill extends the Irish maritime area 200 miles from our coast baseline. As a result the Irish sea area will be ten times the size of the Irish land area. This is part of a pattern where the Irish maritime area is gradually being extended by domestic and EU legislation. We have failed, however, to provide additional resources to ensure maximum surveillance of this extended sea area by the Naval Service and the Air Corps. If the Irish sea area is extended further, will the Minister be in a position to improve the coastguard services which are highly inadequate? It would be absurd to pass the Bill without receiving a commitment from the Government that it will seek to improve them.</P>
      <P>Another issue about which I am concerned is the role extended to the Department in relation to offshore oil exploitation. The main source of oil pollution to date has been sea transport. We have been able to deal adequately with it. In light of some serious incidents in recent years arising from offshore oil exploration, it is vital that measures are put in place which would enable us to deal with large-scale pollution.</P>
      <P>The Department has responsibility for policing and promoting the development of offshore oil exploration. These two functions do not sit comfortably together and should be the responsibility of separate Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill provides that the Minister may give directions in relation to the modification or alter<Col N="1147" /> ation of emergency plans covering oil pollution incidents. Individual Governments cannot make or shape the exact procedures to deal with pollution in isolation from other Governments. The damage an oil spillage may cause depends on the prevailing winds, tides, etc. It may be that winds could force the spillage beyond the seas which fall under the jurisdiction of a particular state. An intergovernmental approach should be adopted to the contingency plans required to deal with oil pollution. There is a case to be made for extending the role of the OSPAR convention.</P>
    <P>The Minister will be aware that many local authorities do not have the necessary outdoor staff to fill potholes or clear gulleys when it rains. What discussions have taken place with his colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, in this regard? Will the Minister for the Environment and Local Government be responsible for the operation of the plans mentioned in the Bill or will the Minister and his colleague work together?</P>
    <P>The Bill has many good points and I have no hesitation, on behalf of the Labour Party, in supporting it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom ar dtús buíochas a ghabháil leis an Teachta Michael Bell as ucht a chuid ama a roinnt liom. Ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimh aon rud a dheineann maitheas don bhfarraige.</P>
      <P>The Bill has many valuable aspirations which I hope will be translated into effective measures. To ensure this the necessary resources and technology should be made available.</P>
      <P>The importance of the oceans should be highlighted. They play a vital role in regulating our climate and ensuring the biodiversity on which many depend. This should be of interest to everybody on the island, not just coastal communities. From an economic point of view, we are reliant on farming. It should be recognised that the oceans absorb a considerable amount of CO2 and greenhouse gases.</P>
      <P>The <i>Exxon Valdez</i> tragedy taught us many lessons. Strange as it may seem, it taught us that a disaster such as an oil spillage could provide an economic boost. GNP in Alaska was boosted. When economic progress is measured by the amount spent Governments run the risk of getting it wrong and translating disaster into economic benefits. The absurdity of measuring the disastrous impact of the oil spillage from the <i>Exxon Valdes</i> as an economic benefit is not lost on anybody who thinks about it seriously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having referred to the need for economic reform, I will deal with the specifics. The Minister put the emphasis on dealing with oil pollution, however, strong safeguards are almost meaningless unless we have the means to apprehend and prosecute those responsible for it. Will the Minister take on board the available technology to fingerprint oil and find the source of pollution so that a legally watertight case can be made by the <Col N="1148" /> law enforcement agencies. As well as having these legislative provisions in place, it is important to communicate to everybody that those who cause oil pollution will be caught.</P>
    <P>The proliferation of plastic worldwide inevitably means that the oceans tend to become the receptacle for plastic waste. This is a growing problem and a life and death issue for marine life, fish, mammals and crustaceans. There is a considerable body of evidence that plastic not only hinders animals, but is ingested by them because from a visual point of view it is similar to food sources. As well as being a biodiversity issue which the Minister is bound to address under OSPAR, the waste management aspect impacts on the Minister for the Environment and Local Government's brief. The Minister will acknowledge that harbours should have proper waste collection receptacles and ways of dealing with waste. Even though the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources has erected &ldquo;No Dumping&rdquo; signs, these are frequently disregarded and are felt to be meaningless because there are no waste receptacles. We need to facilitate people to deal with their waste as well as enforcing the law. The Minister needs to deal with this issue if the Bill is to have effect.</P>
    <P>We are a marine nation, yet we have fallen behind in having the facilities to deal with problems, such as seals which are injured around our shore. The Minister will be aware of the seal sanctuary in Garristown, the facilities in Skerries and of people such as Mr. Willie Duffy and Mr. Brendan and Ms Mary Price who have waged a long and lonely fight on the need for properly resourced facilities to educate the public on the importance of the marine environment and show our concern for wildlife. I hope the Minister will respond to this point.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the ministerial committee on Sellafield which seems to be meeting in a quiet fashion. Given that there have been three accidents in the past month at Sellafield, which seemed to have passed unnoticed, publicly at least from the Government's point of view, it would be interesting to see a progress report from this committee. The Minister referred to phosphorous devices, which are as much a problem in Dublin North as in other coastal communities. There needs to be more warning instructions and signs on how to deal with these devices safely.</P>
    <P>From his long involvement with marine matters, I know the Minister is genuinely concerned, however Government concern, when it does not provide the investment necessary for sewage treatment around the coast is hypocritical. The local authorities do not have the funds to deal with sewage treatment, particularly in coastal communities. This issue must be addressed if the rhetoric is to be credible. Harbours such as Howth, Balbriggan, Rush, Skerries and others which are not viewed as major harbours by the EU but are of importance from the point of view of tourism, fishing and marine life, are not able to function owing to lack of finance. The local <Col N="1149" /> authorities are expected to carry out remedial works on structures that have been neglected for so many years they are liabilities, and I fear for their long-term future. There is a need for Government action and it is the Minister's responsibility to see it is forthcoming.</P>

It is obvious that Deputies know the position very well and have a great interest in it. I indicated in my opening speech that this is a technical Bill but a most important measure for the protection of the marine environment as it enables us to meet our commitments as part of the international maritime community and puts the response procedures that have been developed by them on a statutory footing. I will give very careful consideration to the points that have been raised and I look forward to discussing the provisions of the Bill on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bell asked what the Bill will achieve. In effect we are implementing an international convention, which is a major step and will be very important for the future. On the question of aerial surveillance, this is carried out for the Department by the Air Corps. We recently had a private firm on an independent contract carry out a very detailed aerial surveillance. We are moving along those lines.

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to restate the basic approach of the Government to the crisis in Kosovo.</P>
      <P>The Government has consistently supported a peaceful solution to this problem. The means to achieve this are clear and are available through the interim agreement evolved in the talks in France which was worked on by international mediators and signed by the Kosovar Albanian delegation. The Kosovars compromised, in terms of postponing their goal of independence and provisions to disarm the KLA. Serbia has shown no spirit of compromise and seems to be oblivious to the benefits which this agreement could provide, in terms of safeguarding the integrity of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and ensuring the future of the Serb minority in Kosovo.</P>
      <P>In tandem with the Serb rejection of this basis for peace, we have witnessed the increasing prospect of a humanitarian catastrophe in Kosovo, as Serb units, in clear disregard of the Holbrooke-Milosevic agreement of last October, continue to repress the Kosovar Albanians.</P>
      <P>The terms and demands of UN Security Council Resolution 1199 of 23 September are valid and apply in full. The Belgrade authorities must end the use of excessive and disproportionate force in Kosovo, and they must withdraw their army and special police forces to pre-crisis levels.</P>
      <P>The international community remains committed to addressing the situation in Kosovo. Two days ago the Taoiseach met the Russian Prime Minister, Mr. Primakov, in Shannon. The Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, are attending the European Council in Berlin. The Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs will report to the House on the outcome of the Berlin discussions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The European Council in Berlin has issued important statements reflecting the views of Ireland and all partners. The European Council has recalled that the common objective of Ireland <Col N="1151" /> and its EU partners has been to persuade the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to accept a ceasefire in Kosovo and a political solution to the Kosovo conflict. It is imperative that a humanitarian catastrophe in Kosovo be prevented.</P>
    <P>I invite the House to reflect on the fact that over 250,000 Kosovars are now homeless because of the repression carried out by Belgrade's security forces. Some 65,000 have been driven from their homes in the last month, 25,000 since the peace talks broke down in Paris last Friday. While the Kosovo Albanians signed the Rambouillet accords, Belgrade's forces poured into Kosovo to start a new offensive. Since the outbreak of hostilities in Kosovo in March 1998 around 440,000 people, more than one fifth of the population of Kosovo, have fled or been displaced. There are new victims every day. The civilian population is the target of the hostilities.</P>
    <P>The international community has done its utmost to find a peaceful solution to the Kosovo conflict. In Rambouillet, and most recently in Paris, intensive efforts have been made after months of preparation to negotiate an agreement for the self-government of Kosovo which is fair for both parties to the conflict and which would ensure a peaceful future for Kosovo Serbs as well as Kosovo Albanians and all other national communities. The draft agreement, which was signed by the Kosovo Albanians in Paris meets these requirements. On the basis of sovereignty and territorial integrity of Yugoslavia it assures Kosovo a high degree of self-government, guarantees the individual human rights of all citizens in Kosovo according to the highest European standards, envisages extensive rights for all national communities living in Kosovo and creates the basis for the necessary reconstruction of the war-torn region.</P>
    <P>The Yugoslav leadership under President Milosevic has persistently refused to engage seriously in the search for a political solution. It has presented the Yugoslav people with a distorted picture of the issues and course of the negotiations. In addition, the Serb police and Yugoslav Federal Armed Forces have in the last few weeks massively reinforced their presence in Kosovo, thereby further exceeding the ceilings set out in the Holbrooke-Milosevic agreement of 12 October 1998. Finally the Yugoslav security forces are conducting military operations against the civilian population in Kosovo. On the threshold of the 21st century, Europe cannot tolerate a humanitarian catastrophe in its midst.</P>
    <P>In Berlin yesterday, the European Union, including Ireland, restated its commitment to secure peace and co-operation in the region which will guarantee respect of basic European values, i.e. the respect of human and minority rights, international law, democratic institutions and the inviolability of borders.</P>
    <P>The policy of the European Union, including Ireland, is neither directed against the Yugoslav or Serb population nor against the Federal <Col N="1152" /> Republic of Yugoslavia or Serbia. It is directed against the irresponsible policy of the Yugoslav leadership. It is directed against security forces cynically and brutally fighting a part of their own population. We want to put an end to these outrages. President Milosevic must, in the view of the European Union, stop Serb aggression in Kosovo and sign the Rambouillet accords.</P>
    <P>The European Council in Berlin has urged the Yugoslav leadership under President Milosevic to summon up the courage at this juncture to radically change its policy. The North Atlantic Alliance is taking action against military targets in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in order to put an end to the humanitarian catastrophe in Kosovo.</P>
    <P>The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is facing the severest consequences of its failure to work with the international community for a peaceful settlement of the Kosovo crisis. President Milosevic must, in the view of the European Union, take full responsibility for what is happening. The European Union has made clear that it is up to President Milosevic to stop the military action by immediately ceasing his aggression in Kosovo and by accepting the Rambouillet accords.</P>
    <P>The UN Secretary General, Kofi Annan, has also regretted that in spite of all the efforts made by the international community the Yugoslav authorities have persisted in their rejection of a settlement which would have halted the bloodshed in Kosovo and secured an equitable peace for the population there. He has commented that it is tragic that diplomacy has failed, but there are times when the use of force may be legitimate in the pursuit of peace.</P>
    <P>I want to correct an impression that has grown up of divergences among the neutral members of the European Union. The Minister for Foreign Affairs had the opportunity in Berlin to meet with his Finnish, Swedish and Austrian colleagues. Each regretted the fact that resort had been had to force but there was also understanding of the reasons it had been resorted to. It would have been better to have situated the use of force within the context of the UN Security Council.</P>
    <P>Faced with the humanitarian and refugee crisis, I assure the House that the EU and the Department of Foreign Affairs are co-ordinating closely with the international aid agencies to respond to the extra demands made on them by the additional recent refugee crisis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one of the most saddening debates this House will have had the responsibility to undertake in recent years. I and my party supported the action by the allies in and over Kuwait to reverse the Iraqi annexation of that sovereign country. The difficulty with this debate is that Serbia is a sovereign country and its borders are recognised to include Kosovo within them. In this instance, the allies are invading by air a sovereign country. That creates a radically different legal situation from the one which <Col N="1153" /> obtained in regard to the allied action, which I strongly supported, to reverse the annexation of Kuwait by Iraq.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge that times are reached in international relations when the use of force is necessary when all diplomatic means of resolving a difficulty have been exhausted. One should not, and I do not, approach this debate from the point of view that Ireland must always oppose the use of force in all situations. That is not a realistic position for us to adopt. However, Irish people understand better than most the extreme sensitivity of the position in the Balkans because there are many parallels.</P>
      <P>The Serbian people have a deep sense of grievance going back to the start of the 1914-18 war when Serbia was extinguished as an entity by the Austro-Hungarians following a dispute over the extradition of somebody who had been involved in an assassination. A matter as small as that ignited the First World War in Sarajevo.</P>
      <P>During the Second World War large numbers of Serbs were the victims of genocide in Bosnia-Herzegovina, where the Ustashe, which consisted of Catholic Croats and Muslim Bosniacs, engaged in systematic genocide of the Serbian people in Bosnia, the result of which was that whereas the Serbs were a majority in Bosnia in 1939, they had become a minority by 1945. That is very recent. The Serbs have a deep sense of victimhood which we, in Ireland, can recognise as existing among both communities in Northern Ireland who feel put upon in one way or other by history. In the case of Serbia and the Balkans, that history is far more recent than 1690.</P>
      <P>It is also important to add to this explosive situation the issue of religion. The Serbs are Orthodox, the Croats are Catholic and the Bosniacs and Albanians are Muslim. While one might, in one's sophisticated moments, wish to pretend that religion does not enter into these matters, it does. It enters into people's hearts.</P>
      <P>We should have a clear understanding that at this moment the Serbs clearly feel they are the victims. The Kosovars feel they are the victims, the Muslims of Bosnia feel they are the victims and no doubt the Croats in parts of the area concerned feel they are the victims. In addition, there is an immense difficulty in that there are no effective states in the immediate vicinity capable of doing business. Albania hardly exists as a state. It exists in a state of undeclared civil war between two factions in the north and south of the country. It does not have an effective civic authority and it cannot do business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Serbia is a centralised dictatorship, where its negotiators were largely unable to make decisions at Rambouillet because everything had to be referred back to one man, who caused the problem when in 1991 he extinguished Kosovar autonomy within the Yugoslav federation. It was that decision, which was done for entirely selfish political reasons by President Milosevic to win votes in Serbia, to reverse autonomy which had been <Col N="1154" /> put in place to give Kosovars a sense of dignity, which led to this dreadful situation.</P>
    <P>It is important to recognise that the Kosovars were pacifist for a long time in the face of this provocation. The KLA only recently came into the field. For a long time the Kosovars supported a pacifist leadership seeking a peaceful resolution of this issue but they got nowhere. That is why force was used eventually by the KLA.</P>
    <P>The difficulty is that the Serbs know the KLA demands Kosovar independence, whatever about it accepting autonomy as a stepping stone. That will mean redrawing the internal boundaries in the Balkans, creating a new state and drawing a new border. That will create a precedent for other countries, such as Macedonia, where there is an Albanian minority, perhaps even as far away as Romania, where there is a large Hungarian minority, northern Serbia, where there is a significant Hungarian minority, and of course Bosnia, where the existing settlement is extremely precarious and going from bad to worse &ndash; no doubt the bombing will not help community relations in Bosnia.</P>
    <P>We should be honest enough to admit that UN Security Council Resolution 1199 does not authorise this operation. Whatever may be claimed by NATO, there is no mention of the use of force in that resolution. We should not stretch credibility too far in making such a claim. It is better to be honest and say that this was a political decision without legal authority than to pretend there is a spurious legal authority when none exists.</P>
    <P>We should also not underestimate the gravity of the situation. The Yugoslav army is one of the biggest armies in Europe. My understanding is that the federal Yugoslav army is bigger than the French army and the British army. It has 115,000 men under arms, more than 1,000 tanks, 1,000 helicopters capable of transporting troops, 250 war planes, some of which are extremely modern, and a sophisticated air defence system. The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia may be a Third World country in terms of the living conditions of some of its people, but it is very much a first world country in terms of its military hardware and capacity. It has highly trained people.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to be honest in pointing out that this is not just an American-led operation. Europeans have been intimately involved in devising the strategy which led to the Rambouillet talks and the military threats which were part of the Rambouillet talks process. It is important to understand that the Rambouillet talks were called on the basis that they were backed by military threats if agreement there was not implemented. A threat of such action as is now taking place was inherent in the Rambouillet talks, which were initiated by the French and the British, that is Europeans, not Americans.</P>
    <P>There is a real difficulty. The Rambouillet talks followed the Racak massacre by the Serbs of the Kosovars and were justified. There was a real fear of genocide in Kosovo, to which the Rambouillet talks and the military threat were a reasonable <Col N="1155" /> response at the time, but I do not understand how bombing alone can resolve a political situation on the ground. I accept that military means are sometimes necessary to resolve political conflicts on the ground, but I do not understand how bombing can resolve such a political conflict.</P>
    <P>The likelihood is, as somebody told me at a meeting last night, that the bombing will aggravate the civil war and will be used as a pretext for further Serb massacres of the Kosovars. I have been told by somebody who has been involved intimately on a daily basis in seeking peace in the Balkans that we can expect, as a result of this decision, one million refugees within two weeks in this area. I have also been told that the bombing will help President Milosevic. He does not have the guts to reach an agreement with the Kosovars because he came to power by exploiting Serb nationalism, which is one of the most dangerous sentiments in any country. He cannot give up Kosovo, just as perhaps the Provisional IRA says it cannot give up arms, not that it will not but that it cannot. It is argued that he will only do so if he is forced to do so. In being forced to do so he will rally his people behind him and become, even more, the Serb victim.</P>
    <P>It is important to remember that one of the reasons the Serbs have such an attachment to Kosovo is that it is the location of a major battle in Serb history. It is interesting that the battle is commemorated even though the Serbs lost. This gives one a sense of the psychology of the Serbs and their sense of being victims of history. The bombing will help President Milosevic. It will also help the KLA. They have no plan of what they will do if they win this war. They have no idea of an economic or social programme for an independent Kosovo. Those who have spoken to them are struck by the total absence of any social or economic thinking and the total preoccupation with militarism on the part of the Kosovars. One cannot speak of good people with white hats and bad people with black hats in this situation. There is much badness in all parties, Serbs as well as Kosovars.</P>
    <P>My great feeling is for the damage this conflict will do to other Balkan countries such as Bulgaria and Romania which are currently undertaking a painful economic reconstruction. Macedonia is undertaking a very difficult process of reconstruction and political reconciliation. All of this will be undermined politically by this conflict, and economically by the consequence that no one will wish to invest in or trade with the region while the war is going on. The victims will be the other Balkan countries. They will find their economies destroyed by what is happening.</P>
    <P>This House has a difficulty in adopting a high moral tone. We are not involved because we have chosen not to become involved in the making of European defence decisions and not to allow ourselves to become informed about the considerations that go to make European defence decisions. We have chosen that course. This <Col N="1156" /> means that we do not have the information available to other countries which have been taken into the confidence of those making these decisions. I do not know, and I do not imagine the Minister knows what, if anything, Richard Holbrook offered to President Milosevic, the rejection of which led to the bombing. Ireland does not know because we have chosen not to be involved. Therefore, we have a difficulty in luxuriating in high moral judgments about the actions of others.</P>
    <P>It may be that this action was necessary for the sake of NATO's credibility and the maintenance of peace in Europe. Equally, it may be that there is no strategy behind it or any clear idea of what will happen after the bombing. There may be no clear sense of how, having bombed Serbia, the Serbs can be persuaded to engage in a federal arrangement with the Kosovars or how such a federal arrangement will work, given the bitterness the war will engender. Federations are difficult to operate at the best of times, as we know from our membership of the European Union. They involve compromise. In the European Union we are obliged to compromise with countries with whom we have been at peace for 50 years. How easy will it be for the new Yugoslav federation, as envisaged by the allies to include Kosovar autonomy, to function on the basis of the compromises that are necessary on mundane matters such as money, the routes of roads and so on, so recently after a bloody civil war? My main worry is that this initiative and its consequences have not been thought through. While I do not exclude the possibility that NATO may be absolutely right, even in these precise circumstances, in using force it is not evident that this action has been thought out thoroughly.</P>
    <P>I hope it will be possible for the other Security Council members who may have the capacity to persuade President Milosevic and allow him to save face by making a concession to do so now. It is not sufficient for those who are not supporting NATO simply to stand on the sidelines and condemn. They have a responsibility to put pressure on President Milosevic to come forward with an alternative peace strategy that will work and will respect Kosovar rights. No one should luxuriate in moral condemnation at this time. We need an urgent effort to rekindle diplomacy even while the war is continuing.</P>

      <P>This is a sad day for Europe and for the international community. Diplomacy has lost out and militarism has the upper hand. The United Nations has been bypassed and we have moved dangerously down the road towards a form of international vigilantism. It is also a sad day for Irish foreign policy. We have what amounts to full scale war in <Col N="1157" /> Europe for the first time in 45 years, yet the Irish Government apparently has nothing substantial to say on the matter. We have a Government which is seeking a seat on the Security Council of the United Nations but has nothing to say about the effective bypassing of the United Nations by NATO.</P>
      <P>I draw attention to the Minister's speech. He merely says that it would have been better to have situated the use of force within the context of the United Nations Security Council. What does that mean? There is no comment on whether the Government believes this action is legitimate, legal or illegal. There is no statement to indicate whether the Government supports the bombing. The Minister simply says that the bombing can be stopped if President Milosevic agrees to the Rambouillet interim agreement. This is a sad day for Irish foreign policy. We have, in the words of Deputy Gay Mitchell, been neutered on the international stage. If the Government addressed itself to the issues it would be quite capable of adopting a principled position in relation to international affairs.</P>
      <P>I accept the need for Ireland to maintain good relations with our EU colleagues who are members of NATO and with the British and United States Governments who have worked so hard to bring about a solution to the conflict in Northern Ireland. Maintaining friendly relations with other countries, however, does not mean that we must suspend our critical faculties when they take actions with which we do not agree. Countries such as Austria which have come out strongly against the NATO attack have shown that it is possible to be a member of the European Union without losing one's voice.</P>
      <P>It is not a question of opposing NATO and lining up behind Slobodan Milosevic. I am sure no one in this House has anything but contempt for President Milosevic, who seems to be imbued with the most malignant form of nationalism. We all deplore the atrocities for which his Serb forces have been responsible in Kosovo. The issue is whether the military strikes launched by NATO are legitimate under international law and whether they will achieve the stated objective of relieving the plight of the people of Kosovo. Military action, especially in the absence of any mandate from the United Nations is a serious misjudgment. It has already shown signs of reopening cold war divisions between Russia and the West and will certainly lead to increased tension in the Balkans. There is no reason to believe it will dislodge Slobodan Milosevic, a brutal dictator, and there is a real danger that it will strengthen his domestic political position. It is hard to see how bomb or missile attacks will do anything for the humanitarian needs of the long suffering people of Kosovo and, based on similar experiences in the past, it will almost certainly lead to the death and mutilation of entirely innocent people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1158" /> I accept that exceptional efforts have already been made to broker a diplomatic solution to the crisis and that the position of President Milosevic has been difficult and intransigent. There is no doubt that the Serbian forces within Kosovo have been guilty of serious atrocities against the civilian population. However, military intervention at this stage runs the risk of setting off a chain of events that could plunge the entire Balkan region into a wider conflict. Why has there been no serious attempt to apply international pressure through effective sanctions such as those imposed and which remain in place against Iraq? Why has there been no attempt to isolate Yugoslavia? Why have diplomatic relations with Belgrade not been severed? Why has military action been the first option rather than the last resort? The aim of the international community must be to secure meaningful autonomy for Kosovo which would ensure the religious and cultural rights of its people are upheld and their civil rights respected. In their declaration following the Cardiff Summit in June last, EU leaders stated in relation to Kosovo:</P>
    <P>The European Union remains firmly opposed to independence. It continues to support a special status, including a large degree of autonomy for Kosovo, within the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.</P>
    <P>This is a position the Labour Party supports and which the Irish Government should be attempting to secure through peaceful and diplomatic means.</P>
    <P>There are occasions when military intervention by the international community can be justified, but this must only be done in accordance with a clear and specific mandate from the United Nations. In this case, NATO has acted unilaterally and without any mandate. The issue here is further complicated by the fact that the international community, including all NATO members, recognises Kosovo as part of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.</P>
    <P>The rights under international law of anyone to interfere in the internal affairs of an individual country are, quite rightly, severely restrained. There is clearly a need to update international law to allow for changed post-Cold War circumstances. If international bodies are to be allowed to interfere in the internal affairs of a country in exceptional circumstances, to prevent mass killings for instance, the principles must be applied equally and without distinction.</P>
    <P>In this case NATO is guilty of selective indignation. Tens of thousands of Kurds have been killed by Turkish forces in Turkey and regular massacres occur, yet there is no question of NATO intervention because Turkey is a member of NATO and is co-operating in the operation against Serbia. There are also endless incidents of larger countries flouting international law and ignoring UN resolutions without ever having to face the threat of outside intervention. We are now in a situation where the initial bomb and <Col N="1159" /> missile attacks have been launched, and all the indications are that these are the opening salvos of a campaign that may go on for weeks.</P>
    <P>The primary policy objective of the Irish Government must now be to seek an immediate suspension of the attack. We should co-operate with other neutral countries inside and outside the EU in seeking an end to the military action. We should get off the fence and say politely but firmly to our friends in Britain and the United States that we do not consider military action to be appropriate at this time or in these circumstances.</P>
    <P>Ireland should seek an immediate meeting of the Security Council of the United Nations and, if necessary, the General Assembly. Ireland should also join with other neutral countries in promoting a motion calling for the suspension of the military action and a renewal of diplomatic efforts to broker a peaceful solution.</P>
    <P>When the fighting has been stopped the humanitarian needs of the people of Kosovo will have to be addressed. I hope those NATO powers, who have already spent tens of millions of pounds in launching air and missile strikes, will be willing to spend the same amounts on reconstruction and humanitarian needs.</P>
    <P>If we have learned anything from the past decade in Yugoslavia, and from the past 30 years on our own island, it is that nationalism can be a corrosive and destructive force, especially when symbols, flags, rituals and names are allowed to take precedence over the needs and lives of human beings. We need to move beyond nationalism. Traditional enemies like Germany and France are now close colleagues in the European Union, but in much of central and eastern Europe the divisions are as deep as ever and threaten to spill over into violent conflict. We need to look at a new European collective security system where ethnic minorities, oppressed groups and the economically dispossessed do not feel they have to resort to arms and fundamentalism to have their security protected.</P>
    <P>The OSCE played an important part in defusing the crisis in Kosovo at the end of last year and it should have a renewed role in rebuilding peace in Kosovo when the missiles are back in their silos and the war planes are back in their bases.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>In the brief time available to me I want to raise a number of questions that are provoked by recent events. Before doing so, I want to comment on a complex and thoughtful contribution by the Leader of Fine Gael, Deputy Bruton. One's right to exercise sovereignty in building a civil society, as an alternative to militarism or to valorise the tool of diplomacy as an alternative to threatening military action, is not conditional on being privy to any group of people who seek to use either the threat of militarism or the possession of military capacity and force in international relations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1160" /> It is sad that there is such a sparsely attended House as we are discussing this tragedy at the end of the century. It is a tragedy which, unfortunately, is a re-run of something we have got used to in the media of lights lighting up and the sight of damage, injury and destruction in places of conflict. With no disrespect to the Minister of State, for whom I have great respect, I am disappointed there is no member of the Cabinet in the House to discuss this motion which is a matter of great importance.</P>
    <P>The nature of the discussion we have had so far and the statements issued on behalf of the Government raise some fundamental questions, one of which has been already addressed. What is the authority for building a military sanction into the talks in Rambouillet? The talks in Rambouillet, followed by the talks in Paris, had sponsoring countries. I raise the question as to the manner in which they secured an assent that was greater than the Security Council and the right to offer as a tail to the discussions of a diplomatic kind the threat of military action. I will offer a short answer. It does not have one shred of justification in international law. It is rather the assertion of the arrogance of the strong and the abuse of might of those with the greatest military power.</P>
    <P>Who took the decision to give a mandate to such sponsoring countries that is not being sought from the Security Council? As an aspirant member of the Security Council, Ireland should reflect on a situation in which those who anticipate that they will not get the decision they want from the Security Council decide to bypass the Security Council altogether. Is it now the Government's foreign policy to seek to amend the procedures of the Security Council to prevent the abuse of the veto, or is it its complicit assent with those seeking to bypass the Security Council? The damage done to the authority of the United Nations and to the role of the Security Council by this latest event is nearly irrevocable.</P>
    <P>I also want to raise the question as to the manner in which the territory that has been chosen as the site for the bombing has been defined. For example, what consideration has been given to the position of Montenegro, which resists inclusion within the Yugoslav federation and which has not participated in the declaration of war? Is it because of its convenience as a military target that it has been defined as part of that towards which the bombing can be directed?</P>
    <P>I pose this question and I want an answer from the Department. Is it now the Government's position that ethnic and religious differences can be solved only on the basis of territory? If that is not its position, what initiatives has the Government sponsored or is it seeking to sponsor within membership of the Security Council to find a resolution of such conflicts based on ethnicity, identity or religion?</P>
    <P>What are the implications in relation to the rhetoric behind the Partnership for Peace, whose many advocates here want to take part in the <Col N="1161" /> military picnics in Europe of which they feel deprived at home? Are they happy with the recent actions of NATO and can they be made consistent with the diplomatic methodology being claimed to be the basis for Partnership for Peace? What would be the role of the United States as the appointed peacekeeper leading with a military spear the resolution of conflicts in different parts of the world?</P>
    <P>Ireland's response so far has hardly been elegant and our position has been described as being between a rock and a hard place. It was a rather pathetic response given the fundamental questions I have posed. One is not required to be a member of a defence arrangement to adopt a moral position. It is interesting that member countries of NATO have been invoking a morality for their action. It is fascinating to think about how exclusive their morality is and how silent they have been on changing the definition of some of the UN charter principles to include, for example, principles of right. As Deputy De Rossa said, people such as myself who pose these questions do so while totally abhorring and condemning Milosevic's action. I do not want to hear the usual shabby response suggesting that because we put these questions, we are on the other side.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>The bombing of Yugoslavia is a reckless and unjustified act in breach of international law, puts huge strains on the West's relationship with Russia and is even militarily questionable. It plays into the hands of Milosevic and the ultra nationalists and, because of the failure to deploy ground troops, will lead to reprisals by Serbs in Kosovo resulting in huge losses and perhaps even genocide. That is why I call on the Government to condemn this act of madness.</P>
      <P>The Austrian Government &ndash; Austria is also a neutral country &ndash; has condemned it and has said it will not provide assistance and will not allow NATO airplanes to go through its airspace. What would Frank Aiken have said on this matter? It seems the Government has no backbone and this really is a lily-livered response.</P>
      <P>This action is not ultimately about the salvation of Kosovo and the Kosovars. It is really about NATO asserting its authority in Europe. During the negotiations in Rambouillet, Milosevic was told that it was NATO or nothing. Deputy John Bruton said we are not sure what went on in those negotiations. We have a fair idea. That was what was put to Milosevic. He actually said he wanted UN forces to come in but the idea was rejected by the Kosovars and by NATO because of the tragic experience of Srebenica. To simply write the UN out of the equation is not the answer. Today I call on the parties, particularly the UN to assert what authority it has left. We must remember that in the case of Srebenica, there was no ceasefire and that the UN force on the ground was particularly weak.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Green Party supports the establishment of a two-tier UN force &ndash; the first tier responsible for traditional peacekeeping tasks and the second <Col N="1162" /> tier responsible for safe areas to protect civilians with a strong military capability so that it could keep and make the peace. If this was in place, we would see no more situations like that which occurred at Srebenica and the Kosovo crisis could have been avoided. This structure is one the UN would like to put in place but, unfortunately, the Americans have continually obstructed the building of the UN. It is time the Government and the EU pushed urgently for UN reform.</P>
    <P>Yesterday, the Minister for Defence, Deputy Michael Smith, did not answer very important questions. I again ask if we have been asked for assistance by NATO. Have NATO planes flown into our airspace? I regard any assistance to NATO as completely unacceptable. The Minister in his response quoted UN Security Council Resolution 1199 continually and gave it as the excuse for military action. The Israelis continually breach UN resolutions but are NATO going to bomb them? I think not. We have the example of atrocities against the Kurds and nothing is done. We are being very selective.</P>
    <P>The Government has held back on this because of our commitments to Partnership for Peace and we will see ourselves joining NATO. I notice Deputy Gay Mitchell is not with us today and the response of his party leader was far more measured. Deputy Gay Mitchell seemed to be in fairly gung-ho mood yesterday when it came to the bombing. It is important to remember we have signed up to the Amsterdam Treaty. What Deputy John Bruton said was not quite right that we have no input into European security.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">

This means Irish troops could find themselves on Kosovan soil, and that is something which would be very regrettable indeed.</P>

      <P>I congratulate Deputy Higgins on his statement but nobody on this side of the House or I suspect on the other side is trying to suggest for one minute by way of shabby excuse that we approve of the use of force. There is no question of us trying to demonise Mr. Milosevic but it is important that everybody in this House is aware of his record. He is not a reputable international statesman; he is a gangster at large who has perpetrated terrible deeds against the Albanians in Kosovo. He is not a person with whom we would wish to express any solidarity and that was reflected in the statement by the Minister for Foreign Affairs broadcast on television earlier this morning from Berlin. His concern is that we are caught between a rock and a hard place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1163" /> How are we to act in relation to a man like Mr. Milosevic who has shown such blatant disregard for the rights of his own people and those of other peoples? I emphasise the words &ldquo;rights of other peoples&rdquo; because it seems to me that &ndash; I may be incorrect in this conclusion and do not wish to be aggressive in asserting it &ndash; Deputy De Rossa talks about this being an internal problem. It is not an internal Serbian problem but a problem created by Mr. Milosevic in a determined way to trample on the rights of a free people, which he has no right to do.</P>
    <P>The international community has had a bewildered and slow response to what has been going on in that part of the world. In fact, one of the signal condemnations of the EU is its lack of action in the Balkans where World War One started. Since the events which occurred so many years ago in Sarajevo, there has been a very weak-kneed international response. Resorting to force in this case is not the preferred or optimum response. Deputy Gormley wondered what Frank Aiken would have thought. I would draw rather more on what De Valera said about those who use and perpetrate force on occasion. He said he could not condone but that he could not pretend not to understand. That is the real politick of the situation.</P>
    <P>We cannot condone a breach of international law in the sense that this action has not been brought before the UN Security Council, which is regrettable. We cannot pretend not to understand why it has occurred and forget what lies on the other side of this equation, that is, a person who, if given the opportunity, would have no problem trampling on the rights of people other than the Albanians. He is an openly opportunistic individual who has traded his Marxism for political opportunism and gangsterism and is a person to whom we should not give any form of moral approval or shelter for his activities.</P>
    <P>It is a pity there has not been a mandate for this action at the UN Security Council and it may point to a weakness in the Security Council. I suppose some of the NATO countries will make a very cogent case that UN Security Council Resolution 1199 which called on Mr. Milosevic to withdraw his people from Albanian soil has been flagrantly ignored by him and on that basis, they have a mandate for the use of force. That will be resolved at a later stage.</P>
    <P>This House should not be quick to condemn, and I understand the concerns on the opposite side of the House which were shared this morning by no less a person than Germaine Greer. Her fear was that this action might strengthen Milosevic in his domestic political set up and his form of licensed gangsterism. That should not force us to condemn this action because it is an inevitable result of Mr. Milosevic's blatant disregard for individual human rights.</P>

At the same time the Serb minority within Kosovo must have an absolute guarantee that all their rights, cultural and political, will be respected. The crude policy of bombing by NATO forces cannot and will not resolve the extremely complex issue of ethnic peoples in the Balkans or anywhere else. NATO is not even in favour of the right of the Kosovars to self-determination and it has made that quite clear. It is not the sordid and vicious regime of Milosevic that will really suffer as a result of this bombing adventure but innocent people, including Serbs opposed to the regime of Milosevic and innocent Kosovars. While the bombing of Iraq and the sanctions against Iraq have left thousands dead, including thousands of innocent children, the brutal dictatorship of Saddam Hussein survives. Milosevic can even strengthen his dictatorship as a result of NATO's action. He can use it as a cover to further crack down on opposition within Serbia, including organisations such as independent trade unions and so on, which oppose his regime.</P>
      <P>NATO powers do not worry about keeping dictatorships intact. The military powers that make up NATO have kept dictatorships in place all over the world. They have happily sold arms to them and continue to do so when it suits them. NATO's credibility in guaranteeing the rights of persecuted nations is nil. The barbaric repression of the Kurdish people in Turkey is passed over in silence because Turkey is a crucial member of NATO.</P>
      <P>I am astonished at the position taken by the Government. The speak in the Minister's statement is that of parroting NATO. Safeguarding the integrity of Yugoslavia is one of the arguments put forward, which means continuing to deny the people of Kosovo the right to independence. He spoke about going to pre-crisis levels of Serbian forces within Kosovo, but pre-crisis levels will still mean horrific repression for the people of Kosovo.</P>
      <P>It is imperative that the regime of Milosevic is overthrown, but that is not the aim of NATO. The people of the region cannot put their trust in the ex-Stalinist gangsters, like Milosevic, who rule some of those states, nor can they put their faith in the cynical military power of western capitalism represented in NATO. It is a task for the Serbian people to oppose the dictatorship of Milosevic. By linking opposition movements among ordinary people in Serbia with movements of peasants and workers within Kosovo, on the basis of freedom and respect for culture and political difference, and forming a federation, based also on democratic socialism, which means that the wealth of the area is for the people, we can have peace in the Balkans, the rights of all the people respected and an end to the nightmare that currently exists. That will not be done by bombing.</P>

      <P>I regret I did not have the opportunity to hear the earlier part of this debate, <Col N="1165" /> as I had to attend a meeting I could not avoid. This is a significant debate. We are talking about the potential for major conflict. It is easy to take the view I heard expressed by some recent speakers that any form of violence and force is of itself wrong. We should begin from the premise that the appeasement of tyranny is one of the greatest mistakes the world has made in the past. The appeasement of Hitler right throughout the 1930s led to the horrors of the Second World War, to that war going on for six years, to the deaths of dozens of millions of people and appalling suffering.</P>
      <P>We have in Europe today another tyrant, an anti-democratic dictator who is prepared to use his position to tyrannise many other people. It was painful for the Slovenian people and the Croatian people to get themselves out from under the yoke of this tyrant. He now seeks to put the Albanian people of Kosovo under the same tyranny. It is perfectly reasonable that they should resist and that the free world should assist them.</P>
      <P>The basic question is well put in a leading article in today's edition of <i>The Irish Times. </i>It contrasts the question of legality based on whether one has the entire Security Council supporting one with the legality of the right, on behalf of free people and democracies, to intervene to protect those whose rights are being very seriously interfered with by a tyrant.</P>
      <P>The Secretary General of the United Nations was in Dublin recently. I had the good fortune to meet him at a dinner given for him by the Minister for Foreign Affairs in Iveagh House. In the course of conversation I raised with him the question of whether the United Nations should have a mobile force available to it that was capable of dealing with tyranny as it arose in various places. He said that, in theory, that is fine and the United Nations would like to have that available to them, but his difficulty is that he would have to get the assent of the five permanent members of the Security Council to the use of such a force and the force could well become academic because there are very few situations in which the assent of the five permanent members could be obtained. He was right, and this is one of them.</P>
      <P>The fact that two members of Security Council dissented from this action that has been taken cannot be allowed to invalidate it. It is incumbent on the free world to try to defend human rights and it is not as if this were done arbitrarily and quickly. Diplomacy has been tried with this man, for not just months but for years. He has broken his word. He has refused to sign agreements that were entirely reasonable and the consequences of what he is now suffering are of his own making.</P>

      <P>I wish to record in the strongest possible terms my opposition and that of my party to the attack of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation on Serbia. This is undoubtedly the most serious act of international military aggression within Europe since the end of the Second World War. NATO has carried out these <Col N="1166" /> attacks in violation of international law and without reference to the United Nations. All previous experience shows that military intervention by foreign powers will serve only to deepen the national and social divisions in the region and postpone the prospect of a peaceful long-term solution.</P>

      <P>Quite a number of Departments are actively working in this area at this time, including my own Department and the Departments of the Environment and Local Government, Health and Children and Agriculture and Food. As the Minister of State with responsibility for consumer affairs, I greatly welcome the ongoing work in these Departments, particularly the Government's decision to co-ordinate our work in this area at interdepartmental level. In addition, my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, is progressing with his consultative process on GMOs.</P>
      <P>As Minister of State with responsibility for consumer affairs, one of my main concerns in this area is to ensure the consumer is in a position to make well informed choices in relation to GMO products, especially GM food. It is my earnest hope that today's debate on this subject will be of assistance to consumers in enlightening them on the issues involved in relation to GM food.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While my Department is responsible for general food labelling rules, legislation falling within the remit of other Departments contains additional specific labelling requirements. For example, the Department of Agriculture and Food is responsible for legislation containing labelling rules for jams, wines and quick frozen foods, while the Department of Health and Children has introduced legal requirements for <Col N="1167" /> nutritional labelling of baby foods. Responsibility for labelling of novel foods, i.e. foodstuffs new to the food chain, and novel food ingredients lies with the Department of Health and Children. Novel foods are foods and food ingredients which have not been used to a significant degree within the EU. Foods which contain, or are produced from, genetically modified organisms fall within the scope of the definition. I have outlined the number of Departments involved because it is important that we co-ordinate our work. I welcome the fact that this is being done in a very specific way through the interdepartmental committee.</P>
    <P>At EU level we have developed legislation in this area. The purpose of the measures adopted by the EU on the labelling of GMOs and their derivatives is to give consumers clear, honest, neutral and scientifically sound information on products derived from a genetically modified source. I will have more to say about this later.</P>
    <P>In July 1997 the European Commission adopted a general policy on the labelling of genetically modified products, which stated it would develop legislation on the labelling of products consisting of, or containing, GMOs throughout the food chain. The labelling should give consumers clear, honest and neutral information on products about the GMO origin of products, facilitating choice for consumers without stigmatising modern biotechnology or raising doubts about the safety of products.</P>
    <P>The Department of Health and Children is the competent authority in Ireland for EU legislation pertaining to the genetic modification of foodstuffs intended for human consumption. There are two EU regulations in this regard. Regulation 258/97, which came into force on 15 May 1997, introduced a statutory pre-market approval system for novel foods throughout the EU. The regulation applies to the placing of novel foods and novel food ingredients on the market in the European Union. In essence, the regulation provides that novel foods and novel food ingredients, as defined in the regulation, must be officially approved and authorised before being placed on the EU market.</P>
    <P>Regulation 1139/98, which came into force on 1 September 1998, ensures that the provisions of Regulation 258/97 apply to soya and maize which were placed on the market before the entry into force of Regulation 258/97. However, a genetically modified soya bean manufactured by Monsanto and a genetically modified maize manufactured by Novartis &ndash; formerly Ciba Geigy &ndash; were authorised under Directive 90/220/EEC prior to the coming into force of Regulation 258/97. The aim of Regulation 1139/98 is to ensure that the same labelling rules apply to food and food ingredients consisting of, or derived from, GMOs which were placed on the market before the entry into force of Regulation 258/97. Regulation 1139/98 lays down additional labelling requirements for the Monsanto genetically modified soya <Col N="1168" /> bean and the Novartis genetically modified maize. In essence, and in layman's language, if genetically modified protein or DNA is present in a foodstuff the foodstuff is subject to the additional labelling requirements.</P>
    <P>The Food Safety Authority of Ireland's scientific committee has established a GMO and novel foods sub-committee to advise the Minister for Health and Children on issues relating to the genetic modification of food. The sub-committee affords a forum for the exchange of expert scientific opinion and advice on this new technology and its application to food. The sub-committee assesses applications made under Regulation 258/97 and animal feed related applications made under Directive 90/220/EEC, for which the Environmental Protection Agency is the competent authority in Ireland. I understand that, to date, no application for the placing of a novel food on the market has been made to the Department of Health and Children. The FSAI sub-committee has considered a number of applications made to other member states but no product has yet received approval in the EU under Regulation 258/97.</P>
    <P>On 19 March the UK Government introduced legislation to give effect to Regulation 1139/98. The UK legislation obliges restaurants and other food outlets to indicate on their menus if a food contains genetically modified soya or maize or, alternatively, to convey the information to the consumer through a member of staff if a food contains genetically modified soya or maize, except where neither protein nor DNA resulting from genetic modification is present.</P>
    <P>I understand the Department of Health and Children is urgently considering the measures necessary to lay down the enforcement provisions and penalties for non-compliance with Regulation 1139/98 in Ireland. This involves urgent consideration of the issues in consultation with the newly established interdepartmental group on GMOs, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, industry and other relevant parties. A further element in this process would be an EU consensus on validated analytical methods to test if a product contains genetically modified DNA or protein, and discussions are continuing at EU level on this issue.</P>
    <P>I am aware of recent developments at retail level regarding information to the consumer about the sale of genetically modified foodstuffs. An international consortium of food retailers and industry has been established to validate sources of GM free crops, products and derivatives. The consortium, which includes a major Irish supermarket chain, will be responsible for establishing audit and testing processes to verify the authenticity of GM free raw materials to be used in their products. The consortium was established in response to customer demand to provide GM free foods. Providing consumers with a real and validated choice to purchase or not to purchase GM foods is to be welcomed. I will encourage <Col N="1169" /> support in all appropriate EU fora for this approach.</P>
    <P>The consumer is uncomfortable and suspicious about GMOs. As Senator Henry stated in a Seanad debate, giving the very good example of insulin, there is an appreciation of the importance of genetic engineering in the area of medicine. I share her view. The consumer can understand and see the benefits of genetic engineering in the area of medicine. However, the jury is out in relation to genetically modified foods.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the recent concerns and media reports concerning GM foods. This is a very complex issue, involving technical, scientific, ethical and economic aspects. Due to the recent emergence of this technology, we must approach the issues which it raises in a thorough, comprehensive and responsible manner. Much more information is required for all of us to weigh up the potential benefits against the potential risks. In my view, labelling requirements under current EU law are inadequate. These deficiencies are currently being addressed at EU level and the Government is fully committed to supporting these developments and working to ensure that the consequent legislation fully respects consumer rights.</P>
    <P>The rights of consumers must be fully protected in the matter of genetically modified foods. The consumer is entitled to exercise his or her own choice in regard to GM foods and to be provided with the means necessary to so do. The option to purchase foods which are guaranteed to be free of genetically modified organisms is a basic consumer right. Adequate labelling is, and will continue to be, essential in this regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague, Deputy Kitt, for sharing time with me. There is wide public interest in, and concern about, the use of GMOs in the environment, crops and food. There have been rapid developments in modern biotechnology. However, public information and product specific information, which would safeguard public choice in terms of the use of GMO products, have lagged behind, even though these products are becoming a reality in all our lives.</P>
      <P>We must address and respond to public interest and concern. I have been happy to play my part in this by tackling head on the issues which fall within my area of responsibility &ndash; the implications of the deliberate release of GMOs into the environment. A number of principles have guided, and continue to guide, my approach to dealing with these issues. The first is the precautionary principle. I have always underlined its application in this area and the importance of strong, effective, precautionary legislation. It is on that basis I am participating in EU negotiations to amend the Community directive on the deliberate release of GMOs into the environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have placed great emphasis on the issue of maximum transparency in the regulatory process <Col N="1170" /> for which I have overall responsibility, particularly in regard to the labelling of genetically modified products placed on the market. If GMOs are present in food, there should be clear and explicit labelling in that regard. Full information is the third key principle. I am absolutely committed to the provision of full information in this area as a basis for good public debate. The more information that can be made available, the better the debate will be. Stories aimed at scaring people which have been circulated can be addressed because they have little foundation. These principles are reflected in the national consultation paper on GMOs and the environment, which I published last year. It represented the first major public communication from Government in this important area. My aim was to stimulate informed debate among all interests, including the biotechnology sector and the general public.</P>
    <P>People have asked why, in dealing with this issue, Fianna Fáil has not acted on its pre-election promise to support a moratorium on the release of GMOs into the environment. That is a valid question and one that I am happy to answer. When I took up office, one of my first actions was to see what could be done to implement this promise. I was advised by my Department that under EU legislation it was not possible for Ireland, or any EU member state, to impose a unilateral ban on GMOs. I was not aware that the prohibition provisions contained in the EU legislation, for which I have responsibility in Ireland, are so restrictive in their application. Authorities in many other member states may have been under a similar misapprehension. The full extent of the restrictions has become clearer for all member states only as a result of the limited provisional prohibition action taken by two states in regard to a specific maize product. As Minister, I must respect EU legislation as it stands.</P>
    <P>This in no way detracts from my commitment to provide leadership and an opportunity for a full public debate on the amendment of EU legislation and the formulation of national policy on GMOs and the environment. I am delivering on that commitment through the process which began with the publication of my consultation paper. Having received almost 200 responses to that paper, I am pressing ahead to bring the process to a conclusion. In that context, questions were raised about the ability of the process to reflect in a balanced way the range of concerns and points of view in this complex area. Some respondents to the consultation paper suggested a national consensus conference mediated by a panel of lay people to represent public interest. While conferences of this nature have been held in a limited number of countries, there is no objective evidence that they represent the optimum way forward in all circumstances.</P>
    <P>In considering the best way to bring the consultation process to a conclusion, I was mindful of the need to build on the progress so far and put in place arrangements which are as participative and democratic as possible. This is particularly <Col N="1171" /> important given the range and balance of the many interests and individuals who responded to the consultation paper, all of whom I want to participate in the process until its conclusion.</P>
    <P>For that reason I decided to hold a two part debate. I have invited all the respondents to participate in the debate at which a number of key environmental issues will be identified and analysed in detail. I am acutely aware of the critical importance of independent management of the debate and an independent report on the outcome. I have finalised arrangements for it to take place before an independent panel comprising four people. It will be chaired by Mr. Turlough O'Donnell, QC, a member of the Law Reform Commission, former Lord Justice of Appeal in Northern Ireland and former Chairman of the Bar Council of Northern Ireland. The other three members will be Professor Dervilla Donnelly, Professor Emeritus of Chemistry in UCD, Mr. Sean Cromien, former secretary of the Department of Finance and a noted ornithologist, and Ms. Evelyn Owens, chairperson of the National Centre for Partnership and former chairperson of the Labour Court. I want to put on record my deep appreciation to all four members for their agreement to fulfil this important role.</P>
    <P>On foot of the report which the panel will prepare, and having regard to the written responses which have been received, I will complete the review of national environmental policy in this area as quickly as possible and issue a statement on the outcome. The full range of issues associated with genetic engineering cannot be addressed within the framework of my consultation process. Following a report by me to Government recently, the interdepartmental group, to which Deputy Kitt referred, was established. It will address these wider issues and prepare a co-ordinated overall position as soon as possible. Departments involved with other aspects of genetic engineering will, of course, assist in concluding the consultation process where issues overlap. I also regard it as particularly valuable that the results of the process will be available to inform and add value to the wider work of the interdepartmental group.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to have had the opportunity to bring Deputies up to date on the substantial progress that has been made on formulating a policy position on the environmental dimension to GMOs. I look forward to concluding the consultation process within the next few months. At that stage, the considerable time and energy devoted to the process will have been worth it. We will have arrived at a policy position on the environmental aspects of GMOs on the basis of a full, open and informed debate. That is exactly as it should be.</P>

      <P>I welcome the fact that provision has been made for statements on the issues arising from genetically modified organisms. I regard this series of statements as an opportunity to <Col N="1172" /> identify the issues and outline the concerns which should be dealt with in a full and informed debate. Such a debate should lead to the consideration of any relevant legislative and regulatory action on the genuine concerns identified during the debate. That debate should be calm and measured. However, the Minister, Deputy Dempsey and Minister of State, Deputy Kitt have, in my view, adopted what seems to be an excessively laid back approach to the statements today. That contrasts sharply with the approach adopted by the Green Party which has produced a two page document containing ten eminently questionable assertions and one utterly impractical proposal. I do not believe that is a good contribution to the debate but regrettably it is consistent&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I deplore the fact that a Green Party MEP recently made a most extraordinary and unfounded assertion about the effects of human insulin which has created alarm and confusion among people who do not deserve to be treated in such a fashion. Such assertions do not add to the value of a debate on this issue.</P>
      <P>The techniques of genetic engineering have been in use since the early 1980s in a range of areas from health care to food. In the areas of health care and pharmaceuticals, genetic engineering has enabled the development of human insulin which has had a dramatic effect on the treatment of diabetes. It has enabled the development of Interferon which has a wide range of applications in the treatment of a number of cancers and viral diseases. It has enabled the development of a vaccine for hepatitis B which, if left untreated, can lead to liver cancer and has enabled the development of substances which can assist in the treatment of HIV and AIDS. It has also enabled the development of diagnostic aids for certain types of cancer.</P>
      <P>In the food processing sector, genetically engineered enzymes have been in use for ten years in applications such as cheese manufacture and the clarification of beers, wines and fruit juices. In the pharmaceutical sector, it is estimated that biopharmaceuticals accounted for 13 per cent of all new chemical entities between 1990 and 1994 and accounted for 5 per cent of global pharmaceutical sales. It is forecast that as much as 30 per cent of all new pharmaceutical products produced after the year 2000 will involve some form of biotechnology in their research and development. In the areas of health care and diagnostics, more than 600 diagnostic products currently in use are based on biotechnology.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Biotechnology has played a role in the cleaning and remediation of soils after environmental disasters and it could have important applications in <Col N="1173" /> the management of effluent treatment plants. The Green Party would tell us we should avoid such disasters and would be quite right to do so. However, in this as in other areas, the Green Party seems to adopt the principle that we should not train doctors because doing so might encourage people to become ill. That is carrying the precautionary principle to absurd lengths.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>In recent times, debate on these issues has focused almost exclusively on the genetic engineering of food crops. Many concerns have been expressed in regard to the results of genetic engineering in this area and on its possible and, as yet unknown, effects on plant and human organisms. It seems that while the general public is prepared to accept fairly readily the palpable and obvious benefits of genetic engineering in the medical and health care sectors, there is a reluctance to accept the use of these techniques in regard to the food chain because of the suspicion that while certain benefits may be obvious in the short-term, there could be more long-term side effects of which we are not yet aware. Indeed, recent survey evidence in the EU indicates that food is now regarded as potentially dangerous with 68 per cent of people putting it at the same level of perceived risk as medical products. Although there may be a certain inconsistency between those two views, I believe it is understandable and inevitable. There is a need for caution and due observance of the precautionary principle.</P>
      <P>I do not believe that every advance in technology is desirable or that we should always do what technology allows us to. We need to adopt a case by case approach; that applies to bioengineering as much as to any other area of technology. Nuclear technology gave us nuclear weapons which we could happily survive without&mdash;</P>

      <P>Nuclear technology also provided effective methods of treatment for many kinds of cancer. Some people want to ignore the real world around them. They live on cloud nine and most of them are members of the Green Party.</P>
      <P>Information technology has provided us with incredible ease of communication but has also created the means of very great and unacceptable intrusion into our lives in forms over which most ordinary people have no control. We need a case by case approach to the application of what technology allows us to do.</P>
      <P>One of the concerns many ordinary people have in relation to the genetic engineering of food crops is that they cannot see any real advantage from particular applications. Where there is no perceived advantage but a perceived level of risk, however low, consumers simply do not want the product and rightly feel it should not be forced on them without their knowledge. We need four things. First, we need careful and properly supervised research. Second, we need a hardheaded assessment of the utility of the results of that research. Third, the public needs access to information about research and consultation on its applications. Fourth, we need information on the make-up of what is on offer in the market.</P>
      <P>The health care and pharmaceutical applications of genetic engineering are subject to rigorous testing but there is no public confidence that the application of genetic engineering in the food sector is subject to any comparable testing process. That gap must be filled. In the circumstances of the European single market, we need an EU agency which will require rigorous testing and evaluation, lay down the conditions under which it is to be carried out, subject it to rigorous peer review and assess it from the point of view of the public interest. The Food and Veterinary Office of the European Commission would seem to provide an appropriate nucleus for this function. The office, which is part of the Commission's DG XXIV, has a legal remit to examine and supervise animal feeds and could, therefore, operate in that context. It currently has no legal basis for action in relation to human foodstuffs. I believe it should be given the necessary legal basis and resources to carry out the job which needs to be done. That legal basis should also give the office, as of right, access to all research being carried out by commercial organisations. Realistically, that is where we must expect the bulk of research to be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We need a mechanism through which the activities of this agency can be publicised and made accessible to the public. That would require the establishment of an independent agency in each member state, dedicated to the publication of all the relevant information, not only in the form required for rigorous peer review but also in a form accessible to the public. In that respect, <Col N="1175" /> serious questions now arise in regard to the remit and legal standing of the Food Safety Authority of Ireland. These questions must be resolved immediately, specifically in terms of public interest in ensuring food safety.</P>
    <P>I was interested to hear the Minister for the Environment and Local Government explain how and why the Government found it impossible to live up to a commitment given by Fianna Fáil before the last election. Although I accept the Minister's explanation, if he had taken even five minutes to think about it he may not have made it, had he or whoever wrote it been motivated by long-term consumer safety and not short-term political advantage. In spite of what the Minister said, which was clearly correct, I believe it would be appropriate for the Government and the Governments of other member states to consider a moratorium on the commercial planting of genetically modified crops at EU level. That it is not possible for a member state to legally operate unilaterally in this regard in the face of concerns which exist suggests it is time member states considered introducing a moratorium across the EU.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to have an ongoing and adequate process of public consultation in every member state. The formula adopted heretofore by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government is clearly perceived to be inadequate and weighted in favour of academic and industrial interests. I am not accusing the Minister of bad faith, I am simply stating the forum he has provided to date does not give assurance to all participants that they are equal, something which must be remedied. I note the Minister has indicated a new approach for the conduct of the debate from now on, and the House should tease out this during the remainder of the debate. The Minister must rethink the idea of consensus conferences. I am not at all happy with his out of hand dismissal of consensus conferences which have taken place in other member states. I strongly urge the Minister to listen to what will be said in the House during these statements and to see if what he has proposed can be modified to meet the real concerns which exist. It is in the interest of the Minister and everybody else to have a process which the public feels examines all of these issues in proper detail and identifies the steps which must be taken.</P>
    <P>Consumers are entitled to full information on the characteristics of the food products being offered to them. Clear labelling is essential, and to make it honest and meaningful segregation of genetically modified products from those which are not so modified is necessary. The Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, made a brief reference to this, pointing out that in his view labelling requirements under current EU laws are inadequate and that these deficiencies are being addressed at EU level. I ask the Minister to hurry along in this <Col N="1176" /> regard. There is no need for a lengthy process. If member states set about the task properly, they should not take forever to meet the requirements which we all know exist in relation to labelling.</P>
    <P>Although I have reservations about the almost automatic application of the results of technological developments, which is perhaps a debate for another day, there is rarely a case for not carrying out research. Ethical grounds are almost the only basis on which limitation of research is justified. With that qualification we must ensure research continues and is carried out in a clear and properly regulated manner. Specifically, this means research into genetically modified crops should be allowed continue, but it must be conducted under licence and subject to strict regulation by a competent authority. Field trials are clearly a necessary component of such research. These too should be carried out under licence and subject to strict regulation by a competent body. They should, however, be comprehensive in nature, rather than concentrating solely, as currently seems to be the case, on yield, specific characteristics for which the genetic modification is carried out and specific traits in the plants or resulting product. Field trials should also cover the effects of genetically modified plants on soils and surrounding flora and fauna.</P>
    <P>In addition to setting up the regulatory and supervisory structures I have mentioned, we should re-examine the primary locus of responsibility for these issues in our governmental and administrative systems. In the context of EU regulations and directives concerning genetically modified organisms, four Departments have responsibilities, namely, the Departments of Health and Children, Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Agriculture and Food and the Environment and Local Government. No one Department has primary responsibility. It is perhaps to the credit of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government that he has attempted to take on this role, but his approach to the issue has been deficient. It is only recently that he has taken up a proposal, first made by Young Fine Gael, that an interdepartmental working group should be formed to deal with biotechnology related issues and I understand he intends to move in this direction. The Government should reconsider the matter, place a clear onus of final responsibility on one Department and arrange for the necessary co-operation and co-ordination of the work of other Departments.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, stated that another element in the process is EU consensus on validated analytical methods to test whether a product contains genetically modified DNA or protein. While we welcome this, we must point out it is only part of a wider action the Minister for the Environment and Local Government referred to in his speech in the context of the action being taken by a group of supermarkets <Col N="1177" /> and some restaurants which should be commended and supported.</P>
    <P>It is essential that the public consultation process be modified and reinforced in the ways I have suggested. While the issues I have raised, and others which have yet to be defined, have been considered properly in that framework, the House should return to the issue to consider what is necessary in terms of policy and a regulatory framework to ensure technology is at our service rather than constituting a perceived threat.</P>
    <P>Serious attention should be given to the promotion and marketing of non-genetically modified food products. It is already clear that action is under way in Argentina to promote, produce and market non-genetically modified maize and soya. Other countries may follow suit and we should adopt a similar approach as GM techniques are applied to other food products. This type of action can result in the kind of pressure which is beginning to lead to a modification in the stance taken by, for example, the US, on issues relating to genetically modified foods in world trade. Such action will be to the benefit of consumers in the long-term and will lead to a more rational assessment of the benefits of genetic modification in the food sector in particular. It should also encourage EU members states to act in a concerted manner along some of the lines I have previously indicated.</P>

      <P>I acknowledge that the Minister for the Environment and Local Government excused himself and apologised for his inability to remain in the House after delivering his speech. I understand there are occasions when the pressures of Government may require a Minister to be elsewhere. However, this is not a long debate and has been planned for some time. It is unacceptable that neither of the two Ministers who led this debate could remain to hear the contributions of Members. I acknowledge we have present the Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise, for whom I have considerable respect. However, to my knowledge, he does not serve at any of the three Departments which have line responsibility for the issue of genetically modified foods: the Departments of Health and Children, Environment and Local Government and Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is remarkable that Fianna Fáil, which at the last election was prepared to regurgitate to the lobby groups whatever they wanted to hear and make an election promise on which it has done a <i>volte-face</i> today, cannot even send to the House a Minister or Minister of State who has a line responsibility in this area to hear contributions on the debate. It is testament to the fact that Fianna Fáil does not take this issue seriously. It did not take it sufficiently seriously in Opposition to be more cautious about the election commitment which was made, and does not take it sufficiently <Col N="1178" /> seriously in Government to send a Minister who has some responsibility for the area to contribute to, participate in and listen to a debate which has been flagged for so long.</P>
    <P>At one level the debate is about a simple and personal matter: how safe is the food we eat? Yet it is enormously complex because we live in a changing world in which the questions about from where our food comes, by whom it is produced, for what reward and of what our food is made are becoming increasingly difficult questions. It is a debate which will dominate the early part of the next century. It is important the debate in the Dáil and the continuing public debate on the relationship between biotechnology and the food we eat is conducted based on reason and information rather than on rhetoric and half-truth.</P>
    <P>In all the material we have received in advance of the debate &ndash; I thank all those who submitted material to me &ndash; the most interesting information is contained in the report of the survey conducted by Lansdowne Marketing Research for Genetic Concern in January this year. Seventy eight per cent of respondents said they knew little or nothing about genetic engineering, yet a public debate is taking place which is essentially asking policymakers and the general public to say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; to genetically modified food. On the one hand, large powerful corporations like Monsanto with considerable resources and political influence are seeking to assure us that genetically modified food production is absolutely safe, is the answer to global food shortages and is even safer and greener than traditional products. On the other hand, lobby groups are urging caution, although some appear to be adopting a dogmatic opposition to the technology itself, and there is the opportunity for the political opportunist to exploit the shortage of public awareness and understanding of the issue to promote the politics of fear.</P>
    <P>No one has been more opportunistic in this than Fianna Fáil, which made an election commitment in 1997 and presumably received support and votes on that basis and today has brazenly and without sufficient basis done a <i>volte-face</i> on that. The Minister says his hands are tied by the European Union regarding a ban on genetically modified foods and products. I know of no European Union law which states that this State should approve either trials or the production of genetically modified food. The Minister's answer is an excuse to escape from a pre-election commitment which is not convenient now that his party is in Government.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party believes the debate on genetically modified food should be based neither on hype nor hysteria but on reason and fact. We believe there are a number of principles which must underpin this debate: the right of the consumer to safe food, the need to ensure our environment and ecosystems are not damaged by new <Col N="1179" /> or old food production methods, the need for the public to be informed about the food choices they make, and the need for public policy to be formulated to meet these requirements.</P>
    <P>The modification of food is not new. Since agriculture began 10,000 years ago, humankind has been mixing seeds, developing new strains of plant and, more recently, using artificial fertilisers and pest controls. There is hardly a food we eat which has not been modified in some way by human activity. Genetic modification itself is relatively new, being developed in the last quarter of a century, but it is already common in medicine and food. Many new medicines, vaccines and diagnostic reagents, including human insulin, anti-cancer drugs and the hepatitis B vaccine, are the products of modern biotechnology. Many of our everyday foods, including cheese, fruit juices, beer and wine, are already processed by genetically engineered enzymes and yeasts. Whether we like it or not, genetic modification of medicines and foods is already a substantial reality.</P>
    <P>What is new, however, is that the application of biotechnology to food production has quickly reached a point where it is about to globally transform the way in which crops are grown, agriculture conducted and food produced. Already in the United States, 32 per cent of the corn crop and 38 per cent of the soya crop are genetically modified. Seventy five per cent of all processed foods in the United States now contain genetically modified ingredients, and it is estimated that, within a few years, crop production in the United States will have switched over almost exclusively to genetically modified crops.</P>
    <P>This in turn is driving the pressure to commence genetically modified crop production and food distribution in Europe and elsewhere. The huge companies which have developed GM food want global outlets for their products and are pressing politically, diplomatically and through the World Trade Organisation for the right to sell. Coupled with this is an understandable concern in European agriculture and the European biotechnology industry that Europe should not fall behind in the control and development of biotechnology in food. The pressure is on to genetically modify food. The logic of the market is that where United States agriculture has led, the rest of the world will inevitably have to follow. Ultimately and perhaps within a short time, crop production will be universally genetically modified.</P>
    <P>Should we necessarily accept that? It may be that GM food production is one of the great advances of humankind, that it is the means of producing the 60 per cent extra food the world's population will need over the next 25 years, that rice enhanced with vitamin A is the answer to malnutrition in the developing world, and that wheat enhanced with folic acid will halt spina <Col N="1180" /> bifida. On the other hand, maybe GM foods will result in as yet unknown diseases, that they will cause resistance to be lowered, that the toxins which keep insects away from plants will eventually harm our health, and that the widespread production of GM crops will irrevocably disturb our ecosystems.</P>
    <P>We do not know the answers to these questions. How could we? The production of GM crops is only about ten years old. How can scientists say with such certainty after so short a trial period for GM crops that they are either safe or unsafe? I have always understood that scientific inquiry and research is by its nature slow, sometimes uncertain and contradictory. The full ecological and health consequences of a crop grown today may not be known for half a century, yet we are effectively being asked to authorise, almost within the space of a decade, not the manageable production of individual crops in occasional locations but the transformation of the world's entire crop production system.</P>
    <P>This is a huge dilemma for policymakers, and in facing up to it, it is essential they reclaim the public space and the right to require that commercial activity and scientific endeavour serve the common good. The commercial interests behind GM food production and the Government of the United States may be preparing for the extension of their GM revolution, but it does not follow that policymakers in Europe and elsewhere should take a short cut through the process of information, of public consultation and of democratic dialogue which, in a democratic society, informs the making of public policy.</P>
    <P>We do not have to be rushed into GM crop production in Europe. Whatever argument there may be for genetically modified foods solving world food shortages, it hardly applies in the European Union, one of whose biggest problems is food surpluses and which is paying farmers to stop producing traditional products through set-aside and other payments. Neither should we be rushed into approving crop trials which are not for the pursuit of objective scientific inquiry but to establish the physical and economic viability of production. The Labour Party, therefore, supports a moratorium on the production and commercial trials of GM crops in Ireland and Europe to allow space for the public and policy makers to be better informed, to give reasoned consideration to the issues surrounding GM crop production and, if necessary, to put in place a satisfactory regulatory framework in Ireland and Europe.</P>
    <P>The debate on GM food needs to engage the public, not just specialists, whether from the industry or the lobbies. The consultation paper produced by the Department of the Environment and Local Government is a welcome document. Unfortunately the consultative process proposed by the Minister was initially unbalanced and <Col N="1181" /> unsatisfactory. Genetic Concern has proposed a Norwegian style public jury format. This should be proceeded with but it is not enough.</P>
    <P>The debate should be widened beyond the format proposed by the Minister. The trolley pusher in the supermarket who buys groceries needs to be actively engaged in the debate which should be conducted on radio and television in an educational rather than entertainment format. There is little point in pitting two extremists against each other who will simply add to the supply of polarised misinformation. There should be panels of scientists, consumer bodies, NGOs and Government agencies to discuss the issue in a reasoned manner and for the public to come to a conclusion in its own time.</P>
    <P>In urging a cautious, careful and considered approach to policy on GM food I am not arguing for a position which is hostile to biotechnology. The scientific work should continue but within a framework which puts the public good and the integrity of the environment first. There are many issues to be considered: the ethics of some biotechnology possibilities; the safety of the food produced; the impact, if any, on health; the impact on the environment, wildlife and biodiversity; the economics of biotechnology produced food; the implications for agriculture and food production in the developing world; the control of this technology by a handful of large multinationals; and the mechanisms needed to inform and assure the public. The need of the industry to make a return on its considerable investment in research, the enthusiasm of some scientists for the process and the desire of some producers for more easily managed crops are not the only factors which should determine the pace of development of biotechnology in food.</P>
    <P>While the process of consultation is continuing, the issue arises of GM products already on supermarket shelves. The Labour Party believes that the consumer has a right to know what is in the food we buy, how it is made, where it comes from and how it has been treated. We have a right to have food products accurately and adequately labelled. A label which simply states that a product may contain GM ingredients is inadequate.</P>
    <P>There are difficulties with labelling. How does one test the accuracy of a label on a processed product when DNA becomes less traceable in processing? Should a GM label be stuck on everything with a GM ingredient? Would we then end up with so many GM stickers all over the supermarket that the bewildered consumer will give up and carry on buying? Should we distinguish between traditional genetic modification and new genetic modification? </P>
    <P>There is a need to go beyond labelling to better education about food. If we have a right to know about food and its origin, we have a right to be educated about food. We should start now through the education system and in public and <Col N="1182" /> continuing education to be informed and to make informed judgments about the foods we buy and eat. There is no substitute for knowledge and personal judgment.</P>
    <P>There is a lack of confidence in the public apparatus for the approval of foods. The citizen no longer trusts a Government spokesperson or an agency which reassures them that the experts have tested the food and it is safe. Recent experiences with blood, BSE, salmonella, water quality and the revelations at the beef tribunal have all undermined public confidence that the State apparatus will keep us safe.</P>
    <P>Confidence needs to be restored. It will take a considerable investment of resources to do this. Telling the public that there are EU directives to save us from potential harm from genetic modification and that the Environment Protection Agency has responsibility to enforce them sounds reassuring until we discover that the EPA has only one officer dealing with the GM issue. The Food Safety Authority is seriously under-resourced and understaffed. The Department of Agriculture and Food is regarded by most consumers as the downtown office of food producers. If we want a safe food regime, we will have to pay for it and give the proper resources and authority to the agencies to which we give responsibility for food safety, public health and a clean environment.</P>
    <P>There is a need for better co-ordination. There are four Departments and at least two State agencies with responsibility for GM food. There is a need for a dedicated Department of food safety and education. In the short-term there is a need for greater co-ordination between the bodies which have responsibility.</P>
    <P>This debate raises two other issues, the first of which is the relationship between science and policy making. The world in which we live has been changed dramatically by the advances of science. We seem to have a virtual ignorance and fear of science. We do not include science at the policy table. There is a need for a new relationship between policy makers and scientists. The scientist should be as central to planning and policy making as the economist. In this way we would avoid finding ourselves in the situation of having to play catch up on an issue which has been thrust upon us by scientific advance.</P>
    <P>The second issue is that of regulation. Throughout the 1980s an ideological battle took place in the developed world between left and right on the question of regulation. The war cry of the right, &ldquo;deregulate&rdquo;, was heard nowhere more than the United States. The Reagan Administration, which led the charge, cleared the way for the development and rapid advance of genetically modified food. It is no accident that GM foods were developed and advanced rapidly in the most deregulated political and economic environment in the world. The development and <Col N="1183" /> rapid advancement of GM foods is the product of deregulation in the 1980s.</P>
    <P>There is a need to reassert that there is such a thing as society, the public and common good; that there is a need for democratic debate and that in this case the market is not totally free, that it is subject to intervention and regulation to prevent food being controlled by large powerful multinationals and developed in a way about which the consumer is not informed or entirely happy.</P>

Genetic engineering is as serious and as sinister a development as nuclear fission as a generator of electric power. The people who opposed the siting of a nuclear fission electric generator in Carnsore in Wexford have been subsequently entirely vindicated by what happened in Chernobyl with this uncontrollable potentially devastating force.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have fundamental problems, in principle and in practice, with the Commission's proposed terms and conditions for grant aiding fleet renewal under the next round of Structural Funds 2000-2006.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Commission's proposals include a 130 per cent tonnage replacement requirement as a precondition for grant aiding the introduction of new and second-hand vessels. The Commission is also proposing a number of other restrictive fleet capacity management measures in the financial regulation, including an effective ban on the trading of fishing vessels within the EU fleet. Essentially the Commission is seeking to set fleet capacity parameters which are much more restrictive than the MGP IV fleet programme framework which was agreed by Council in 1997. It also seeks to pre-empt, in my view, future decisions <Col N="1184" /> by Council about the nature and framework of the next fleet programme &ndash; MGP V &ndash; for the period after 2001.</P>
    <P>Ireland and other member states agree that the funding of fleet modernisation and renewal in the next round should, as is the case at present, be subject to member states meeting their obligations in relation to fleet capacity and fishing effort under the MGP programmes. To that extent, the funding proposals should indeed take due account of the existing MGP Council decisions and parameters laid down in the individual fleet programme of member states.</P>
    <P>It is not acceptable for the Commission in its financial regulations to try to rewrite the 1997 Council Decision on MGP IV and to pre-empt political negotiations and decisions on the parameters for the next MGP which will be determined in 2001. In discussions to date at official level in Brussels on the Commission's proposals, Ireland together with a number of other member states has strongly opposed the restrictive fleet proposals and in particular the 130 per cent capacity cut as completely unacceptable. There will be an initial debate by Ministers at next week's Fisheries Council on the key issues of the Commission's proposed regulation. I will be making clear my opposition to the fleet provisions and I will be looking for support from like-minded colleagues in urging the Presidency and the Commission to think again.</P>
    <P>The fishing industry organisations have been fully briefed on the proposals and I know that I have their full support in opposing these unduly restrictive measures. My objective is to ensure continued support for the modernisation and renewal of the Irish whitefish fleet in particular, in line with our obligations under MGP IV and, in due course, MGP V when this is negotiated and agreed by the Council of Ministers. The rules governing EU and national support for fleet renewal in the next Structural Funds round should fully reflect existing fleet capacity parameters under MGP IV. They should not, however, attempt to rewrite or pre-empt past or future Council decisions on the direction of fleet policy. I am sure I will have the full backing of the House in resisting the Commission's proposals.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister's positive response. I have been approached by fishermen who have expressed their concern on this matter. Will the Minister confirm, should this measure be agreed, that it would cost in the region of £2,500 per tonne to purchase additional capacity and this would drive fishermen out of the business? The Minister has brought forward the whitefish renewal package but we have to continue the momentum from the year 2000 for further improvements of the vessels. Will the Minister confirm that his approach has the sup<Col N="1185" /> port of Spain and Portugal and other fishing countries?</P>

      <P>We are attempting at this stage to get as wide support as possible for our approach. I agree with the Deputy it would be disastrous for the Irish fleet if we had to accept a 130 per cent reduction for a new or second-hand vessel, especially at the stage the Irish fleet is at present. It emphasises all the more the need to press ahead with the modernisation of the fleet urgently. The Government gave a three year period, looking at the tax situation, for modernisation and development. We will have to go beyond that with continuing development. I do not accept this proposal. It would drive up the cost of tonnage and would make matters impossible for the fishing industry. It is totally unacceptable.</P>

Will the Minister indicate the other like-minded member states that feel strong about the proposal? For example, may I deduce that Spain, with 20,000 fishing vessels, would be opposed to this measure, as well as Portugal, another strong fishing economy? We need to be confident that Ireland is not an isolated voice when this matter is discussed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt that there is a good deal of support for the line we are taking. I do not expect to have great difficulty on that front. The proposal will be very vigorously opposed and debated next week. We have to wait to see what way the support shapes up when we come to the table. We will be there the night before and we will have meetings to try to consolidate support for our approach. I think we will find widespread support among the fishing community generally.</P>

      <P>I can assure the Deputy that I have no plans to close down salmon fishing on 1 July this year. The scientific and management information available to me confirms the continuing vulnerability of salmon stocks. I have therefore decided to maintain and enhance in certain key respects, existing conservation measures for this season. All commercial salmon fishing will again close on 31 July. There is one exception which is the snap net fishery in the Waterford Estuary, which I propose to close on 14 August 1999. However, where commercial fishermen and anglers can agree salmon management plans for specific areas, I have indicated that I will be open to reviewing season lengths for those areas in consultation with the regional fisheries boards.</P>
      <P>I have also announced a number of important new measures beginning this year to protect spring salmon and spawning stocks. These include a total ban on prawn and shrimp bait until 1 June and a selective ban in certain areas from 1 September thereafter. A ban on the use of gaffs is also being introduced which will facilitate catch and release schemes. I have asked the regional fisheries boards to develop and propose voluntary catch and release schemes in partnership with local fishing clubs. In addition, spring salmon &ldquo;black spot&rdquo; rivers will remain closed for angling next year until 1 May. The regional fisheries boards will identify those spring salmon rivers which are particularly vulnerable. My decision on the salmon conservation measures for 1999 were informed by consultations with, and feedback from, the central and regional fisheries boards and the Marine Institute. They were also informed by the views of the various organisations which represent the interests of commercial and recreational salmon fishermen. The initiatives I am taking in relation to spring salmon stocks were also informed by the outcome of the national spring salmon stocks seminar held in September last year as well as the advice of each of the regional fishery boards. I share the general concerns about the state of spring salmon stocks. The steps I am taking this year are the first in a series of phased measures to address the particular conservation needs of this component of the salmon stock.</P>
      <P>I have no doubt I have the full support of the central and regional fishery boards in maintaining and enhancing salmon conservation strategies for 1999 in the interests of the resource itself and of all stakeholders in that resource.</P>

      <P>I take it from the Minister's reply the <i>status quo </i> will be maintained, and that the starting and finishing periods this year will be as applied in the last season. Net fishermen on a number of rivers have been in contact with me. Their impression is that 1 July will be the finishing date, although I do not know from where that date emanated. Will the Minister clarify if that is correct so that they can plan for the season?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is correct. The only addition is that, where commercial fishermen and anglers can agree salmon management plans for specific catchment areas, I have indicated I will be open to reviewing season lengths for those areas in consultation with the regional fisheries boards. If in a particular area the commercial fishermen and anglers believe it would be successful and arrive at some agreement, we can re-examine the position.</P>

      <P>The plan for the year has been set out and discussed with the regional fishery boards. The <i>status quo </i>is being maintained following discussions with the regional fishery boards, the Marine Institute and the Central Fisheries Board. The regional fisheries boards are also aware that if in specific catchment areas there is a possibility of doing something otherwise, it will depend on agreement locally. We have broadcast that package and have issued a press release. If they consider there would be agreement and it is feasible, we can review that particular area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>My strategic objective is to ensure a sustainable and vibrant future for the Irish seafood industry and the communities it supports, backed up by the necessary level of funding to underpin investment post 2000.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to have the full backing and commitment of BIM in the task of delivering on that strategic objective for the sector. The BIM plan for 2000-2006 is an invaluable input into the challenging task ahead to deliver a sustainable future for, and with, the industry and coastal communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1188" /> The fleet, processing, aquaculture and ancillary service sectors already support jobs for 16,000 people in areas where there are few alternative employment opportunities. The sector is worth £300 million per annum to the national economy and seafood exports are now valued at some £250 million. The achievements to date underline the significant potential for further growth in this indigenous natural resource based sector which will deliver jobs and growth, particularly in peripheral coastal communities.</P>
    <P>Our existing development strategies have been focused on the modernisation and renewal of the fleet, the continued growth of the aquaculture sector, expansion in onshore processing and the development of fishery harbours infrastructure and aquaculture landing places. My own commitment, and that of the Government, to the development of the sector is clearly underlined in delivery last year of funding support and tax incentives for the whitefish fleet renewal programme supporting up to £60 million investment in the fleet. I also achieved, in the context of the budget for 1999, a major increase in Exchequer funding for fishery harbours and aquaculture infrastructure development. There is still much to be done and the immediate challenge is to position the sector firmly to deliver on its recognised economic potential and development needs into the next millennium, with EU Structural Funds support.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>While listening to the Minister's response I was reminded of the BIM report, some of which he quoted verbatim. I welcome the BIM document. It serves to focus our minds on the negotiations from 2000 to 2006. This is an excellent opportunity for the Minister to maximise the level of funding, given the Objective One status&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;and the areas in transition. On the question of the proposed funding of £200 million, £44 million national funding, is the Minister optimistic, in view of Objective One status and the areas in transition, about maximising the funding? Under the previous programme the fishing community received only £75 million for the marine sector which was totally inadequate. Is the Minister optimistic that the targets set by BIM are sustainable?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>From the fishing industry point of view, it would be helpful if most of the west were to remain eligible for Objective One status. The BIM targets are what I would wish for. I would want us to be clear about what we can do, our potential and what we must do. We are entering the negotiations on the Structural Funds on that basis. The amount of Structural Funds globally will not be as great as on the last occasion. We <Col N="1189" /> would not be doing our job if we did not put on the table the possibilities and the potential for the fishing sector generally. That is what we have done. We then have to examine how best to fund the sector subsequently and to bend all our policies and instruments to achieve those targets. Obviously, the discussions on the Structural Funds will be an up-front part of the negotiations and we will try to maximise the allocation for the fisheries sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree statistics show that the western counties are most deprived, have many disadvantages and contain the most peripheral communities? Surely it is realistic that the proposals the Minister presents at EU level recognise that these areas represent a unique case. It is regrettable that certain peripheral coastal sectors of Kerry and Clare are not included in the Objective One region but that argument is long lost now.</P>
      <P>The Minister has an excellent chance. Does he agree that BIM has lifted the bar a little high for him to jump to the £200 million figure? It is a good aspiration, but there is a big gap to bridge between the £75 million and £200 million figures in order to progress the marine industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that, but we are at the beginning of a process. We would not be doing our job if we did not set out what we believe to be the potential. One might set a lower target and make it easier to reach it&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;but I have never done that and I do not intend to do it here. It would be far better to achieve a percentage of a high goal than achieve a lower goal. That is the Deputy's point.</P>
      <P>On the discussions generally, the policy debate on the draft Council regulation laying down the detailed rules and arrangements concerning the Community structural assistance in the fisheries sector and the political agreement on these main issues are set for the end of March, but the adoption of the Structural Funds regulation, including the framework regulation on Structural Funds for fisheries, is set for early April. The key agreement on the Council regulation laying down the detailed rules and arrangements regarding the Community structural assistance in the fisheries sector is set for the Fisheries Council on 10 June. While there will be a discussion of the general principles at this stage, it will be along the lines of making a detailed recommendation for 1 June. That is when that will be completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a major opportunity for the development of the different aspects of the fisheries sector, particularly in the west. The BIM report is accurate and correct. It lays down the kind of development which can take place. It also pinpoints strongly the fact that one can develop pro<Col N="1190" /> cessing in inland towns. It is not only coastal communities who will be involved, but inland towns in areas which currently fare badly. Despite all of the investment, there is little going into these inland areas. It was mentioned earlier today that processing successfully takes place in Roscommon.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed with the recent ESRI report which did not recognise the potential in the fisheries sector. It is inaccurate in many aspects. We would have conveyed our views on that to avoid the perception that the fisheries sector is not one for investment, because it is. The potential is there. A mistake was made many years ago and we will not make the same mistake again. I certainly will not do so and I welcome what Deputy Finucane has to say about it.</P>

      <P>The State port companies which operate under the aegis of my Department are working closely under the focal point of Cruise Ireland with all the relevant interests, including Bord Fáilte, the Northern Ireland Tourist Board, ground handlers, ships' agents and tourism-business associations in developing Ireland as a cruise liner destination and ensuring that the commitment made in An Action Programme for the Millennium is fulfilled. Our objective is to further develop our key State commercial seaports as cruise ship destinations featuring on the itineraries of all the cruise lines operating in Europe.</P>
      <P>The Cruise Ireland marketing and development initiative, with market support from Bord Fáilte and European Regional Development Fund assistance through the Operational Programme for Tourism, is delivering tangible benefits for the cruise liner business. The number of cruise vessel calls to Ireland rose from 100 in 1997 to 110 in 1998, while passenger and crew number visits correspondingly increased to 98,400 in 1998 as compared with some 85,000 in 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Cruise Ireland participated in 1998 for the fifth year in a row at the main cruise line promotion in the world, the Seatrade Cruise Shipping Convention in Miami. I am advised that the international cruise industry is expanding rapidly and all the major cruise companies have ships on <Col N="1191" /> order or under construction. Cruise ship capacity has doubled since 1994 and passenger levels projected at some 7.2 million worldwide by 2000 are expected to further increase to at least 10.8 million by 2010. It is the intention of Cruise Ireland and the port companies, as key players in this initiative, particularly the ports of Dublin, Cork and Waterford, to capitalise on this expansion and to this end the marketing effort is being intensified for 1999.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for that detailed reply. Does he agree it is not encouraging for Irish people who wish to take vacations on cruise liners that they must fly to ports some of which are even outside the EU? Does he agree that Aer Lingus could play a major part in that operation? In other words, it could carry foreigners to link up with cruise liners in Irish ports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will probably be aware, Ireland does not have a cruise liner industry but is increasingly becoming a venue for cruise liners. The Deputy's point about the link between air transport and cruise liners is important. One can only board when the ships visit the ports if one made an arrangement. Otherwise, it would appear that the Deputy is correct to a great extent.</P>
      <P>Initially Ireland was not particularly geared for this development but it is an area which is developing rapidly. Incoming cruisers stay for short and longer periods. Some visit Waterford, Dublin and then travel to Derry and others do the reverse.</P>
      <P>It is an area which can bring in a great deal of extra business. That is clear in Cork, Dublin and in Waterford, where Waterford Glass connects up well with them as it is a showpiece for visitors and it does a great deal of business. This is a growing industry and the Cruise Ireland promotion will be helpful.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I am firmly committed to supporting the development of the fish processing sector to deliver maximum returns from our fisheries resources and ensure that the economic benefits of our seafood exports accrue to Ireland in terms of value added. Continued strong growth in the fish processing sector is critical for jobs, growth, value added and exports in the Irish seafood industry overall. Fish processing output is on a <Col N="1192" /> steady upward growth curve and amounted to 145,000 tonnes in 1997, valued at £213 million. There are significant opportunities for further growth. A buoyant market exists for seafood in the EU and worldwide. Consumption will continue to follow an upward trend creating the opportunity to develop new products to satisfy market need and allowing the industry to move along the value chain.</P>
      <P>Under the present Fisheries Operational Programme £25 million of investment involving more than £11 million in grant aid has been undertaken in the fish processing sector to maintain and enhance competitiveness. Grant aid support has been targeted, in particular in the past two years, at development projects delivering increased added value and new jobs. I recently announced grant aid for two major processing projects in counties Cork and Donegal supporting investment of £4.1 million.</P>
      <P>There is still a great deal to be done to realise the full potential of the fish processing sector particularly in terms of quality, value added and scale. We add some 50 per cent to the value of our fish through processing. Other countries achieve up to 200 per cent in added value. Capacity expansion, product technology and product development in the processing sector will require significant levels of funding support, post 2000 and this is a key priority for me. The sound economics of supporting investment in this indigenous, natural resource-based sector are self evident. I welcome BIM's solid endorsement and analysis of the potential in its Seafood Industry Agenda 2000-2006 which underpins my assessment and which will be an invaluable input into the task of securing the necessary funding support for the sector, post 2000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister and his Department on the steady progress made in fish processing. Does the Minister agree that most of the major development investment has gone to the bigger ports at the expense of development in small ports? Does he have any plans to make a detailed examination of small fishery ports whose local communities depend on the fishing industry for their livelihood?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>There is considerable potential in small ports, particularly in the area of aquaculture and the processing of aquaculture products. This is part of the proposal made by BIM on overall development, taking each sector separately to see what it can contribute. I see considerable scope for development in the hinterlands of some of the smaller ports. I do not envisage concentrating on the major ports. While large ports have a major part to play, the extra £3 million which was granted in this year's budget will help the development of small ports. This will be done on two fronts, on the one hand tourism and leisure <Col N="1193" /> and on the other, aquaculture. This investment will stimulate development and all sides will agree that it is worthwhile. There will be considerable development in small ports around the country. I foresee much opportunity in Donegal, for example. A one day seminar was held in that county recently and was attended by more than 200 people representing many fishing interests and highlighting the many opportunities for development in smaller ports and among small coastal communities as well as in major ports such as Killybegs and Greencastle. The opportunity exists for exciting development and we must make sure we take that opportunity.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have the percentages. The standard answer to questions such as this is that if Deputy Deasy puts down a Parliamentary Question the information will be given to him. The bulk of white fish is exported without further processing. A great opportunity exists in that area. The same is true of aquaculture produce, especially shellfish. People are engaged in processing at the moment and we know what needs to be done. It is expected that more people will come forward with proposals to develop processing in those sectors than there will be money available and so extra funds will be required. We must show what can be done and the employment which can be provided locally. Deputy Deasy will know of recent developments in Dunmore East which are of a high standard. The situation is best illustrated by the fact that we add, on average, 50 per cent to the value of fish through processing while many countries add up to 200 per cent. There is a huge difference between the value of processed and unprocessed fish.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley" hpid="Mr. McGinley Mr. McGinley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that there are increasing difficulties in landing pelagic species in home ports, due first to the locations where they are caught and second, to the price structure within the country? Does he agree that it is very important to give every available assistance to fishermen to land as much as possible in home ports to increase the number of jobs in processing in home ports?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a difficulty in this area. The beginning of the catches tends to be near Norway and there is an area there in which Irish fishermen are not permitted to fish. The fish move gradually down nearer to the Donegal coast. The problem for the fisherman is that it is more economical for him to fish out near the coast of Norway and to land his catch in a Norwegian port. As the fish move down, it <Col N="1194" /> becomes more economical to land the catches in Killybegs.</P>
      <P>We have a constant battle to maintain balance and to support the processing industry. We have shared out quotas over a period so that there is a continuous supply of fish. Some skippers of big vessels would rather catch fish at the early stage and land in a foreign port. We try to maintain a balance. I have responsibility for the management of the fishing industry and I try to do so in as fair a way as possible. That is the subject of some disagreement at the moment. I try to maintain a reasonable balance.</P>
      <P>There is an essential conflict between the catchers and processors for the reasons I have given. Nevertheless, the catchers need the processors and the processors need the catchers so there has to be negotiation and agreement reached around the table. My Department does that to the point where the level of disagreement becomes too great. We listen to both sides and try to find a balance. It is then up to me, as Minister, to manage the fishery.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>Would I be correct in saying all the funds available for processing have been used up? What is the average cost per job in the fish processing business? I understand it is more than £20,000 per job. Perhaps the Minister would give the actual figure if it is available. Was much of the processing that took place concerned with bringing the fish processing units up to minimum health and quality standards? To what degree are we moving towards having more successful companies like Green Isle Foods and the recently announced Bantry Mussels? In the next operational programme we should have a better chance of maximising that type of effort. Will the Minister agree many processing plants have been brought up to par at this stage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have the exact figure on the cost per job but I will get it for the Deputy. I would not disagree with the figure he mentioned. The importance of the jobs is that they are sustainable and they are in a market which has long-term opportunity. The European Union is only 52 per cent self-sufficient in fish and, mainly for health reasons, the market for fish, especially whitefish, is growing at a considerable pace internationally. There is a long-term future in processing fish.</P>
      <P>In regard to the moneys being used up, to the best of my knowledge all the moneys have been allocated. We will have to consider how to deal with the other projects in the pipeline and I will do that shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy is correct in relation to minimum standards. Much of the money in the early stage was absorbed in reaching the minimum standards required for the existing operations. That placed a heavy cost on the processors and absorbed a <Col N="1195" /> large proportion of the moneys available. That is one of the reasons we have the opportunity to go further because there is a great deal of ground to make up to reach the standards required. In the case of the aquaculture produce, the standard is critical and must be very high. We are in the strong position of having reached those standards. There is excellent quality control and that can be seen in Killybegs, Cork, Dunmore East and the other units throughout the country. It can also be seen in the market for the produce.</P>
    <P>On the question of more successful companies, the BIM programme stated there was scope for that kind of development and for more successful companies if we combined the quality handling and processing of the produce and go for species that are the most beneficial. BIM sees considerable scope for further development on the Irish seafood market in the years ahead.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>More than 30 whitefish stocks around Ireland were scientifically assessed in 1998. On the basis of the assessments, Irish and EU scientists expressed concern about the state of a number of these stocks. These include monkfish, haddock and saithe off the north west coast, cod and whiting in the Irish Sea and sole, plaice and hake in the Celtic Sea. These concerns were reflected in the total allowable catches, TACs, agreed for 1999 at the Fisheries Council last December. I have worked to achieve a balance at Council between maximising the fishing possibilities for Ireland while ensuring conservation objectives are met through the setting of sustainable TACs geared to protect the long-term viability of stocks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Common Fisheries Policy embodies the principle of free access, subject to quota entitlement, to the fishing grounds of member states beyond the 12 mile limit. Where member states have quota entitlements in the Irish zone, the fishing activity of their vessels is subject to quota limitations and to the maximum levels of actual fishing effort permitted in western waters. In addition, under the Iberian Accessions Agreement, the total number of Spanish vessels permitted to fish at a given time in the waters around Ireland is 93, of which no more than 40 vessels may fish in the Irish Box. Overall access arrangements within European waters are a matter of Community competence and Ireland cannot take unilateral action to reduce the number of vessels <Col N="1196" /> licensed by other member states to fish their quotas in our zone.</P>
    <P>Within the CFP framework the instruments used to conserve stocks include the TAC and quota regime which limits the amount of fish member states can catch, together with conservation and enforcement. New control measures have been adopted that will strengthen our ability to ensure member states fishing in our waters comply with quota and conservation rules. New conservation measures to protect juvenile stocks will come into force in January 2000. I am also working to bring about further improvements to these measures. When I met the Spanish Fisheries Minister in January I stressed to her the need for enhanced conservation in the monk and hake fishery. We agreed officials should review together the scope for additional conservation measures which will be taken up with the EU Commission and the other member states concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's statement that 30 species are under threat is alarming. Are the measures the Minister is taking sufficient to counteract the depletion of stocks? Are the experts happy with the situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to determine the status of the stocks. For that reason these surveys were done on a scientific basis and an excellent document, running to hundreds of pages, was produced in time for the negotiations. We have to discuss that report with the fishermen and the organisations and try to find a reasonable balance.</P>
      <P>In regard to the European Union, it is significant that while we may argue about the stocks we are committed to their sustainability. There is always an argument about what that means in terms of the quotas for a particular year because it will affect people's livelihoods, but the experts' views are accurate. They are with us in the negotiations and they will guide us on how far we can go. That is also the case in the discussions with the fishermen. Like scientists, they get the best scientific data they can but they recognise they do not have all the information. I accept the point that this matter needs to be carefully monitored.</P>
      <P>We are trying to ensure the quotas taken by individual states or vessels are not excessive and do not exceed the figures allocated to them. For that reason, we are forever tightening up on surveillance. Last December the Fisheries Council agreed on measures to improve control and enforcement. These measures which were put forward by us will come into force on 1 July this year and will help to tighten up on the monitoring and inspection, particularly of flag ships. These new measures for which I pushed strongly at the Council will help to create the much needed level playing field in fisheries control.</P>

      <P>The Minister only partially answered the question. Some of the species he mentioned are the bread and butter of Irish fishermen and include monkfish, haddock, plaice, sole and hake, which is a very important fish as far as the Spaniards are concerned. We should be knowledgeable enough to know to what degree these stocks are being depleted. The depletion level of some species may be 10 per cent less than the minimum we would like and in other cases it may be more than 90 per cent. We must quantify to what degree those 30 species have been depleted.</P>
      <P>Early last year, after a couple of very serious incidents involving the ramming of Irish fishing boats by Spanish ones, a large number of Spanish boats were arrested for illegal fishing and for irregularities as regards their log books, catches, secret holds with undersized fish and so on. Strangely, this year I have heard little or no mention of Spanish boats, which are the main offenders in overfishing and illegal fishing, being caught or prosecuted. Have Spanish fishermen reformed? If they have, it would be like the conversion on the road to Damascus. It would be a bolt from the blue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>With all due respect, a Cheann Comhairle, a Kilkenny man might not have the same interest or patent where fisheries are concerned. What has happened? Have the Spaniards been transformed? Have they stopped fishing? Will the Minister give me an explanation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two aspects, the quantity of fish, which is measured as scientifically as is possible, and overfishing When we come to the negotiations at the end of the year, we have the best possible information available. We look at where the stocks stand and difficult decisions must be made. That is based on scientific information which is improving all the time. There are many difficulties in reaching the quotas but having done so, we ask if there is a level playing field.</P>
      <P>There is no question there has been a tightening in control and surveillance, which will be further tightened this year. It is not an easy task but we currently spend approximately £57 million on surveillance and we have EU support in doing so. We have, however, large areas to police. We are bringing in additional regulations. I had discussions with the Spanish Minister about checking landings in Spain. There is fairly rigorous checking of flag ships and other ships when they land here. We also have bilateral discussions with our friends in the UK on the same basis to make sure there is a level playing field because there were various practices where people were landing in other ports and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some very important steps have been taken. The Spanish have agreed to exchanges among our <Col N="1198" /> inspectors and theirs and for our inspectors to go to Spain to look at what they are doing at landings and as regards control. That is a very important step forward. I know the Deputy is very cynical about what might emerge but, nevertheless, one would like to think reasonable checking takes place at the landing stage.</P>
    <P>The EU regulations require that all foreign registered vessels, including flag ships, give a minimum of two hours' notice of their intention to land. In our case, flag ship landings are mainly into Killybegs and Castletownbere. Over 75 per cent of all landings by flag ships are monitored and inspected by the Department's sea fishery officers on a random basis, although the fishermen will say it is fairly frequent.</P>
    <P>The new control regulations which will come into force in July this year will require flag ships to provide a minimum of four hours' notice of landings. This has been a bone of contention previously. The Deputy might remember a television broadcast about a particular landing which gave notice after hours in the evening.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I saw that programme too. That is one of the reasons we want that relationship with the inspectorate in Spain, that is, to make sure we are all doing the same thing. That is one of the measures which will strengthen the situation.</P>
      <P>A number of other measures will be introduced this year. I know this is a constant problem and is very important but these are two separate things. When we come to work out the quotas, we look at the number of fish left in the water. It is another question as to who took what. If we could get a level playing field, we would probably find some stocks might increase as we come up to the next quota regime, and that would benefit everyone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It was the Deputy who spoke about reform. We must be very vigilant and I fully realise it is a tough business. The Deputy can be assured we will do what we can in that regard.</P>
      <P>We are also introducing satellite monitoring of boats and will be able to identify where they are at any time. They will have to report what they have coming into any of our zones or areas. It is as far as we can go within the EU compared to what is being done in Norway, for example. They run their own show and one must go with one's boat to a particular place. Although there is freedom of movement within the European Union, one will now have to report what one has on board as one comes into one of our zones and as one leaves it. That makes it much easier for the inspections. We are tightening up all the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1199" /> There are two aspects to this, one is general conservation and sustainability and the other is the level playing pitch. On general conservation and sustainability one only has to look at other countries like Canada and Newfoundland where cod were wiped out completely. In fairness to the EU, although probably as a result of the questions we ask and the pressure applied by the fishermen's organisations, we achieve a reasonable balance in relation to conservation. If we can achieve a level playing pitch, conservation will be better. Incidentally, there was a large increase in haddock stocks this year, although nobody really knows the reason.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister recognised the importance of the control, surveillance and protection of our native fishing waters and that it must be thorough and efficient.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>He is probably also cynical. The Spanish fishing fleet consists of 20,000 vessels compared to our fleet of 2,000 vessels. Fishing is part of the fabric of the Spanish economy. I am not sure if the reciprocal arrangement about inspectors agreed between the Minister and Minister de Palacio, the Spanish Minister for fisheries, is achieveable. Vigo is a large fishery port in Spain and fishing forms a major part of its local economy. Many people involved in supervisory positions in Vigo are either sons, daughters or relatives of people employed on the fishing fleet, and a nod and wink culture permeates there. Our inspectors are regarded in our fishery ports as <Col N="1200" /> being extremely vigilant. That contrasts sharply with their Spanish counterparts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>That is why I want to bring them together. We need to agree on a level playing field. If we are to operate certain measures in compliance with EU requirements, others will have to do the same. If they do not, we must know about it and highlight it. Discussing these issues with the people involved is an important advance. I accept that there can be great difficulties. These difficulties have to be brought home to the Spanish Administration and we will bring difficulties of which we become aware to its attention.</P>
      <P>There are other aspects related to the point raised by the Deputy. The Spanish fishing fleet has a strong regional management compared to our fishing fleet which has a central management and a few people based locally. We have a controlled system. I do not know if is true that relatives of inspectors are working on the Spanish fishing fleet.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what the Deputy said. Because of the regional management structure of the Spanish fishing fleet its operation is very different from ours. That is one of the aspects with which we are trying to get to grips. I am planning to visit Spain fairly soon to consolidate what we have been doing. Our inspectors will also discuss these issues with their counterparts in Vigo and we will see what they come up with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The ITV programme was graphic in its description of what was happening in the Spanish port. It reported that the landings were controlled by the terrorist group ETA and the fisheries officers there were terrified to examine the catches. Examination and surveillance does not count for anything, if fishery officers are intimidated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It does if ships are caught at sea. We have a very large number of boardings. Checking through satellite surveillance and other forms of surveillance is being tightened up. TV crews have come here for a day to report some aspect or about some person and they often report their findings to the effect that such activities are generally taking place. On investigation it is often found that such activities are not general as we were led to believe but are specific activities that nevertheless require investigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was the case of a vessel that came into Castletownbere late at night. It was suggested that the fishery officer got out of the way, allowed the vessel come in, the crew to offload late and that the operation was sloppy. That was not the case. Notice had been given but it was given after the office had closed. That does not happen on <Col N="1201" /> many occasions but it led us to seek four hours' rather than two hours' notice. Fishermen here alert people about what is happening and would alert people about that type of practice.</P>
    <P>By strengthening controls, we can cut out some of these measures. I do not know the extent to which the matters reported in Vigo on the TV programme are taking place. It was claimed the level of surveillance was low and that checking was infrequent and, consequently, fishermen land many more fish. We will closely monitor that. We discussed that with the Spanish Minister who agreed that our inspectors should join the Spanish inspectors and examine the systems, the methods used and what is happening. We cannot do much more than that. This will be an important development, if we can proceed along these lines.</P>

      <P>The sensitivities of the Irish Government and public to the use of the Irish Sea generally for the transport of the materials mentioned by the Deputy to and from Sellafield have been made known on many occasions to the UK authorities and I have their assurance that in any event the vessels involved will not at any stage pass through waters under our jurisdiction. The same authorities have also stressed to me that voyages by such vessels through waters solely under UK jurisdiction are kept to a minimum and are already limited to one or two per year.</P>
      <P>In these circumstances I have given particular attention to ensuring that the voyages that take place have regard to the highest possible level of safety in terms of the vessels employed and the operational requirements applied to them. In this connection the IMO Assembly, which I addressed in November 1997, agreed that the INF Code, which governs the transport by sea of the materials concerned, should be made mandatory. In the meantime, my Department has been discussing the development of improved reporting arrangements for voyages of vessels carrying such materials both within the IMO context and bilaterally with the United Kingdom and France.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister reacted in a positive way to this serious problem. Where I live is as near to Sellafield as to Leinster House. Will the Minister agree his Department should be notified when nuclear material has been transported across the Irish Sea, even if it is inside the limits governed by the UK authorities? Did he have any discussions on whether it should be mandatory for countries who transport these <Col N="1202" /> materials to notify their neighbours of the transport of such materials?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the INF Code we got agreement that would be made mandatory. That code has certain requirements. It was drawn up by a joint IMO international atomic energy agency and United Nations environmental protection working group. It seeks to regulate the construction, equipment and operation of ships engaged in the carriage of irradiated nuclear fuel, plutonium and high level radioactive wastes. For the purpose of the code, ships carrying flasks containing such materials are assigned to three classes depending on the total radioactive quantity which may be carried on board. The ships are required to reach specific standards, depending on class assigned, in relation to damage stability, fire protection, temperature control of cargo spaces, structural strengths, cargo securing arrangements, electrical supplies, radiological protection equipment, ship board emergency plan and crew management and training. In addition, they must comply with the IMO's Safety of Life at Sea Convention, 1974, and the International Maritime Dangerous Goods Code of the Convention on the Carriage of Radioactive Materials.</P>
      <P>The flask used for the carriage of radioactive materials must be approved in accordance with the International Atomic Agency regulations for the safe transport of radioactive materials. That very detailed code existed in a voluntary capacity and we proposed that it should be made mandatory, with which the IMO assembly agreed. That was a huge step forward and a very important development. Ireland took the lead on that issue and it was promoted and negotiated by our experts, in advance of the assembly at which I spoke as the representative of Ireland. I was invited to speak at the opening stage and to make these proposals, to which they agreed.</P>
      <P>We want to go further than that, along the lines suggested by the Deputy. There was a general agreement with Britain and France that we should have better notification and communication, which has happened since then, either directly to our Department or to us through the Department of Foreign Affairs. However, the number of occasions on which this is necessary is few and far between. The fewer and further between they are, the better from our point of view; nevertheless, we must recognise and deal with the realities.</P>

      <P>I advised the House on 4 November 1998 that 29 devices in all were washed ashore on the east coast between 3 June 1998 and 19 July 1998. I have had details regarding these incidents tabulated with a map appended, and I will supply a copy to the Deputy. I am not aware of any further devices having been washed ashore in the jurisdiction. The Irish Marine Emergency Service of my Department, IMES, has, however, been notified by the Northern Ireland Department of the Environment of five devices having been washed ashore earlier this month on Belfast Lough near Bangor and the Antrim coast near Larne.</P>
      <P>I outlined to the House on 4 November 1998 the manner in which I responded to these incidents, by raising the matter both directly with the UK Government and at international level. Contact is being maintained at official level with the UK Government and a general review of the issue will take place at a meeting with the UK authorities planned for Dublin in the near future.</P>
      <P>The IMES considers the actions which were undertaken arising out these incidents to be normal operating functions and they were, accordingly, not costed separately. I understand the Garda and Army take a similar view. I am advised that expenses incurred by Civil Defence volunteers are met by the local authorities concerned.   </P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad about that because, as the Minister will remember, there was a great deal of controversy about that matter from Wexford to Carlingford Lough. Does the Minister agree it seems somewhat unfair that local authorities, which are hard pressed for funds, had to pay for the supervision of beaches from Wexford to Carlingford because of explosive devices left at sea by the British following World War I, while the British got away scot-free? Does the Minister agree that was grossly unfair and set a bad precedent for similar happenings in the future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>A great deal of the work was done by the Irish Marine Emergency Service through the coastal unit volunteers who patrol the coasts. They and the Civil Defence repeatedly patrolled the coast for quite some time. The main cost incurred was the cost of the manpower and womanpower involved in patrolling and the cost of the experts from my Department. It came within the normal Irish Marine Emergency Service costs. The Irish Marine Emergency Service is used to co-operating with the British across the Irish Sea on many of these issues. No charge is ever laid for that co-operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this event, our main concern is that such incidents stop and that the cause is identified. <Col N="1204" /> Substantial studies have been undertaken since then of Beaufort Dyke by the British at their expense. They have made that information available to our experts. The report will deal with that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Finucane mentioned the report on dumping in the Irish Sea. That report was delayed by two elements, one of which was the introduction of extra material. There have been reports from men working on vessels who claimed certain matters were dumped. There was great difficulty in locating the factual information about that, which took a considerable amount of time. The important aspect is to get it sorted out so that it does not recur. It has recurred in Northern Ireland but not in our jurisdiction.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>That is being investigated. They did not have any simple or immediate answer for it. The devices were to have been deposited very deep in the dyke. It appears that some were not in the dyke but were on the slopes into it or outside the entrance and they were moved by the movement of the seas over a long period. That is being investigated to see how it happened. It also relates to what the merchant seamen said because they claimed some of the dumping was done short of the target to save fuel and time. That is being investigated as fully as possible and will be included in the report.</P>

      <Col N="1206" /> Monsanto makes plants and crops resistant to their weedkillers which they sell worldwide and also produce millions of acres of genetically engineered crops, which they also sell in the world seed market. Genetic engineering involves taking seeds from separate and disparate species and inserting them in other species with which they have no natural affinity. For example, genes from fish and bacteria are inserted into such varying crops as tomatoes and corn. These seeds are then scattered over millions of acres of land. In the case of the United States, there are tens of millions of acres of genetically modified soya and maize.</P>
    <P>The changes are irreparable; the seeds cannot be recalled once they are released. That is totally different to traditional breeding and seed selection methods which have been used by people everywhere to ensure food security and quality. Multinationals want to release radically mutated crops into the environment after a number of years of experimentation under laboratory conditions with no knowledge of what the consequences will be in generations to come. Under different natural conditions they may exhibit characteristics and behaviours which cannot be predicted. This could be potentially catastrophic in terms of crop failure and so on.</P>
    <P>The agenda of multinationals is clear. They want to control world seed markets by reducing the number of species and also control the number of varieties of genetically altered crops. That does not just include soya and maize, but, for example, rice production in the Third World. They then want to tie farmers worldwide into their contracts and disallow their right to take the best seeds when harvesting so that they can sow them the following year.</P>
    <P>This poses a massive threat to biodiversity globally and also to food security. What if the selected genetically engineered crops experience a catastrophic failure at any time in the future, which is entirely possible? Biodiversity could be so reduced for the main food staples of the world that food production capacity could be devastated. That is dismissed by some as scaremongering, but it is irrefutable. They cannot guarantee that this will not happen. Should we trust multinationals, such as Monsanto, with food quality and security? This company has distinguished itself through the production of agent orange, a poisonous chemical that laid waste to millions of acres of vegetation in Vietnam and continues to poison to innocent children there.</P>
    <P>Propaganda by multinationals that genetic engineering of food will feed the world is bogus. Hunger and malnutrition come not from the lack of capacity to produce food but from the ruthless control of food markets by capitalist companies for profits. The genetic engineering of animals to increase the amount of food they yield, which is also going on apace, is unethical, involves severe <Col N="1207" /> cruelty and also has unknown health risks. A number of instances demonstrate the dangers involved. An experiment was conducted to put an extra growth hormone gene into salmon. One group of offspring hatched from transgenic parents developed deformed heads and various degrees of discoloration which led to reduced viability according to a 1994 report. Pigs were treated with a sheep growth hormone activated by zinc in the diet. One pig produced a twenty fold increase in growth hormone levels and it died as a result of acute gastric haemorrhage due to ulceration when the zinc was withdrawn. I am indebted to Compassion in World Farming for bringing those proven examples to my attention.</P>
    <P>Labelling is absolutely critical. While I want an end to genetic engineering in the wild and want GMOs off supermarket shelves, we must at least demand labelling. The current labelling legislation is a joke. A typical pack of Bacon Fries contains both maize and soya protein but the fact that it is genetically modified is written in such small type, one would need a magnifying glass. Radical changes are needed in this area.</P>
    <P>Genetic Concern took up an excellent initiative to conduct independent research on people's concerns about genetic engineering. It showed clearly that a huge majority of people want information and are massively concerned about the current situation. Fianna Fáil and the Government have adopted an entirely cowardly, and utterly opportunist, approach in this regard. Fianna Fáil correctly stated prior to the last general election that companies involved in the development of genetic engineering were treating populations like guinea pigs. The party started to retreat from this position after the general election and that retreat has since turned into a rout as Fianna Fáil trots out EU regulations. Where the health of our people and the security of our ecosystems are at stake, no regulation must stand in the way of people resisting the threat which exists. The United States is attempting to bully the EU to allow unlabelled genetically engineered produce into Europe. We must have the guts to stand up to them to ensure the security of our ecosystems, the safety of our food supply and the health of our people. That must come first.</P>

      <P>I am delighted this debate has eventually reached this forum. For the past two years, there has been a great deal of speculation on this issue in the media; the debate has been driven by soundbites and, in some cases, misinformation on both sides of the argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Higgins stated that in April 1997 the current Government, then in Opposition, called for a moratorium on commercial crop planting. It has been silent ever since and that silence has fuelled public fear. The absence of a public <Col N="1208" /> debate on the issue has been a very important missing dimension. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government informed us that it is not possible to introduce a moratorium when in Government because of EU directives. I am surprised he was not aware of that himself when in Opposition. I am relatively new to this House but I realise that EU regulations restrict us from calling for a moratorium on the commercial planting of these crops. Austria, Luxembourg and France have attempted to impose moratoria but have met with opposition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">

    <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune" hpid="Ms Clune Ms Clune">
      <NameTxt>Ms Clune</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an ongoing debate on this issue within the EU at the moment. I would like the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to lead the call for a moratorium, if that is what is required. We are being inundated with science but we do not really need it at present and should take things at a pace which suits us. Deputy Dukes earlier called for a five year moratorium and I support that. We should step back and assess the impact of these crops in a timeframe which is suitable to us.</P>
      <P>The public is confused. People are caught in the middle of a debate between the biotechnology industry which supports GMOs and those opposed to them. There has not been any Government-led debate on the issue. The Government produced a consultation document last September but it was not widely read as its very size and wording were off-putting to people.</P>
      <P>A referendum was held in Ireland last year on the Treaty of Amsterdam and the Good Friday Agreement. The Government posted explanatory leaflets into every household at that time. Why can it not do the same now on the important issue of genetic engineering which will be very much a part of industry and job creation in the future? The public needs more information on the current status of genetic engineering and its effects on our food, crops and so on. People must be informed of who controls genetic engineering and the manner in which it is controlled and regulated. The Government has this information and should do much more to inform consumers who push trolleys up and down supermarket aisles every week and are dependent on the authorities to ensure their food is safe. Outrageous statements have been made to the effect that the food on supermarket shelves is putting people's lives at risk, yet the Government has not offered any reassurance on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Consultation conferences were referred to. I believe they would be very useful and I am sorry the Minister for the Environment and Local Government dismissed them. A conference is currently being considered for the UK where the attitudes of six citizen juries will be measured. A total of 1,000 people will be recruited from a ran<Col N="1209" /> dom sample of 5,000 adults for the purpose of testing public attitudes to GMOs. There is also a similar Norwegian example which was referred to earlier in the debate. Such conferences could prove very useful in involving the public in this debate to a greater extent.</P>
    <P>I strongly support the call for more detailed labelling. Consumers will then be in a position to make informed choices. The term 'genetic engineering' on the back of a packet will mean nothing to people. A total of 60 per cent of processed foods contain soya or soya derivatives. Fish fingers, chicken curries and chicken nuggets, which are a key element in most children's diets, are made from soya derivatives and contain GMOs. The Food Safety Authority of Ireland assures us that the foodstuffs currently on supermarket shelves do not pose any risk to health. The Government must reassure people, stand behind the authority and provide it with more resources. That also applies to the EPA. Only one person within the EPA has responsibility for GMOs in the environment.</P>
    <P>The value of genetic engineering in the revolution of health care has been referred to. The manner in which is has revolutionised agriculture has given rise to widespread public concern and anxiety. The facility now exists to engineer crops and plants such as sugar beet, soya and maize in order to make them resistant to herbicides and pesticides. Such crops are being marketed on the basis that the amount of herbicides and pesticides used is reduced, thus proving more beneficial to the environment and the consumer. Five sugar beet field trials have been carried out in Ireland in the past year.</P>
    <P>The global area of genetically modified produce planted is increasing at a staggering rate every year although there is very little in Europe thus far. Genetic engineering has much to offer us but we must control and regulate it. We must allay public fears and examine the issues on a case by case basis. That is the way forward.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NedOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. N. O'Keeffe Mr. N. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. N. O'Keeffe)</NameTxt>
      <P>As Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food I welcome the opportunity to speak on this very important topic and to congratulate my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, on publishing his consultation paper on genetically modified organisms and the environment. It provides an opportunity for the general public to participate in the development of a national policy on GMOs and the environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would point out that Ireland has a strong biotechnology sector in which some 170 national and multinational companies are represented. BioResearch Ireland, which was established in 1987, has five centres of biotechnology research and development based in the universities. These <Col N="1210" /> centres specialise in diagnostics, food biotechnology, agriculture and veterinary biotechnology, cell and tissue culture and pharmaceutical biotechnology.</P>
    <P>It should also be remembered that the EU Commission's White Paper on Growth, Competitiveness and Employment acknowledged modern biotechnology as one of the areas offering the greatest potential for innovation and growth. It concluded that the Community should be open to reviewing its regulatory framework in order that the full potential of genetic engineering for jobs, investment and growth can be realised.</P>
    <P>It goes without saying that GMOs released into the environment for use as seed, food or feed production must not pose a risk to the health and safety of humans and animals. Neither must GMOs cause biological damage by upsetting the balance in nature. Increasingly, genetically modified products are being released into the environment as seed and crops for use as novel food for humans and feed for animals. These genetically modified products undergo rigorous research and assessment procedures before they can be approved for release into the environment for use in the production of food and animal feeds, or as other medical, pharmaceutical or crop protection products.</P>
    <P>All member states of the EU have established scientific committees to carry out a rigorous risk assessment on GMOs. Ireland has a GMO advisory committee which advises the Environmental Protection Agency on the environmental safety of GMOs. A GMO and novel foods sub-committee under the Food Safety Authority of Ireland's scientific committee is providing advice to the EPA on the animal feed aspects of GMO dossiers received. My Department has a nominee on both committees.</P>
    <P>It must also be emphasised that the European Union takes the issue of human, animal and environmental safety from GMOs and GMO derived products seriously. To this end it has set up seven scientific committees in the field of consumer health and food safety. The work of these scientific committees is co-ordinated by a scientific steering committee. These committees are within DG24, the directorate responsible for consumer affairs in the EU. Committees of relevance to GMOs consist of scientific committees for food, animal nutrition, for plants, including pesticides, and toxicity, ecotoxcity and the environment. Their advice on matters relating to human health is based on the principles of excellence, independence and transparency.</P>
    <P>In the interest of safety to humans, animals and the environment, it is of paramount importance that products of biotechnology are adequately regulated. Regulations covering labelling is essential to allow consumers make an informed choice. It is also necessary to amend the legislation as required to take account of experiences gained <Col N="1211" /> with GMOs already released into the environment.</P>
    <P>My Department has responsibility for implementing a series of five seeds marketing directives, a vegetable seed catalogue directive and the common seed catalogue directive. In terms of developing a link between the catalogue directive and the Deliberate Release Directive (90/220 EEC), the forthcoming amendment to the common catalogue directive will introduce provisions requiring the identification of genetically modified seed varieties as such in the common, national and sales catalogues and making the inclusion of genetically modified varieties in catalogues subject to consideration of safety for human health and the environment, based on an environmental risk assessment similar to that provided for in the Deliberate Release Directive (90/220 EEC).</P>
    <P>Currently, genetically modified feedstuffs for animals are regulated under the deliberate release directive. This is an interim arrangement, pending the introduction of an EU specific regulation for feed stuffs. The deliberate release directive was amended in 1997 to provide for the labelling of feed materials at the level of whole seeds but once it is processed into a feeding stuff, for example when milled, there is currently no labelling provision. The GMO and novel foods sub-committee under the Food Safety Authority of Ireland's scientific committee is currently providing advice to the EPA on the animal feed aspects of GMOs. I hope that the promised feed specific EU wide legislation can be progressed with a view to implementation at the earliest date.</P>
    <P>The most striking benefits of biotechnology are to be seen in the area of human medicine. The production of insulin for the treatment of diabetes readily comes to mind. Other products include growth hormones, enzymes and special proteins required by humans. To date, 18 GMO products have been approved in the EU under the deliberate release directive. These range from a vaccine against Aujeszky's disease in pigs, a vaccine against rabies, genetically modified carnations and chicory and a test kit to detect antibiotics in milk. Ten of the releases consist of various crop plants with in-built resistance to herbicides and insects.</P>

      <P>These transgenic plants are of interest to crop producers for economic reasons but also because of ease of management.

      <P>This is in contrast, for example, to present day sugar beet production which requires up to three applications of mixtures of herbicides which are residual and do not break down readily in the soil. Insect resistant transgenic plants also have specific benefits for the environment. Developing transgenic plants that are resistant to environment friendly plant protection products can benefit the environment and lead to more sustainable production in the long-term.</P>
      <P>Biotechnology is a powerful tool for the development of products which benefit mankind and the environment. This technology needs to be properly managed to avoid damage to nature and the environment. Hence the need for strong, effective and precautionary legislation, and scientific assessment of GMOs at national and EU level. The concerns of consumers are paramount and the consumer's right to choose between genetically modified and conventional products must be protected. I welcome the consultation paper on genetically modified organisms prepared by my colleague the Minister for Environment and Local Government. I have every confidence that it will lead to an informed debate on the issues and in due course to the development of a generally agreed approach to this technology.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>Our discussions on genetically modified foods is both timely and necessary. I have heard more about them in the past two years than I did in the previous 20 years. The issue is being carried along on the back of a raging controversy about what is safe and unsafe for humans to eat. The strange thing is that biotechnology is not new. From the early 1970s there have been remarkable breakthroughs and in the 30 years since then many worthwhile developments have taken place without any of the current furore.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I plainly see why people are very upset about genetically modified food getting into the food chain. Huge anxiety always results when people do not understand an issue, and it is very important for everyone, irrespective of whether one is for or against genetically modified foods, that we establish a forum where the issue can be debated without rancour or outlandish statements. I hope the Government, the Departments of Health and Children and Agriculture and Food, the EPA, the consumer associations, Gen<Col N="1213" /> etic Concern and everybody else will become involved in a forum and continue to discuss the matter. Later I will give a few reasons for this view.</P>
    <P>There are a few facts on which we can rely. To my knowledge there has not yet been a single disaster in the context of genetically modified foods.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>This is what is wrong with the debate on this issue. The Deputy will have an opportunity sooner or later to say what he wants. I have not heard of a disaster happening in this area in 30 years, although others might have, and independent scientists have spoken to me on the matter.</P>
      <P>The advances of biotechnology in pharmaceuticals are nothing short of revolutionary. I have friends who take insulin which was developed through this technology. I did not know its origin for years. I am told biotechnology is extremely important in the treatment of cystic fibrosis. However, the main debate concerns genetically modified foods. No cloud hangs over the use of biotechnology in other areas, but it is a different story with food.</P>
      <P>I cannot prove whether claims in this area are right or wrong because I am not an expert on the subject. However, I have attended some seminars and read some papers on the subject. One conclusion I have reached is that genetically modified food cannot be offloaded on a population which is not ready for it. If that were to happen, there would be a revolution, because people will not tolerate food whose origin they do not know and of which they do not approve. I can, therefore, understand why people would have problems with genetically modified food. However, if I were the managing director of Monsanto, I would not want it to happen that way because, if the public did not want to buy food containing GMOs because it did not believe it was safe, it would not be good for my business. It is against that background that it is extremely important there is consultation. I do not know at what level of intensity it should be, but there should be much more than there has been to date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of the discussions I attended, at which both sides were represented went over the top. Some outlandish statements were made which I do not believe could be proved. There is a body of independent scientists around the world who should make known their views. They are independent in that they do not have chips on their shoulders and do not stand to make money from <Col N="1214" /> the venture. There are many hundreds of them around the world who do not view matters in the same way as those few to whom Deputy Higgins referred. We must allow for greater evaluation of this matter.</P>
    <P>The pace at which genetically modified foods will find their way into supermarkets will be slow, apart from those which have already entered the market. There should be better labelling and it should not be in small print. This is of major importance to a housewife doing the weekly shopping if she wants to avoid genetically modified foods. However, I wonder how many will avoid them if the product is good, the price is right and it has an acceptable health certificate.</P>
    <P>A fact even the most strident critic of genetically modified food accepts is that much of it exists already. Like most Irish people, I love cheese and have been eating it for years. I did not know until recently that it is made using genetically modified organisms. I do not understand why there has not been a furore over this, because cheese is part of the staple diet in almost every home in the country.</P>
    <P>Perception is everything. There was a huge reduction in the consumption of beef during the BSE crisis and many people stopped eating it. Why have they started to eat it again given that the level of BSE has not reduced significantly? The reason is that people came to realise there were only 60 to 70 cases of BSE every year in a herd of several million cattle, that new traceability measures had been put in place and that the issue of hygiene in factories had been addressed. Nothing changed other than the measures taken to increase confidence, yet people started to eat beef again, and I have no doubt they will continue to do so. If a poll had been conducted at the height of the BSE crisis, most would have replied that they would not eat beef. If one were to be conducted now, however, the figure would be much less, although there are still cases of BSE. It is all about perception.</P>
    <P>I grew sugar beet when I was younger and had a major problem with weed control. I often put three heavy and intensive sprays on the beet to control the weeds. Roundup, which as the House knows is not as toxic as Paraquat and other such products, was very effective in this regard. Genetic modification of sugar beet to assist in this regard makes sense provided it can be proved there are no side effects. I await the day that someone breeds a potato which is not subject to blight. I sincerely hope that day will come because blight has cost us a great deal of money, time and lives.</P>
    <P>Whether people are for or against genetic modification, I hope they engage in open and honest debate and that there will not be as many outlandish claims.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been listening to the debate in my office and appreciate the contributions of Deputies. I am glad of the opportunity to address the House on this important issue. Genetically modified organisms have existed for more than 20 years, but it is only recently that the majority of people in Ireland have become aware of them. Genetic engineering is a technology used to alter the genetic material of living cells to make them capable of producing new substances or performing new functions. For example, GMOs are plants or bacteria whose genetic material has been altered, and they are widely used in the biomedical, pharmaceutical and chemical industries in contained use, that is, they are not released into the environment.</P>
      <P>In the biomedical area, genetic engineering has become a widely used research technique in the past 20 years. The genetically modified organisms produced include those used in vaccines, process micro-organisms used for the production of pharmaceuticals, enzymes and reagents, and other model micro-organisms used in the course of biomedical research. There is also further research on understanding the molecular biology, including genetics, of animals, plants and micro-organisms. In these systems a gene for a particular molecule is inserted into an organism which then produces the drug. There are currently some 280 such drugs or vaccines in clinical trials, and 40 biotechnology drugs are in daily use by millions of people. A good example is insulin which has been used by diabetics worldwide since 1982. It is produced from GM bacteria rather than animals and in a cleaner, more controllable environment than was the case previously.</P>
      <P>Increasingly GMOs are being used in agricultural and environmental applications which require that they be used on land or in water bodies, etc., to fulfil their function. This is legally referred to as &ldquo;deliberately released into the environment&rdquo;. These GMOs are mainly crop plants or bacteria modified in specific ways. Bacteria, for instance, have been genetically engineered to allow them break down oil or other polutants for environmental clean up purposes.</P>
      <P>The best known of the plant modifications are genes which make crops resistant to insect attack or tolerant of a specific herbicide. There are approximately 30 GM crops in use worldwide. Many more are awaiting approval. More than 70 million acres of GM crops were grown worldwide in 1998. It is estimated that at least 90 million acres will be grown this year. The main GM crops are corn, cotton, maize, rape seed, tomatoes, potatoes and sugar beet.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Ordinary farmers are buying the seed in increasing numbers to reduce the need to use pesticides and thereby reduce costs, including labour. Other crops are favoured because of consumer demand, for example, potatoes which contain no pesticide residues.</P>
      <P>Only a few hundred acres of these crops were grown in the European Union in 1998 because the regulatory process has not been resolved due to public uncertainty about GMOs. An added complication is that GM food is on the market because the European Union is obliged under GATT regulations to allow importation of soya and other products from the United States, much of which are genetically modified.</P>
      <P>There has been strict testing of genetically modified crops in countries in which they have been approved such as the United States, Canada and Japan. Between 1987 and 1998 there were 28,000 field trials of 60 GM crops in 45 countries, few of which could be said to be lax in their regulatory procedures. They have analysed the evidence and decided that there is no basis to deny their use. They claim to be benefiting economically and environmentally. Trials of new crops will continue.</P>
      <P>The extent of trials of GMOs within the European Union is impressive. Between October 1991 and June 1997 there were approximately 1,000 trials at 4,000 experimental sites of more than 30 GMO plant species in member states. As a result 16 GMOs have been placed on the market. A further nine or ten are awaiting approval. More than 250 field trials of sugar beet are being conducted in Europe. A single trial was conducted in Ireland in 1998.</P>
      <P>GM technology has a lower credibility rating in the European Union than in the rest of the world. Various events unrelated to genetic engineering, for example, BSE, have caused the public to be less trusting of new technology. There are strong lobby groups opposed to new technologies. As a result the public has become nervous about GMOs.</P>
      <P>The European Union is in a strange dilemma. There is a massive body of scientific information which suggests that genetic engineering is safe. Millions of acres of crops have been grown, millions of tonnes of food have been consumed; billions of doses of GM drugs have been administered and tens of thousands of trials have been conducted worldwide, all without serious cause for concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is conscious that the subject of GMOs is a sensitive one and considers that giving advice to persuade the public that there are only benefits to be gained from developments in biotechnology and genetics is not the ideal approach. For this reason it decided earlier this month to establish an interdepartmental group chaired by my Department at assistant secretary-general level. It comprises representatives of the <Col N="1217" /> Departments of Enterprise, Trade and Employment; Health and Children; Agriculture and Food and the Environment and Local Government as well as a representative of the Food Safety Authority. It was convened immediately and has begun its important work of collecting and analysing all relevant material on this complex subject. It will liaise with all relevant Departments and public bodies with responsibility in this area with a view to producing a co-ordinated Government strategy on GMOs as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I am confident that, if the necessary systems are put in place to ensure safety and there is clear labelling for genetically modified products, the farmer and consumer will decide for themselves whether these crops and foods have a future. There was a reference to genetically modified cheese. This is incorrect. The manufacturing process includes a genetically modified enzyme.</P>
    <P>Deputy Clune said there should be a moratorium on GMOs. Banning genetically modified products would have serious implications for products in daily use ranging from essential medicines and vaccines to foodstuffs posing a threat to people's health. It would also send the wrong message to the biotechnology industry.</P>

      <P>This debate, although long overdue, is timely given the publicity the issue has received due to the efforts of the environmental NGOs and the courageous, upstanding citizens who disturbed the field trials.

      <Col N="1218" /> During the debate on the Plant Varieties Bill I was heckled by all sides &ndash; Fianna Fail, Fine Gael and the Labour Party. Predictably, Deputy Dukes engaged in heckling again today. He said that the Greens were living on cloud nine. This is reserved for those who have been proved right. As Mark Twain once said, a crank is only a crank until he has been proved right. We have been proved right time and again. We were the first party to warn of the dangers of nuclear power but were dismissed. There is not a Deputy in the House, with the exception perhaps of Deputy Dukes who supports nuclear weapons, who would dispute that at this stage. CFCs destroy the ozone layer&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Dukes did not leave me out of it. The Green Party was the first to issue public warnings about CFCs and global warming, which were dismissed. Deputy Connaughton referred to BSE. When we first brought that to the attention of people we were dismissed as scaremongers and cranks, but we have been proved right. The tactic is to smear those opposed to genetically modified organisms as unscientific. Monsanto claims to be scientific and tries to portray itself as a cross between Mother Teresa and Superman, out to save the planet. This company is greedy, unethical and ruthless. I and many others have a great problem entrusting the future of food production to people like that.</P>
      <P>The Green Party is in favour of research into the biomedical applications of genetic engineering where such research is conducted safely and ethically, however, it is important to note that the applications I have quoted concern the contained use of transgenic micro-organisms. The issue being debated concerns the engineering of micro-organisms and more complex plant cells and their subsequent release into the environment. It is this uncontained use of genetically modified plants and micro-organisms, coupled with their use in food crops to which the Green Party is opposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are four problems with genetically modified crops, the first being food safety. Fears about the safety of GM plants which have been engineered with foreign genes, such as bacterial or animal genes are not confined to those who know nothing about genetic engineering but are <Col N="1219" /> strongly expressed by the scientific community. To be sure of safety, exhaustive and long-term studies need to be done. Is this happening? Unfortunately, safety studies are largely in the hands of TNCs who are secretive about their results or anxious to market new GM products and consequently cannot be relied upon for objectivity. Food toxicity studies should be on a par with drug toxicity surveillance but we do not have this level of safety research for GM plants. Is there a Government Minister or Member who will declare in this debate that food derived from GM plants is safe?</P>
    <P>Why are we taking these risks, even small risks? As we know, and Dr. Patrick Wall of the Food Safety Authority recently admitted, there is no apparent advantage in plant genetic engineering for the actual consumers of food. Dr. Wall and Deputy Connaughton in his contribution referred favourably to genetic engineering in the production of human insulin. Let us remember that insulin is a protein that has been purified rigorously from a GM micro-organism which was grown in contained circumstances. In this debate we are addressing the uncontained growth of GM plants which are then released irrevocably into the environment. Let us not be fooled by all this talk of insulin.</P>
    <P>The Green Party concludes that GM plants are not being properly and openly investigated for toxicity and hence their release into the Irish market should be immediately banned. This ban should remain indefinitely until such time as long-term research has eliminated our food safety concerns. The Minister told us he discovered EU regulations only when he went to the Department, but he did not specify them. He was backed up by Mr. Euro, Deputy Dukes, who could have informed the Minister about them. The recent case brought by Dr. Claire Watson shows that countries can set their own standards, as is the case in Austria and Luxembourg. It is regrettable that the Government did not back Austria when it wanted a moratorium on GM foods.</P>

      <P>The announcement that 50 jobs will be lost in the Transmould plant in Killarney this week went unnoticed in the national media and by the Government. This is very worrying. A response is required from Government to ensure that replacement jobs are created as soon as possible. These job losses in addition to the 30 temporary lay offs at Alps Electrical in the town will further depress Killarney, which has been neglected in terms of industrial development. The people are sick and tired of empty promises during the past two years. Since taking office the Government has insisted it is actively seeking a replacement industry for the Pretty Polly plant in Killarney, but there is nothing on the horizon. I understand that 30 visits <Col N="1221" /> by potential industrialists have been made to the Pretty Polly plant since its closure, however no one has expressed genuine interest in setting up in the plant. Are there problems with the plant or with the location of Killarney that detract investors? Training and alternative employment opportunities should also be put in place as a matter of urgency. Since there is not a full-time IDA presence in Kerry the Government should consider opening an IDA office in the county to assist with developments.</P>
      <P>Following the failure to obtain Objective One status for Kerry it is essential that the Government sets out its plans for the county. In including Kerry in its application for Objective One status, I presume the Government is aware of the pockets of acute disadvantage, particularly in south Kerry. As the application for south Kerry has failed is the Government prepared to address the problem the county suffered due to its peripheral location?</P>
      <P>Given the job losses in Killarney this week, attention must be drawn to the jobs being lost through competition to low paid economies in the Far East. It is high time we revised our job creation policy and focused on bringing a good mix of indigenous and multinational employment to towns. Ireland should no longer rely on low wages as a method of remaining competitive. I ask the Tánaiste to meet the various agencies, Kerry County Council and the IDA with a view to putting a task force in place.</P>

      <P>Transmould Limited was established in Killarney in 1989 and manufactures a range of transformers, smoke and heat detectors and also a range of emergency lighting and plastic mouldings. It currently employs around 155 people between temporary and permanent staff.</P>
      <P>Transmould is a direct subsidiary of Menvier-Swain Group plc. This company is a large manufacturer of emergency lighting systems for industrial and commercial applications and has its headquarters in Banbury in the United Kingdom. The Menvier-Swain Group employs more than 1,500 people in facilities in Europe, Australia and the Far East. Menvier was acquired in December 1997 by Cooper Industries, Houston, Texas. Cooper Industries is a diversified worldwide manufacturer of electrical products, tools, hardware and automotive products. The company employs about 30,000 people in 100 manufacturing facilities worldwide.</P>
      <P>Recent announcements by the chief executive officer, Mr. H.J. Reilly, indicated that the company intends to implement a cost reduction programme which will involve the elimination of 12 facilities worldwide with, in some cases, the transfer of production to lower cost countries such as Mexico.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1222" /> This week, Transmould announced it is to downsize its operation in Killarney by about 50 jobs over the next six months. These jobs are mainly related to the production of transformers and coils. This has occurred as a result of principal customers being forced, through market competitiveness, to source products from lower cost suppliers in the Far East.</P>
    <P>In light of the downsizing of the Transmould operation in Killarney, we have asked the agencies to intensify their efforts to facilitate additional investment, job creation and job maintenance in Killarney. Developing the full potential of the south Kerry area, and in particular Killarney, to attract more industry to the area and to expand the existing industrial base in the region is a priority for all agencies.</P>
    <P>IDA Ireland continues to promote the vacant Pretty Polly facility to potential overseas investors. In recent years there have been 39 site visits to Killarney, 34 of which have visited the Pretty Polly facility. IDA Ireland is confident that a positive outcome will emerge from the intensive promotional work being undertaken.</P>
    <P>As a result of IDA Ireland promotion of Killarney as a suitable location for call centres, Rosenbluth International, the second largest travel management company in the world, recently established a call centre in the town. The company chose Killarney as a centre to co-ordinate all its support services for Europe and will employ 250 people at full development. IDA Ireland also continues to work with the existing overseas companies located in Killarney and hopes this development work will result in expansions by these companies.</P>
    <P>In addition, Enterprise Ireland is working with indigenous industry in the south Kerry area. The agency aims to build on the success achieved in the area in 1998 when a net gain of 110 jobs was achieved by companies in its client base. Enterprise Ireland's business development activities will focus on helping companies in the area exploit their growth potential through capability and capacity enhancement measures. These will include the development of a response to the training and resource requirements of the key services sector. There will be a special emphasis on software and telemarketing.</P>
    <P>At community level Enterprise Ireland will continue its involvement in a range of activities including supporting the Killarney working group and participation on the Kerry County Enterprise Board which has been a major success.</P>
    <P>I am confident the strenuous efforts made by the development agencies will yield positive results on the industrial front for Killarney and neither I nor the Government propose to establish a task force at this time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>The gas pipeline to Fingal is coming in at Loughshinny. The local community has had its difficulties with it but recognise the reality and are learning to live with it although they have been disappointed by Bord Gáis and the assurances given. This Adjournment debate arises from the fact that £50 million is to be spent by Bord Gáis on increasing the capacity of that gas pipleline by 70 per cent. Where does this plan fit into our overall obligations under the Kyoto Convention and derogations which we have secured relating to greenhouse gas emissions and the potential for renewable energy and energy conservation here? It seems we have exceeded our target in relation to Kyoto. People including the intergovernmental panel on climate change would say the target was too low. We are getting away with a considerable amount of irresponsibility in the eyes of many. The question for the community in north Dublin, in Fingal, is whether we should allow another pipeline to enter at this or any other point into Ireland without putting in place the necessary energy conservation measures, assisting groups such as Energy Action, which is basically a charity, which insulates the homes of many elderly people. The Minister of State is aware of this as I have met him at functions organised by Energy Action. Have we a responsibility to realise the potential for renewable energy before giving in to the temptation for added fossil fuel consumption. Gas is benign compared to turf or coal but nevertheless it is a finite resource and it contributes to the problems of climate change. At what stage are the consultations? Will the Loughshinny and Rush communities be consulted in advance of any decision as they will bear the brunt of any disturbance which occurs as a result of engineering work in the area if the pipeline is to proceed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Sargent for raising this urgent matter. The Deputy's sentiments on this issue are not too far from mine. The Government is committed to ensuring Ireland's energy sector can contribute positively to future economic growth and development. This demands that, in energy policy, an appropriate balance be struck between ensuring energy price competitiveness, security of supply and environmentally sustainable energy production.</P>
      <P>The production of electricity through combined cycle gas turbines is recognised as the most efficient power generation technology. Natural gas is, of course, also by far the least offensive fossil fuel in terms of environmentally harmful emissions which must now be limited to ensure we meet our international obligations arising from the United Nations Convention on Climate Change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am, therefore, in support of an increased role for natural gas in the overall energy sector. I am <Col N="1224" /> well aware of the Deputy's concerns about environmental sustainability in energy policy and his support for the development of renewable energy. I also have progressive views in this area and can assure the Deputy that there is ample room for renewable energy alongside natural gas in meeting our future energy needs.</P>
    <P>Currently there are two sources of natural gas, namely the Kinsale Head gas field and the interconnector pipeline between Scotland and Dublin. As the Deputy will be aware, the Kinsale field is now approaching exhaustion although there are encouraging prospects of at least one new indigenous source of natural gas off the west coast. On the other hand, the demand for natural gas is growing at a substantial rate and this trend will continue, particularly having regard to the anticipated demand for natural gas for power generation as the electricity market is opened up to competitive supply.</P>
    <P>It is of paramount importance that an adequate supply of gas is available to meet growing demand. A study of natural gas demand and related infrastructural options to the year 2025 is being conducted by Bord Gáis and my Department and is already well advanced. A high priority continues to be given to the study.</P>
    <P>The current capacity of the gas interconnector between Scotland and Ireland is between 9 and 10 million standard cubic metres per day. Bord Gáis will enhance the capacity of the interconnector to 17 million standard cubic metres per day by means of additional compression to be provided in the years 2000 and 2001. This will provide adequate capacity to meet forecast gas demand to 2004. However, the study shows that by 2005 daily peak demand for gas for domestic, industrial and other purposes will have increased to between 17.1 and 25.1 million standard cubic metres. The necessary additional gas transmission infrastructure to cater for the demand for gas from 2004 will be put in place in time to ensure there are no supply restrictions.</P>
    <P>Technical consultants appointed by Bord Gáis have recommended the provision of a second gas interconnector between Scotland and Dublin, parallel to the existing interconnector, as the optimum option. That option is being considered by Bord Gáis and my Department against the background of a possible commercial gas discovery in the Corrib field off the west coast, a proposal for a North-South gas interconnector and the interest shown by a number of private sector companies in the provision of additional gas infrastructure both to and within the State. I have received notification from one company about a new interconnector.</P>
    <P>It is important that I set out clearly the scope of my legal powers in this matter. Section 40 of the Gas Act, 1976, provides that a person, other than Bord Gáis, shall not construct a natural gas pipeline without giving previous and reasonable <Col N="1225" /> notice to me, as Minister. I am then empowered to impose requirements on the manner in which the pipeline is constructed or operated. The requirements which may be imposed are directly analogous to those which may be imposed on Bord Gáis under the Gas Act, 1976, in relation to the construction, operation and maintenance of pipelines. I am not, therefore, empowered, in so far as market regulation is concerned, to consider the question of whether the construction of a new pipeline between Britain and Ireland by a person other than Bord Gáis should be allowed.</P>

      <P>I thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for letting me raise this matter and I thank the Minister for being present.</P>
      <P>I was informed about this matter by the woman's family a few days ago. A 78 year old north Galway woman from the parish of Ballymoe was admitted to Roscommon County Hospital suffering from a suspected blood clot last week. On her arrival at the hospital she was informed there was no bed available and she was put waiting on a trolley in the casualty department. After about seven hours on the trolley, her family became anxious about her welfare as she was unhappy in this position, and they conveyed their anxieties to the hospital authorities.</P>
      <P>Due to an unreal workload, according to the family, the doctor in charge was not able to examine the woman at that stage. At 1 a.m. the family suggested to the hospital authorities that they believed their mother's best interests would be served by bringing her home. When she was being taken down from the trolley to be dressed for home, she went into a feeble state and became faint. At that stage it was obvious to everybody that she was unable to go home. However, as there was still no bed for her and the trolley proved unsuitable, the family reluctantly agreed to go home after being advised by the authorities that their mother would be well looked after.</P>
      <P>When the family arrived back at the hospital the next morning, they found their mother sleeping on a bench type couch near a corridor. One member of the family described the bench as the back seat of an old Hillman Hunter car. The family were terribly upset by the way their mother was treated under the so-called modern health service which has more in common with 1959 than 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The woman left the hospital shortly after that and is now progressing well. The family wishes to stress that the nurses and the doctor could not have been more helpful, but it appeared to them that both the doctor and the nurses were grossly overworked on that occasion. It appeared that there were not enough staff available for this type of emergency and that the level of accommodation for a 78 year old woman was short of what <Col N="1226" /> one would expect in this day and age. One would expect that the stay in hospital of a person who is nearly 80 years of age would be more comfortable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased with the opportunity afforded to me this evening by Deputy Connaughton to address the House on the issues raised concerning a patient admitted to Roscommon County Hospital on 16 March 1999.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the provision of services at Roscommon County Hospital is a matter for the Western Health Board in the first instance. Notwithstanding this, I advise the House that I am personally familiar with the case raised by the Deputy, having spoken to a family member of the person in question on Monday last, 22 March. Following my conversation with that family member, I subsequently personally took up the case with the chief executive officer of the Western Health Board. I understand a full investigation into the circumstances of the case has now been initiated and the board has arranged to meet with the family involved as part of this process.</P>
      <P>While it would not be appropriate for me to comment on the detail of the specific case, I want to address the House on some of the related issues that arise. Roscommon County Hospital will treat more than 5,000 patients on an in-patient and day case basis this year. In addition, it will see more than 14,000 patients in accident and emergency and a similar number of patients will receive treatment at out-patient level. The Deputy will appreciate that while these planned levels of activity will be scheduled to benefit patients to the greatest extent possible, the unpredictable nature of the work of the accident and emergency department of a hospital is such that on occasion, at times of particular pressure, delays do inevitably occur. However, at all times it is the strict policy of all hospitals that priority is accorded to those patients most in need of immediate medical attention.</P>
      <P>Roscommon County Hospital provides a high quality service to the people of its catchment area and plays a major role in the provision of health services in the western region. Recognition and appreciation of the contribution of the hospital to the quality of life people in the Roscommon area is evidenced in the strong displays of loyalty to the hospital which we have seen over the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since my appointment as Minister for Health and Children, I have invested heavily in developing that role, in recognition of the major contribution which the hospital makes and the strong will of the people locally to have that developed and strengthened. In December of last year, I formally opened new surgical facilities and a psychiatric day unit at the hospital at an overall cost of £650,000. The surgical development <Col N="1227" /> involved the renovation and extension of St Brigid's in-patient ward and the provision of a new physiotherapy area to provide improved standards of accommodation and lead to enhanced patient satisfaction. A new dedicated day surgery area, with five beds, reception, treatment and recovery facilities, was also provided to allow for an increased throughput of surgical patients in the hospital and to ensure services can be developed in a manner most appropriate to needs. New private accommodation was also provided to assist the hospital to maximise its income to the benefit of both public and private patients.</P>
    <P>In another major step in the overall development of the hospital, a second consultant surgeon has taken up duty since January, following my decision to increase the hospital's revenue base for this purpose.</P>
    <P>The net effect for the people of Roscommon and the other areas mentioned by Deputy Connaughton of these developments is to provide improved access to a better service. This is very important in terms of what I am trying to achieve for the hospital services overall, that is, to provide people with services in their own region that respond efficiently, effectively and appropriately to their needs. Taken with the major development at Unversity College Hospital Galway and Mayo General Hospital, as well as the construction works under way at Portiuncula Hospital, the improvement of services at Roscommon are an essential part of the realisation of my strategy for hospital services in the west.</P>
    <P>I know that further developmental needs remain at Roscommon County Hospital and I am determined to address these in a structured manner. Work is now under way on the preparation of an outline development control plan for the hospital which will set the overall footprint for all future developments, ensuring that they can proceed in a manner consistent with the board's long-term development strategy for the hospital which involves the integration of community and elderly services on site there. I have already given a public commitment that the development of the hospital's accident and emergency department will take priority in that context.</P>
    <P>In outlining these measures for the enhancement of services at the hospital, it is not my intention to dismiss the unsatisfactory experience of any one patient there. Whatever the circumstances of the case, it is my primary concern as Minister to ensure that every individual who presents for hospital treatment is dealt with in an appropriate and satisfactory manner and it is because of that concern that I personally raised this case with the health board.</P>
    <P>It is important, however, to set that in the context of the overall service being provided at Roscommon County Hospital and the very real efforts that are being made by this Government <Col N="1228" /> to address its development needs as part of a wider strategy for the development of acute hospital services on a regionally self-sufficient basis. That strategy is being underpinned by unprecedented levels of new investment by this Government in the acute hospital sector &ndash; £71 million for specific service developments this year, an overall health expenditure increase of 28 per cent in revenue funding and 43 per cent in capital funding since the Government took office.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that cold figures mean little to individuals whose hospital experience, for whatever reason, is less than fully satisfactory. They do, however, illustrate the commitment the Government is giving to developing health systems, bulding on its very many existing strengths to make it, where possible, more responsive to needs and better placed to deliver the kind of service people expect and are entitled to receive.</P>
    <P>An investigation into the case described by Deputy Connaughton is taking place. On behalf of everyone concerned at Roscommon County Hospital, I apologise and regret that any patient should have had the experience the lady in question had. I am anxious that we learn from experience. I am sure the family in question would like us to learn lessons and try to make sure that such an incident does not occur again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, sir, for affording me the opportunity to raise the very important matter of the need for a Government commitment to the development of a university in Waterford. Recently the interim review group on both Waterford and Cork institutes of technology reported to the Minister for Education and Science. The chairperson of the interim review group was Professor Dervilla Donnelly and the group was composed of international and national members. The recommendations on the delegation of qualification awarding authority to each of the colleges were identical except in one regard. The first recommendation was exactly the same and read as follows: &ldquo;Subject to the above recommendations of the interim review group and subject to the conditions and arrangements to be specified by the new statutory body, the interim review group recommends that Waterford/Cork Institute of Technology be granted delegated authority to award its own qualifications within a national framework in respect of all existing NCEA validated national certificate and diploma courses.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is, however, a significant difference between the second recommendation on the delegation of qualification awarding authority to the two institutes of technology even though the difference is only one word. The second recommendation for Cork Institute of Technology reads as follows: &ldquo;After an appropriate period of <Col N="1229" /> time following the delegation of qualification awarding authority in respect of certificate and diploma courses, a review should take place which would have the potential to grant delegation in respect of degree courses.&rdquo;  In the case of Waterford Institute of Technology the recommendation reads as follows: &ldquo;After an appropriate period of time following the delegation of qualification awarding authority in respect of certificate and diploma courses, a review should take place which would have the potential to grant delegation in respect of primary degree courses.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I understand the Minister for Education and Science has accepted the recommendations in respect of both Waterford and Cork institutes of technology. He has further published the Qualifications (Education and Training) Bill, 1999, which will provide the statutory framework for the implementation of these recommendations. Under the provisions of the Bill, there will be a National Qualifications Authority with a Higher Education and Training Awards Council.</P>
    <P>The Minister is well aware of the lack of a university in the south-east region and of the low participation rate in the region of students in degree courses. It appears from the recommendations of the interim review group that Cork Institute of Technology which services a region that already has an excellent university, UCC, is being assigned a broader provision in relation to its eventual delegated authority to award its own degrees than the Waterford Institute of Technology which has already been recognised in the steering committee report on the future of higher education as requiring special attention in the matter of degrees in the context of the regional deficit. This report was accepted as a benchmark by the Government at the time.</P>
    <P>I demand that the Minister for Education and Science states clearly the position in relation to the use of the word &ldquo;primary&rdquo; in the context of Waterford Institute of Technology. The excellent work which has been carried out over many years by both Waterford and Carlow institutes of technology at apprenticeship, national certificate, national diploma and degree level has made a huge contribution to the economic and industrial development of the region. The work must be continued and expanded upon. However, the major regional deficit, the lack of a university, remains. This must be urgently addressed.</P>
    <P>The south-east regional authority will be proposing, in its submission to the Government on the national development plan, the upgrading of the Waterford Institute of Technology to university status. I seek a categorical assurance from the Minister that he will fully support this proposal when it comes before the forum of the Government and the regions in early May and that he will make sure it is a clear, well funded and major part of the national plan for 2000-2005.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter and allowing me the opportunity to respond on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, who is unavoidably absent this evening.</P>
      <P>The steering committee on the future development of higher education was asked to advise on the future development of the higher education sector and to examine, within the overall national context, the needs for higher education on a regional basis and the appropriateness of the current institutional provision, by region, to meet those needs.</P>
      <P>In July 1996 the Government approved in principle the recommendations in the report of the steering committee as a benchmark for future planning in the sector subject to regular review. As a response to the higher education needs of the south-east region, the report recommended an increase in student places in what was then the Regional Technical College, Waterford, an increase in degree level awards and a change of title to Regional Institute of Technology.</P>
      <P>Early in 1997 the college was redesignated as the Waterford Institute of Technology and arrangements were put in place to carry through the process leading to the delegation to the institute of authority to make awards. This process was initiated through the appointment of a review team chaired by Professor Dervilla Donnelly. The results of this academic review, published on 5 March 1999, recommended that Waterford Institute of Technology become one of the first institutes to have the delegated power to make awards in respect of all NCEA validated national certificate and diploma courses.</P>
      <P>The review group also recommended that, after an appropriate period following the delegation of award-making authority in respect of certificate and diploma courses, a review should take place concerning the further delegation in respect of primary degree courses.</P>
      <P>I stress that the Government has made a major commitment to develop and extend the institute. This has included a significant increase in the number of degree places in the institute, unprecedented capital investment of £14 million and a major expansion in recurrent funding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The excellence of Waterford Institute of Technology is well known and this review process has provided a full vindication of this. I am delighted with the successful outcome of the independent review of the institute and have no doubt this recognition of its work is richly deserved. Earlier this month, the Minister published a Qualifications Bill which will enable him to formally implement this recommendation for devolved authority once it is enacted. It will also enable further devolution of degree certification to the institute. The way forward to achieving this was outlined clearly in both the work of the review <Col N="1231" /> group and the self-evaluation work of the institute.</P>
    <P>The Minister previously stated that his objective in the sector is to develop a framework for the structured development of institutions in the technological sector to address changing local and national demands, while ensuring the maintenance of the complementary third level systems of university and technological education. He further stated that the diversity of institutions and the separate missions of the two broad sectors will be maintained to ensure maximum flexibility and responsiveness to the needs of students and to the wide variety of social and economic requirements.</P>
    <P>Waterford Institute of Technology will continue to play a major and growing role in higher education. The Government has played its role in ensuring it has the facilities and resources to meet this challenge. The institute's recurrent grant was increased substantially last year and provision has been made for an unprecedented £14 million in major capital funding for the institute.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1232" /> With regard to an increase in degree level provision in the south east region, the Department of Education and Science has, in recent years, sanctioned an increased degree level provision in Waterford Institute of Technology in the areas of computing, financial services and administration, aimed at meeting the identified higher education needs of the south east region. Proposals regarding further additional degree level provision for the 1999-2000 academic year will be the subject of forthcoming discussions with the Department in relation to the institute's annual programmes and budget submission. Accordingly, Waterford Institute of Technology has a distinctive and unique mission in the south east region which the Government wishes to maintain.</P>
    <P>The Government has demonstrated its commitment to the institute through the provisions of the Qualifications Bill and the Universities Act. The statutory provisions will be there to ensure the institute has the power to seek, when it wishes, additional devolved authority.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.25 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 30 March 1999.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for the Marine</askee>
      <Quest>and Natural Resources the steps, if any, taken or envisaged by his Department to fulfil the commitment made in An Action Programme for the Millennium to develop a comprehensive policy for the shipping industry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[8557/99]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <P>(Dr. Woods): The development and expansion of an indigenous shipping industry is the key policy objective for the sector. Expansion of Irish fleet tonnage, increased employment of Irish seafarers and shore based personnel and increased maritime activities are strategic policy objectives.</P>
    <P>The overall goal of Government policy for the shipping sector is to support and facilitate the development of a competitive Irish flagged and owned shipping sector, while maximising employment of Irish seafarers and ancillary shorebased personnel.</P>
    <P>The key objectives I am seeking to achieve are  to increase market share for Irish shipping services; to increase demand for, and supply of, well trained Irish seafarers; and to maintain and increase the Irish pool of maritime expertise because of its spin off benefits for the maritime sector generally.</P>
    <P>The strategies I am employing to achieve these objectives include the application of a competitive fiscal regime for the Irish shipping sector and for Irish seafarers. Fiscal alleviation measures that apply in a special way to shipping are considered to be State aid and are governed by the European Community guidelines on State aid to maritime transport, published in July 1997. A range of fiscal alleviation measures are in place to benefit the Irish shipping sector.</P>
    <P>A corporation tax rate of 10 per cent applies to trading income from certain qualifying shipping activities.</P>
    <P>Capital allowances are available in relation to certain expenditure incurred on ships and for offset against qualifying shipping activities.</P>
    <P>A special £5,000 income tax allowance for seafarers, who are at sea on voyages to or from foreign ports for at least 169 days in a tax year, was introduced in the 1998 Finance Act. A provision is included in this year's Finance Bill to extend this relief to seafarers servicing mobile or fixed rigs, platforms or installations in Irish waters.</P>
    <P>Provision was made in the Social Welfare Act, 1977, which allows for refunds to certain employers in the shipping industry in respect of the employers portion of the social insurance contributions paid in respect of seagoing employees.</P>
    <P>In the non-tax area a shipboard training subsidy is paid to students at the nautical studies department of the Cork Institute of Technology, by my Department through the institute, to help <Col N="1234" /> students secure places mainly with UK companies operating deep-sea fleets.</P>
    <P>I also set up a Task Force on Seafarer Training and employment in February 1998 to capitalise on the considerable potential to create jobs in the national and international shipping sectors.</P>
    <P>The task force brought together shipowners and operators, education and training agencies, industry and trade unions and specialists from Government Departments, including my Department. The task force presented a unanimous final report to me in October 1998 which supported in principle a joint proposal by the Cork Institute of Technology and the Naval Service to establish a new National Maritime College in County Cork.</P>
    <P>The report also identified real opportunities for skilled seafarers at home and abroad and a widening gap between supply and demand for well qualified seafarers. In its final report the task force stressed that more detailed costings would be necessary before the National Maritime College development could proceed.</P>
    <P>Government approval in principle to the development of the new National Maritime College for Cork, announced in October 1998 was further underpinned by the allocation of £200,000 to my Department to advance work on the costings and scheduling for the new college.</P>
    <P>In order to progress the recommendations of the task force an interdepartmental expert working group has been established. The group comprises senior officials and technical experts from my Department, the Departments of Finance, Education and Science and Defence as well as representatives of the Cork Institute of Technology, the Naval Service and FÁS. The group will examine the costings, financing and timing of the new National Maritime College with a view to submission of a fully developed proposal for implementation to Government.</P>
    <P>It is my intention that the group's work be progressed as quickly as possible so that the Government approval in principle can be given tangible effect in terms of an implementation plan and timeframe.</P>
    <P>I will shortly be launching a major new promotional campaign to encourage young people to take up careers at sea and in the marine related onshore services sector, as recommended by the task force. This special £150,000 three year programme, co-financed by the Irish Chamber of Shipping, will generate interest in careers at sea and in marine related services among our young people.</P>
    <P>The Deputy should also be aware that a consultancy review has been commissioned to examine the feasibility of developing the marine services area and increasing the size of the fleet. My Department is working closely with the consultants and the shipping industry in this study task, which I am advised is nearing completion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 38 together.</P>
      <P>In relation to the ports sector, the key policy objective is to support and facilitate the availability of efficient and competitive port services. In the context of the implementation of the Harbours Act, 1996, this policy objective has been given tangible expression through the transformation of the State commercial seaports. Nine of the key commercial State seaports which handle over 93 per cent of national seaborne trade have been corporatised as fully fledged commercial State companies and these are Cork, Drogheda, Dublin, Dún Laoghaire, Foynes, Galway, New Ross, Shannon Estuary and Waterford.</P>
      <P>The port companies are statutorily responsible under the Harbours Act, 1996, for the management, control, direction and development of the harbours as commercial operations. Freeing up the ports from direct State control gave them the commercial freedom needed to operate as a modern, customer oriented service industry, while enhancing accountability for operation and financial performance. There has been significant development in maritime infrastructural works at the commercial seaports with the assistance of EU funding. Co-financing of infrastructural development at the ports comes through my Department, from the EU via the Operational Programme for Transport 1994-1999, the Ireland-Wales Maritime INTERREG Community Initiative and the Cohesion Fund. On completion of the current programme of modernisation and infrastructural development at our key seaports some £163 million, will have been invested in new and upgraded infrastructure and access improvements.</P>
      <P>In general, investment has been directed towards reducing the economic disadvantages of Ireland's peripherality, through improving port facilities and increasing port efficiency. The aim of reducing port-shipping costs by at least 15 per cent in real terms over the duration of the programme, thereby enhancing the country's ability to compete in the EU internal market, had been achieved by 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware how vital ports are to the economy and to keeping trade moving efficiently and on time. The returns from the top 20 ports for 1998 <Col N="1236" /> show that seaborne trade is at an all-time high. Ports throughput in 1998 was buoyant with notably increased traffic. Cargo levels recorded at the 20 key commercial seaports increased by 9.2 per cent from 41 million tonnes in 1997 to a record level of 45.5 million tonnes. Some 4.7 million passengers passed through the four ro-ro passenger ports in 1998 &ndash; Dublin, Dún Laoghaire, Rosslare and Ringaskiddy, compared to 4.4 million in 1997 &ndash; up by almost 6 per cent.</P>
    <P>In order to determine the needs of the ports industry, my Department commissioned independent consultants last year to complete a detailed study on future seaport capacity requirements. As part of the EU national seaport capacity study a comprehensive physical inventory of existing seaport capacity was completed. The expert consultants have determined both the future demand for seaport traffic handling capacity by mode and the consequent infrastructural and organisational improvements which will be required to cater for future traffic. Total projected levels for the year 2007 were estimated at 60.7 million tonnes with 77 per cent of the total projected to move through the three largest ports, Dublin, Cork and Shannon Estuary ports.</P>
    <P>The study also found that the capacity total for Ireland's 20 main ports will increase from 88.9 million tonnes in 1997 to 101.7 million tonnes in 2007. In a projection of surplus and shortfalls of capacity by 2007 some 8.7 million tonnes at various ports, notably at Dublin, Cork and Rosslare was identified. The study is a significant tool in ensuring the development and maintenance of adequate infrastructural capacity at strategic Irish ports to cope with economic growth and to underpin future development plans to deliver that capacity at locations as required. The study points clearly to the need for a further national port development programme which is currently being considered in the context of the National Development Plan, 2000 to 2006. The findings of the National Seaport Capacity study have been communicated on an individual basis to all of the 20 commercial seaports which were the subject of the review. This will facilitate the ports in question, whether in the State or private sector, in determining their future development plans and investment needs to meet the future demands of their customers.</P>
    <P>In relation to policy development on State regional ports, my Department commissioned independent consultants in October last to undertake a major independent review of the State's regional ports and harbours. The study covers 16 State ports and harbours with a commercial traffic of less than 250,000 tonnes.</P>
    <P>The Government's An Action Programme for the Millennium identifies as a key priority transferring small harbours to local control to develop marine leisure activities in the context of securing and enhancing the livelihoods of the coastal communities who depend on the sea for their future. The intention is to develop a general strategic development framework for these ports and har<Col N="1237" /> bours, having regard to their differing conditions and potential.</P>
    <P>All the State regional ports and harbours covered by the study currently operate under the Harbours Act, 1946, and range from those with busy commercial traffic to others catering for a mix of uses including seafishing and marine leisure as well as some which have experienced a severe decline in terms of commercial and seaborne trade. Our objective is to chart the way forward for these ports and set out a long-term coherent and sustainable development plan for their future and for the people whose livelihoods they support as well as identifying the best development options, including local authority control in terms of ownership, financing and activities-operations. The review will be completed in 1999 and its findings published.</P>

      <P>Grant aid of some £167,000 was provided between 1996 and 1998 to Louth County Council for coast protection works at Annagassan. Following the completion of this scheme last year, Louth County Council has signalled that their assessment that an extension of the coastal protection scheme to the north of the area is required.</P>
      <P>I recently announced, under the 1999 coast protection programme, further financial assistance of up to £15,000 to the county council to undertake design and evaluation work for the proposed additional coastal protection scheme at Annagassan. The future funding needs for a costed programme of protection at Annagassan will be fully considered in light of this assessment.</P>
      <P>Expenditure under the 1999 coastal protection programme will be almost £5 million. The represents a fivefold increase in the annual funding available in previous years. This very significant increase in Exchequer support for coast protection schemes underlines my commitment and that of the Government to tackling the serious threat of coastal erosion. I am determined to ensure that our coastline is protected and preserved in its own right and in the interests of those who live and work in coastal areas. In addition to 29 projects being grant aided this year, I have also committed funding to develop a geographical information system, GIS, and for coastal and aerial survey work. The data generated from this essential survey work will critically inform future coastal protection programmes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland has exclusive mineral and hydrocarbon rights over our Continental Shelf as defined under Article 76 of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, which came into force in November 1994. Ireland ratified this Convention in July 1996. My Department has as one of its functions the delineation of the outer limit of Ireland's Continental Shelf in accordance with Article 76.</P>
      <P>The delineation of the outer limit of our Continental Shelf will be done by means of a claim submitted to the United Nations Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf. The claim must be based on scientific data which has had to be collected, processed and interpreted. Our claim could result in an extension of up to 30 per cent of our Continental Shelf. Ireland has ten years from the date of ratification of the convention to submit its claim to the commission. Work has been under way for a number of years and is continuing on the preparation of the submission in support of our case.</P>
      <P>I expect that we will be in a position to present our case well within the timescale laid down, thus consolidating Ireland's claim to potential minerals and hydrocarbon extraction from the area.</P>
      <P>As regards fishermen, it must be noted that the European Union holds primary competence in fisheries matters and that it is not open to a member state to assign unto itself exclusive fishing rights. The effect of an extension of the Irish fishery zone would not be to exclude EU fishing fleets from the zone, although it could have the effect of excluding non-EU fishermen from the extended area. This, of course, could have implications for bilateral agreements between third countries and the European Union.</P>
      <P>Currently, by way of derogation under the common fisheries policy, Irish fishermen have exclusive rights within six miles and there are restrictions on entry by non-Irish fishing vessels between the six and 12 mile limits. The Deputy will be aware of the recent European Parliament Report on the Regionalisation of the Common Fisheries Policy which calls on the Commission to propose that the 12 mile exclusive fishing limit be extended to 24 miles for all member states. The National CFP Strategy Review Group which I have established to inform and assist our negotiating strategy for the 2002 review will be examining the scope for change in relation to the 12 mile limit.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16 and 25 together.</P>
      <P>The recent European Parliament report on the Regionalisation of the Common Fisheries Policy calls on the Commission to propose that the 12 mile exclusive fishing limit be extended to 24 miles for all member states. This proposition reflects the widespread recognition of the socio-economic importance of coastal fisheries for the communities they support. It also reflects concerns about conservation of fish stocks of vital importance to the coastal member state concerned. I fully share those concerns. The national CFP strategy review group which I have established to inform and assist our negotiating strategy for the 2002 review will be examining the scope for change in relation to the 12 mile limit, a more regionalised approach to fisheries management and the position of coastal fisheries as part of its wide ranging brief. In that context the group will be examining the proposals by the European Parliament and their implications for Ireland.</P>

      <P>This is not a matter that comes within the remit of my office. However, I am informed by my colleague, Deputy Michael Smith, Minister for Defence, that the main day to day role of the Naval Service is to provide a fishery protection service in accordance with the State's obligations as a member of the European Union. The service is tasked with patrolling all Irish waters from the shoreline to the outer limit of the exclusive economic zone. These patrols are carried out on a regular and frequent basis and are directed at all areas of Irish waters as necessary. Fishery protection patrols are complemented by assistance provided by the Air Corps in the form of aerial surveillance by the two CASA maritime patrol aircraft. Other roles carried out by the Naval Service, generally in support of other Government Departments, include search and rescue operations, aid to the civil power, drugs interdiction at sea, salmon fishery patrols and assistance with oil pollution control at sea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Naval Service is equipped with a total of seven vessels comprising one helicopter carrying vessel, four offshore patrol vessels and two coas<Col N="1242" /> tal patrol vessels. At present, six vessels are operational and one is undergoing refit. A new fishery protection patrol vessel is currently under construction and is due to be delivered in September 1999.</P>
    <P>Following the Government's consideration of the Price Waterhouse review of the Air Corps and the Naval Service, a planning process is now in place to give effect to the Government's decision in the matter. There are two broad dimensions to this work. First, there is the need to address the military capability requirements to be comprehended within the White Paper on Defence which were not dealt with in the consultants' report. Second, there is a range of effectiveness and efficiency recommendations for implementation in order to ensure that the taxpayer obtains the best air and sea services possible. In this regard, the Chief of Staff has recently been instructed to initiate, in conjunction with the General Officer commanding the Air Corps and the Flag Officer commanding the Naval Service, the necessary process to address these matter. It is hoped that plans for the effectiveness and efficiency measures can be finalised early in the new year.</P>

      <P>My Department, together with the Marine Institute, BIM and the herring industry have been working closely to implement the recommendations of the task force on the management and marketing of herring since it reported to me in March last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The quality training programmes for the dry-hold herring fleet and for the herring processing sector are virtually complete. The industry led herring industry marketing group, has been established and is to develop and co-ordinate sectoral strategies to maximise returns to Irish herring <Col N="1243" /> processing and exporters. BIM is recruiting a pelagic market co-ordinator to facilitate and drive market co-ordination and co-operative strategies for the herring industry, working with the marketing group. BIM advise that an appointment will be made shortly.</P>
    <P>At the March Fisheries Council last year, I was successful in reducing the quantity of herring which could be imported tariff free 1998-99 into the EU. This had been strongly recommended by the task force. I also fought successfully at the December Council against proposals to double the quantity of herring which could be imported at preferential rates of duty. I will be opposing strongly at the Fisheries Council next week attempts by other member states to significantly increase the amount of herring imported tariff free this year.</P>
    <P>The task force recommended that market research and fishing trials should be undertaken to identify new fisheries and optimum fishing times and opportunities for herring in terms of roe, matje and fillet markets. BIM's report on the trials and research undertaken last year will be available shortly, and will inform next steps. I have also provided grant aid towards feasibility R&amp;D trials into alternative loading and unloading systems and technical gear innovations which the task force also recommended in the interests of product quality and economic returns.</P>
    <P>The task force recommended that industry participation in the management of the herring fisheries should be enhanced. This has also been implemented, in consultation with the industry, through the setting up this autumn of committees in the Celtic Sea and north-west herring fisheries.</P>
    <P>The task force recommended that the necessary strategies to deliver and resource herring assessment and survey programmes should be put in place. At my request the Marine Institute has extended its herring catch sampling programme and put in place new acoustic survey programmes. The institute has developed a practical partnership approach with the industry including participation by fishermen in stock assessment programmes. The other recommendations made by the task force are also being actively progressed. These include the development of funded R&amp;D programmes and the carrying out of studies into herring offal use, the investigation into the potential markets for herring milt, management and conservation initiatives for the north-west herring fishery industry, adjustments to the management regime in the Celtic Sea fishery, a review of market support regimes and funding for fish processing projects.</P>

      <P>This question refers to the medical evacuation of a fisherman with an eye injury from the MFV <i>Nozdie </i>on 21 January 1999. There was no delay in responding to this incident and certain media comment in that regard was inaccurate.</P>
      <P>In medical evacuation situations at sea the Irish Marine Emergency Service gives priority to speedy delivery of on scene first aid, life saving, en route support and provision of professional medical attention as soon as possible. In this particular incident, IMES called out Courtmacsherry lifeboat as this was the fastest way to get medical attention to the injured fisherman. It was also the fastest way to get the casuality to professional medical attention ashore as a doctor and ambulance was arranged, by IMES, to meet the Lifeboat on its arrival ashore.</P>
      <P>The Courtmacsherry LB is a Trent Class with a 25kt speed and its estimated time of arrival, ETA, to the scene of the incident was calculated at 37 minutes. ETAs are calculated on the basis of response times plus the fastest speed capability of the various emergency response resources. ETA to the scene of the incident for the marine emergency service helicopter from Shannon Airport was 54 minutes and for the Air Corps helicopter from Waterford Airport was 55 minutes.</P>
      <P>The Air Corps helicopter was on the ground at Waterford Airport when the incident commenced for the marine rescue control centre, MRCC, Dublin. It had earlier that morning carried out training flights in the Waterford area. If the latter helicopter was in the air, at a location closer to the casualty than Waterford airport at the time of the commencement, which is not, its ETA to the casualty could, theoretically, have been earlier. Although not relevant in this case, revised arrangements have been put in place to ensure that the location of the helicopter is reported to IMES at all reasonable intervals.</P>
      <P>As Kinsale was closer to Cork Hospital and 11 nautical miles from the scene, it was decided to land the casualty there and a doctor met the Courtmacsherry lifeboat on arrival. The casualty was immediately treated by the doctor and subsequently transported by ambulance to hospital in Cork.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>Our natural resources already make a major contribution to the national economy and exports.</P>
      <P>The value of exports from working of those minerals for which I have responsibility came to about £90 million in 1997. Galmoy only commenced production in 1997 so these figures do not reflect its full capacity. A third lead and zinc mine is currently under construction at Lisheen in County Tipperary which is expected to go into production by the end of this year. Full production from Lisheen and Galmoy will double the volume of exports of zinc and lead in concentrates.</P>
      <P>The economic impact of the mining sector in the future will depend on the success of exploration companies in finding additional deposits and bringing them into production. It will also depend on factors outside our control such as international commodity prices which not only determine the value of exports in this area but also influence the extent to which companies are prepared to invest in exploration budgets for countries such as ours.</P>
      <P>As regards oil and gas, the two commercial finds made to date, the Kinsale Head and Ballycotton gas fields, have been used to meet national commercial, domestic and industrial requirements and have made a significant impact in terms of import substitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been a number of recent important developments in terms of petroleum exploration and production, namely, the Corrib gasfield, <Col N="1246" /> located off the Mayo coast. In 1998, Enterprise Oil and their partners Saga Petroleum and Statoil Exploration (Ireland) Limited, drilled and tested an appraisal well, flaring gas on test at a stabilised rate of six million cubic feet of gas per day. It is not possible to give precise figures for the size of the gas accumulation at this stage; this will only be possible when the accumulation has been fully evaluated. The evaluation process will involve further appraisal work being carried out over the next two to three years and plans are well advanced to drill an additional well this year.</P>
    <P>Also in May last year, a ten-year petroleum lease was granted to Providence Resources Plc over the Helvick oil field off the Waterford coast. Published figures indicate that it contains an estimated seven million barrels of recoverable oil together with associated gas. Under the terms of the petroleum lease, the company is required to submit a detailed plan of development for the field for my approval by 1 May 2000.</P>
    <P>The south-west lobe of the Kinsale Head gas field, estimated to contain some 50 billion cubic feet of gas in-place, is not being drained by the existing production facilities. Marathon, the operator, are currently planning to bring this into production and have submitted a plan of development for the field for my approval.</P>
    <P>Exploration activity is continuing with 27 exploration licences in place. On Monday 22 March, I awarded two new exploration licences to AGIP Ireland and ELF Petroleum Ireland in the South Porcupine Basin off the South West coast.</P>
    <P>Apart from the benefits which arise directly from the use of oil and gas, exploration and production activities offer the opportunity of significant economic benefits in terms of goods and services. These benefits include employment in the services sector of engineering and technical industries and technical support industries, and other support activity from, for example, the use of service ports by the exploration companies.</P>
    <P>In relation to the forestry sector, Government policy is set out in the Strategic Plan for the Development of Forestry in Ireland, Growing for the Future, which was published in 1996. The overall aim of the strategic plan is to develop forestry to a scale and in a manner which maximises its contribution to national economic and social well-being on a sustainable basis and which is compatible with the protection of the environment.</P>
    <P>Exports of timber amounted to £144 million in 1997, the latest year for which accurate figures are available. I believe that Ireland stands to gain significantly from the development of its forestry sector beyond its current scale. The strategic plan sets out the ideal scale, or critical mass, of Ireland's forestry sector, based on timber production, as an annual production of approximately ten million cubic metres per annum, and preferably between 12 and 15 million cubic metres.</P>
    <P>In the area of Irish seafood, exports have been <Col N="1247" /> increasing steadily from £170 million in 1993 to £228 million in 1997. Further significant expansion in the value of seafood exports can be anticipated and it is envisaged that this sector will make a growing contribution to overall Irish exports.</P>
    <P>Finally, inland fisheries' value in the context of the Deputy's question is primarily in tourism angling. It was estimated that in 1996 170,000 overseas anglers came to Ireland, involving expenditure in the region of £57 million. Indeed angling is the second most important outdoor tourist activity after golf, and extends the tourism season, especially in less developed areas. There is good potential to continue to develop tourism angling which is currently funded by the Tourism Angling Measure of the Operational Programme for Tourism.</P>

      <P>A number of key steps have been taken by my Department in an effort to minimise dangers to marine traffic or rescue operations from the year 2000 computer problem. As previous advised to the House my Department and <Col N="1248" /> the Irish Marine Emergency Service are well advanced in their action programme to address the Y2K compliance issues for IT systems, office equipment and other plant with a view to achieving early compliance.</P>
      <P>All systems and equipment at the various offices and locations have been identified and their assessment in terms of whether or not they comply is virtually complete. All operating systems have been upgraded and non-compliant servers have been replaced. Work has commenced on the installation of upgraded communications links between Dublin offices and remote locations for completion in early April 1999. Outside expertise has been obtained to test and modify PCs for completion by end April 1999. The Department aims to replace any non-compliant items of non-IT equipment, mostly fax machines and photocopiers, by end May 1999.</P>
      <P>In addition to its own facilities for search and rescue response my Department also depends on facilities &ldquo;declared&rdquo; by other organisations. As regards the facilities which have been &ldquo;declared&rdquo; to the Irish Marine Emergency Service, my Department has sought assurances on Y2K compliance from these organisations and is awaiting their Y2K audit results.</P>
      <P>The Y2K issue must be tackled on two fronts, namely in the Department's own search and rescue communications systems and within the marine industry itself. In line with Government action generally my Department initiated an awareness campaign targeting the marine and fisheries sector on the need for plans of action to deal with the Y2K problem. A marine notice issued on 28 September setting out guidelines for practical corrective strategies. The notice sets out a basic strategy which may be adopted in achieving Y2K compliance in the shipping sector. I can assure the Deputy and the industry that we will continue to support and advise in every way possible.</P>

      <P>The proposed removal of gravel from the Codling Bank is part of proposed essential beach protection works at the sea front at Bray. In addition to protecting the sea front there will also be protection for the substantial State investment in rail, telecommunications and other infrastructure in the area and the risk of flooding in the town will be much reduced.</P>
      <P>The proposal, which was made by Bray Urban District Council and was the subject of an environmental impact statement, is for the removal of a maximum of 250,000 cubic metres of gravel from the Codling Bank and its placement on the sea shore at Bray. The gravel is to be taken from an area which comprises approximately 1/800th of the Codling Bank. The whelk fishermen were not among the groups which made objections or observations when the EIS was published. Their concerns were, however, covered in the submission made by the Irish Fishermen's Organisation.</P>
      <P>The objections received were put to Bray Urban Distinct Council and their responses considered. The position in regard to whelk is that they have neither specific spawning nor nursery areas. It is also possible to remove a substantial portion of the whelk from the area in question to an appropriate area before dredging takes place. Before a foreshore licence to allow for the removal of gravel was granted, expert opinion was obtained to the effect that the adverse effects on fisheries would be minimal.  Nevertheless, I have put in place a liaison group which will meet before dredging commences and during and after dredging to rapidly identify and promptly deal with any difficulties which may arise. In addition the foreshore licence granted obliges Bray Urban District Council to ensure that the works will not be injurious to, <i>inter alia</i>, fishing and to carry out a hydrographic survey of the dredged area immediately after dredging is completed and a further hydrographic survey twelve months later. The results of those surveys will be submitted to me for consideration and any action I deem necessary.</P>
      <P>I have met with fishermen from Howth and my Department has also met with a number of fishing organisations under the umbrella of the Irish Fishermen's Organisation. These included the whelk fishermen. I have no reason to believe that there are grounds for concern over the future of our whelk fisheries as a result of the dredging proposed, but I will in any event keep this matter under review.</P>

      <P>Ireland's long-standing position on the common fisheries policy is that our allocated share of fish stocks under the common fisheries policy falls far short of a fair and equitable level. Ireland's case in that regard remains on the table and I will take every opportunity to advocate and advance the case. Apart from the key matter of allocations, Ireland has generally taken the view that while the basic principles of the common fisheries policy are well balanced, there is considerable scope for improvement and change on an ongoing basis.</P>
      <P>I am committed to vigorously pursuing change within the CFP framework which will improve Ireland's position including improved conservation measures and a level playing field on control and enforcement of the rules. The 2002 review of the common fisheries policy will be a key opportunity to pursue change in the interests of the Irish fishing industry. I have therefore established a National CFP Strategy Review Group which will inform our negotiating position in the run up to and during the review.</P>

      <P>The two principal native species in Ireland are the broadleaf species of oak and ash. Under the Government approved Strategic Plan for the Development of the Forestry Sector, the annual target for broadleaf planting is 20 per cent. This target is now being met, the bulk of it from native species, and compares very favourably with the early years of this decade when broadleaf planting was only at 3 per cent to 4 per cent. I am particularly anxious to see a reintroduction of native hardwoods. Under Council Directive 66/404/EEC a national register of seed stands including native oak and ash, is maintained. Applicants under the national afforestation programme are advised where possible to use plants derived from home collected seed from registered seed stands.</P>

      <P>There are no limitations at present under EU legislation on the use of tangle nets. Any such limitations introduced unilaterally under national legislation could apply only to Irish vessels.</P>
      <P>I share the concerns about the potential adverse impact of certain fishing methods, including very long tangle nets, on fish stocks, juvenile fish and spawning grounds. At my recent meeting with the Spanish Fisheries Minister I stressed to her the need for enhanced conservation in the monk and hake fishery and we agreed that officials should review together the scope for additional technical measures which could be taken up with the EU Commission and the other member states concerned. This meeting is being organised for after Easter. In addition, I have asked BIM, the Marine Institute and the fishing industry to work together on new proposals based on the science and practical experience and knowledge of fishermen for improved technical conservation measures in the monk and hake fishery. We will then progress these with the Commission and other relevant member states.</P>

      <P>Under the special scheme introduced with the approval of the European Commission, the licensing and registration position of previously unregistered small fishing vessels is being regularised. Some 600 applications under the scheme have now been approved for a sea fishing boat licence and the remaining applications, numbering some 400, are being processed.</P>
      <P>The granting of a licence under the special scheme is subject, <i>inter alia</i>, to the provision of a survey report which confirms that the vessel is safe and seaworthy, and a licence is not issued unless confirmation is received by my Department that action has been taken to remedy any defects. The scheme represents, therefore, a significant improvement in the safety regulatory framework and in upgrading the safety standards for smaller fishing vessels.</P>
      <P>It goes without saying that high safety standards are essential for fishing vessels, and I am continuing to give the matter high priority in light of the recommendations of the fishing vessel safety review group. Additionally, safety issues will be a crucial consideration in the future enforcement of the provisions of the Fisheries Acts which prohibit a boat from engaging in sea fishing without a sea fishing boat licence.</P>

      <P>This is not a matter that comes within the remit of my office.</P>
      <P>However, I am informed by my colleague, Deputy Michael Smith, Minister for Defence, that responsibility for the prevention of the illegal importation of drugs rests primarily with the Garda Síochána and the Revenue Commissioners while the main day to day role of the Naval Service is to provide a fishery protection service in accordance with the State's obligations as a member of the European Union. During the course of routine patrols Naval Service vessels may be deployed to anti drug smuggling operations. Naval Service vessels are specifically tasked from time to time to carry out drug search and interdiction operations in aid of the civil authorities.</P>
      <P>Existing resources have enabled the Naval Service to respond effectively to taskings involving the prevention of illegal drug importation. Government measures to improve law enforcement in relation to drugs, including the establishment, in 1993, of a joint task force involving the Garda, the Customs Service and the Naval Service, have helped to maximise the effective use of Naval Service resources in combating the illegal importation of drugs. Since the formation of the aforementioned joint task force the Naval Service has been involved in 19 drug interdiction missions. These missions involved the Naval Service operating either in conjunction with the Garda or the Customs Service, or both. Apart from the direct involvement of the Naval Service in drug interdiction missions at sea, Naval Service officers have been called on from time to time to assist the Garda and the Customs Service using their particular expertise in navigation, marine engineering and diving capabilities. Army personnel have also provided assistance in drug interdiction missions on occasions.</P>
      <P>The designation of Naval Service personnel as enforcement officers under the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, has increased the role and effectiveness of the Naval Service in the area of drug interdiction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The strength of the Naval Service is kept under constant review in the light of operational requirements. Eighty four recruits have been enlisted in the service to date in 1998 and arrangements are in hand for the enlistment of an additional 36 recruits. Seventeen apprentices are also being recruited. Twelve cadets are at present undergoing training with the Naval Service and in addition, nine watchkeeping officers have <Col N="1255" /> taken up appointment with the executive branch of the service.</P>
    <P>The Naval Service is equipped with a total of seven vessels comprising one helicopter carrying vessel, four offshore patrol vessels and two coastal patrol vessels. At present six vessels are operational and one is undergoing refit. In December 1997 a contract was placed for the supply of a new fishery protection patrol vessel which is due to be delivered in September 1999.</P>

      <P>Wage rates paid to apprentices are agreed between the employers and the relevant trade unions, and I have no function in the matter. The off-the-job training allowances payable by FÁS are calculated on the basis of the rates payable in each individual trade adjusted downwards by the amount of PRSI normally paid by the individual apprentice. I have arranged for FÁS to forward details of the rates for the different trades to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>In the above context, and taking account of the fact that the rate of unemployment benefit varies according to the social insurance contribution paid, the difference between apprenticeship wages and unemployment benefit will vary from case to case. One of the areas being considered by the Inter-Departmental Group on Implementation of a National Minimum Wage is the treatment of apprentices. I expect to receive the final report of the group in May. When I have finalised my proposals on the national minimum wage Bill, including the treatment of apprentices, I will bring them to Government for approval.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a range of fiscal and social measures permissible under the community guidelines on state aids to maritime transport to facilitate the competitiveness of the EC fleet and the employment of the highest possible number of community seafarers. The guidelines published in July 1997 clarify what aid schemes may be introduced in order to support the community maritime interest.</P>
      <P>These include allowances for accelerated depreciation on ship investments, reserved profits on ships sales linked to reinvestment in ships, corporation tax alleviation measures or replacement tonnage taxes, reduced rates of social insurance and income tax for EU seafarers on board ships registered in a member state, crew relief and shipping investment aid.</P>
      <P>All State aid measures must, of course, comply with notification and approval requirements specified in the guidelines and no aid measures can be put into effect or financial commitments to potential shipping industry beneficiaries entered into in advance of Commission approval.</P>
      <P>State aid measures to help the Irish shipping industry expand both the fleet and Irish seafarer employment include a corporation tax rate of 10 per cent which applies to trading income from certain qualifying shipping activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Capital allowances are available in relation to <Col N="1258" /> certain expenditure incurred on ships and for offset against qualifying shipping, activities.</P>
    <P>A special £5,000 income tax allowance for seafarers, who are at sea on voyages to or from foreign ports for at least 169 days in a tax year, was introduced in the Finance Act, 1998. A provision included in this years Finance Bill will extend this relief to seafarers servicing mobile or fixed rigs, platforms or installations in Irish waters.</P>
    <P>Provision was made in the Social Welfare Act, 1997, which allows for refunds to certain employers in the shipping industry in respect of the employers portion of the social insurance contributions aid in respect of seagoing employees. It is intended shortly to extend this scheme for a further four years to 2004 and to restrict eligibility under the scheme to employers of seafarers on EU registered ships.</P>
    <P>The question of strengthening existing fiscal alleviation measures for the industry is the subject of ongoing review, in full consultation with the Irish Chamber of Shipping and other national representative bodies in the shipping industry, having regard to what is permissible under the EU Community guidelines and competing demands on Exchequer resources.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 52 and No. 53 together.</P>
      <P>Seafish landings have grown incrementally from a level of 226,256 tonnes in 1988 valued at £83,931,782 to 307,987 tonnes in 1997, the latest year for which figures are available, valued at £144,774,096.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fishing opportunities available to the Irish fishing fleet are determined by the actual fish stocks present in EU fishing waters and, for the main economic stocks, by the quotas allocated on a stock by stock basis to Ireland under the total allowable catch and quota regimes of the Community common fisheries policy. Total allowable catches are set each year on the basis of scientific advice on the optimum catch levels to ensure the long-term sustainable exploitation of the resource. Overall, the 1999 combined quotas for pelagic and whitefish species show an increase on the quotas set for 1989 and I am confident that adherence by fishermen to conservation and <Col N="1261" /> management regimes will allow for continuing sustainable development of the catching sector.</P>
    <P>There remains significant scope for continuing development of fishing opportunities by the Irish fleet. Some specific quotas remain under-utilised, in particular nephrops to the south and west of Ireland. In addition, many stocks are not subject to quota including a number of valuable inshore stocks such as lobster, whelk, crabs and razor fish which are giving a high return to Irish fishermen at present. Deepwater species and blue whiting offer further opportunities. My Department is working closely with the Marine Institute as regards scientific advice, and An Bord Iascaigh Mhara as the development agency, to identify further fishing opportunities, to encourage continued sustainable growth and ensure the future for the industry.</P>

However, I am at present considering the many issues relevant to decentralisation policy and I propose to discuss these with my colleagues in Government in the near future. I have noted the case made by you for the inclusion of Kilrush as a location in any new decentralisation programme.</P>

      <P>My Department, through the health promotion unit, has been involved in a number of initiatives in order to improve the incidence of breastfeeding in Ireland including the production of materials encouraging breastfeeding. The National University of Ireland, Galway, with funding from the health promotion unit, has produced a training pack for health professionals which includes a breastfeeding video and information booklets. This pack has been developed by the centre for health promotion studies, <Col N="1264" /> National University of Ireland, Galway, in conjunction with the health promotion unit and An Bord Altranais and is designed to equip health professionals with the necessary skills and knowledge to assist mothers with breastfeeding. It is recognised that the support of health professionals is critical to the success of the national breastfeeding policy as they are the first point of contact for the mother during pregnancy and after childbirth and are ideally placed to ensure that the mother receives information about the benefits of breastfeeding in order that she can make an informed choice.</P>
      <P>The Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative, which is a global campaign led by the World Health Organisation and UNICEF to encourage hospitals and health workers to support mothers to breastfeed, has recently been established in Ireland. Participation in this initiative was recommended in the national breastfeeding policy for Ireland and I am confident that participation in this initiative will result in an increase in the incidence of breastfeeding in this country.</P>

      <P>There has been a substantial investment in the development of services to persons with a mental handicap in recent years. Particular attention has been paid to the development of support services, including respite services, for persons with a mental handicap living at home with their families, so that individuals can continue to live in the community for as long as possible.</P>
      <P>Respite care is provided in a number of ways. In some cases it is provided in a residential setting. It is also provided by host families through the various share a break schemes. The home support services can also provide shorter respite breaks for carers. These services enable agencies and health boards to respond to individual family needs in a flexible manner and with a package of care which is designed in consultation with the carers.</P>
      <P>Additional revenue funding of £12 million is being provided in 1999, with a full year cost of £18 million in 2000, for the development of new services. This additional funding is providing 80 new designated respite places in addition to the development of new residential, day and other support services. The respite care services will continue to be expanded and account has been and will continue to be taken of this need in the allocation of additional resources for the provision of new residential facilities and the enhancement of other schemes which assist families in this area.</P>
      <P>I have requested that the health boards provide me with information on the issues raised by the Deputy in relation to respite services which are provided to young people with a mental handicap in their regions and I will forward this information to the Deputy as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>The detailed deployment of Garda personnel to individual areas is a matter for the Garda authorities who have informed me that the current personnel strength of Youghal Garda station as of 2 March 1999 is 23. There is augmented by personnel from surrounding stations who are deployed to Youghal particularly during the summer months, when the population increases, due to the influx of tourists.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities also inform me that there is a very successful rural policing scheme in operation in the area with two area administrative centres, based at Midleton and Youghal.</P>
      <P>I am further informed that the Garda authorities are satisfied with the present policing arrangements in place in Youghal and do not consider it is necessary to upgrade Youghal Garda station to a district headquarters level or to appoint a superintendent, as the present policing structures in place are adequate to meet the demands placed upon it.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 82 and 83 together.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputies that I recently announced a major new initiative in the special education area under which all children assessed as having special needs arising from a disability will be entitled to an automatic response to those needs. The level and nature of the response in each case will depend on the assessed needs of the child or group of children involved. The response may take the form of a full or part-time remedial teacher, resource teacher or child care support depending on the number of children involved and the nature of their needs. Children with learning disabilities attending schools in question will benefit from these initiatives.</P>
      <P>My Department has written to the board of management of Stratford national school, Stratford, County Wicklow seeking details of the pupils who have special educational needs. The school's application for a resource teacher will be considered once these details have been received.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House will appreciate that each appli<Col N="1274" /> cation for a resource teacher requires careful consideration to ensure that the special educational needs of pupils receive the appropriate level of support. My Department's inspectorate is considering the information supplied by St. Fiacc's national schools, Killeshin Road, Graiguecullen, Carlow, in support of its application for a resource teacher. I expect a decision will be made on this application very shortly.</P>

The question of any future expansion of the service will be considered in the light of experience with the existing service and having regard to available resources.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the representations referred to by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The report of the Special Education Review Committee recommended that pupils with special educational needs who are fully integrated into mainstream schools should receive additional teaching support. The level of support required is determined by the nature and degree of disability of the pupil concerned and the pupil-teacher-ratio for that disability. For visually impaired pupils, the level of support is three and a half hours teaching support per pupil per week. My Department therefore sanctioned seven hours per week additional teaching support to help the school authorities cater for the special educational needs of the pupils concerned.</P>
      <P>I understand that the school in question has failing enrolments and is, as a consequence, losing a teaching post. I can appreciate that the school is anxious to retain this teaching post. However, my Department can only allocate full-time resource teacher posts by reference to the specific support needs of the children with special needs. There are insufficient pupils with special educational needs in Rockchapel national school to warrant a full-time post.</P>
      <P>My Department is considering the school's application for a special needs assistant. I expect a decision will be taken on this application in the near future.</P>

In the current school year, of the 762 schools at second level, 190 schools have been allocated disadvantaged posts and qualify for disadvantaged status on that basis.</P>
      <P>While I have no proposals at present for designating further schools as disadvantaged, I can assure the Deputy that the position of Salesian College, Celbridge will receive full consideration in the context of any future review of the disadvantaged and home-school-community liaison schemes.</P>
      <P>A study of educational disadvantage conducted by the Combat Poverty Agency and the Education Research Centre in 1996 concluded that disadvantage status should be confined to 16 per cent of the school-going population. The study noted that such status had already been granted to 17 per cent of pupils. As an alternative to extending the disadvantaged area scheme to additional schools, the study recommended that available resources be targeted on the most disadvantaged schools.</P>
