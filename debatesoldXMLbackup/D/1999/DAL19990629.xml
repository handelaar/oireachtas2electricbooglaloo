      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The National Millennium Committee comprises the following members: Deputy Séamus Brennan, Government Chief Whip and Minister of State &ndash; Chair; Mr. Richard Holland, principal officer, Department of the Taoiseach; Mr. Peter Barry, former Minister; Mr. Lochlann Quinn, chairman, AIB Group; Mr. Howard Kilroy, Governor, Bank of Ireland Group; Ms Eithne Healy, Chairman, Dublin Theatre Festival; Ms Deirdre Purcell, Journalist/ Author; Ms Patricia O'Donovan, Deputy General Secretary, ICTU; Ms Monica McWilliams, Northern Ireland Women's Coalition; Mr. Derek Keogh, Chairman, Millennium Festivals Limited; Mr. Brian Murphy, Chairman, Office of Public Works; Mr. Paul McGuinness, Manager, U2; Mr. Ronan Keating, Boyzone; Mr. Joe Barry, former Director-General, RTE.</P>
      <P>The National Millennium Committee was established to examine and make recommendations on projects of national significance which could be included in the Government's millennium programme. This programme covers the period 1999 and 2000.</P>
      <P>The committee was also asked to recommend a system for supporting millennium projects at local and community level. In this regard the £2 million Millennium Recognition Awards initiative was recently announced and advertised in the national newspapers.</P>
      <P>On its establishment at the end of last year, the Millennium Committee agreed to a schedule of meetings for 1999. To date, it has met on nine occasions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is appropriate for me to acknowledge an interest in that my brother is one of the members of the Millennium Committee. That said, have any recommendations been made by the committee and will there be tangible results before the millennium arrives?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the committee made four recommendations to the Government which have been approved and a further nine or ten recommendations are awaiting Government consideration. Those approved by the Government are as follows: £1 million to Millennium Festivals Limited; £2 million to the millennium community awards, for local initiatives with maximum funding of £75,000 per project, which is being administered by ADM on behalf of the committee; £2 million to Míle Átha Cliath for its board work and Liffey lights project &ndash; the lighting of the bridges under the Liffey; £80,000 for the millennium book &ndash; the Deirdre Purcell project to have students in schools around the country write articles about the millennium and have them placed in the National Library. That comes to £5,080,000. The matching funding is approximately £9 million which comes from other sources, not from the millennium committee. As well as that there are eight or nine projects: the Irish World Heritage Centre in Manchester, the Banks of the Lee project, Cork Opera House, Share Cork, Gaiety Theatre, the Municipal Gallery, the Green Town 2000, Millennium Last Lights Ceremony, Ecumenical Service, RTE Educational CD-ROM and the Irish Landmark Trust. Those projects, if approved by Government, would amount to about £4.6 million. The matching spending on those from non-millennium committee sources is £24 million. Overall the committee has committed itself, subject to Government approval, to £9.7 million. That has levered out additional matching spending of £33 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the £33 million matching funding coming from lottery or other public sources or is it a mixture of public and private funding? If the Minister of State has that information perhaps he will give the breakdown. On the possible projects that are being considered as distinct from those already announced and agreed, is the Minister of State in a position to outline what he expects will be the end result? What tangible artefacts and events will have been agreed between now and the end of the year when the millennium commences six months and a day from now, other than the parties and the celebratory events which by their nature will be very intangible although they may have a hangover effect?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's first question was about matching funds. The matching funds for the Irish World Heritage Centre in Manchester will come from the UK lottery, the UK millennium funds, the UK Government and the city council in Manchester. The matching funds for the Banks of the Lee will come from Cork Cor<Col N="175" /> poration. The matching funds for the Cork Opera House will come from some trust money which the Cork Opera House has available to it, although I am not certain about the full breakdown. A substantial part of the £3 million matching funds for the Share Project in Cork will come from Cork Corporation and private sources. In respect of the Gaiety Theatre an additional £1.07 million will come from private sources. Funding for the Municipal Gallery, the Francis Bacon studio, will also come from private sources. In respect of the Irish Landmark Trust an additional £600,000 will come from the trust itself which is collected separately by the trust from its other activities. The additional £4 million for the Millennium Festivals Limited would have come from the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation and in regard to Míle Átha Cliath for the Lights on the Bridges the additional £5 million would have come from Dublin Corporation, Míle Átha Cliath having collected some funds from the private sector but not a significant amount.</P>
      <P>In regard to the tangible effects, the committee takes the view that its brief is not to organise end of year parties. Its role is to have a more reflective, meaningful and deeper appreciation of what the millennium is about. It is about the 2000th anniversary of the birth of Christ. It is a Christian commemoration. The people are well able to enjoy themselves on new year's eve without the necessity for Government expenditure.</P>
      <P>We have confined ourselves to consider a range of tangible projects of which we can be proud. For example, with regard to the children's hour, we have asked everybody to donate the last hour of their income to the children's fund. While it is a voluntary matter, we have agreed to make that request and to facilitate it in the public service. It should raise a number of millions of pounds for children's causes.</P>
      <P>It is unlikely all the projects will be completed before the end of the year. The Deputy asked if tangible items, such as buildings, would be completed by 31 December. That is unlikely. Most such projects will run on well into the middle of 2000. The committee elected to consider themes concerned with the environment, recognition and celebration. There are 568 proposals before the committee. Some 121 have been declined, 152 have been sent to ADM for local consideration and a further 296 are currently being processed.</P>
      <P>The millennium recognition awards scheme will be tangible by the end of the year. Under the scheme any local community can apply for an award of up to £75,000 and we expect a few hundred different awards to be granted in that category. The Board Walk and Liffey Lights of Míle Átha Cliath will also take place by the end of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Last Lights Ceremony is being worked on at present. It should reflect the tone of what we are trying to bring to the millennium. It will commence at 4.30 p.m. on new year's eve and people <Col N="176" /> will be able to bring their families. We hope it will take place in every village and town in the country. It will be a poignant, reflective, peaceful and ecumenical ceremony. It will be the committee's main proposal for new year's eve and its purpose is to bid farewell to the last light of the century.</P>
    <P>The Bank of Ireland Group has put up £10 million and launched a scholars' trust in which it will award 600 scholarships over a period. We have talked to the bank about it. The project has been launched and invitations are being sought from students.</P>
    <P>Many of the projects are already in progress. The book has been opened and will be finished by the end of the year. We have had meetings with the churches. Subject to the appropriate mechanisms, the President has kindly agreed to address a joint sitting of the Dáil and Seanad on 16 December on the subject of the millennium. It is the last date on which the Dáil and Seanad will sit for the century. RTE has 60 hours of programmes planned between 1 September and sometime early in the new year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for the comprehensive information he has provided the House. Given that not many Members are in attendance, perhaps he would advise all Members what is being done with taxpayers' money, which has been voted by the House, either directly or indirectly. The bulk of the £33 million, with the exception of British lottery moneys, is, by and large, being provided by other voted moneys in the House. It would be good to know how it is being spent. Has Mr. Paddy Duffy's post on the committee been filled by another nominee?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Starting, I hope, at the end of July, we will be publishing a regular newsletter which will be widely distributed. I will immediately communicate the information I have outlined to Members of both Houses. We wanted to establish many of the projects before circulating information on them, but we will now proceed to do that. There is no proposal to replace Paddy Duffy's position on the committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the recent controversy relating to Mr. Duffy, it transpires he was an <i>ex-officio</i> member of the committee.The membership of the committee comprises people with substantial declared interests. Is there a procedure whereby people absent themselves if there is a conflict of interest, such as their bank or business supporting a particular project, to ensure there is fair play?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to <i>ex-officio</i> membership, Mr. Duffy was not a member of the committee from the date of its last meeting or perhaps a number of days before that. The other <i>ex-officio</i> member is Mr. Richard Holland, principal officer at the Department of the Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="177" /> In regard to interests, I made it very clear at our first meeting, and reinforced it again recently, that they should be declared. Regularly, at the start of meetings, committee members make it clear that they have an interest in, or are directors of, companies involved in certain projects because they come largely from the private sector and I have been adamant that they make the committee aware of anything in which they have an interest. They have been excellent about that. They have done it openly without having to be prodded unnecessarily by me. It is an essential part of the process and I intend to make sure they stick rigorously to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the enduring contribution the committee hopes to leave in terms of our cultural formation, has there been any proposal for the extension of music education in the regions? What is the status, in terms of the different categories outlined by the Minister of State, of the proposal for the State to take responsibility for The Great Book of Ireland, which was produced some time ago on the initiative of Theo Dorgan and Poetry Ireland? What is the status of the proposal for the study of Celtic migration?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are 568 proposals before the committee, many of which relate to music. The following is an approximate breakdown: 20 per cent of the proposals relate to arts and culture; 15 per cent relate to science, technology and innovation; 15 per cent have strong spiritual or religious elements; and 15 per cent relate to children and child care. The rest of the proposals involve a mixed bag of ideas. In terms of an enduring cultural legacy, almost 100 are related to the arts. I do not have the proposal on Celtic migration with me, but I recall a submission on it and I will check it for the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to music education in the regions, the PIANO report identified a line to the west of which there was no musical provision. While I support the general concept of a conservatoire, there was an opportunity to provide the basic institutional infrastructure for music education, identified by Dr. O'Connor in the PIANO report, particularly in the west.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State did not mention the proposal regarding The Great Book of Ireland, which cost £1 million. I am involved in that proposal, but it is likely to go outside the country unless assistance is provided by the State. Another proposal, sponsored by Gaillimh Le Gaeilge and others, including the local authority in Galway, relates to Celtic consciousness, migrations, etc.. I am not asking for details from the Minister of State but I like to think the two specific proposals to which I referred are allied for consideration and, in particular, that it is not too late to consider filling in a missing provision on music education where there is none.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I invite Members to make proposals to the committee. We have tried to conduct our business in a non-political and dignified way to mark this important Christian commemoration. We have had many meetings with the churches and hope to meet local authorities shortly to ensure they can help out locally both during the millennium weekend and throughout the new millennium.</P>
      <P>It is a humorous comment that we have not done this before, and few Members of the House will ever do it again. The celebration of the millennium is uncharted waters and the creation of precedents will not worry us. The committee has tried to ensure the millennium will be commemorated in a dignified way and will leave a legacy. It is hoped that some initiatives can be taken and some projects supported which will have a lasting and meaningful effect. The committee would welcome suggestions from Members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>How many of the 560 projects on the books of the committee directly involve the improvement and extension of the use of the Irish language in the next millennium? Does the Minister of State envisage a similar initiative in the Oireachtas to that in the Israeli Parliament which has set itself the task of improving the use of its national language over a number of years in the parliament? Will the committee give some thought to such an initiative in terms of the projects mentioned by the Minister of State? Perhaps such an initiative is already planned but was not mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will ask the committee to consider the Deputy's suggestion. We met Bord na Gaeilge and discussed how the language could be included and recognised to a greater extent given its importance throughout the ages. We will have further discussions about that. I mentioned the Presidential address on 16 December. This may be a suitable occasion to ensure much more Irish is used in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that this is the 2000th anniversary of the birth of Jesus Christ, will the Minister of State tell the House how he intends to respond to the large number of postcards all Members of the House have received which urge that a particular Christian ethic should be applied to the millennium celebrations and monuments which may be provided? Although I am not among them, I respect that the vast majority of people in this country describe themselves as Christians. Will the Minister of State respond to this issue?</P>
      <P>Will he ask the committee to consider providing a millennium hostel to deal with the continuing scandal of homeless people in this city and other towns as a counter-active measure to the expenditure of £23 million on a luxury mansion for some unknown purpose?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I sought suggestions and I will take the Deputy's point about a hostel on board. I will raise it with the committee at the next meeting. So far we have responded to proposals put to us. We will spend a few hours next week considering if other initiatives could be taken which have not been suggested to date. The Deputy's suggestion could fall into that category and I will ensure it is discussed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps it could be called the Bethlehem hostel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will ensure it is discussed. It is a worthwhile suggestion. So far we have responded to ideas suggested to the committee and more than a third of the funds have been committed. We will now consider initiatives suggested by the committee itself. However, I will ensure that the Deputy's suggestion is considered.</P>
      <P>I discussed the issue of a statue with the churches and local authorities and I asked them to outline their thinking on the matter to the committee. However, I would not advise the committee to embark on any type of religious project without the specific agreement and understanding of the relevant churches. To date, the matter is still under discussion.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Public Enterprise</askee>
      <Quest>if she has concluded the necessary preparatory work for the introduction of public service contracts in relation to the CIE subvention; the timetable for the implementation of these contracts; if this issue is linked to her approval of a fare increase to CIE companies; if she has concluded her consideration of the application for fare increases; and, if so, the outcome in this regard.</Quest>
      <QRef>[16279/99]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The preparatory work for the introduction of public service contracts is well advanced. I hope to be in a position shortly to circulate a draft memorandum seeking Government approval for a contract in respect of services provided by Bus Átha Cliath. Significant progress has been made on three Iarnród Éireann contracts covering railway infrastructure, mainline rail and suburban rail services, and on a contract covering Bus Éireann services. I hope to bring proposals to Government in relation to these contracts later this year.</P>
      <P>I will shortly complete my consideration of applications from the three CIE operating subsidiaries for fares increases. There has been no general round of fares increases for CIE since 1991. I met the CIE unions some time ago to discuss a number of issues. During that meeting the unions urged me to approve an increase in CIE fares. I also recently met the CIE chairman and he too strongly argued the case for an early increase in fares.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister outline the level of fare increases proposed by the three CIE companies? Is it 16 per cent? Will she assure the House that she would be slow to go beyond a single digit percentage increase, in view of the overriding policy objective of encouraging commuters to move out of private cars onto public transport? A massive fare hike would be contrary to this policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no disagreement with the Deputy's tenet that buses and trains should be made attractive in every way in order to encourage people to use them. The proposed increases vary according to the fares, ranging up to 12 per cent. There is no standard increase. I will take on board the Deputy's suggestion that I consider limiting the increases to a single digit percentage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister clarify the position regarding public service contracts? This has been in gestation for four years &ndash; what is the delay? Is <Col N="181" /> a fare increase linked to a conclusive agreement between the Department and CIE on public service contracts? During the recent controversy I suggested the fare increase was being postponed until after the local elections, but a Department spokesman said the sole reason for the deferral was connected with those contracts and the two issues were being taken together. Is that correct or was it merely a cynical device to wait until after 11 June before lashing the increase onto the long-suffering commuter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>There was no cynical device to lash anything to anyone. It will still be some time&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Was the Minister's spokesman correct?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>At this point the two matters are moving together. The method behind the public service contracts is interesting. The Bus Átha Cliath contract is almost ready. It provides that the company will provide all services within its timetable, as amended from time to time, and the Exchequer payment is to be linked to the operation of those buses at peak times on weekdays. The contract specifies the minimum number of buses to be in operation at peak times during different periods of the year. Penalties are to apply if Bus Átha Cliath falls below a threshold of 99 per cent compliance with the provision of the minimum number of buses in peak times. It goes on to outline the further ramifications of that. It is really a case of us providing the money and Bus Átha Cliath providing the services which will be enunciated. I agree with the Deputy that it is taking a long time. They had not been implemented when I came into office two years ago but I believe they are nearing completion. That is probably what the spokesperson was alluding to. There is much contact with Finance on the public service contract obligations as well as with the transport operators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that Dublin Bus receives the lowest subvention from Government of any capital city in Europe? Instead of a fare increase in Dublin Bus, will she consider increasing the subvention to meet CIE's revenue needs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>This year, for the first time in its history, Bus Átha Cliath has 150 new buses which it did not have to provide from its own revenue. We have not worked out the implications but that is equal to a large subvention. We are including in the national development plan yearly increases in the provision of buses for Bus Átha Cliath and others which in turn will be equal to a subvention.</P>

      <P>The future development of the military aerodrome at Baldonnel is primarily a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Defence, in the first instance. Both the Minister for Defence and I have received several proposals on limited development of civil aviation at Baldonnel. I met people in our offices, as did the Minister for Defence who put forward some ideas.</P>
      <P>Any use of Baldonnel for civil aviation purposes is a matter which falls to be considered by me, in consultation with the Minister for Defence, in the context of overall airports policy. In that regard, advisers have been appointed jointly by the Minister for Finance and myself to assist in the examination of Aer Rianta's report on its future strategic direction. It is expected that the advisers will complete their work in the near future. We will then report to Government on that, <i>inter alia</i>, with reference to specific proposals. I do not know what the advisers will come up with and, therefore, it would be pointless to speculate.</P>

Is she aware that the Secretary General of the Department of Defence recently indicated to a Dáil committee that the Department had no principled objection to developing Baldonnel as a commercial civilian airport? Will the Minister agree that, arising from the housing development in the vicinity of Baldonnel Aerodrome, it will be difficult to find a flight path that will not fly over housing development, which would have serious implications for the people who live in them?</P>

      <P>Most times. I met Mr. Tony Ryan in my office and he put forward a proposal. My officials were with me; that seems to be obligatory now. Mr. Ryan left a paper with us. I met another man whose name I was trying to remember as the Deputy spoke. I believe his name is Patrick McBatt or McButt &ndash; I will furnish the Deputy with his name &ndash; and he has land adjoining Baldonnel Aerodrome.

Is she aware that Mr. Ryan went to all the ICA committees, he went to the Irish Countrywomen's Association, to Tidy Towns meetings and to Kildare residents' meetings seeking support for this kind of cracked proposal? I am sure the Minister would agree it is similar to many other cracked proposals he has put forward, all of which were failures until someone else took them over. Is the Minister aware that Ryanair, of which Mr. Ryan was once a substantial board member, though no longer, has no interest in developing a second airport in Dublin? It wants to operate from Dublin Airport as it is.</P>

      <P>Aer Rianta's submission to me last April in regard to the future strategic direction of the company sought the authority to exit from the Great Southern Hotel Group, in a manner determined through a consultative process with the relevant stakeholders. I had a meeting on 20 May last with the regional representative of SIPTU, Mr. Jack Nash, and a delegation of 24 Great Southern Hotel Group staff. I advised them at that meeting that my main consideration would be, of course, to find the right future for the Great Southern Hotels in a way that will also be right for the staff and the Irish tourism industry.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, the board of Aer Rianta has retained Arthur Andersen consultants to examine all the options. In relation to employee share ownership schemes in commercial State companies, I have already stated that such schemes will be considered on a case by case basis with the best interests of each company in mind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister outline her position and that of the Government, not that of Arthur Andersen, on the future of this group? She said in a Dáil debate on this matter that she could not give any position on a single entity until <Col N="184" /> she had met SIPTU and heard its point of view. Now that she has done that and some time has elapsed, will she give a commitment to the House that it is the Government's intention to keep this group together as a single entity? Has she had discussions with CERT? The point was made during the Dáil debate on this matter that standards for the hotel and tourism industries depend on CERT having an ongoing role in this matter. Does the Minister intend speaking to CERT about the future of the Great Southern Hotel Group if she has not done so already?</P>

      <P>The Cabinet has not discussed the future of the Great Southern Hotel Group either formally or informally, so it is clearly not for me to give an opinion now on the matter. I have not yet met with CERT, but when the House rises at the end of this week I intend to do a lot of work in this regard, such as visiting hotels and consulting various agencies and bodies.</P>

Specifically, does the Minister agree with the comments of the chairman at the time of publication of the Arthur Andersen report that the State had no business washing dishes or making beds? Does she concur or disagree with that view? It is appropriate that the Minister with responsibility for this matter state her position. What is her perspective on this matter? She has not been afraid to speak about many other State companies. She favours the IPO option in Telecom Éireann and Aer Lingus. Why is she so reluctant to state her position in this regard?</P>

      <P>No, it was very pleasant.</P>
      <P>The Government has identified the light rail project as a pilot project for a public private partnership approach. Therein, I think, lies the difficulty. Consultations on the Arthur Andersen study are continuing. I will bring proposals to Government when I have completed those consultations and my consideration of their recommendations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whatever decisions are taken in relation to a PPP approach to the light rail project, I am determined it will be implemented as part of an integrated public transport strategy. The recently completed DTO blueprint for the period 2000 to 2006 makes substantial proposals in this regard, including the development of transportation <Col N="186" /> nodes and interchange points, park and ride, feeder and local bus services and integrated ticketing. CIE will be fully involved in, and is committed to, the implementation of this integrated approach.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister surprised CIE is becoming less enthusiastic about this project, given that it was agreed almost ten years ago and has been the subject of reversals and delays, so that we are about to build a partial and unintegrated system? Is it any wonder CIE and the general public are losing confidence in the project and that the Minister for Finance is running scared of the unknown and unknowable costs of tunnelling in the city centre? </P>
      <P>Does the Minister agree there is now a need for clarity? The Minister says she is bringing proposals for a public private partnership to Government. Is it not long past time for a decision to be made? The nature and extent of private participation is unknown and we cannot allow this vacuum to pertain for much longer.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister aware private sector involvement can be successful only if the private sector partner is involved from the beginning in the planning, design and decision-making phase of the project and not merely in the construction and operational process? I know the Minister is very busy with flotations, etc., but where, when and whether we will have a fully integrated and extended Luas system are major questions for Dublin. Will it ever exist? Who will build it? Who will run it? Decisions on these issues must be made now. Will the Minister make these decisions and make them known so an end can be put to the lack of clarity and persistent rumours which are eroding public confidence on a daily basis?</P>

      <P>Four days after I issued a document on the possibilities of public private partnership, which remain huge as there is huge private interest, I received the letter from CIE which expressed these doubts for the first time. I had said that part of the study concerned the potential for the private running of Luas for which CIE could put forward its own proposal and bid like anyone else.</P>
      <P>Ahead of time Mr. Justice O'Leary gave me his report on 17 December. I agreed it ahead of the timetable set out and work on the line from Tallaght to Dublin City centre is beginning at the end of this year. This has been decided and is being done by public contract. It is the only line for which we have a detailed estimate. Ten days ago, again ahead of time, I received the report from Mr. Justice O'Leary and within the next week or ten days, also ahead of time, I will have given my opinion on it. This will then go ahead and work will commence next year. Each of my actions and those of the agencies have been taken ahead of the indicative timetable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first line, from Tallaght to Dublin City centre, was relatively untroubled as, apart from one <Col N="187" /> section, the other adjustments which must be made are matters for local authorities and I think they can be easily overcome.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>Currently there are ten wind farms in commercial operation with an installed capacity of 63 MWe selling electricity to the Electricity Supply Board. A further 20 wind energy projects have been selected to receive contracts from the ESB, subject to certain conditions.</P>
      <P>The third alternative energy requirement competition, AER III, invited applications to develop a wave energy to electricity plant. The information notes advised that European Regional Development Fund grant aid of about £1 million, 1.24 million ECU might be available. The application which was declared successful assumed payment of the grant aid in its costings.</P>
      <P>In the event, the monitoring committee of the economic infrastructure operational programme, which includes the European Commission, decided not to grant aid the project and this decision was conveyed to the winning applicant.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding the withdrawal of grant aid, I offered to nominate the project to receive an offer of a power purchase agreement. The winning applicant has not yet informed my Department whether the project will proceed.</P>
      <P>Proposals to further promote renewable energy technologies, including wind and marine power, will be outlined in the &ldquo;Green Paper on Sustainable Energy&rdquo; which I will publish shortly.</P>
      <P>Detailed cost data on the various technologies is not readily available. The ESB regards such data as commercially sensitive, particularly with the emergence of competition in the electricity market. Information in a recent consultant's report suggests approximate information on the cost of electricity from different sources as follows: coal 2p per kilowatt hour, kWh, combined cycle gas 2p per kWh, oil 3p per kWh and wind 4p per kWh. I am aware that the cost of wind is trending downwards. I do not have reliable information about the production cost of wave energy beyond saying it is more expensive than currently operating wind farms.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I note the continuing reluctance of the ESB to supply information. Would the Minister agree that the more information is available, the better we in this House will be able to decide the form of energy to which we ought to give <Col N="188" /> greater emphasis? Will he accept that competitors invariably know these details anyway?</P>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that the wind energy aspect is proceeding much more slowly than many of us would have hoped? On the other hand the wind energy technology is developing quickly, the average weight of wind turbines has halved in five years, the average energy output per turbine has increased fourfold and moreover, costs have decreased by a factor of ten in ten years. The Minister seemed to be alluding to that when he said it cost 4p per KWh.</P>
      <P>What is the position on North-South co-operation on wave energy and wind energy? As far as I am aware, proposals were being funded under INTERREG II. What have the feasibility studies indicated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the costings, I suppose it is understandable in the age of competition that a company would be slow to come forward with its commercial secrets. In that context, the data which I provided to the Deputy is based on a number of assumptions and that is the best I can do for him. It is pretty accurate.</P>
      <P>I would not agree that there is slow progress being made in the area of wind energy. From a very low base, wind energy has actually forged ahead.</P>
      <P>There is a departmental strategy, which was put in place when Deputy Stagg was Minister of State, to generate energy from renewable sources up to 2010. The strategy aimed to increase the percentage of renewable energy sources to 10 per cent by the end of 1999 and 14 per cent by 2010. In the forthcoming Green Paper which will plan the strategy for the next ten or 15 years, I propose to substantially increase those targets.</P>
      <P>Other measures have been put in place also, such as the fiscal measures announced by the Minister for Finance last year and particularly the Green Paper, on which I am depending, to explore the various options available to ensure that we meet the substantially increased targets for renewable energy sources in the coming years.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Deputy's question on North-South co-operation, there is a good deal of co-operation. On off-shore wind energy, there is an assessment study in process at present. Kirk McClure Morton, Consultant Engineers, Belfast, were commissioned by&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy is aware that the provision of telecommunications infrastructure is primarily a matter for operators in the newly liberalised telecommunications market.</P>
      <P>Recognising that in certain regions competition alone will not provide the required broad band telecommunications infrastructural investment, I recently sought fresh proposals for projects supporting the development of advanced communications networks and services which might be co-funded by the European Union.</P>
      <P>A number of proposals were received, they were evaluated by independent consultants and recommendations have been made. Proposals were not received for the Cavan and Monaghan region in the latest round. Contractual details are currently being finalised with a number of companies and I will make these known shortly.

As the Minister will be aware, both the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment have indicated strongly and consistently that the Border counties need inward investment and that the necessary infrastructure should be put in place to ensure that modern technological industries can be brought to those areas which suffered so much for in excess of 30 years.

Following the invitations we sent out, not one Cavan-Monaghan firm applied. However, that was not the Deputy's point and I understand that.

      <P>To answer the Deputy directly, yes, all of the developmental agencies, the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment are in favour of inward investment in Cavan-Monaghan. The need for broad band connectivity in that regard is well noted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I will shortly complete my consideration of applications from the three CIE operating subsidiaries which have made submissions for fares increases. I met the CIE unions some time ago to discuss a number of issues. During that meeting the unions urged me to approve an increase in CIE fares. I also recently met the CIE chairman who strongly argued the case for an early increase in fares.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that the reason the unions and the CIE chairman are arguing for fares increases is that the subvention being given to Dublin Bus and CIE generally is inadequate to meet the required services? Is the Minister simply flying another kite here? She gave the exact same reply in a statement on 8 December 1998 to the effect that she would announce a positive response in the near future. At that time, the Minister was threatening a 16 per cent increase in fares. Has she had an opportunity to re-examine this matter and consider the possibility of encouraging people onto trains and buses by reducing fares rather than increasing them through the provision of the necessary subventions to CIE? It is vital that we get people out of cars.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that we encourage people to use public transport. I would be surprised by any utility which would not increase its fares for eight years. Except for some increases over which CIE has control, it is eight years since CIE or its subsidiaries increased fares. Taxpayers' money will, for the most part, pay for the 150 buses although there will be some input from European funds. Is it not desirable to invest taxpayers' money in the public transport system? Does the Deputy feel it is proper for a public utility not to increase its fares for eight years? During <Col N="192" /> that time workers have received wage increases on a yearly basis, as is only proper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister seems to be suggesting that it is proper that people who use public transport services should pay for them. Does she agree that the less well off in society comprise the bulk of Dublin Bus users in particular? The same applies to Bus Éireann. Low paid civil servants from the Minister's Department and other Departments use the service extensively at weekends. Does the Minister agree that if people are to be encouraged to remain in a public transport mode, it is unacceptable to increase fares? Will the Minister decide whether she will provide a subvention to public transport in Ireland, either run by CIE or others? Will public transport be paid for by means of subvention or fares? Public transport subventions in Ireland are the lowest in Europe. In some cases, we receive five times less per passenger.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am reliably informed that that was the case until this year, but I am awaiting exact information on that. In some European countries operating companies supply their own buses, as did Bus Átha Cliath until 1999. The national subvention towards the cost of buses increased greatly last year.</P>
      <P>A huge fuss was made when the ESB was not granted the third round of three rates of price increases. I did not grant the third round because the company was making profits in the region of £200 million per year. There has not been any public transport fare increases since 1991.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">

    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell" hpid="Ms O. Mitchell Ms O. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I take issue with that. Does the Minister believe that the provision of new buses necessitates increased subsidies to Dublin Bus? The case has always been made by the company that one of the reasons it did not provide additional buses related to the losses such buses would incur. Additional buses have not been provided as a result of the Government requirement that the company must break even. A genuine examination of whether extra buses would incur losses is required. Public service contracts should be made available in order that we would be aware of what companies make losses and the extent of the subsidy required for the provision of public transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is correct in regard to the public service contracts as we would <Col N="193" /> be better aware of what services are required. Dublin Bus bought its own buses until the recent provision of 150 buses.</P>

      <P>As I already stated in an earlier reply, the future development of the military aerodrome at Baldonnel is primarily a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Defence, in the first instance. Both the Minister for Defence and I have received several proposals, which I outlined earlier, on limited development of civil aviation at Baldonnel. Any use of Baldonnel for civil aviation purposes is a matter which falls to be considered by me, in consultation with the Minister for Defence, in the context of overall airports policy. I am awaiting the analyst's report on Aer Rianta which I will bring to Cabinet. The rest of the reply is basically the same as the one I gave earlier.</P>

      <P>I do not believe there is any necessity for a second airport in the greater Dublin area. Does the Minister accept that an additional airport in Dublin would result in the duplication of infrastructures and facilities? Does she accept that the international experience of two-airport cities does not support the case for a second airport? Given the importance of Dublin Airport in the general development of the greater Dublin area, particularly north Dublin, does the Minister accept that the development of an additional airport at Baldonnel would result in moving jobs from north Dublin to Baldonnel?</P>

      <P>The proposals I received, of which the Minister for Defence also received a copy, did not relate to the provision of a general or commercial airport but to the provision of facilities for private executive jets. The Deputy referred to the experience of cities in which there are two airports. I have noticed that in such <Col N="194" /> instances the smaller airport does not appear to attract the same level of business. Although we are in the early stages, I do not envisage proposals for a major airport but that remains the prerogative of Cabinet.</P>

As I mentioned in my responses to those questions, there are no funds available for a radon remediation grants scheme in 1999.

      <askee>Minister for Public Enterprise</askee>
      <Quest>if she will ensure that there will be no price increase for domestic consumers of electricity for the foreseeable future following the publication of the ESB annual report and accounts; the applications she has received from the ESB for tariff increases for domestic and commercial customers; and her response in this regard.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no application from ESB at this time for a price increase for domestic consumers of electricity. At a press conference held on 25 May 1999 to announce its results for 1998, which were splendid, the ESB confirmed in response to questions that it would not pursue a proposed 3 per cent price increase. Future price increases will be a matter for the new Commission for Electricity Regulation.</P>
      <P>The ESB implemented price increases averaging 2 per cent in 1996 and 1.5 per cent in 1997. A 3 per cent price increase for 1998 has not been implemented. The ESB wanted to apply this 3 per cent average increase by way of a 5.25 per cent increase for domestic customers and below 3 per cent for the commercial and industrial sector.</P>
      <P>The Government at its meeting on 12 May 1998 decided that there was no justification for this increase in light of the very strong financial performance of the ESB. The ESB has estimated that domestic customers are currently being undercharged while industrial and commercial customers are being overcharged. As ESB faces competition in the future, it is necessary to ensure that there is a level playing field for all industry players.</P>

It wishes to raise domestic charges by £16 million to cheapen charges in the competitive market for large customers. What steps will the Minister take to ensure that domestic customers will not have to pay more so that large multinationals will get cheap electricity?</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 and 20 together.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance and I have jointly appointed a team of advisers to assist in the examination of Aer Rianta's report on the future strategic direction of the Aer Rianta group. These advisers are now examining and evaluating the full range of recommendations made to me by the board of Aer Rianta. I do not think it would be appropriate for me at this point to speculate on the possible response until they have finished that job, which they will do in the near future.</P>
      <P>Following that, and in the light of my own consideration of the advisers' recommendations, I intend to report to Government with specific proposals on the future strategic direction of Aer Rianta.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that the Minister cannot tell us now what her or the Government's final decisions will be. However, does she agree it is not in the interests of Aer Rianta, the country or consumers to have a continuation of Aer Rianta's monopoly, or of any other public or private body? Does the Minister agree the approach which should inform consideration of <Col N="202" /> the proposals should be based on that fundamental principle?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what they are coming forward with, and the Deputy accepted that in his question. However, to exchange a public monopoly for a private one is not very good business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree the sale of Aer Rianta will lead to its private ownership and, thus, of Dublin airport? Does she agree that having a private monopoly that is not subject to the Minister in any sense, except in company law, is the worst possible scenario from the consumer's point of view? That would be a ready made opportunity for the abuse of power by such a private monopoly. In the public interest, will the Minister strive to ensure that will not occur?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The points made by Deputies Jim O'Keeffe and Stagg are in my mind. I do not know what the advisers will come forward with and, therefore, I am constrained in giving a decision on the matter. However, it strikes me that exchanging a public monopoly for a private one cannot be the best way to do business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to press the Minister further on the question of a monopoly. As one who is in favour of neither public nor private monopolies, does the Minister agree that, whatever future is being mapped out, this core principle should be borne in mind &ndash;  neither a public nor a private monopoly? Whether it is achieved by way of a second airport at Baldonnel, a separately operated terminal at Dublin airport or by independent regulation, we should not have a monopoly in future.</P>
      <P>I understand what is being considered is the report on the future strategic direction of the company, as produced by the board of Aer Rianta. Why is the Government's consideration confined to the options produced by the board of Aer Rianta? Why is there not a broader consideration of all options, not just those emerging from the Aer Rianta stable?</P>

      <P>In that context, does the Minister agree that if there were an IPO for Aer Rianta, there is absolutely no guarantee the three airports would be kept together? Given that Dublin is by far the most profitable of the three airports, one could not avoid a situation whereby, later on, some private group might decide to hive off Cork or Shannon. This would pose serious threats to those regions. Will that form part of the Government's regional considerations in any future plan for Aer Rianta?</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree that Aer Rianta has been particularly successful at running the airports on behalf of the people? Does she also agree there is a need for further serious investment at Dublin airport and, to a proportionally lesser degree, at Cork and Shannon airports? Will she agree the company has been starved of investment capital by this Government which seems to be on an investment strike in that it will not invest in anything? Certainly it has not invested in any of the State companies since coming to power. Will she agree arising from that, that both the management and the unions in Aer Rianta have opted in desperation for an IPO to get funding for the necessary capital investment at the airport? Will the Minister ensure a majority shareholding is retained by the Minister so that a private monopoly will not run Dublin Airport?</P>

      <P>The appointment of a regulator is the best way of dealing with the economic regulation of airports and, in particular, airport charges. In that regard, I intend shortly to seek Government approval for the drafting of legislation to establish a regulator.</P>
      <P>Provided that the required legislation is in place, I intend to have the regulator appointed and statutorily empowered before the end of this year. As regards landing fees, I am very much aware that the level of airport charges has financial implications for both the airlines and for Aer Rianta in particular.</P>
      <P>Any decision on the future level of landing fees will be taken by the regulator, following his or her appointment, after taking full account of the interests of the travelling public, the airlines and the airports' revenue needs. I am in discussions, as of today, with the chairman of the board with regard to the discounts which are due to be abolished on Thursday, 1 July. This evening and tomorrow I will take part in discussions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a red hot Minister talking. I do not know about regulators being ice-cold. The previous Government introduced Etain Doyle as the regulator for telecommunications. It is good practice to have a regulator for charges. To reply to Deputy O'Keeffe, it is my objective that the discounts to be erased on 1 July should not be erased until the end of the year so that there will be time for the regulatory regime to be in place.</P>

If so, will she say to the chairman that she will be prepared to cover the costs that Aer Rianta will lose if it does not increase its charges? It maintains that because of the loss of duty free sales it can no longer give out discounts.

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">

What I will put to the chairman is that for the remainder of this year, until 31 December, there would be a moratorium on the 25 per cent. One would need to be Einstein, and even he would have difficulty, to understand the convoluted array of discounts, rebates and so on. By the end of the year the 25 per cent will be of benefit to all airlines, Aer Lingus, Ryanair, CityJet etc., and they will stay in place until 31 December 1999. By then the regulator will be in place.</P>

      <P>Regarding the confusion which has arisen following the last minute changes made by the Government to the Order of Business, which were not communicated to my office, there is a danger in this provision, and the one which probably will be before the House tomorrow, that the plenary session of the House is attempting to dictate to a committee when it should terminate its business. I ask the Minister to elaborate on the thinking behind this provision before a precedent is set which would enable the House from time to time to unilaterally dictate when a committee should terminate its business by way of a guillotine motion.</P>

      <P>The Minister knows that is not my point. He deliberately did not read into the record the information on the piece of paper he had in his hand. A proposal for a guillotine is being contemplated. It was altered twice in the last hour and it may surface again tomorrow depending on the outcome of discussions today. In relation to No. 2, on which the House may divide, is a precedent being established which will enable the House to dictate to committees when they should terminate their business? If the House votes in favour of this proposal, will a precedent be established which will validate a guillotine motion tomorrow morning?</P>

Deputy Bruton raised the issue of the completion of the Bill. This matter is still being discussed and I understand that while the House was dividing, the committee made further arrangements to provide for extra time tomorrow for the Bill along the lines we discussed earlier.

      <P>There are two outstanding Bills which the beleaguered Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has yet to bring forward. The first relates to human rights, which is a requirement under the Good Friday Agreement. It was the subject of embarrassment for the Minister of State, Deputy Flood, in Dublin Castle at the weekend and gave rise to the criticism of Professor Brice Dickson, the chief commissioner of the human rights commission in Northern Ireland. In view of the lamentable failure of the Government to bring forward legislation as distinct from circulating the heads of a Bill, when will the legislation be introduced?</P>
      <P>Regarding legislation on our obligations under the Good Friday Agreement, when will the amendments to the 1956 Irish Nationalities and Citizenships Acts be brought forward? Will the Minister explain what, if anything, is going on in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform?</P>

      <P>In page 6, to delete lines 1 to 4, and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;combined heat and power' means the simultaneous production of utilisable heat and electricity from an integrated thermo-dynamic process where the overall process operating efficiency, based on the gross calorific value of the fuel used and defined as the ratio of energy output usefully employed to the energy input, is greater than 70 per cent. and where the integrated thermo-dynamic process satisfies such technical, operational, economic and environmental criteria as may be specified by the Minister from time to time, following consultation with the Commission;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment follows from a commitment I gave to Deputies Yates, Stagg and Sargent on Committee Stage on 12 May, the first day of Committee Stage. We agreed that a new definition of &ldquo;combined heat and power&rdquo; would be worked out which would give a firm indication to the industry of the definition of CHP but which would leave some scope for flexibility for the commission to take account of technological developments in the future. The Bill is now to be amended by inserting the new agreed definition which has been worked out with the help of the sustainable energy division in the Department, in consultation with the Irish Energy Centre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the approach of the Minister and her officials to the dialogue that has taken place between Committee and Report Stages. In particular I welcome the Minister's amendments Nos. 2 and 13 and I am happy to withdraw amendments Nos. 3 and 4 in my name. <Col N="221" /> On Committee Stage it was proposed that CHP would be defined at a future date by the regulator. I found that all groups, regardless of their perspective on CHP, were opposed to that because it created an air of uncertainty. The Minister has opted for the 70 per cent thermo-efficiency ratio while dropping the 30 per cent ratio I had proposed for the heat requirement. I am prepared to accept that, however, because it is a major step forward in an attempt to define it.</P>
      <P>Does amendment No. 13, which is being taken with this amendment for debate purposes, open a Pandora's box in that the 70 per cent ratio could be changed at any time? Perhaps the Minister would outline the circumstances whereby it would be redefined from 70 per cent? In other words, does this create a new uncertainty or is it only in very prescribed circumstances? We have rehearsed all the arguments. We have come up with a definition of CHP, and I am prepared to withdraw amendments Nos. 3 and 4 on the basis that amendment No. 2 in particular is a major step forward.</P>

What lobbying does the Minister envisage taking place &ndash; I am sure it would be intense &ndash; if it came to the point where she altered the terms of CHP definition?

      <P>On behalf of the officials I thank Deputy Yates for his kind words and note that he will withdraw amendments Nos. 3 and 4. Amendment No. 13, which we are discussing with amendment No. 2 for debate purposes, leaves some scope for flexibility with the commission but it is to take account of technological developments in the future. This amendment provides that the Minister of the day may, by order, alter the efficiency ratio of 70 per cent in the definition of combined heat and power. If 70 per cent proves too high, it can be lowered and if a technology change so requires, it can be raised to encourage the most efficient ratio. It is not to do with the 28 per cent but with efficiency of operation.</P>

      <P>I am concerned that this new subsection will invite trouble. If the Minister had said she could vary the ratio upwards, that would be fine but all the expert advice we have available to us would indicate that 70 per cent is a reasonable figure. There is no possibility that the technology will get worse. The Minister is unintentionally inviting people to come in and make a case for having it reduced. I suggest the Minister should look at this again, though I am not sure when. She should include &ldquo;greater&rdquo; and leave out &ldquo;or lesser&rdquo; as that would remove the possibility of pressure to reduce this so that this false CHP could get into the market again, when we think the Bill excludes it.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 6, between lines 16 and 17, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;electrical contracting industry' means the industry of all electrical contractors in Ireland;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I regard this as a very serious defect in the Bill and a matter the Minister did not see fit to accept at any stage. She said she would discuss this with the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, but I have received very disturbing representations from the Register of Electrical Contractors of Ireland on this matter. Statistics show that almost 500 fires in households are caused by faulty wiring. One must get a RECI certificate before the ESB will connect a commercial premises. The Health and Safety Authority has some role in policing working conditions, but living conditions in houses are not subject to control. The Minister or I could set up a group to give out certificates without any controls being placed on us. This is self-regulation and any contractors who do not want to adhere to RECI's high standards can set up their own regulatory body.</P>
      <P>This amendment proposes to give the commission a role in this matter. The Minister says that the commission will only look at the economic and commercial aspects of this matter, but Ms Etain Doyle, the telecommunications regulator, has found gaps in that sector. This amendment addressees a genuine concern in the interests of safety and putting houses on the same footing as workplaces. Amendment No. 6 seeks to define the electrical contracting industry and an electrical contractor. Amendment No. 15 seeks to ensure that the electrical contracting industry operates to the highest possible standards. It does not prescribe what the rules may be, but this is a pass the parcel situation between the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Department of Public Enterprise. I feel strongly that this matter should be taken seriously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Yates is right. This is a pass the parcel situation. The Tánaiste wrote to me about this and I replied in what I would call a game of pass the parcel between our Departments. I do not feel it should be the responsibility of my Department and Deputies will say, &ldquo;You would say that, wouldn't you?&rdquo;, but the Tánaiste does not feel it should be her Department's responsibility either. The Health and Safety Authority has some expertise in this area whereas my Department does not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Yates referred to domestic dwellings, but from my time on local authorities I understand that local authorities have the right to ensure wiring in local authority dwellings is to a particular standard. I know they insist on repairs <Col N="224" /> being carried out to those standards. I have not spoken to Mr. Tom Reeves since he became regulator, as I do not think it would be proper, but the regulator has been speaking to officials who have conveyed to me his opinion that this should not be within his remit. He has an economic focus and concentrates on opening markets and defining eligibility, which is necessary work.</P>
    <P>The officials and I discussed these amendments this morning and I am not satisfied by the pass the parcel arrangement. It is turning a blind eye to the matter. RECI has contacted me as well. I have not discussed this matter with the officials, but there will be another electricity Bill in the autumn which will deal with those parts of the directive not dealt with by this Bill. By the time we debate that Bill I will seek to have the situation regarding RECI resolved. It is not good enough to leave this hanging.</P>

      <P>The considered position of the Tánaiste's Department is that this is not a health and safety matter at work so it will not deal with this. The ESB says it has no responsibility beyond the meter. However, the chairman of the ESB has said that the regulatory situation is far from satisfactory. I think the Minister will agree it is not good enough that the public must endure a system, designed to ensure their protection and safety, that is far from satisfactory, to use the words of the ESB chairman. There will be a serious fire in a house because its wiring is not up to the RECI standard. I will withdraw amendments Nos. 5, 6 and 15 and will put them down again for the next Bill. I am glad the Minister has accepted that unless she puts the boot in on someone, this matter will continue to float. I withdraw the amendments based on the Minister's good intentions, but I press her on it because this is a genuine issue of public safety.</P>

However, this definition does not deal with district heating. Users of district heating schemes, whether tenants in a block of flats or a local authority housing scheme, would not be the main purchasers of electricity, while they would be the main purchasers of heat.

      <P>This amendment fulfils a commitment I gave Deputy Sargent on Committee Stage. I agreed that the commission would have a duty to advise the Minister on sustainability and Ireland's international environment agreements. Deputy Sargent's Committee Stage amendment mentioned Local Agenda 21 and the Kyoto Agreement on Global Climate Change. We agreed that specific mention of such agreements was not advisable since they could be superseded by other agreements. I agreed to follow the spirit of Deputy Sargent's amendment.</P>

This would not have precluded other agreements. We should consider the agreements into which we enter. As it is the practice to write them in lower case letters, there is a danger they will be ignored.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins (Dublin West)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would welcome any advice the Minister could give on the impact of electricity generation in relation to sustainability. The amendment should refer specifically to the issue of incineration as part of that process, as there will be a dispute as to whether incineration as a means of generating power is a sustainable activity. In time this will become very controversial in Dublin and throughout the country. Because of this, incineration, which is a very dangerous means of waste disposal and which will be discussed in terms of heat and power, should be referred to. The Bill should be specific as there is clearly a very strong lobby trying to get incineration up and running and which uses various covers, including the generation of energy through incineration. The generation of energy must not override the huge concerns of communities about incineration and the very serious dangers of environmental pollution which result from it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>We are dealing with various types of incineration in the creation of electricity. We incinerate turf, coal, oil, gas and biomass which we grow specifically for the purpose of burning. We also incinerate chicken litter and mushroom waste. There are objections to incinerating domestic refuse. There are clean streams of domestic refuse which do not have the negative effects referred to by Deputy Higgins. There are proposals to incinerate toxic waste and the problem arises in this area. Nothing in the Bill will encourage or facilitate such incineration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins (Dublin West) Mr. Higgins (Dublin West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins (Dublin West)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Stagg is correct in saying there is nothing in the Bill which explicitly encourages incineration. However, there is nothing debarring it either, and this is the point I am trying to make. It is clear that incinerators, depending on the material being incinerated, can release cancer causing and toxic chemicals, including heavy metals such as arsenic, lead, etc., from their smoke stacks. This is a crucial issue for communities. I do not know if the Minister is aware of the huge lobby which exists. The issue is one of waste disposal but it is relevant here because incineration is being discussed in combination with electricity generation. Because of this, the matter should be dealt with in the Bill. In view of the studies which have been carried out in many countries, which show serious health effects resulting from incineration, the Minister should have ruled it out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is favourable to privatising electricity generation in the same way as it is privatising, selling and flogging every other State asset to what will eventually become multinational concerns. These people are driven only by profit, and the well-being of the communities which will endure the down stream effects are not being taken into account. If the Minister was really dealing with sustainability and environmental considerations from the point of view of <Col N="229" /> the community, what I am suggesting would have been made explicit in the Bill.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(<i>e</i>) to provide a consumer complaints service for all matters relating to the generating, supply and distribution of electricity.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will be brief in my comments as I want to facilitate adequate debate on all sections. This provision seeks to have a customer complaints service. Since Committee Stage I have examined this <Col N="231" /> matter further and was referred to the ESB's customer complaints arbitration service. Outside the scope of the only existing arbiter are: ESB retail, ESB finance electric, ESB electrical contracts, including public lighting, power generation, national grid businesses and a series of other points on page five of the complaints' commissioner's report. If a customer has a complaint, he or she cannot go to the Minister, the regulator or anybody else. I am prepared to look at this in the context of a new Bill but the Minister should accept amendment No. 16, which would deal with the deficiencies which the complaints' commissioner acknowledges in his first annual report are beyond his scope.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>On 18 May we talked about this on Committee Stage. I am keen that the issue of supply to customers other than eligible customers will be dealt with in the next Bill which will complete the implementation of the directive. That Bill is already in gestation. That will form part of that Bill.</P>
      <P>This Bill is initially about the 28 per cent and clearly they will have macro issues. Once it is passed and we move on to the main directive, I will provide for a section which relates to a customer complaints' service which will come into operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>This issue was discussed earlier. Where we effectively hand over monopoly powers in some areas it is important that there be a customer complaints' service. The Minister's sets out the most valid way of having this.</P>
      <P>A major lacuna in law in the past 15 years is that we excluded the commercial and non-commercial State sponsored bodies from the remit of the Ombudsman. It was a dreadful mistake because it meant one could not ask a question here or anywhere else. I am pleased with the model the Minister is proposing. Deputy Yates's concern is a valid one but the Minister's response is the most obvious, and the best one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's remarks and will withdraw amendment No. 16. I take the Minister's point that when we move towards a position where 100 per cent of customers will be eligible to shop around, it will still be an ESB monopoly in terms of transmission and supply. We are only talking about competition for generators. There is an acknowledged series of areas for which there is no service. I hear many complaints about Etain Doyle's operation, that she has no consumer complaints service worth talking about. I understand there will be legislation to deal with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that when the section comes, it will not be minimalist and will deal with things, like power cuts over Christmas when the storms blow, how quickly people are entitled to have their service back, to complaints about the metering of bills. We hear of difficulties with premium rate <Col N="232" /> calls from Telecom Éireann where people hotly dispute their bills. In some cases such people take their complaints to the Ombudsman. This section should not be an adjunct of the next Bill but a principal section and covering an area where, as the State has reduced ownership of these companies the Minister will not be accountable as there will be arms length regulation from the legislators, and there will be proper accountability in terms of a customer complaints' service. On that basis I will withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(<i>c</i>) does not discriminate unfairly between producers of electricity from renewable, sustainable and alternative sources and producers of electricity from fossil and carbon fuels, and&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is quite similar to amendments Nos. 18 and 19 but it makes a different point which I ask the Minister to take into account. I will not press the amendment to a vote. When we are talking about discrimination, which the Minister acknowledged on Committee Stage is needed from time to time in the interests of public service obligations or general fair play, there is a point to be made between electricity generated from fossil fuels and from renewable sources in that the cost of producing electricity from renewable resources would tend to internalise the overall costs of pollution, health effects, etc., whereas those producing electricity from fossil fuels would currently be able to operate without the downstream health or pollution effects which were mentioned in international agreements and obligations we have as a country. That is why I ask that the discrimination be in place to take into account the externalities in electricity generation which are borne by the renewable sources, given that wind power and wave power do not involve emissions. If we are talking about fair discrimination, I ask that this be a subject of consideration.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(<i>e</i>) to require that the system operator gives priority to generating stations using renewable energy sources when selecting generating stations.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>During our discussions on Committee Stage, there was a considerable level of agreement on the need to ensure the viability of renewable energy sources by requiring that the system operator would give priority to generating stations using wind or wave power when selecting generating stations. That was based on the commonsense understanding that it is not possible to control energy sources such as wind or wave. Therefore, it is essential to take the energy when it is available. The system operator should accord priority to such power stations. Can the Minister ensure that through the acceptance of this amendment or through some other means?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Put simply, wind energy stations want to ensure that when the wind blows, their electricity will be used. If the wind were to blow from 9 p.m. to 12 p.m. on a Thursday night and the ESB were to say it did not need the power because it was full to capacity, then God help the wind people. The Minister previously stated that if the ESB were to use a more expensive electricity source, it would have to have some mechanism of surcharging it.</P>
      <P>Section 8(5) states that &ldquo;without prejudice to subsections (3) and (4), it shall be the duty of the Commission .&rdquo;. If we are serious about wind power, the wind generating stations should be given something of a leg-up.</P>

      <P>I support the general thrust of amendment Nos. 27 and 28. This matter also affects small hydro schemes which will have better electricity production rates when water levels are high. The schemes are very renewable as the water goes down the hill, evaporates and comes up the hill again. The wording should not focus <Col N="237" /> on wind power alone. The term &ldquo;renewable energy sources&rdquo; would be the correct one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The electricity directive allows member states to impose public service obligations on the system operator. There will be a cost involved as renewable energy source stations are usually more expensive than others. In effect, the obligation is a public service obligation and section 38 gives the Minister of the day the power to impose such obligations.</P>
      <P>It would not be appropriate to place the duty on the commission without making provision for the payment of the public service obligations involved. I recall what Deputy Stagg's acquaintance at the treasury holding informed him when he said to forget about the amendment because someone would have to pay the public service obligation. This amendment would clearly involve the imposition of a public service obligation and provision would have to be made to pay for that. Section 38 confers power on the Minister to impose public service obligations. I appreciate that the imposition of such obligations would give a leg-up to the stations in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The logical extension of the Minister's argument is that the ESB's dispatcher could decide that, because it is too expensive to use wind in the generation of electricity, it will not be used. The previous Government introduced a provision in 1996 under which anyone who wants to can link up to a renewable energy source. The ESB, however, has refused to facilitate anybody. The logical extension of the Minister's argument is that the PSO could be used to stop the ESB using wind in the generation of electricity. We are talking about a small proportion of the overall uptake. Perhaps the matter can be dealt with in another Bill, but an imprimatur should be given to the regulator to instruct that the lever be switched when the wind is blowing. The question of who will pay can be dealt with later.</P>

      <P>When people talk about the cost of using wind in electricity generation, they never mention that there is no pollution. This should be factored in. It is an essential safety net for those who generate electricity using renewable energy sources. Unless they are given priority, they will not get in. There are no public service obligations involved. As the Minister of State said, those who use wind in the generation of electricity are improving their methods with the result that shortly it will not be more expensive.</P>

    <P>On Committee Stage Deputy Stagg expressed concern about the wording of the subsections and the ability of renewables or CHP suppliers to supply top-up electricity to their customers.

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>These amendments relate to section 13 which upset me so much that I voted against it last week. This matter featured in the discussions with the civil servants. The Minister's amendments represent substantial progress. The ESB has indicated that my amendments would have the effect of obliging it to provide low cost electricity to an independent. I can offer an example of the converse of spill. Let us say I am providing electricity to Deputy Stagg and he wants 40 megawatts but I can produce only 30 megawatts. The ESB would be obliged to produce cheap electricity for me to sell it to him and I would have a guaranteed profit margin on the ESB's electricity when selling it to Deputy Stagg. I do not want to do that. I accept that point.</P>
      <P>The point I am trying to make is that Deputy Stagg would not buy the electricity from me because I would be unable to meet his full requirements. The ESB's response would be predictable. Will amendment No. 29 have the effect of ensuring, without going as far as I had proposed in amendment No. 30, that where somebody cannot meet the full need, the ESB will be obliged to produce the balance of the electricity? Let us look at the converse, where Deputy Stagg wants 40 megawatts and I can produce only two. The result would be the rape of the ESB for 38 megawatts at a cheap price while I make a profit from selling it on. That is not what I meant to do.</P>
      <P>Does amendment No. 29 meet the objective of providing for a dual supply on a fair basis? I will be happy to withdraw my amendment on the basis of the Minister's assurances.</P>

      <P>With regard to amendment No. 29, I acknowledge that we covered a good deal of territory in this regard last week. Amendments Nos. 29 and 33 make it clear that suppliers will be able to supply top-up electricity to their customers in accordance with the trading mechanism to be developed by the commission under section 8(1)(<i>c</i>). Amendment No. 30 could be withdrawn in favour of amendment No. 33. This amendment is intended to address concerns expressed about suppliers' ability to obtain top-up electricity. I undertook to address this issue and emphasised that top-up and spill would be dealt with in the trading mechanism.</P>
      <P>The licensed suppliers will be responsible for meeting the contract needs of their customers. Any imbalance between the production of the supplier and the demands of the customer will be met by buying supplementary electricity or selling surplus electricity through the trading mechanism. We had nearly arrived at that formula in the discussion on Committee Stage but we did not have it in the correct format. There is general agreement among present and prospective suppliers about the composition of the trading mechanism. Amendments Nos. 29, 30 and 33&mdash;</P>

      <P>This amendment arises from a commitment I gave last week that a mechanism to enable the Minister to place a cap on the amount of CHP would be inserted into this section. This amendment would mean the Minister of the day can impose a cap on CHP so that there will be no possibility of CHP expanding too quickly and opening the market significantly over the 28 per cent mark. It takes out the limit on the renewables but inserts it on CHP.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>If Aughinish Alumina built a power station and had a surplus of electricity, there would be a basis on which it would be bought back by the ESB at the spill price, which could be half the price at which they would sell it to eligible customers. The Minister has segregated other renewables from CHP, but has she met the other point?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>The other point in my amendment was to seek to give comfort to CHP where it would have excess capacity over the amount it supplied on an occasional basis, so it could be spilled into the system. I looked at the trading mechanism and we had a long discussion outside the committee with the Minister's officials. The discussions were most helpful. Arising from that, I see no need for a spill mechanism because of the trading mechanism that is now in place.</P>

      <P>What does the Minister have in mind as a possible range of ceilings? I received one set of briefings to say that CHP would be in the order of 5 per cent of the market, but 5 per cent of 4,000 megawatts is 200. Does this make it a non-runner for Aughinish Alumina? The Minister has made the point that the spill provision is there &ndash; the surplus of electricity will be bought back but it will be subject to an overall ceiling. That is the Minister's compromise. What indicative megawatt figure is the Minister talking about, in that this will determine if there is Aughinish Alumina co-generation? Is it 50 or 250?</P>

There should be sufficient flexibility, without distorting the electricity market, for the benefit of CHP. If an individual project makes economic sense, given the amount of steam, heat or waste energy that goes up a chimney, the Minister should consider it.</P>

The original section 27(1) referred to an entitlement to buy electricity. The issue of the supply of electricity is now dealt with in section 13 and section 27(1), which is amended, does not refer to entitlements.

      <P>This amendment would enable the board to impose different charges on different electricity suppliers for the use of transmission. Costs for connection should be on a cost reflective basis. Section 33(7) places a duty of non-discrimination on the ESB in dealing with the provision of access to the transmission. This provision meets the requirement of the electricity directive. As the ESB will be granting access to its own generating station as well as to those of its competitors, it is important that it be required to comply with a statutory duty of non-discrimination. In page 27, line 29, after &ldquo;charges&rdquo; the Deputy seeks to insert &ldquo;in respect of the various classes and categories of primary electricity supplier&rdquo;.

      <P>The amendment gives the commission the power to allow a person to construct a direct line where it is satisfied the person can build the line more economically than the cost quoted by the ESB. This does not compromise the specification of the line. Its main impact is to ensure the ESB's quotations are disciplined by the knowledge that an alternative is available to the applicant. The ESB can often provide an exorbitantly high quote to connect a house. The mechanism proposed by the amendment would provide a discipline and enable a supplier to provide electricity at a cheaper rate.</P>

It was remiss of me not to refer earlier to the officials who accompanied the Minister today. Not only were they present to advise and assist her but we met them between Committee and Report Stages and that facilitated both the acceptance of amendments and the easy passage of the legislation. It was improved by the process.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with Deputy Stagg's remarks. It has been a privilege to work on the Bill with colleagues, the Minister and her staff. She displayed extremely mature flexibility and her ability to accept amendments reflected her mastery of her brief. It is to her credit because many of the amendments which were accepted will be extremely welcome. Many people pioneering in the area of renewable energy will breathe a sigh of relief that a number of amendments were made which will hopefully be implemented following the Bill's acceptance by the Seanad and the President.</P>
      <P>However, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government has a job to do in terms of the waste hierarchy so that we can be genuinely proud of the renewable energy which will be developed and it will not be a source of damage or embarrassment internationally. To that extent, I thank the Minister and her officials for their work, particularly in making time available to meet Opposition spokespersons. It was much appreciated.</P>

      <P>I concur with Deputies Stagg and Sargent regarding the Minister's officials, to whom I referred earlier. I put on record my appreciation of the Minister's approach to the Bill. Throughout its passage, she has been patient, flexible and pursued an agenda of consensus and common sense. I appreciate that because it is much more rewarding for Opposition Members. Having been a Minister, I am aware that in all briefs one is advised to say &ldquo;no&rdquo;. Essentially, it is a frustrating and arduous exercise to pursue amendment in Opposition without massive resources and back up. It is much more satisfying to feel one is making progress in the passage of a Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="254" /> At the outset, my objective was to tip toe through the minefield of vested interests, ensure the customer got a better deal and that there would be orderly competition. We do not know what the outcome of the legislation will be or whether there will be 15 licensed operators or one additional operator. I hope there will be orderly development and that the ESB will continue to prosper but that there will also be some level of competition both in terms of renewables and elsewhere in the industry. I also hope a market in deregulated electricity will be developed which will be a model for the rest of Europe.</P>

      <P>I join colleagues in thanking the Minister for her courtesy and co-operation during all Stages. She listened attentively and generously accepted meritorious points, which was important. Her officials were absolutely splendid and most co-operative. All my colleagues have put a great deal of effort into this debate and a considerable number of people have helped in a voluntary capacity. I also thank Deputy Yates, although on occasion we might not have seen eye to eye, but we reached agreement.</P>
      <P>The Bill is important for the midlands and the Minister addressed many of the concerns of people living there. The competition era approaches and, while it will be new for the ESB, I am certain it will have the ability to cope and develop in the future. We are looking after the consumer and not just those employed in the industry. The Bill will ensure consumers receive a much more competitive price and it will be of great benefit to them. It is splendid and I hope it works out as such.</P>

      <P>I thank all speakers, not just for this evening's debate, which was very productive, but for the debate during all the previous Stages of the Bill. Like many of them, I learned as the Bill was going through the House. One should be able to stand up and say one understood the Bill from its inception; I did not. It was an educational exercise for me in that it was a matter of doing one's homework and mastering the amendments and the brief as one went through it. The Bill was so complex that it could not be absorbed. Clearly, if one were to deal with it in that fashion, one's mindset would be to say &ldquo;no&rdquo; to every amendment. If one understood everything, one would not agree with any proposal put forward by others. I have always believed, since the day I first entered the House, that ministerial offices do not possess all the knowledge. How could they, given that all of us are human? Therefore, if proper, interesting and suitable points are made during debates, despite the sound advice one receives, one should not always accept it. In general terms, however, I take it.</P>

It was a most enjoyable experience because each meeting on Committee Stage was better than the previous one. Each of us gained more knowledge about the Bill between meetings. Deputy Coveney was extremely interesting and interested in the debate at two such meetings and it was a learning experience for him.</P>
      <P>A number of interesting issues and people were unearthed during the debate, which demonstrated how other sectors of society operate and which will have repercussions for future Bills. I was not aware that people were foolish enough to write letters, such as those which appeared in the newspaper, and call people collective names which I shall not repeat.</P>

    <P>is of the opinion that at current and foreseeable rates of growth in housing demand, Ireland is facing a housing and infrastructural crisis; and calls on the Government to tackle the looming housing and infrastructural crisis as a single project and to produce a national infrastructure and settlement plan which would decide future development patterns, to be under the aegis of the Department of the Taoiseach and be invigilated on a weekly basis by him, so that all our people are housed in places that are accessible to where they work.</P>
    <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Dukes.</P>
    <P>It is clear that Ireland faces a major infrastructural crisis. One sees the evidence of this every morning and evening in our cities and towns as traffic is blocked up on the way to and from work. One also sees evidence of it in the queues of people outside auctioneers' offices, waiting for the opportunity to buy houses which are available at limited offer prices. I have every reason to believe that this will continue to get worse unless something is done about it. It requires politics and political action to change this position. I am not a visionary and I cannot foretell the future. However, I have an idea about how politics can influence the future for good or ill. If politics is to influence the future for good, three characteristics are required &ndash; predictability, efficiency and transparency.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons for Ireland's current economic success is the predictability of our tax policies as they affect business. As the political parties in the House are agreed on basic corporation tax policy, changes in Government have not changed the business environment as far as tax is <Col N="257" /> concerned. Few other European countries have that degree of predictability. Ireland's membership of the European Union has enhanced that predictability because it has set constraints on what this and other member state governments can do to change direction with regard to matters such as budget deficits, environmental regulation, competition policy, etc. Predictability is an important success factor for Ireland and we can be reasonably comfortable about it.</P>
    <P>The second requirement for successful political action in the economic field is the promotion of efficiency. This is an area in which Ireland, particularly regarding the provision of infrastructure, has been deficient. Planning for the foreseeable growth in the number of people looking for houses has been particularly inadequate. The political system at governmental level between Departments and between Departments and local authorities has not coped adequately with the rapid, but foreseeable, increase in the demand for additional houses.</P>
    <P>For every ten houses we have today, there is a need to provide an additional four in the next ten years. This is the biggest single construction project ever undertaken in the nation's history. It is truly the millennium project because no construction project of its size and proportion has been undertaken in this millennium. It is important that the provision of these additional houses and all the infrastructure necessary to support them is seen as a single project and not as a series of individual projects, some of which may be co-ordinated with others.</P>
    <P>The traffic problem is a symptom of a disease and not the disease itself. The disease is the shortage of housing and this represents the fundamental underlying threat to Ireland's economic success. There is a need to put in place a national infrastructure and settlement plan which would be administered on a weekly basis by the Taoiseach to ensure that, over the next ten years, all the necessary infrastructure is provided to create houses for people which are affordable and capable of being lived in in a civilised way.</P>
    <P>At present people are not living civilised lives. They must spend an increasing amount of time in their cars morning and evening because the only place in which they can afford to buy a house is far away from their place of work. Meanwhile, because of this extra traffic over longer distances at slower paces, inner city and suburban residents are facing a rapid deterioration in their lifestyles due to the increased use of their housing areas as short cuts by people avoiding traffic jams on the main arterial routes. Smaller suburban and inner city housing areas are now experiencing levels of through traffic for which they were never designed.</P>
    <P>Travel times are becoming longer to and from work because in Dublin, in particular, it has been decided to have a low density suburbia with plenty of green space and few multi-storey buildings or high density housing. There are objections to any change in this position, but those who <Col N="258" /> object fail to realise that the choice of having a low density city carries the cost of a consequent large traffic problem. This is because of the undermining of the economics of public transport by the low density choice that has been made.</P>
    <P>The traffic problem will only be solved if the overall infrastructural problem is solved, in particular, the problem of housing and of servicing them with schools, bus, train and waste disposal services and all the other requirements, including child care, which are necessary for a civilised life. If houses are built far away from bus and train services, there will be traffic problems. If, as we are trying to do, more houses are built in outer suburbia or the edges of our cities without tackling the resultant waste disposal, schooling, road, footpath and other problems in advance, inevitably there will be objections from existing residents. They see that providing houses without services will worsen their lives and, therefore, they object and use the provisions of the planning Acts to the full.</P>
    <P>We are now moving from having a not-in-my-back-yard culture to a BANNA culture &ndash; build absolutely nothing near anything. This is becoming the guiding principle. In the recent local elections, individuals were elected whose sole successful platforms were objecting to travellers' halting sites, new houses in a particular area or some other development which is necessary to house people, including the provision of means of incinerating waste. The willingness of people to use the electoral process to pull up the ladder after themselves once they are safely ensconced in a house and forget about the needs of others increased considerably in the recent election. This is a matter of concern, but it only happened because the political process has shown weakness. It has been unwilling to give leadership in these matters.</P>
    <P>Political responsibility is thinly dispersed among so many local authorities and councillors who act individually in each case without any sense of a county government, similar to a national Government, making decisions on a county wide basis. This dispersal of political authority and absence of political planning has left the field open to those for whom objection, motivated by personal and selfish interests, is an increasing way of life and of asserting one's individuality and existence in an area. Due to the lack of political authority and planning, an objector culture is developing. This bodes ill for our ability to undertake successfully in the time required the major construction project which is needed to provide four houses for every ten which currently exist to meet the foreseeable housing need.</P>
    <P>Due to the haphazard nature of our infrastructural planning, our existing buses, trains and roads are being used inefficiently. There is a need to change the shape of our cities, not in terms of the overall shape of the city but in the sense of having more businesses located in the suburbs and more residences in the inner city so that traffic is in both directions in the morning and <Col N="259" /> evening. If there are places of work in the suburbs and some people living in the cities, people will travel outwards in the morning and inwards in the evening, in addition to people travelling in the opposite direction. That will allow buses, trains and roads to be used more optimally. It is important that we continue seeking to ensure that residential accommodation be a requirement in all inner city developments, and that office and other business accommodation be a requirement in outer city housing developments.</P>
    <P>We also need to take decisions not only to build satellite towns around Dublin but to establish other cities as alternative poles of development. Places like Dundalk, Athlone, Carlow and Thurles should be developed around their proposed or existing third level institutions with a view to possible city status.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of great importance that we have a national plan which takes these sorts of strategic decisions. From my experience of the introduction of Operation Freeflow, I do not believe we can afford to leave the physical planning task to the Department of the Environment and Local Government on its own. I mean no disrespect to the Minister, Ministers of State or officials of the Department. Its brief is simply too narrow &ndash; it does not encompass education, law enforcement, traffic enforcement, child care or many other areas inherent in a successful human infrastructure development plan. Nor does the Department have the authority to decide on the physical shape of the country &ndash; it has a contribution to make but it does not have the overall political authority.</P>
    <P>That is why we need a plan led by the Taoiseach. Operation Freeflow was introduced solely because I as Taoiseach took a personal interest in the matter. I brought all the relevant traffic authorities &ndash; law enforcement, public transport, other facility provisions, etc. &ndash; together for lunch in the Taoiseach's office, told them I would meet them again for lunch a month later, and demanded to see results within that time. Things which had not happened, and were not due to happen for years, all happened within the space of that month, simply because the Taoiseach was involved and these people had to report back.</P>
    <P>Without making false claims for my abilities in this regard, this is an example of how the Department of the Taoiseach ought to be used to deal with strategic problems in Government. The housing shortage is a strategic problem facing us and is the main contributor to the traffic problem and other factors leading to the deterioration of lifestyle in our society. We must deal quickly with this problem.</P>
    <P>In the context of the objector culture to which I referred, I have noticed a deplorable practice in my constituency, which undoubtedly occurs elsewhere also. A cement plant was to be built but a competitor who operated another such plant financed the cost of objectors to the proposed plant; and those proposing the cement plant paid <Col N="260" /> what they called &ldquo;goodwill money&rdquo; to objectors, who then withdrew their objections. I regard this as corruption. Politicians have as much or as little influence on the planning process as do objectors, because neither of those groups makes the decisions. If politicians had received or paid such money we would be immediately accused of corruption.</P>
    <P>It is corrupt for a company to pay people to object to a competitor's proposal. It is also corrupt for a developer to pay people to withdraw their objections. In both cases the actions materially affect the course of decision making. It could be argued that the decision is taken not by the objector or the developer but by someone else, but in business time is money and if a development can be delayed for a sufficiently long time &ndash; in one case objectors used the court as a further delaying tactic, after the planning appeals board had made its decision &ndash; that is as good as killing it. People who finance or buy off objectors are, therefore, corrupt in any understandable meaning of the term, and this corruption must be stopped if the bottlenecks in our society to which I referred are to be overcome.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to share the remainder of the time with Deputy Clune. Deputy Bruton has put our infrastructure problem in a new perspective, that of our future development patterns. This perspective is badly needed and the motion is timely. The Government is in the process of preparing the national development plan for the next EU financing period, from 2000-6. During that period we will face major infrastructural needs with a declining inflow of funds from the EU and a correspondingly large and increasing need for funds from, or supported from, our resources.</P>
      <P>It is the accepted wisdom of those involved in planning for economic development that we currently have a major infrastructural deficit but I am not sure how deep that understanding goes. It is far from commonly held that a major part of that deficit is in housing, and Deputy Bruton has set out in clear terms how and why that is the case. The sooner policy makers and the Government realise how central housing is to our infrastructural deficit and how crucial a part of the problem it is, the better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two major components in our infrastructural deficit which we must address between now and the end of 2006 &ndash; I take that perspective because it is within that framework that we will examine a national development plan. The first component is the backlog, the insufficiency of our current infrastructural provision in face of our current needs for economic and social infrastructure. Housing is a major part of that problem. There is no sector of the housing market in which supply comes anywhere near meeting the level of demand. House prices are still rising at an appalling rate. It is a measure of how desperate the problem is, and how desperate the Government is, that it must resort to clapping <Col N="261" /> itself on the back because the rate of increase in house prices appears marginally to have slowed down or, to borrow a phrase from &ldquo;Star Trek&rdquo;, reduced from warp speed to the merely supersonic.</P>
    <P>It was bizarre to hear Government spokespersons being quoted and interviewed last week, saying how wonderful it was that the rate of house price increases was coming down. There is nothing to be smug or self-congratulatory about in the fact that the rate of increase has slowed from ten times to eight times the annual rate of inflation. That is doing nothing for young couples earning £40,000 per year between them who cannot afford to buy a house. No amount of smug self-congratulation by the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, or any other spokesperson for the Government, on the reduction in the rate of increase in house prices will matter a traithnín to a couple in that position because they still will be unable to afford a house at the end of this year, and they will be able to afford it even less by the end of next year.</P>
    <P>Such evidence, as is available, indicates that rents are rising also. Rents for modest houses and apartments are now at levels which would have been inconceivable five years ago. I heard of a case the other evening of a couple who are paying rent of £1,100 per month for a relatively modest four bedroom house in a suburb of Dublin. Young couples, forced into the rental sector because they cannot afford to buy a house, are now paying rents which in many cases exceed what they would have expected to pay for a mortgage a few years ago. Last autumn, parents of third level students who live away from home and off campus were shocked to find out the amount by which rents had risen from the previous June. I have no reason to believe the same will not happen this autumn. Students who between them were paying rents of £400 for apartments at the end of their leases in June of last year found that their rentals had gone up to £500 when they went back to rent the same apartments in September or October of last year. That will continue to be the case.</P>
    <P>Local authority housing lists are already enormous and no matter how the Government dresses it up, it is perfectly clear that the current rate of local authority housing provision is not keeping up with demand. The waiting lists get longer, and it does not matter for how long the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, goes on about it in this House &ndash; and he does go on about it &ndash; the housing lists get longer. The level of demand for local authority housing is being further fuelled by the fact that even modest starter house prices are now beyond the reach of many people who, until only a few years ago, could reasonably have expected to be able to buy a home of their own.</P>
    <P>Our road infrastructure is appalling. The National Roads Authority considers that it is a reasonable objective to bring average journey speeds between major urban centres to 50 miles per hour. Most Members of this House do a fair <Col N="262" /> amount of driving around the country and no one will disagree with me when I say that nobody travelling from any one of our major urban centres today to any other could possibly hope to achieve an average journey speed of 50 miles an hour without completely ignoring speed limits and common prudence in driving. It cannot be done. That is a medium-term objective identified by the National Roads Authority. We are miles away from that and although we have been spending substantial amounts of money on our road infrastructure, journey times are getting longer even in the areas where we have made major improvements.</P>
    <P>I live what would normally be a distance of about an hour's journey from Leinster House. In the past two years, I have found that the journey time at any time of the day is a minimum of an hour, an average of an hour and a quarter and, at some times in the morning, an hour and a half and even up to two hours for a journey of 35 miles. That is not unusual. I had occasion for a time some years ago to travel frequently between my own home and Limerick, a journey which, even before the Portlaoise bypass, I could usually do in about an hour and a half. It would be foolhardy to try to make that journey now in an hour and a half because the level of traffic has increased and the level of provision of road infrastructure has simply not matched it.</P>
    <P>In towns throughout the country, raw sewage is still being discharged into water courses. During the course of a recent Question Time in this House, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government refused even to try to indicate a target date by which we might achieve the objective of full waste water treatment in all urban centres. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government was unable to tell me what would be a reasonable timescale in which to expect that we would stop the practice of discharging raw sewage from urban centres into our water courses.</P>
    <P>Water quality is a major worry despite the fact that the Minister for the Environment and Local Government tries to put a good gloss on it. The latest Environmental Protection Agency reports on water quality give rise to serious concern. Inevitably, the Government has picked out the good point. It is true that the incidence of heavy pollution in our water courses is decreasing. On the other hand, the incidence of moderate pollution is increasing. The EPA sets out clearly that the number of cases of moderate pollution of water courses is increasing year by year. That means that we have a far more pervasive problem with water quality than is officially admitted.</P>
    <P>Our railway infrastructure has come into question in recent times. The Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, who was in the Chamber a short while ago, has been obliged to come forward with a major investment programme of several hundred million pounds, not to bring about a major improvement in the level and capacity of service being supplied on the railways but simply to get <Col N="263" /> what we have into a reasonably efficient and safe condition.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that at a time when we are considering making major investment simply to ensure the safety of our railway system we have other projects coming forward, based on spurious ambitions for our railways, that can have major effects on our environment. For example, we have a proposal for a major landfill operation in Silvermines, County Tipperary, being justified on the basis that there is a rail link adjacent to the site. If our railway system cannot safely take the volume of traffic that is on it now, it will certainly not be able to deal with trains bringing tens of thousands of tons of waste down to Silvermines, any more than it will be able to deal with another proposal to locate an incinerator in Kilcock in County Kildare, again on the basis that there is a railway line nearby. I hope that those who are called to make decisions on these matters will examine the wider aspects of our infrastructure provision when they are making them. If they do not, we are storing up enormous problems for ourselves.</P>
    <P>I have referred to only four areas of the backlog in our current infrastructure provision. There is another component in our infrastructure deficit, that is, the pressing need that now exists to plan infrastructure provision to deal with current levels of growth and the foreseeable infrastructural demands arising from those levels of growth. A continuation of current levels of economic growth, household formation and rates of population increase will create an escalating need for infrastructure provision. Demands in relation to the quality of the infrastructure provided, whether it is in housing, roads, education facilities, social facilities, waste management, waste treatment, etc., will continue to rise. When we factor in accepted policy objectives in relation to sustainable growth and a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, we can see that the need for infrastructure provision and expenditure is racked up even further.</P>
    <P>The volume and the quality of infrastructure required are not the only demands we face. We must also have regard to the requirements of coherence and efficiency in our planning process, and we must have regard to regional considerations. Coherence and efficiency in planning require a new approach to planning law. The Government had promised a Bill for mid-summer. Mid-summer's day has come and gone and we still have not seen the Bill. With increasing infrastructural demand, planning has become a more contentious issue and all the signs are that this trend will continue. As Deputy Bruton said, the recent local elections showed that there is widespread resistance to infrastructural expansion in key areas such as housing, accommodation and waste treatment and management. It now appears that in some areas the NIMBY principle is a good basis for getting elected. We must wonder what constructive contribution will be made <Col N="264" /> to the increasingly difficult area of planning by the NIMBY brigade when they are involved in making decisions.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton drew attention to very dubious practices in our planning procedures that are now being admitted to. In those circumstances it is even more urgent that we reinforce the transparency and efficiency of our planning process. It is possible to do these things while giving elected representatives a greater role in the planning process. It would be impossible to provide the public accountability for planning that is required without giving our elected representatives a more explicit and determining role in the planning process.</P>
    <P>Regional concerns become more urgent each day for a number of reasons. First is the simple matter of equity. It is inequitable that the fruits of our economic success are not more widely shared throughout our society. It requires no great wisdom to see that today there is still an enormous imbalance in terms of wealth and access to services between the west and the east. We are now paying the price for ignoring the wisdom that was popular in 1969, when we junked the Buchanan report as a result of the most appalling combination of influences. We are now back to that position. As Deputy Bruton said, we need a new approach to the development of urban areas and to providing the services required to allow growth in areas other than those where we have allowed it to take place until now. In terms of efficiency, it is utterly undesirable to have concentration of growth in the eastern half of the country, which is the norm. Infrastructural planning and provision must be seen explicitly as effective tools in remedying this inequity and avoiding this inefficiency. That is what the motion sets out to do and I hope that if the Government even half believes some of the things it has said in the House, it will accept the motion and act accordingly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune" hpid="Ms Clune Ms Clune">
      <NameTxt>Ms Clune</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion and the point made by Deputy Bruton that he, as Taoiseach, had taken hold of Operation Freeflow. It is time someone at that level addressed the serious infrastructural deficit and the problems people are experiencing from day to day. We are told that those are the problems of a booming economy. If so, that economy should address those problems and invest where necessary to ensure that we maintain our competitive edge, which is vital for the country's future.</P>
      <P>Why did less than 50 per cent of the population vote in the recent local elections? Is it that they feel the economy is going so well that they do not need politicians, or is it that they despair at the lack of infrastructure in their local areas and the effect such neglect is having on their lives? In many cases, it is the latter. The lack of forward planning has contributed enormously to daily traffic jams and to the stress caused by living in urban areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach recently opened the Jack Lynch tunnel in Cork. That is the culmination of the <Col N="265" /> LUTS plan which was envisaged for the city over 20 years ago. A vital infrastructural development is, however, missing from the west of the city. The lack of a Ballincollig bypass is causing severe traffic jams in the area and turning housing estates into rat runs. Yesterday local elected representatives were asked to a briefing by the IDA and the Cork Institute of Technology, which are proposing a major technology park in the very area that is suffering such major traffic problems. I do not doubt that such a technology park would be a great asset to Cork if the correct infrastructure were in place, but to build it we would need a material contravention of the development plan and there are no roads in place to deal with the extra traffic that such a technology park would entail. What are we, as public representatives, to say? We know very well that it is necessary for the development of the city, but at the same time those living in the area cannot take any more, and I do not doubt there would be objections to the development. The infrastructure must be put in place before the already overburdened population of the area are troubled further.</P>
    <P> I live in Dublin three days a week, and Cork's traffic problems are not as severe as those in Dublin. The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children was recently briefed on nursing shortages and the difficulties hospitals have in attracting theatre nurses, cardiac care nurses and intensive care nurses. The reason is that nurses cannot afford to live in Dublin. They cannot afford to buy houses here and do not want to deal with the stresses of traffic. A recent meeting discussed loading nurses' incomes to enable them to live in Dublin. This is an opportune time for the Taoiseach to intervene. No Department is taking responsibility for overall traffic management and control in our major city. We will not see Luas come on stream for some years &ndash; sometimes it is on, sometimes it is off. It is a debacle, yet there are cars stuck in traffic and this affects the quality of life of those sitting in them as well as the environment. The lack of sufficient public transport is one of the reasons for our traffic problems. Efficient, reliable and affordable public transport, which is provided in many European cities, is the key to solving those problems.</P>
    <P>Another major infrastructural problem is the lack of child care facilities, which is contributing enormously to the problems of young people with children. There are two sides to this problem, the first is the cost of child care and the second is the absence of facilities. Both can be solved in different ways.</P>
    <P>Yesterday I attended a briefing in my constituency about the problems experienced by people providing child care when applying for planning permission. There are objections if they seek permission to locate in residential areas on the grounds of traffic and noise, while they are not encouraged to look for permission to locate in commercial or industrial areas. Young people are caught in the trap of being committed to work while being unable to afford someone to mind <Col N="266" /> their children. This problem will boil over. The recent child care regulations are very welcome but as a result there is a reduction in the number of places offering child care.</P>
    <P>I support the motion. There are other areas I would like to discuss, such as the lack of waste management infrastructure, which we debated recently. I call on the Taoiseach and the Government to address this matter in a coherent fashion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>June 1997 brought us to the end of the rainbow. At the end of a rainbow, one expects to be dazzled by a crock of gold. However, at the end of their rainbow, we were dazzled by the glaring absence of forward planning and building for the future.</P>
      <P>In the housing area, there was not a coherent attempt &ndash; or even an incoherent attempt &ndash; to address the problem of escalating house prices before matters reached the serious situation with which this Government was left to deal. The one major step taken by the previous Government &ndash; the increase in stamp duty &ndash; only served to hasten the deterioration of the situation by choking off the supply of second hand houses. Fine Gael still does not seem to have learned from its mistakes. Since settling in for the long haul on the other side of the House, the proposals it has come up with have centred on adding demand to the market when the dogs in the street are barking &ldquo;supply, supply, supply&rdquo; as the main element of the solution &ndash; although not the only solution. The same can be said of its approach to infrastructure and transport requirements.</P>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to draw together and put on the record of the House the enormous achievements of the Government over such a wide area of policy in just two years in office. The motion refers to some of the major challenges the Government has faced, and will continue to face in the period ahead. In confronting them, we should be conscious that these challenges relate to the unprecedented and unpredicted success of our economy over recent years. The continuation of that success will depend, to some extent, on how we respond the these challenges.</P>
      <P>The Government's belief that this response must be strategic and coherent across a wide range of policy areas was borne out by the decision in principle to draw up a national spatial development strategy. This was announced as one of the measures adopted in the wake of the second Bacon report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fine Gael have only now woken up to the fact that the Government has already taken this decision. Perhaps Fine Gael know about it and are attempting to piggy-back on the Government's decision on the actions taken, or on the other actions about to be taken, by the Govern<Col N="269" /> ment. However, the terms in which its motion is expressed suggest that it has failed to land comfortably on the piggy's back. In calling for a natonal infrastructure and settlement plan, it is proposing an exercise that would be static and partial in character and out of date in concept. The Government, on the other hand, sees the subject matter as part of a wider, more dynamic approach that would take the form of a national spatial development strategy to encompass economic performance, social inclusion and sustainable development.</P>
    <P>The arguments for national spatial guidance have been advanced in a number of recent reports and regional studies. The European spatial development perspective, which was adopted by EU Ministers responsible for spatial planning last month, has developed an approach and concepts that we can use to advantage in spatial planning in Ireland. The three fundamental goals of the perspective &ndash; social cohesion, sustainability and competitiveness &ndash; are very much to the fore in the recently prepared strategic planning guidelines for the greater Dublin area. They have been adopted in the draft regional strategic framework for Northern Ireland which will contribute to achieving a common approach in spatial planning in both parts of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The competitiveness of Ireland is dependent on a wide range of factors. A key consideration is the effective economic functioning of each of the different regions of the country. This means developing each region in a way that optimises its own distinctive economic potential, enabling it to exploit fully the resources which it possesses. Each region does not possess the same potential or the same range of attributes and characteristics and it would not be expected that each region or area would develop in a similar way. Each has its own strengths and weaknesses and the intention should be to determine what these are and to build upon the strengths and compensate for the weaknesses.</P>
    <P>The economic competitiveness of the country and of its regions has to be advanced in parallel with policies to achieve other goals relating to sustainable development, the quality of life, social cohesion and conservation of the natural and cultural heritage. This introduces the concept of a balance between achieving these goals within the country as a whole and within the different constituent areas. Related to the idea of balanced developement is that of integrated development where the aim is to integrate policies as they affect an area. The intention is not only to avoid conflict and diminution of benefits but to achieve a synergy where extra benefits are achieved from the co-ordinated formulation and operation of policies.</P>
    <P>A national spatial strategy is, of its nature, longer term than our other planning instruments, with a vision of upwards of 20 years which will provide a coherent context for longer term investment decisions. Public investment cannot be delayed pending the production of such a strat<Col N="270" /> egy. Existing centres will require continuing inward investment.</P>
    <P>The building of entirely new cities is suggested as a response to our rapidly growing city regions. While it has been put forward in the past as the classic overspill response, it has a number of serious disadvantages and was rejected as an option in the recent strategic guidelines for the greater Dublin area. The main disadvantage of that model is that it is a very high risk option. It would require high levels of initial investment and is dependent on reaching target populations within a reasonable timescale. Moreover, the development of a small number of new towns offers people little choice in where they will live. There can also be problems associated with achieving a balanced social mix and developing an identity which is so important for stability. A study of the history of new cities in Britain and further afield will see these lessons underlined.</P>
    <P>The national spatial strategy is likely to recommend a broad planning strategy for the country at large, to identify broad spatial development patterns for areas and set down indicative policies in the location of residential development, industrial development, rural development and tourism and heritage. The strategy will provide the basis for co-ordination and co-operation in policy formulation and particularly in decision-making on major investment in infrastructure, including public and private transportation infrastructure and major industrial location.</P>
    <P>While Ireland has made significant progress over the past decade, the benefits of our economic success have been spread unevenly. The forthcoming national development plan will have as one of its principal objectives more balanced regional development, in so far as public policy can make this happen and can influence the spatial distribution of economic activity. Maintenance of Objective One status for the Border, midland and western regions should assist less developed parts of the country to compete better for foreign investment through the more favourable State aids regime available in Objective One regions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a ball the Government almost dropped. It was lucky to get away with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>This approach must, however, recognise that there will be certain kinds of large employment enterprises which will always wish to locate in, or close to, the major urban centres. It will be vitally important that the spin-off opportunities that these enterprises present to home grown businesses are fully exploited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Investment in infrastructure can have an important bearing on the spread of economic activity throughout the country. In deciding on the investment strategy for various categories of infrastructure in the NDP, we will have to ensure it is complementary to and supportive of spatial development. Balanced spatial development should address the needs of all regions within the <Col N="271" /> limits of the resources available. A major infrastructural priority in the greater Dublin region will be to address the problem of congestion, while in the Border, midlands and east regions the priority for infrastructure will be to make the region more accessible for productive investment in industry, tourism and internationally traded services.</P>
    <P>On the question of infrastructural investment, the Government has over the past two years significantly increased the levels provided under the existing NDP. Contrast this with the much more timid approach of the rainbow Government which stuck pretty rigidly to the limits of the plan, notwithstanding the evidence of the need to reappraise them in the light of newly emerging circumstances.</P>
    <P>A record sum of £337 million is being provided for national road investment and maintenance in 1999 by way of funding to the NRA and local authorities. This represents an increase of 30 per cent on the initial 1997 provision of £255 million. This is also a record year for non-national roads. In excess of £242 million is being provided in State grants for these roads in 1999, an increase of 40 per cent on the initial 1997 figure of £170 million.</P>
    <P>On the specific issue of Dublin transportation, the DTO short-term action plan, published last September, is designed to advance and accelerate a set of measures consistent with the DTI strategy which can be completed in the period to end 2000. Detailed objectives include completion of 12 quality bus corridors and 180 kilometers of cycle tracks by end 2000; provision by end 1999 of an additional 150 buses by Dublin Bus; additional rolling stock for DART; lengthening of outer suburban and key DART station platforms; and upgrading by end 2000 of the Maynooth-Clonsilla rail line.</P>

      <P>Similarly, in the area of water and sewerage infrastructure, investment levels have increased by 70 per cent since 1997, to a record level of £275 million this year. Key initiatives are being implemented by the Government to provide services to open up land for residential development. The serviced land initiative has provided £39 million in Exchequer funding to open up 100,000 additional housing sites.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another important measure announced in this year's budget is the rural towns and villages <Col N="272" /> initiative aimed at providing badly needed water and sewerage facilities in towns and villages that have not been accorded priority under existing programmes. The rural water programme is being driven forward in a planned and properly resourced way and in partnership with the group schemes movement to provide adequate supplies of good quality water to rural areas and to support local development.</P>
    <P>However, despite the greatly increased level of existing programmes, the Government recognises that Ireland will not be able to continue to prosper and grow unless the basic infrastructure is in place to support it. We may be approaching EU income levels but we do not yet have the stock of capital, built up over decades of high investment, which is enjoyed in other advanced countries. The Government is determined that this infrastructural deficit will be radically addressed in the new national development plan for 2000-06 which is at an advanced stage of preparation. This plan will aim to mobilise the additional funds flowing to the Exchequer, the funds flowing from the EU as a result of the very successful Agenda 2000 negotiations and private funding, to carry out a seven year infrastructure programme unprecedented in the history of the State. The programme will transform our roads network, greatly improving road access to all regions. Equally, the need to substantially upgrade our public transport infrastructure will be recognised.</P>
    <P>Continued large-scale investment will be required in water and waste water services if we are to meet EU environmental standards, support economic development and ensure a strong supply of serviced land for housing. The NDP will also provide for a major investment plan for waste recycling and disposal. The policy context for this programme has already been set in last October's policy statement on waste management, entitled &ldquo;Changing our Ways&rdquo;, which set ambitious waste management targets and involves considerable capital investment exceeding £600 million.</P>
    <P>The Government has decided the public private partnership approach offers advantageous new routes to the procurement of needed infrastructure and we are committed to exploiting the advantages of the PPP approach to the greatest extent possible. A special unit has been established in the Department of Finance and in my Department for this purpose. The Minister for Finance recently announced an important Government decision on specific PPPs.</P>
    <P>If we are to deliver on these capital projects within the timescales envisaged, we need to look at ways of speeding up the planning phase of projects, shortening the lead time and eliminating undue delays. We have been considering how the planning system can contribute to this and the forthcoming major Bill to reform and consolidate the planning system will contain a number of measures designed to streamline procedures and speed up the approval process.</P>
    <P>While on the subject of the planning Bill, over <Col N="273" /> the past two years we have been subjecting the planning system to a very rigorous review following extensive public consultation. I am confident the Bill which I intend to publish next month will represent a thorough revision of the existing code which will give us a planning system better suited to modern requirements, while embodying the concept of sustainable development. It will also help address some of the concerns mentioned in the Fine Gael motion, including the issue of social and affordable housing. I look forward to the support of Members on the other side of the House for those provisions.</P>
    <P>While the planning system has coped well with the huge influx of applications and appeals, there is no denying that delays have arisen in processing planning applications and appeals at national and local levels. On two occasions last year local authorities were asked to review their operations and, where necessary, to employ additional planners. At various times a number of Members have raised the question of planning offices being inundated and unable to cope with the number of planning applications. As I indicated previously, we asked each of the local authorities to indicate their needs. A survey carried out by my Department in mid-May last showed that staff numbers in the larger local authority planning departments, that is, county councils and county borough corporations, had increased by some 14 per cent, to more than 750, in the preceding year. Several local authorities indicated at the time that they were on the point of recruiting additional staff to their planning departments. I am certain, therefore, that the situation has improved even further since then and that number has been exceeded.</P>
    <P>The measures which have been taken to enhance the performance of An Bord Pleanála were outlined in this House last week. Deputies will be aware that I have appointed an additional member to An Bord Pleanála and that substantial additional staffing is being put in place. I expect the cumulative effect of the various measures which I and the board have taken will begin to show results quickly in terms of the time taken to dispose of appeals and to reduce the backlog of appeals which has developed.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the housing issue because all of the matters I have been talking about come together in one way or another to impact on housing. The motion recognises this. The Government realised quickly on coming into office that undue inflation in house prices had the potential to damage continued economic progress as well as giving rise to serious social problems. As I said at the outset, the rainbow Government scarcely lifted a finger despite the ominous trends that were already well established during its tenure. By contrast, urgent action has been the hallmark of the Government's approach to this problem. Recognising immediately that the supply of serviced land for residential development was a major factor, I made the case for what has become known as the serviced land initiative and <Col N="274" /> the first tranche was included in the Government's first budget in 1997.</P>
    <P>Similarly, we lost no time in initiating a detailed study by experienced economic and planning consultants, working with officials of the Department, to provide a detailed assessment of the factors underlying house price inflation and a set of recommendations for action. It is generally accepted that few reports have been implemented with the alacrity and determination with which we implemented the first and second Bacon reports. While it is well recognised that house price inflation can be difficult to rein in once it takes hold, there are already encouraging signs that the Government's actions are bearing fruit.</P>
    <P>House price data for the first quarter of 1999 support the view that the rate of house price increase has peaked and should moderate significantly this year. The rate of increase in house prices nationally, both new and second-hand, was lower in the first quarter of 1999 than in the preceding quarter. A significant feature of these latest figures is that, for the second quarter in succession, there has been little change in the average price of second-hand houses in Dublin, which has tended to be a leading market indicator in recent years. Over the past six months, second-hand house prices in Dublin rose by only 2 per cent, compared with an increase of almost 25 per cent in the preceding six months. There is a good prospect that the trend in new house prices will moderate appreciably in coming periods with the continued increase in new housing output.</P>
    <P>Speaking of housing output, last year's output of more than 42,000 set another new record and the indications are that we will surpass that this year. There has been a very substantial increase of 21 per cent in housing output in the first four months of 1999. Furthermore, despite the difficulties in planning departments or An Bord Pleanála, there has been a 14 per cent increase in planning permissions in the first quarter of 1999. That points to a continuing strong trend in future output.</P>
    <P>Meeting increased housing demands in a balanced and efficient fashion requires not only increased private housing supply but also providing for tenure choice. It is for this reason we recently announced the establishment of a Commission on the Private Rented Residential Sector, with the aim of producing recommendations which will make an important contribution to achieving a thriving, more diverse and well managed sector.</P>
    <P>On the social housing side, we are not content with the fact that we have this year brought the social housing programme to its highest level for 13 years. We are looking to the future and have indicated that a new four year multi-annual local authority housing programme of 22,000 additional local authority houses will commence next year. This represents the equivalent of an increase of more than one fifth on the existing local authority housing stock. In addition, we believe the voluntary housing sector has the <Col N="275" /> capacity to complement the local authority programme in a major way, with enhanced support from the Department and local authorities. Our target is to expand social housing output through the range of local authority and voluntary housing programmes to cover the needs of more than 16,000 households per annum over the next few years, thus delivering social housing to almost 60,000 households over the next four years.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, I am glad to have been able to speak about the many advances made in the areas of housing, infrastructure and planning over the past two years. I regret that time constraints have allowed me to touch only all too lightly on very important subjects. A tremendous amount of work has already been done to ensure policies in these areas are advanced in a coherent and strategic manner. The forthcoming national development plan will give us a policy and resource framework to take forward these policies over the coming years.</P>
    <P>The importance the Government attaches to effective implementation of infrastructure programmes is underlined by the recent Government decision to set up a Cabinet subcommittee, chaired by the Taoiseach, on infrastructural development, including public private partnerships. The membership consists of the Tánaiste, the Ministers for Finance and Public Enterprise, the Attorney General and myself. The subcommittee has a focused job. Its immediate task is to prepare, by mid-September, a framework for action in this area. Among the issues it will address will be those relating to the infrastructural approval process and the development and implementation of PPPs. The subcommittee will be serviced by a cross-departmental team of senior officials from the Departments concerned.</P>
    <P>I readily agree that mechanisms need to be put in place to monitor the implementation of programmes in the various sectors so that shortfalls are identified in good time and remedial action taken where necessary. The proper management of any programme requires as much. I am currently examining organisational structures and resources within my Department to ensure policies across the areas in question are delivered in the focused and co-ordinated way that is required. However, I find it difficult to take seriously the proposal in the Fine Gael motion that the Taoiseach would be cast in the role of invigilator, like an exam supervisor patrolling Departments, usurping the role of the Ministers responsible. I thought all along the Taoiseach was an enthusiast for the strategic management initiative.</P>
    <P>The House may be assured the Government takes seriously its role in ensuring the Ireland of the 21st century has the physical infrastructure and housing stock befitting a modern, vibrant and inclusive society. Any objective judgment on our record to date in this area would not provide anything but confidence in our ability to deliver on <Col N="276" /> this. That is more than can be said for the record of certain other parties in the House.</P>

      <P>Any objective judgment of the Government's performance in this area would not make us confident it is capable of delivering anything worthwhile.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party supports the motion tabled by Fine Gael which goes to the heart of the next phase in this country's economic development and social progress. It is a theme which has been raised on many occasions by the leader of the Labour Party and a central one in his address to the party conference two months ago. The motion relates to housing, transport and infrastructural deficiencies and highlights the problems the Government has failed to address.</P>
      <P>The Government appears to be surfing on the crest of the country's economic success, oblivious to the hazards which lie ahead for our prosperity and to the storm gathering around it. Ireland is a very changed country from the time 40 years ago when these Houses might have been considering the need to industrialise or from 30 years ago when they were preoccupied with the first attempts to modernise Ireland's social legislation. Ten or 15 years ago, the Houses were preoccupied with the seemingly insoluble problem of unemployment.</P>
      <P>The modern, prosperous European country we have today, which enjoys levels of wealth and prosperity unheard of a couple of decades ago, came about as a result of changes which had to be worked for and by conscious political decision making. By the same token, political decisions must now be made about the future development of the country. Unfortunately, the Government seems unwilling or incapable of making such decisions.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding the country's economic prosperity, Ireland faces many problems. Our transport infrastructure &ndash; road and rail &ndash; is closer to the Second than the First World. We have a housing crisis, the magnitude of which the Government has failed to grasp. There are also many warning signs that the prosperity and economic success we now seem to take for granted may be under threat unless remedial action is taken. We are aware of the existence of considerable social inequality in spite of increased prosperity. There are also problems in the education area. However, the biggest problem is on the infrastructural side and housing is the biggest of the infrastructural problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Government has made housing a luxury. A young professional couple at the start of their careers cannot now afford to buy a home of their own. People are forced into renting poor quality accommodation at exorbitant costs, often without <Col N="277" /> security of tenure. Local authority waiting lists are twice the length they were when the Government took office and homelessness is no longer something confined to cardboard city. It is a condition which has been visited upon many people of different ages, people who are being evicted from private rented accommodation and simply do not have anywhere to live.</P>
    <P>If any one thing illustrates the shortcomings of this Government as it now marks two years in office, it is surely its utter failure to make any impact whatsoever on the housing crisis. This Government has more resources at its disposal than any previous Administration in the history of the State. Yet, with each passing month, the local authority housing queues grow longer and the price of even the most modest dwellings pass further and further out of the reach of young couples. Tens of thousands of people in the private rented sector face continuing rent increases and insecurity of tenure.</P>
    <P>The newspaper photographs we saw last month of prospective buyers queuing for days for the opportunity to buy apartments with prices starting at £150,000 vividly illustrated the extent of the housing crisis and clearly revealed that Government policies are not working. The Government, in general, and the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, in particular, seem intent on ignoring the plight of those suffering as a direct result of the Government's failure to deal with the housing crisis.</P>
    <P>If the Minister wanted further independent evidence of the seriousness of the crisis, it can be seen in the Dresdner Kleinworth Benson report published last month which revealed that housing in Ireland is now the second most expensive of the countries surveyed. I was not surprised by the contents of the report which confirmed the findings of the Labour Party housing commission. The Labour Party's research revealed that the average price of a house, relative to earnings, doubled between 1994 and 1998. For thousands of people, this means they are priced out of the housing market and do not have any prospect of owning a home of their own.</P>
    <P>It is evident that the Government's total reliance on the Bacon report was misplaced and that property prices are continuing to rise at a rate which is creating huge difficulties for first time buyers. Four day queues of people wishing to buy expensive apartments in Dublin and similar queues for semi-detached homes in Dundalk are among the more dramatic illustrations of the expensive and demoralising battle facing young couples as they attempt to put a roof over their heads.</P>
    <P>Housing is a social need. Since it represents one of the fundamental requirements of human beings, it should not be treated in the same way as non-essential traded commodities for speculation or investment. Steps must be taken to control the price of housing. The Government should establish a fair price certificate system for all new houses, as recommended by the Labour Party <Col N="278" /> housing commission. The system should be based on agreed criteria such as the quality of the property and should be closely linked to building costs, land costs and levies and provide a reasonable profit for the builder.</P>
    <P>The social and economic results of the housing crisis affect every family and town in this country. The Government's policy has failed and a new direction is needed. The recommendations of the Labour Party housing commission represent a radical new approach to the housing crisis. Instead of seeking to ignore the problem, the Government should have the good grace to acknowledge its abysmal failure in this area and should implement the recommendations of the housing commission's report. As a result, house prices would at long last be brought under control and people would be able to afford to put roofs over their heads and have some hope for the future.</P>
    <P>The right to good quality, affordable housing should be enshrined either in the Constitution or in legislation, as is the case in most other European countries. A national strategy for affordable housing, backed up by comprehensive inspection and monitoring and overseen by an independent audit committee should be introduced. A minimum of 20 per cent social housing should be provided for in all residential developments. Is this what the Minister was referring to when he mentioned the measures he intends to take in the proposed planning Bill for which we have been waiting for two years? We were informed that it would be published mid year. The Dáil will go into recess later this week and there is still no sign of it. It was my hope that the Minister would at least have named the day. This is yet another example of a continuous string of promises but lack of delivery.</P>
    <P>There is a need for 10,000 units of social housing per annum to tackle current waiting lists and other unmet housing needs. The Minister said that 22,000 new houses will be provided over a four year period. In the Estimates which were presented at the Select Committee on the Environment and Local Government two weeks ago, not a single penny has been provided for additional social housing this year. We were informed that a start would be made next year. There is a lead-in time of 18 months to two years in the provision of housing. This continuing delay and long-fingering is prolonging the agony of those in need of housing.</P>
    <P>There is a need to introduce a licensing system to govern the private rented sector. All the Government has offered is a commission which will not report until this time next year. This means that further time will elapse before the measures and legislation that are needed now to provide protection for tenants are introduced.</P>
    <P>Housing has to be seen in a wider context. There is road and rail gridlock. It now takes five hours to complete a journey that once took three hours. It is unreliable and unsafe to travel by car and there is no public transport alternative. The <Col N="279" /> Luas project agreed by the previous Government was long-fingered, changed and dithered with for so long that even the most optimistic now believe that it will be many years before it is put in place.</P>
    <P>There is an urgent need to change and modernise the planning system. The Planning Act, 1963, is out of date. There is a need for a new planning regime which will not confine itself to physical planning but will be based on social needs and will take into account the need to develop communities. It should not be driven by the profit requirements of developers, as has been the practice in our major cities in the past three and a half decades.</P>
    <P>Change is not coming from the Government. We are reaching the point where the people will get the change that is required to provide homes, efficient transport services and good planning of the environment and physical and social infrastructure only if there is a change of Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. S. Ryan Mr. S. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The housing crisis is the biggest social problem facing us as a country. Young couples cannot afford new homes. Local authority waiting lists are longer than ever while tenants in the private rental sector face spiralling rent increases. Since the Government came to power two years ago house prices have increased by over 60 per cent and rents by over 50 per cent while there are over 20,000 extra families on local authority housing lists. All this has occurred in a period of unparalleled buoyancy in the economy. This year the Minister for Finance will have a projected surplus of £5.5 billion.</P>
      <P>I compliment my colleague, Deputy Gilmore, on his initiative in proposing the establishment of an independent national housing commission to assess the nature and causes of the housing crisis and offer solutions. The Minister and Minister of State have refused to establish such a commission or acknowledge that there is a crisis. The Government's only response has been to publish the Bacon reports which to date have failed to increase the availability of accommodation or slow down dramatically the annual increase in the cost of housing.</P>
      <P>In 1998 the cost of housing in Dublin increased by 31.7 per cent. Couples with two average incomes are unable to bridge the gap between the normal maximum loan and the price of a house. Based on 1998 costs, the difference is in the region of £54,000. This is a matter of grave concern and cannot be left solely to market forces.</P>
      <P>There is a strong case for intervention. The cost of a house is made up of the price of the land, labour, materials, services and profit. The average price of a site in the Dublin area has risen by 200 per cent since 1995 and now accounts for nearly 40 per cent of the average house price. This is a scandal. If we classify ourselves as a caring society, something has to be done to ensure landowners are not allowed to accrue massive profits as a result of land rezonings or planning permissions.</P>

      <Col N="280" /> Action to tackle building land speculation is essential if the problem of spiralling house prices is to be dealt with. The nettle has to be grasped. The Kenny report published in 1973 has to be revisited. The Labour Party will lead the way. I hope the Government will see the merits of addressing the issue.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the Celtic tiger, there are at least 45,000 families on local authority housing lists. This is some achievement as we approach the new millennium. There has been a huge increase in the number of applicants for local authority housing throughout the country. In Fingal County Council there are well in excess of 3,000 on the housing list. The allocation from the Department has been sufficient to construct 80 and 95 new houses in the past two years at a time when there is much talk about equality, justice and fair play for everybody.</P>

      <P>The Minister is on the rack with regard to the housing crisis and people know it. The sooner there is a change of Government, the better. That would ensure equality in the housing market and in housing policy.</P>
      <P>The number of houses in the Fingal County Council area is unacceptable and must be increased to at least 400 per annum. That is not too much to expect. There is a massive increase in the cost of private rented accommodation. In my constituency, rented accommodation costs of up to £750 per month have resulted in a huge increase in housing applications and families being forced to live in grossly overcrowded conditions. I hope the Minister responds to the positive recommendations put forward by Fine Gael and the Labour Party this evening.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to bring this report before the House and I look forward to it being debated in both Houses of the Oireachtas. Like others who have commented on this matter on the many occasions it has arisen, both inside and outside the Oireachtas, we address the issue with mixed feelings. First, we are conscious of the feelings of hurt and loss experienced by the people involved in the terrible accident which killed a mother of two young children and left her husband a single parent and severely disabled. We are also conscious of the ter<Col N="281" /> rible loss and pain of other people affected by the accident and particularly by what the committee was asked to investigate, the early release of Mr. Philip Sheedy.</P>
      <P>I pay tribute to Deputy Eoin Ryan, the chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Women's Rights for the honourable way he acted when it became obvious that there might be a conflict of interest in the context of the committee's investigation and his remaining in the Chair. I also pay tribute to the members of the committee who worked with me, particularly the members of the working group.</P>
      <P>I will give the House a brief summary of the background to the need for the committee to examine the circumstances surrounding this case, the progress or lack of progress made and the lessons the committee has learned. Hopefully, the Houses of the Oireachtas will be able to continue the work that the committee was not able to do within its resources and will raise urgent questions about the initiatives and reforms which are necessary so that if an event again arises which involves the political and judicial branches of Government and confusion about the separation of powers under the Constitution, at least there will be a clear path and more powers to deal with it.</P>
      <P>The committee considered the report from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform on the early release from prison of Mr. Philip Sheedy and presented an interim report to both Houses of the Oireachtas on 20 April this year. In that report, the committee signalled that it would proceed to consider matters arising from this event. It hoped it might be able to obtain answers to the many questions raised by the sequence of events and to be in a position to report back to the Oireachtas. It was hoped that it would be possible to recommend procedures and policies to ensure this would never happen again and to allay the fears and concern of the public about the case.</P>
      <P>The committee considered a letter from Mr. Hugh O'Flaherty, dated 16 April, in which he indicated his willingness to make a statement to the committee and &ldquo;to answer any and all questions which members may raise&rdquo;. In acceding to Mr. O'Flaherty's request, the committee also decided that the same opportunity should be offered to Mr. Cyril Kelly and Mr. Michael Quinlan. Letters were sent to each asking if they wished to meet with the committee on this basis. During this period the committee was at all times acutely aware of the importance of the constitutional separation of the judicial and political functions. It was also motivated at all times by minimising further hurt to everybody involved in this dreadful case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first way the committee tried to proceed was by means of an informal inquiry in which people would voluntarily appear before it. However, in a letter dated 5 May, Mr. O'Flaherty indicated he would not attend and could not further help the committee as the Constitution <Col N="282" /> did not permit him to do so. This effectively meant the committee would not have the voluntary co-operation of all persons. Mr. Cyril Kelly indicated that he had not adopted a final position in the matter and was following the proceedings of the committee. Mr. Michael Quinlan offered to attend and to co-operate with the committee.</P>
    <P>In seeking advice from senior counsel it emerged that a number of different procedural ways might be available to the committee. However, all options were fraught with constitutional or legislative difficulties. With that in mind, the committee decided to write to the Chief Justice, Mr. Liam Hamilton, and request him to make further inquiries into the circumstances surrounding the Sheedy case. The Chief Justice had already presented a report to the Government in an efficacious and efficient manner. The committee believed that if he could undertake that task on behalf of the Government he might also be able to continue and conclude it, perhaps with more success than the committee. Alternatively, if the Chief Justice felt he could not undertake that task, the committee asked if he could suggest, within the existing constitutional and legal framework, how the committee might progress.</P>
    <P>A reply from Mr. Liam Hamilton, dated 10 June, stated that he had completed all the inquiries open to him and that it was not a matter for him to advise or make suggestions to the committee as to how it should proceed. This second avenue having been closed, the committee had two further options offering some prospect of progressing the matter. The first entailed the continued involvement of the committee or some other Oireachtas committee appointed for that purpose. The second option was the establishment of a tribunal of inquiry.</P>
    <P>Members of the committee are conscious of the negative public reaction to the setting up of yet another public inquiry. They are also conscious of the difficulties involved in attempting to amend existing legislation to qualify the exemption now enjoyed by members of the Judiciary under the compellability of witnesses legislation. They are also extremely aware, as are the Members of all committees, that a committee such as ours does not have the time, expertise or resources necessary to bring about a speedy conclusion. The committee is overwhelmed with a huge work programme regarding other legislation and that would add considerably to our difficulties.</P>
    <P>The other option is a tribunal of inquiry. The tribunal could be established within appropriately narrow terms of reference with a fixed time for reporting back. It might have a better prospect of securing satisfactory answers. The committee admits that it could face the same legal difficulties and the prospect of constitutional challenge but it might not run directly into the very difficult and immediate problem of the separation of the Judiciary from the Houses of the Oireachtas, a problem the committee constantly faced. The committee believes the Houses of the Oireachtas might not be hindered in the same way and <Col N="283" /> should be allowed to continue to make progress on this matter. The outstanding issue is so serious that is requires, at least, the consideration of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution, and even the prospect of having a referendum on a constitutional amendment.</P>
    <P>Members of both Houses were faced with the prospect of a constitutional crisis if we had tried to work through a procedural process towards the impeachment of judges. It was then realised that the Article on judicial functions, the special exemption of judges, and the lack of a process being laid out under the Constitution or legislatively, did not allow any forum or procedure to be continued with, that would allow both sides to be heard on this matter. That is still an outstanding and urgent area to be examined. There may be other occasions on which the House will be faced with the same difficulty, so the committee would like the Oireachtas to examine this issue and use all its powers, either by way of legislation or constitutional amendment.</P>
    <P>We welcome the fact that as a result of the working group under Mrs. Justice Susan Denham, recommendations have already been made for the establishment of a judicial body to contribute to high standards of judicial conduct, and a system for handling complaints about judicial conduct. Members of the committee agree that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform should ensure that such a judicial body is established at the earliest possible date and that the committee will have an input into the recommendations for its establishment. Above all, the committee wishes to convey its frustration and disappointment with the futile attempts to get answers despite the hard work and goodwill of everybody involved on the committee. It is now the responsibility of the Oireachtas to use every possible method to ensure accountability at all levels in every institution of State in order to restore confidence to the administrative and judicial system that has been severely dented.</P>
    <P>Article 5.2 of the Constitution concerning judicial functions has been widely interpreted by some of the judges. We could usefully have a debate as to whether the Article has been extended to a far greater degree than was envisaged in 1937.</P>
    <P>I thank all members of the committee who worked in such a cohesive way towards achieving a consensus. The commitment and shared concern of all our members was an example of how the committees of this House can and do work. It was an honour to have been able to chair the committee. Unfortunately, the report and its conclusions are not what we would wish to have presented to the House. Our committee, and others, when faced with such difficult decisions &ndash; particularly with regard to judicial and political matters &ndash; must ensure that even if it means changing the Constitution or setting up a tribunal of inquiry, despite negative public reaction, it <Col N="284" /> must be done. I hope some way will be found to answer the questions arising from the Sheedy case which has given rise to such public concern. I hope also that the judicial body, which should be set up as quickly as possible, will ensure that a case like this will not happen again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Miss M. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I speak on behalf of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, who is unavoidably absent at the talks in Stormont this week, which is why he cannot attend the House.</P>
      <P>The House will be well aware of the events which led to the transmission by the Government to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality and Women's Rights, of the reports of the three separate inquiries in connection with the early release from prison of Philip Sheedy, namely, the report of the Chief Justice, the report of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the report of the Chief State Solicitor.</P>
      <P>In summary, on the evening of 10 February 1999, the Attorney General contacted the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, at a meeting in Berlin regarding concerns that had been raised with him relating to the case of the DPP <i>v.</i> Philip Sheedy in the Dublin Circuit Court in November 1998. The Minister decided that an immediate inquiry should be established. At the request of the Minister, the Attorney General then contacted the Chief Justice who initiated an inquiry. The Minister also instructed the Secretary-General of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform that the Garda authorities should be advised of the matter and that the Department should immediately conduct its own inquiries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Chief Justice provided the report of his inquiries to the Attorney General on 14 April, who furnished it to the Minister. On the basis of facts either admitted or established at that stage, the Chief Justice accepted that Mr. Justice <Col N="285" /> O'Flaherty became involved in this case in a spirit of humanitarian interest and concluded, <i>inter alia,</i> that the intervention of Mr. Justice O'Flaherty in the re-listing of the case was &ldquo;inappropriate and unwise, that it left his motives and action open to misinterpretation and that it was therefore damaging to the administration of justice&rdquo;. The Chief Justice took the view that Mr. Justice Kelly, then a judge of the Circuit Court, should not in the circumstances of this case &ldquo;have entered on a review of a sentence imposed by one of his colleagues&rdquo; and, moreover, &ldquo;failed to conduct the case in a manner befitting a judge&rdquo;, and that Mr. Justice Kelly's handling of the matter &ldquo;compromised the administration of justice&rdquo;. The Chief Justice concluded his report by emphasising that as Chief Justice he has no jurisdiction, whether under the provisions of the Constitution or any Act passed by the Oireachtas, to make any recommendations arising out of the facts in this case.</P>
    <P>The report of the Department was finalised on 19 April 1999. It took account of the conclusions of the Chief Justice, the replies from the County Registrar to a series of questions put to him about his role in the matter, and other inquiries which are set out in the report. It concluded that the action of all officials, bar one, were carried out <i>bona fide,</i> in the course of what they took to be their proper duties. In relation to the Dublin County Registrar, Mr. Michael Quinlan, it concluded that, on the information available at that time:</P>
    <P>1. While Mr. Quinlan's motives and actions were very evidently misguided, they were not corrupt. He did not know Mr. Sheedy and there is no suggestion that what he did was motivated by any prospect of personal gain or reward.</P>
    <P>2. His performance in general, but, in particular, in connection with the official-level inquiry, fell well short of the standards that can reasonably be expected of a person holding the position of County Registrar and, in the circumstances, obstructed and misled the Department's investigation and in fact amounted to misbehaviour.</P>
    <P>On 16 April 1999, the Government considered the contents of the Hamilton report and decided, <i>inter alia,</i> to approve the delivery of letters to both judges stating that, in the light of the Hamilton report, it would consider at its meeting scheduled for 20 April proposals for resolutions for the consideration of both Houses of the Oireachtas, for their removal from office under the provisions of Article 35.4.1º of the Constitution. The Government also gave approval to make the necessary arrangements for the immediate release of the Hamilton report to the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Women's Rights. Following consideration of the Department's report on 20 April, the Government approved the <Col N="286" /> release of same to the joint committee. Mr. Michael Quinlan was provided with copies of the departmental report on a confidential basis on the evening of 19 April 1999. Mr. Justice Hugh O'Flaherty resigned on 17 April 1999. Mr. Justice Kelly and Mr. Quinlan resigned on 20 April 1999.</P>
    <P>On 20 April 1999 the matter was again considered by Government and later that day the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform made a statement to this House in connection with the circumstances surrounding the relisting of the case of the DPP <i>v</i> Philip Sheedy. The Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, informed the House of the resignation of the two judges and the County Registrar and outlined the severance terms to which the Government was and is prepared to agree and which would be brought before the House in due course for approval, namely, the provisions contained in the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) (Amendment) Bill, 1999, Second Stage of which was opened in this House last Thursday.</P>
    <P>The Minister has examined the report of the joint committee and he notes its findings. In particular he notes that the committee finds itself unable to inquire further into the circumstances surrounding the early release from prison of Mr. Sheedy for the legal, constitutional and other reasons outlined in the report and seeks the views of the Oireachtas as to how the outstanding issues can be resolved.</P>
    <P>Judges are exempt from compellability under the Committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Compellability, Privileges and lmmunities of Witnesses) Act, 1997. The committee has considered that an amendment to that legislation could provide that judges and former judges could not be compelled to give evidence in relation to the exercise of their judicial functions. It is the Minister's view that the committee rightly points to the serious difficulties which may follow from such a course of action. Judicial and non-judicial functions cannot be easily categorised, particularly in the context of the handling of a court case. If the amendment were to be included in the compellability legislation further questions would have to be resolved, such as who is to decide in any particular circumstance what constitutes a judicial or non-judicial function. Would the committee or a Minister certify that the actions fall within the judicial category? Would it ultimately be a matter for resolution by a court were there to be a difference of opinion regarding the certification? Does an Oireachtas committee or indeed a Minister have the authority to adjudicate in issues such as whether a particular matter related to judicial functions. Even if it were easy to answer these questions, which it is not, there remains the point that the boundaries they seek to push out stray dangerously close to interference with the independence of the Judiciary.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="287" /> It seems to the Minister that it is a matter of natural justice that judges should be aware in advance of precisely the matters which fall outside judicial functions. It would be wholly inappropriate to compel judges to answer questions on actions which they considered to be judicial while the Oireachtas considered otherwise. The complexity of the case at issue highlights this problem. In his report the Chief Justice concludes: &ldquo;I cannot share Mr. Justice O'Flaherty's belief that a judge of the Supreme Court, having called the County Registrar, an official of a lower court, to his chambers, could expect that anything said by him would be received by the said official as if it had come from a private individual.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>As it happens, the question of the independence of the Judiciary was examined by Mr. Justice O'Flaherty in his consideration of the case of McMenamin <i>v</i> Ireland where he quotes Lavery J. in O'Byrne <i>v</i> Minister for Finance [1959] IR 1, as follows:</P>
    <P>the danger of interference with independence is obviously from the executive and legislative organs of Government. History &ndash; not only our own but all history &ndash; teaches that such a danger can be very real. As the independence is declared, it is to be expected that it would be secured and protected. As has been said, the judicial power is the weakest of the three organs of Government, as it holds neither the sword nor the purse.</P>
    <P>The words of the joint committee itself in this regard underline the problematic nature of this issue where it states at paragraph 13: &ldquo;It is the view of the Committee that any enquiry in this area will be entering unchartered constitutional terrain, fraught with legal difficulty and the virtual certainty of legal challenge.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>For his part, the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, has no difficulty with a comprehensive review of the Committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Compellability, Privileges and lmmunities of Witnesses) Act, 1997, as suggested by the joint committee. He believes that such a review might provide some assistance in determining the practical benefits from any proposed amendments. Moreover, he believes it is essential that any proposed amendments should be examined thoroughly with due regard to the balance that must be maintained between the different branches of Government. A &ldquo;quick fix solution&rdquo; to our present difficulty may produce long-term harm to the institutions of State.</P>
    <P>The committee's second option is the establishment of a tribunal of inquiry under the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Acts, with appropriately narrow terms of reference which include a fixed time for reporting. The Minister considers that the same difficulties referred to above may come into play, in particular the categorisation of <Col N="288" /> judicial and non-judicial functions and the requirement to recognise the independence of the Judiciary. In addition, we have seen the problems which can be caused by narrow terms of reference where the tribunal is forced to return to the Oireachtas for an extension of terms. Furthermore, in theory a fixed time for reporting seems sensible but that in itself can result in a less than satisfactory inquiry. The committee rightly points to two difficulties which could arise if a serving judge of this jurisdiction was to chair such a tribunal, namely, the impact of an appointment would have on the hearing of cases before the courts, and the extent to which members of the Judiciary would be personally acquainted with one or more of those involved in this matter. However, the other options mentioned by the committee, chairmanship by a former judge or a judge of another jurisdiction, are equally problematical. Again, the committee points up that it may well be that a tribunal of inquiry would stand little better prospect of bringing matters to a satisfactory conclusion.</P>
    <P>As regards the significance of the insertion of the word &ldquo;judicial&rdquo; before &ldquo;functions&rdquo; in the 1937 Constitution, I am advised that the Minister finds common ground with the committee in their recognition of the fact that it would not be open, in the absence of a constitutional amendment, to make any inquiry into the exercise of their judicial function by a judge or former judge. It is not clear if the implication of the report is that the committee would favour such an amendment, but the Minister most assuredly would not. The Minister also notes the suggestion in the committee's report that some members of the committee may have a clear grasp of what constitutes the exercise of a judicial function and may be able to draw very precise distinctions in relation to what most of us would regard as very complicated matters. The Minister is convinced in his own mind that if we go down the road of a constitutional amendment to provide for an inquiry into the exercise of functions, judicial or otherwise, by a judge or former judge, we will be embarking upon a very perilous path and one which he is sure is fraught with legal complexity.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of great concern to the Minister that a new approach seems to be creeping into our parliamentary process which is that wherever we are hindered in our course because of constitutional difficulties, the suggestion of a constitutional amendment is immediately made. I am very proud of our Constitution. It is a very robust document. I strongly believe it is not simply a document to invoke when of assistance in pursuing a particular political course of action and to amend when it causes constraints to another political project. On balance, for all the frustrations it may produce from time to time, our Constitution serves as a magnificent bulwark of our freedoms and liberties and as a protector of the <Col N="289" /> separation of powers on which the effective working of our democracy depends.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware of the very valuable work carried out by the working group on a Courts Commission, chaired by Mrs. Justice Denham, in the development and improvement of the area of courts administration in Ireland. The group was requested to specifically address the issue of judicial conduct and ethics. The sixth report of the working group dealt, among other matters, with this topic.</P>
    <P>The group examined the issues surrounding judicial conduct such as judicial independence and the fundamental nature of same in the context of the rule of law and the procedures which are adopted in other countries relating to the handling of judicial conduct that might be considered unsuitable for a member of the Judiciary. It recommended the establishment of a judicial committee and, on publication of that report in April, such a committee was duly established by the Chief Justice, and had its first meeting on 19 May 1999. The committee will consider the sixth report and it will consider further the position in other jurisdictions, including Canada, New South Wales, the United States of America and New Zealand. It will consult with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Bar Council, the Law Society, academics and others and it will also receive submissions from interested bodies.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, and of direct significance to our work today, it will advise on and prepare the way for the establishment of a judicial body which would contribute to high standards of judicial conduct and establish a system for the handling of complaints relating to such conduct. It will do other preparatory work, including the relating of judicial standards and ethics and will consider matters which have arisen since the sixth report was finalised last November. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has personally assured the Chief Justice that he will have every support from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Government in carrying out the work of this judicial ethics committee.</P>
    <P>The report of the Department made nine recommendations in relation to institutional and procedural changes in the courts designed to prevent any recurrence of the events which led to the early release from prison of Mr. Sheedy. They dealt with issues such as the performance of duties by court staff, judicial conduct and ethics, the review of sentences and establishment of a parole board; the method of appointment of county registrars, the assignment of cases to particular judges, court rules, plea negotiations and the formal transfer of responsibility for the administration of court services to the new Courts Board. Some of these recommendations have been implemented already and others will be the subject of proposals to be brought before Government in due course.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="290" /> I am informed that the Courts Service Transitional Board is working diligently towards the establishment of the Courts Service later this year. The aim of this significant change in courts administration is the provision of an efficient, effective and accountable service to judges, practitioners, court staff and, most importantly, the users of the court system. This will be support by information technology systems which will facilitate the organisational changes which are now under way. This work was in train before the events with which we are concerned occurred, but these have given added urgency to the radical overhaul of the courts service.</P>
    <P>The past few months have raised many difficult and important issues affecting the operation of our courts and there has been a level of concern and debate in this respect which is without precedent. In our discussions of this matter we must never forget that the primary victims in this controversy are the Ryan family, whose private grief has been constantly intruded upon by these very necessary discussions.</P>
    <P>However, it is a reality that in many situations we must accept that some truths will only be partially revealed and that we may never get the full facts in specific situations. To quote from the Bible, St. Paul's Epistle to the Corinthians, Chapter 13: &ldquo;For now we see through a glass darkly.&rdquo;  It is also now time for us to accept this reality and to move on from this episode. We must look to the future and learn the lessons from these events so as to avoid a repetition. That is what the Minster for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Courts Service are doing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins (Mayo) Mr. Higgins (Mayo)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins (Mayo)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a fundamental onus on us all as Members of the Dáil and the Oireachtas and an unavoidable moral duty on the Government to get to the whole, unvarnished truth about the Philip Sheedy affair. To fail to do so would be an abdication of the Government's duty to this House and an abject failure of its responsibility. This is, after all, where the public accountability buck is meant to stop.</P>
      <P>However, given what the Minister of State has said, it is regrettable that the motto of the Government &ndash;&ldquo;hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil&rdquo;&ndash; lives on. I am very disappointed with her response, which is crystalised in her final remarks. Biblical quotations will not suffice, nor will they thwart the determination and right of the public and the Oireachtas to know exactly what happened.</P>
      <P>The Government is making a big mistake if it believes this matter can be consigned to the shelves of history. Moving on will not happen until we analyse what happened in the past. The possibility of a constitutional challenge to whatever course of action or further inquiry we engage in should not deflect us from our determination to carry out our duty and to establish the full truth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="291" /> It was interesting to note the litany of negatives thrown up by the Minister of State. Nobody knows if a court challenge or challenges would be upheld. The issue should be fully tested before the High Court, the Supreme Court and, if necessary, the European Court. It should be decided conclusively once and for all, otherwise it will remain suspended and unresolved and this and future Governments will never be clear in their position in the events of future similar controversies involving judges.</P>
    <P>In the event of challenges being upheld, we should not shirk the need for constitutional amendment, provided it does not interfere with the separation of powers or the narrow interpretation of what constitutes judicial function. It is, therefore, incumbent on the Government that in the wake of the publication of this report, it decides, on the basis of the analysis and studies in the report, which course of investigation or inquiry should be embarked upon to establish the full truth and all of the circumstances surrounding the wrongful early release of Philip Sheedy from prison.</P>
    <P>The fact that Philip Sheedy is back in prison and that a Supreme Court judge, a High Court judge and the county registrar were each forced to resign does not mean that the matter has been concluded. We must ascertain why the individuals involved acted in the way they did. We must establish the reason two senior judges, judges entrusted with the responsibility of enforcing the law of the land and with dispensing justice, broke the very laws they were constitutionally charged to uphold. The constitutional declaration made by each judge on taking office to execute that office without fear or favour was breached by the actions of Mr. O'Flaherty, but outside the precincts of the court in that his involvement in having the Sheedy case wrongly listed happened out of court. In the case of High Court judge Kelly, he wrongfully heard the case in that he engaged in <i>ex parte </i>conduct without hearing both sides, he engaged in a mysterious and unexplained calling of the case out of turn and he deliberately misled the court by conveying the impression that he had access to an up-to-date psychological report. All of these individually and collectively breached the constitutional pledge given on taking up such high office.</P>
    <P>The Chief Justice has again been commended for the speedy and precise manner in which he discharged the limited task assigned to him by the Government and for the clarity of his findings of fact: the fact that Mr. O'Flaherty's intervention in the administration of justice and that former Mr. Justice Kelly's handling of the case compromised the administration of justice speak for themselves.</P>
    <P>In essence, the Chief Justice said that justice was perverted in the Sheedy case and that the two <Col N="292" /> judges involved played key roles in the perverting of justice. Am I not right, Sir, in asserting that to pervert the course of justice is a criminal offence? In such circumstances, where there is clear evidence of a criminal offence &ndash; there will not be a clearer presentation of the evidence and the facts than that set out in the Chief Justice's report &ndash; the gardaí should be asked to investigate the matter and files prepared.</P>
    <P>Mr. Justice Hamilton's limited investigations established the roles of the two judges in the affair. However, in relation to Mr. O'Flaherty, we do not know why such an experienced and senior judge should be guilty of such a serious error of judgment. Given that he has now refused to make himself amenable to any and further investigation, he must be compelled to do so.</P>
    <P>In his letter to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Women's Rights dated 5 June, Mr. O'Flaherty stated he could not assist the joint committee because under the Constitution he, as a former judge, is independent and is not accountable to the Houses of the Oireachtas or any other institution of the State for his conduct in the exercise of his judicial function. However, in the same letter he went on to state he was not involved in any judicial function concerning the conduct of the Sheedy case. He had no part in the hearing, judging or reviewing of the case.</P>
    <P>There are clear contradictions in Mr. O'Flaherty's argument. While he was a judge he did not have any judicial function in this case. This in turn means that the section of the Constitution quoted by him on the independence and accountability of the Judiciary does not and cannot apply to him. He was not performing a judicial function and, therefore, his conduct does not come under the article of the Constitution he is now attempting to invoke. In his case there is no question of the independence of the Judiciary being at stake.</P>
    <P>What is at stake here is accountability, the same obligation and degree of accountability as applies to any other citizen. Mr. O'Flaherty must be rendered accountable for the very serious charge of which he stands indicted by the Chief Justice, that he damaged the administration of justice. Just as it would be very wrong for the State to fail to act if an ordinary citizen deliberately perverted the course of justice, likewise, it is incumbent on the State to apply the law in this instance and to ensure that Mr. O'Flaherty is answerable before the law. He was not exercising a judicial function. He is, therefore, accountable and answerable before the law of the land, similar to any other citizen.</P>
    <P>I regard Mr. Kelly's position as being completely different because he had judicial function in the case, even though he abused it by exercising it wrongly. One cannot, therefore, under the Constitution impinge on or query his actions inside the realms of the court room. However, <Col N="293" /> one is entitled to query why a judge of such high standing should uncharacteristically deviate from and set aside the standards he so rigorously applied previously.</P>
    <P>One is entitled to ask Mr. Kelly whether he knew or had any contact with Mr. Sheedy or any member of his family and whether he had been approached by anybody in advance of the case in order to possibly influence him to hear a case over which he knew full well that he did not have seisin. If so, it must be established who approached him. One is further entitled to ask him under oath if there was any contact between him and Mr. O'Flaherty in regard to the case. One is entitled to explore the reason for the unique situation where two judges of such high standing took such a personal interest in the welfare of Mr. Sheedy and if, in advance of the case, there was any contact between Mr. Quinlan and Mr. Kelly, and the possibility of asking Mr. Kelly to explain the reason for the difference between his version of events and that of Mr. Justice Joseph Matthews. One is also entitled to ask Mr. Kelly to spell out in detail his involvement in and knowledge of the case in so far as they did not in any way trespass into the domain of his judicial function.</P>
    <P>We again commend Mr. Michael Quinlan for his willingness to make himself available to the joint committee. While the former County Registrar erred grievously in having the case listed, he is, nonetheless, to a certain extent a victim in that it can be presumed that when approached by a judge of the Supreme Court to list the case he must have felt that he was compromised and under pressure. This is acknowledged in the Chief Justice's report where he concludes:</P>
    <P>I am satisfied therefore that had Mr. Justice O'Flaherty not spoken to the County Registrar, he the County Registrar would not have telephoned the accused's Solicitor and opened the possibility of the case being re-listed.</P>
    <P>Mr. Quinlan's evidence could well be crucial in unravelling some of the unexplored aspects of the case.</P>
    <P>The letter of 12 April 1999 from Mr. Michael Staines, solicitor for Philip Sheedy, to the Chief Justice is of particular significance. Mr. Staines recounts in it the telephone call he received from Michael Quinlan querying when he would make application for a review of sentence for Philip Sheedy and emphasising that Mr. Justice Cyril Kelly was awaiting the application. Mr. Staines stated: &ldquo;I asked Michael Quinlan what this was all about and he indicated to me: &lsquo;You don't want to know&rdquo;'. It is obvious that this is a comment of considerable significance. It may well be that it possibly related to the approach that Mr. Quinlan had received from Supreme Court Judge, Mr. Justice O'Flaherty. However, it must be established whether the comment also implied that <Col N="294" /> other people had made contact with Mr. Quinlan regarding the listing of the case.</P>
    <P>There is an obvious requirement to investigate the roles of other key personalities in the affair. For example, there has been no official investigation of the alleged role of Mr. Ken Anderson. All we have is Mr. O'Flaherty's version of events in which he stated:</P>
    <P>Sometime late last year (probably October), I casually encountered a son of family friends and neighbours, Mr. Ken Anderson who was accompanied by a sister of Mr. Sheedy. This encounter was entirely by chance. They gave me an outline of the facts of Mr. Sheedy's case.</P>
    <P>We do not have Mr. Anderson's version of this chance encounter other than by way of an interview in <i>The Star</i>.</P>
    <P>Again the Chief Justice stated that &ldquo;They gave me an outline of the facts of Mr. Sheedy's case&rdquo;. It is clear from this that Mr. Sheedy's sister had a role in soliciting the assistance of Mr. O'Flaherty in attempting to obtain the early release of her brother. To date nobody has interviewed her in order to establish her version of the event or, indeed, subsequent events. There is also a need to establish the full extent of the role of Mr. Sheedy senior. One can understand the deep concern of a parent whose son faced a protracted spell in prison. It is obvious that he played a pivotal role in contacting a variety of people in order to try and bring about his son's early release from prison. He needs to outline the contacts he made with various persons on his son's behalf in any investigation.</P>
    <P>The absence of the representative of the Chief State Solicitor from the court when the Sheedy case was called was an aspect of the role of the Office of the Chief State's Solicitor which was not investigated. The Chief State Solicitor was represented by Ms Eileen Creedon. According to Michael A. Buckley, Chief State Solicitor, in his letter to the Chief Justice dated 6 April 1999:</P>
    <P>Ms Creedon was called out of court to answer the telephone. While Ms Creedon was absent at the telephone item No. 19 (The Sheedy case) was called by Judge Kelly.</P>
    <P>The transcript of the case ran to only one and a half pages. It could not have taken much more than two minutes. The identity of the person who telephoned Ms Creedon has not been established. What has not been determined, or it certainly has not been made public to date, is whether this telephone call happened to be an unhappy coincidence in terms of timing or whether it was a deliberate decoy in order to ensure that the representative of the Chief State Solicitor's office was absent from Court while the case was being heard. We need to hear from Ms Creedon the circumstances surrounding the telephone call.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="295" /> Most of the investigation of the Chief Justice was concluded by way of written correspondence with the various parties involved. An in-depth oral inquiry is needed, which would enable all the key individuals to whom I have already referred to be questioned in detail about their knowledge of or involvement in the different aspects of the affair. Others who would have to be called before such a process are Mr. Brian McGreary, law clerk in the Chief State Solicitor's office; Mr. S. J. Braonain of the Central Criminal Court; Mr. Brendan O'Donnell of the Circuit Court office; Mr. Michael O'Donnell, Registrar at the Circuit Criminal Court; Mr Luigi Rea, B.L.; Mr. Sheedy's original legal team; and the one which represented him at the controversial hearing on 12 November 1998, including Mr. Michael Staines, his solicitor. The interest in the case of Mr. Sheedy and the involvement of political figures, such as the Taoiseach, former Deputy Jim Tunney, Deputy Brian Lenihan and former councillor Joe Burke would also be of interest to such an investigation.</P>
    <P>Similar to other members of the joint committee, I am deeply disappointed that the Chief Justice has declined to resume his inquiry into the Sheedy affair. He claimed that it would be &ldquo;constitutionally impermissible&rdquo; and &ldquo;improper and inappropriate&rdquo; for him to make any further inquiries into this matter at the request of the committee. The request was motivated in the first instance by an acknowledgement of satisfaction with his original report and, second, with a view to allowing the Judiciary and the bar to deal independently with the issue themselves rather than having judges subjected to scrutiny by an outside or extra-judicial body. Not alone did the Chief Justice decline this option but his curt response to the series of valid questions put to him by the committee was unhelpful and discourteous.</P>
    <P>If he wanted to plead constitutional grounds, he should have done so in advance of writing his report at the Government's request. Having carried out his investigation into the conduct of the two judges while they held office and published his report on 14 April it is illogical and contradictory for him to try and argue that it is constitutionally impermissible for him to inquire further into the matter when both individuals are no longer judges. If he wished to plead constitutional grounds he should have done so immediately on being requested by the Government to investigate the affair. If there was no constitutional impediment in the way of his first investigation, then there is no constitutional difficulty now.</P>
    <P>Having unsuccessfully sought to have the matter investigated by the joint committee where the key persons involved, prompted by the spirit of Mr. O'Flaherty's first letter, would have voluntarily appeared before it, the committee has fur<Col N="296" /> thermore been frustrated by the unco-operative attitude of the Chief Justice. There seems, therefore, to be two remaining options. While one would like to see the joint committee enhancing its role and carrying out the inquiry itself assisted by an amendment to the Committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Compellability, Privileges and lmmunities of Witnesses) Act, 1997, in order to enable the judges to be brought before it, it is questionable as to whether a parliamentary committee would have the time, expertise or resources necessary to bring its inquiries to a speedy conclusion.</P>
    <P>I share Deputy Howlin's view that a tribunal of inquiry would be the best option at this stage and such a tribunal need not be a protracted affair. The number of personalities involved is limited and well known. It should be possible to draw up tightly circumscribed terms of reference and have the entire matter concluded within a matter of weeks. The public interest demands that the truth must be established. The tribunal should be chaired by a judge or a former judge from another jurisdiction. In view of the senior positions of the two former judges, it would be impractical to expect one of their former peers to sit in judgment on their recently departed colleagues. The refusal of co-operation of the Chief Justice also must be a factor.</P>
    <P>A decision from the Government is needed before the end of this debate as to which course of inquiry is envisaged. The joint committee has done the exploratory work. It is now a matter for the Government to recommend and we have no intention of allowing this matter to languish in the sands of time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am extremely dissatisfied with the Minister of State's contribution on behalf of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in response to the report of the Committee on Justice, Equality and Women's Rights. Is this House made up of men and women or of mice? Choices have been put before us by the joint committee which did a great deal of work on this issue. Others also did much work on it, options were put in good faith before the House and we expected the Minister to make a decision.</P>
      <P>A vote was taken at the committee in which the Opposition indicated its priority, which is a tribunal of inquiry. However, the majority of the committee decided that the report would be laid before the House, with options. The report was laid before the House not in expectation of the type of reply we received from the Minister of State. In effect, she said the Government does not want to know any more and it will not make any further inquiries. It will set up a committee in relation to the courts, but it is afraid to go any further in relation to the investigation of the specific matters involved in the Sheedy affair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="297" /> The Minister of State said: &ldquo;Even if it were easy to answer these questions, which it is not, there remains the point that the boundaries they seek to push out stray dangerously close to interference with the independence of the Judiciary.&rdquo;  She went on to make other points about being afraid to push out the boundaries on the issue of the separation of powers. The separation of powers serves us well, but not in relation to the points at issue in this debate because we do not have a clear definition of what is a judicial function. This is obvious in the contributions of the Minister of State, Deputy Higgins and Deputy Barnes and in other comments on this matter. We must push out the boundaries and establish the sense in which judges operate within or outside their judicial functions.</P>
    <P>Deputy Higgins referred to Mr. Justice O'Flaherty. It seems clear from the report that it was accepted that Mr. Justice O'Flaherty operated outside his judicial function with regard to his involvement in the case when he requested the registrar to relist it. We must bite the bullet on this issue. I am extremely disappointed because it appears the Government will allow the report to sit on a shelf and that it will do nothing. This is unacceptable. In common with Deputy Higgins, I also call for a public inquiry into this affair.</P>
    <P>On foot of the report from the committee, the onus is on the Government to choose how best to proceed. However, there can be no hiding from the seriousness of the affair. Effectively, the Chief Justice elect, a High Court judge and a senior court official were forced to resign after a damning report from the Chief Justice. It is an event without precedent in the State's history and we need to get to the bottom of it. The Government has rejected our suggested approach. We accept that it was not without legal difficulty, but given the absence of prior definitive legal opinion in this area, no approach would be watertight.</P>
    <P>This affair has done serious damage to the perception of the administration of justice. When the story broke, we as politicians indicated our determination not only to find out how the judges acted but why they acted as they did. This obligation still holds. Tomorrow the Government will force through generous pension arrangements for the two judges involved. There appears to be a sense within the Judiciary that now the boil has been lanced, namely, the two judges have been removed, they are happy to leave it at that. However, the public is owed more. A tribunal with limited terms of reference is not perfect, but it is the best way forward. If the Government does not agree, it should come up with a better alternative. If the possibility of legal action arising from the inquiries of a tribunal acts as a bar to its establishment, none of the tribunals currently under way would have got off the ground. Perhaps that is what the Government wants.</P>
    <P>Deputy Higgins referred in detail to the various <Col N="298" /> questions which arise in relation to Mr. Justice O'Flaherty, Mr. Justice Kelly, Judge Matthews, Mr. Quinlan, the Chief State Solicitor's report and Ms Creedon who represented the Chief State Solicitor at the trial in question. Deputy Higgins referred to the fact that the transcript only ran to one and a half pages and that the Chief Justice was able to report up to a certain point but felt unable to go further. There are many unanswered questions, including those of accountability, and we have a duty to find answers to these questions. If this means the courts questioning what is a judicial function, so be it. I brought along a copy of the Constitution because we are being asked to accept that Article 35 of the Constitution is the basis for the view that we as parliamentarians are not competent to decide if something is a judicial function. Perhaps we are not competent, but I have not heard much comment from the Judiciary or the legal profession generally on the general and important issues which arise in this case.</P>
    <P>Articles 34 to 38 of the Constitution deal with the courts and justice. Article 35.1 states: &ldquo;The judges of the Supreme Court, the High Court and all other courts established in pursuance of Article 34 hereof shall be appointed by the President.&rdquo;  Article 35.2 states: &ldquo;All judges shall be independent in the exercise of their judicial functions and subject only to this Constitution and the law.&rdquo;  The Article also deals with the process of how a judge of the Supreme Court or the High Court can be removed from office for stated misbehaviour or incapacity upon a resolution of the Dáil and Seanad.</P>
    <P>I am not a constitutional expert but these provisions are vague. If the Constitution has not been interpreted by the courts in this regard, there is an onus on us to ensure that a process is put in place where this interpretation can be made. Otherwise, these questions will be left hanging in the air. Another issue which is left hanging is whether one has more access to justice if one can strike up a conversation with a judge and if, as a result of that conversation, one can hope something will happen in relation to how one's case is listed. This issue forms part of the background to this matter and it must be investigated in the interest of public confidence that justice is done and seen to be done. It is a serious issue to leave in the background without trying to find out why the events happened as they did in this case.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State mentioned the Constitution and said it is robust. She said it has served us well and the Government was unwilling to open it up in any way. However, it is being opened. A committee is considering the Constitution at present. There are people in wheelchairs demonstrating outside Leinster House this evening. When the House was dealing with the Employment Equality Act, the Constitution did not appear to allow us ensure that such people <Col N="299" /> would always have access to work even if there was a cost to the property owner or person offering the job. There is nothing wrong with questioning the Constitution if we believe areas of it may need to be amended. The Constitution has been in existence for many years and it is in order to question it and consider if parts of it need to be improved.</P>
    <P>The great number of questions which arise in this matter were not in any way answered by the Minister of State. I do not understand the purpose of the Biblical quotation at the end of her speech about seeing through a glass darkly. I did not know the Minister of State intended to quote from St. Paul's Epistle to the Corinthians, Chapter 13, but if I recollect it correctly it states:</P>
    <P>When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I thought as a child, I understood as a child, but when I became a man, I put away childish things. Now we see through a glass darkly, then face to face. Now I know in part and then shall I know even as also I am known.</P>
    <P>I am not sure that is entirely correct but it is my recollection of the quotation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>One could use other parts of the quotation and say that now I know in part, but then shall I know even as also I am known. That part of the quotation refers to going to heaven, but one could say that we know in part but there is a great deal that we do not know. It appears to the Opposition that the only way we will know the full details of this case is by having the courage to suggest a limited tribunal of inquiry. The Minister said there were difficulties with having it chaired by someone from another jurisdiction but did not indicate what those difficulties might be &ndash; she merely threw that statement into the air. I would like a response to that also.</P>
      <P>There is anger among the Opposition at the tone of the Minister's response and its failure to address the issues still outstanding in the Sheedy case. We agree with the suggestion that we examine the courts, but it is not suggested how we should deal with the Sheedy case. We accept there are difficulties but feel the only way to deal with them is to allow them to be opened up to examination by a tribunal of inquiry or the courts. It may involve amending the compellability legislation but so be it &ndash; we need to find out what was happening, to ensure we get clear answers in areas where judicial function is blurred, and to ensure the public is satisfied that justice is done and is seen to be done.</P>

      <P>In its conclusions, the committee's report states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="300" /> The committee has now reviewed these options and considers that the authority and powers currently available to it will not enable it to obtain additional information in relation to the facts surrounding the early release from prison of Mr. Sheedy.</P>
    <P>The committee could have reached that conclusion at the beginning by looking at its terms of reference. Nothing in those terms, under any interpretation, would empower, enable or entitle the committee to raise a range of issues such as they have now raised. The notion that former judges should be brought before the committee is utterly outside its terms of reference. Many of the matters in which its members have engaged in public controversy are not based on its authority as a committee of this House.</P>
    <P>Its members are so frustrated in not knowing or understanding their terms of reference that they use the most unqualified words of criticism in all directions. The Chief Justice is described as unco-operative. I also heard Deputy Higgins say something which he might like to consider on reflection. I did not intervene at the time and I trust he will give me the same courtesy. He quotes the Chief Justice as saying &ldquo;these two judges played key roles in the perversion of justice&rdquo;. That is an outrageous distortion and implication. The Chief Justice did not say any such thing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins (Mayo) Mr. Higgins (Mayo)">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not be interrupted. The Deputy who has attributed to the Chief Justice the opinion that those judges played key roles in the perversion of justice should acknowledge that this is not only a total distortion of what he said and a falsehood but also a gross intrusion on the independence of the Judiciary, which he seeks to call into question.</P>
      <P>These are serious issues. The separation of powers is written into our Constitution for good, valid and sufficient reasons and until recent months, this House and the people we represent were satisfied, confident and comfortable in this separation. The relevant Article of the Constitution properly insists that the Judiciary shall be independent in the exercise of its functions. That has been the bulwark of the Constitution under which we serve. All of us recognise that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For one reason or another, the Chief Justice was not able to reply to the committee chairman's letter seeking advice, suggestions, or co-operation. That has been used in this House as a reason to attack the Chief Justice and the courts for not being co-operative, to distort and misrepresent what the Chief Justice said, and to imply that he said these two former judges played key roles in the perversion of justice. That is disgrace<Col N="301" /> ful. If Members feel frustrated that they cannot get to the root of the matter we should look at the terms of reference of the Oireachtas and the committee which feels so frustrated. Did we ever imagine that a committee chairman would write to the Chief Justice asking for his co-operation? Is there the slightest tither of awareness on that committee, of the separation of powers in our Constitution? I am further astounded that the Chief Justice is then accused of being unco-operative. This is unbelievable. Whatever frustrations individuals may feel about this sad and tragic event, it is no basis for misquoting, distorting, and undermining our most fundamental constitutional foundation, the separation of powers.</P>
    <P>If we address these issues again at any point we must first look at our own powers and terms of reference. Then there would be no danger that we would call into question the independence of the Judiciary, much less try to involve them in political barnstorming or using such outrageous expressions as Deputy Higgins has, namely, &ldquo;played key roles in the perversion of justice&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>Having participated as a member of the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Women's Rights in the investigation of the Philip Sheedy affair, it is disappointing to have to speak on a report which is mostly if not all about failure. Two facts are clear from the report. First, that the committee under the vice-chairmanship of my colleague, Deputy Barnes, did everything possible and explored every avenue open to it under its terms of reference to get the full facts of this mysterious case. Deputy Barnes and the committee deserve to be congratulated on their efforts. Second, the committee failed in spite of all these efforts. We are commenting on and evaluating a report which, unfortunately, details our failure to do our business as we wanted. It speaks volumes of the powers of or, rather, the constraints not only on the committee system but on this House to investigate and to satisfy public disquiet and alarm on this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Rightly, it was the committee's intention to determine what lessons might be learned and the procedures and policies which might be identified and recommended to avoid a repetition of what <Col N="302" /> occurred. It sought additional information. It is disappointing that it was forced to conclude:</P>
    <P>The committee . . . considers that the authority and powers currently available to it will not enable it to obtain additional information in relation to the facts surrounding the early release from prison of Mr. Sheedy.</P>
    <P>It is more than depressing to read the report's conclusions. Almost every paragraph is littered with words and phrases such as &ldquo;failure&rdquo;, &ldquo;impossible to achieve&rdquo;, &ldquo;unable to get co-operation&rdquo; and &ldquo;regrets&rdquo;. Despite the unsatisfactory nature of the report, the committee should be congratulated on its untiring and determined efforts to investigate and get to the roots of this mysterious case. We failed, but the question we must ask in the House tonight is, where do we go from here? Do we do what the Minister said, look to the future and move on? We should never do that. The Government has a moral responsibility to investigate the reason justice for Philip Sheedy is different from justice for others. The very basis of our judicial system has been undermined by this episode.</P>
    <P>We can pose many complex questions this evening, whether they be constitutional or judicial in manner, but I want to pose three simple questions. First, who is this man? He is supposed to be an ordinary citizen, yet everybody, from the highest level of the Judiciary to politicians, jumped through every loop to get him out of prison. Second, why are those involved in the case so reluctant to tell all? Third, why is the Minister so anxious to move on? If the answers to these questions are simple, why are we not getting them? If the answers to the three questions I have posed are not simple, we should not move on.</P>
    <P>I want to comment on the attempt by the Minister to use the Bible to try to justify burying this episode. He said that the Bible states: &ldquo;From now we see through a glass darkly&rdquo;. I remind the Minister that the Bible also states: &ldquo;Where there is darkness, let us show light&rdquo;. The Minister's determination to move on and bury this episode raises serious questions. Unanswered questions leave all of us in this House and the general public very uneasy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to respond. I join with everyone else in expressing disappointment with the speech read by the Minister of State on behalf of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. I shall deal with the outburst by Deputy O'Kennedy later, but if that is an example of the arrogance of the judicial profession, is it any wonder there is such anger and concern both inside and outside this House? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am astonished that the Minister would turn down the two options left open not just to the committee but to these Houses. We are talking <Col N="303" /> about the status of this House. I remind everyone that we are the elected Members of a democratic Republic. We represent the citizens and their rights and it is our job to ensure there is accountability on the part of every institution of this State. If we are not prepared to do that, or if we say that some other institution has superior rights to silence us or prevent us asking questions, there is something wrong with our democracy. There are more serious questions to be answered than when we started this debate.</P>
    <P>I am astonished that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform should say that our robust 1937 Constitution can address the needs, the accountability and the educated views of those outside this House. Much of that Constitution has stood us well, but it is a reflection of the 1930s which has no bearing on us on the brink of a new millennium.</P>
    <P>I have struggled with many others both inside and outside this House to hold referenda on the Constitution to give us various rights regarding housing, the disabled etc. As for women and their role, we are still suffering from sections 40 and 41 of the glorious Constitution of 1937.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has responsibility for at least communicating with the Oireachtas committee on constitutional reform and review. If this is the attitude he expresses towards its members, why do they bother to sit? Why did we set up a review commission headed by the eminent T. K. Whitaker, who made dozens of recommendations, if we did not believe that our Constitution needed to be examined and amended? That is the most depressing message we have received tonight.</P>
    <P>I resent the tone and the attitude exemplified by Deputy O'Kennedy who treated those of us on this side of the House as if we had no competence or confidence and no sense of the importance of understanding the separation of powers of the Judiciary and the Executive. I remind Deputy O'Kennedy that he and others in his profession in the law courts make their fortunes out of taking different interpretations from the Constitution and legislation enacted in this House.</P>
    <P>I want to read something into the record, and I hope Deputy O'Kennedy gets an opportunity to read it &ndash; he does not appear to have got an opportunity to read the other reports. The eminent senior counsel who instructed our committee &ndash; this is in favour of the 1937 Constitution &ndash; stated:</P>
    <P>There is an additional word inserted in the 1937 Constitution as opposed to the 1922 Constitution. The word &ldquo;judicial&rdquo; is placed before &ldquo;functions&rdquo; in the 1937 Constitution. In the light of the insertion of the additional word &ldquo;judicial&rdquo;, and based upon a literal reading of Article 35.2, it would appear that an inquiry of a judge or of a former judge of matters relating <Col N="304" /> to events not connected with that person's judicial functions would not be covered by Article 35.2. The article in the Constitution protects the independence of judges in relation to the exercise of their judicial functions and not generally.</P>
    <P>I rest my case.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Death Sentence on Kurdish Leader.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me speak on this important subject. I am pleased that you gave it priority on the Adjournment. It is an indication that you share the concern of the Irish people. Abdullah Ocalan has been condemned to death by hanging. It is important that the Irish people, through their representatives in Dáil Éireann, voice their total opposition to this death sentence. It is essential that the Irish people are unified in ensuring that this death sentence is commuted.</P>
      <P>Three people were appointed as judges in this case, one of whom is a military officer. I was concerned that family members of the people who had died in the conflict were allowed to wave flags in court and produce pictures of the deceased. There was also a very intensive campaign before people were brought across to the island of Imrali for the trial. It is essential that we condemn terrorism, and while it is important that we do so, the Turkish Government should not carry out the death penalty at this time. Were the death penalty carried out, it would inflame passions, not just in southeast Turkey but from central Europe to the Middle East. It would create a very dangerous scenario.</P>
      <P>The death penalty has not been carried out in Turkey since 1984 and it is essential it is not carried out in this instance. The House will be aware that in May a Turkish State security court handed down a death sentence on the Kurdish guerrilla commander, Semdin Sakik, who is a former deputy to Abdullah Ocalan. Mr. Sadik's brother, Arif Sakik, was also sentenced to death. This means that there are three people facing the death penalty in Turkey.</P>
      <P>Turkey is a member of the Council of Europe and I am proud to represent my party on that body's legal affairs committee. All Irish representatives on the Council of Europe are opposed to this death penalty; the Council itself opposes the death penalty at all times. Turkey has applied to join the European Union and I believe its application was welcomed and is highly regarded. However, one of the standards of civilisation is that a Government does not impose the death penalty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="305" /> I am sure other European Parliaments will join us in calling upon the Turkish Government to ensure that the death penalty is not applied to Abdullah Ocalan and the Sakik brothers. To carry out the death penalty would be wrong and a retrograde step. I hope the Minister for Foreign Affairs, his Department and this House communicate our objections to this sentence to the Turkish Ambassador to Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NedOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. N. O'Keeffe Mr. N. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. N. O'Keeffe)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government regrets that the death sentence has been passed on Abdullah Ocalan by the State Security court of Ankara earlier today and joins the international community in appealing for clemency. Ireland also associates itself with the declaration of the EU Presidency on the outcome of the Ocalan trial.</P>
      <P>The Government's opposition to capital punishment as a matter of principle, irrespective of the defendant and the offence of which he is convicted, is well known. As the Minister for Foreign Affairs made clear in the Seanad earlier this year, it is the deeply held view of this Government and that of the other member states of the European Union that the abolition of the death penalty contributes to the enhancement of human dignity and the progressive development of human rights. For those reasons, we and our partners are working assiduously towards the universal abolition of the death penalty. As the Minister for Foreign Affairs said: &ldquo;the continued use of the death penalty diminishes us all&rdquo;. Ireland has been following the trial of Abdullah Ocalan closely and a representative of the Irish Embassy in Ankara was present at today's proceedings. Earlier, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, together with our EU partners, called on Turkey to ensure a free and fair trial for Mr. Ocalan. On the occasion of the visit to Dublin of Speaker Cetin of the Turkish Grand National Assembly, the Minister for Foreign Affairs emphasised Ireland's concern to see fair and correct treatment for Mr. Ocalan and an open trial according to the rule of law before an independent court, with access to legal counsel of his choice and with international observers admitted to the trial. He also stressed Ireland's strict opposition to the death penalty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government understands that Mr. Ocalan's lawyers have already given notice that they intend to appeal the decision of the Ankara State security court. This appeal will be made in the first instance, to the higher court of appeals in Turkey. If the appeal fails at that level it will be submitted to Parliament where it will be considered by a Parliamentary Committee and, if that committee so decides, by plenary. Ultimately a decision to carry out the sentence would require the consent of the President. In addition to these domestic remedies, Mr. Ocalan's lawyers have <Col N="306" /> also indicated that they intend to appeal to the European Court of Human Rights.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that the death penalty has not been implemented in Turkey for the past 15 years, as Deputy Enright said. This is a significant achievement. Ireland would very much hope that Turkey's existing moratorium on execution would be maintained pending the early abolition of the death penalty. As the Council of Europe has recently recalled, President Demirel joined all the other heads of State and Government of the Council of Europe at the Strasbourg Summit in 1997 in a pledge to abolish the death penalty and, pending that, to uphold existing moratoria on executions.</P>
    <P>The capture and trial of Abdullah Ocalan attracted widespread attention in the international community and presented Turkey with a difficult and sensitive case. Mr. Ocalan was arrested in mid-February in Kenya and, following charges of treason, separatism and murder, was incarcerated on the island-prison of Imrali. On 3 March, the Turkish authorities granted unrestricted access to Mr. Ocalan in Imrali prison to representatives of the Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly. The delegation declared itself satisfied that Mr. Ocalan was not at risk of physical ill treatment and from interviews with Mr. Ocalan and the three doctors attending him was satisfied that his physical health was good. However, they expressed some unease about his psychological health and recommended that he be provided with a radio, newspapers and books. Following the delegation's visit, a number of recommendations were accepted by the Turkish authorities.</P>
    <P>Mr. Ocalan's trial opened before a State security court comprising two civilian judges and one military officer on 31 May with a reading by the prosecution of a 139 page indictment accusing Mr. Ocalan of treason, separatist activities and murder. The trial was adjourned on 8 June to allow Mr. Ocalan's defence team to prepare their case. On 18 June, in a move which was widely welcomed by the international community, the Turkish Parliament adopted a constitutional amendment removing military members from all State security courts in accordance with a European Court of Human Rights's ruling.</P>
    <P>Mr. Ocalan's trial resumed on 23 June when the defence team presented their case before three civilian judges. Following a further adjournment, the Court met again this morning when the presiding judge pronounced the verdict on Abdullah Ocalan, sentencing him to death on charges of treason, separatism and murder. In his statement the presiding judge is reported as saying:</P>
    <P>the Court has decided unanimously to condemn the defendant to death since Ocalan's crime of aiming to divide Turkish territory by <Col N="307" /> orders he gave to the PKK and the decisions he took are established without doubt.</P>
    <P>On the grounds that the PKK's acts had claimed &ldquo;the lives of thousands of innocent people&rdquo; it is understood that the judge also refused to commute the sentence to life imprisonment under Article 59 of the Turkish Penal Code as requested by the defence team. In Mr. Ocalan's final statement to the court he is reported to have said that he did not accept the treason charges although earlier in the trial he is reported to have accepted all charges against him but had asked to be allowed to live to mediate peace between PKK rebels and the Turkish State.</P>
    <P>Ireland, and its partners in the European Union, continue to be concerned by the Kurdish question. Since 1984 more than 30,000 people have died in fighting between the Turkish Army and the PKK. The EU has indicated that it upholds the territorial integrity of Turkey and utterly condemns terrorism. However, it has made clear to Turkey that the fight against terrorism must be conducted with due respect for human rights and the rule of law.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. D. Carey Mr. D. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I raise an important matter for County Clare farmers. I refer to the five month delay in REPS payments in County Clare. The previous Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Yates, established a charter of rights for farmers which would have enhanced the rates of EU grants to farmers. The charter brought about a great improvement in the relationship between farmers and the staff of the Department of Agriculture and Food where there was a change of attitude towards farmers. There now appears to be an industrial relations problem in the Department and I plead with the Minister to resolve this difficulty, even if doing so costs money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="308" /> While I acknowledge the response of the Minister and the Department to the crisis caused by last year's wet weather and the resulting shortage of fodder, the delay in payments under the REP scheme is causing great hardship. Farmers have invested heavily in slatted houses and other pollution control measures and are now kept waiting for payment. The editor of the <i>Farmers Journal </i>said in last week's issue that last year was a profitless year for cattle and beef feeders. It is generally acknowledged that there is a very small profit margin in farming. Farmers who have borrowed to make the required improvements are being charged interest rates of between 11 and 15 per cent. If the weather was good and cattle prices very high, farmers would not complain about a five month delay in grant payments, but the Minister must agree that the delay in payments is causing great hardship in a year when farmers are experiencing a huge shortage of income.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to resolve the dispute in his Department, if necessary by calling in a third party. Farmers' representatives spoke to the Minister about this matter and a slight improvement followed. However, 1,300 applicants still await payment. It has been claimed that approximately one fifth of the total payments have been paid and the Minister claimed, in reply to a parliamentary question, that half had been paid. Approximately 1,300 small farmers who have made no profit in a year of dreadful weather still wait to be paid.</P>
    <P>If we wish to see an adequate response to problems such as farmyard pollution, we must look after farmers, who have invested heavily, in this time of need by improving the rate of payment and making those payments on demand, as was promised in the charter of rights.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NedOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. N. O'Keeffe Mr. N. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Carey for raising this matter on the Adjournment, although as usual he has highly exaggerated the situation. The position is that Ireland's performance in delivering direct payments to farmers under EU headage and premium schemes is among the best in the EU and compares very favourably with that of other member states. For most schemes Ireland rated between first and fifth among the 15 member states in terms of early payment in the 1997-98 scheme year. Ireland was first in the arable aid and ewe premium schemes, third in the suckler cow scheme and fifth in the special beef premium scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the 1998 headage and premium schemes, more than £768 million has been paid, of which £35 million went to farmers in County Clare. Payments under the 1998 schemes were made in line with the payment targets set out in the charter of rights for farmers. The Government implemented the charter of rights when it took office. It has made major improvements in the payment of all schemes and has had great suc<Col N="309" /> cess in that area. I visited County Clare on a number of occasions. I have been to the Clare County Show on two occasions and I have heard no claims such as those made by Deputy Carey.  The most recent payments were in respect of 1998 extensification premiums under which £75 million has been paid in the last month or so. A new scheme to combat pollution was introduced last week and was widely welcomed.</P>

      <P>The scheme was announced last week and anyone interested in it should consult his or her local farm development officer after next Monday. Schemes for dairy hygiene and installation aid have also been introduced. The Government is moving progressively in making payments to farmers. We know and understand the needs of farmers, especially the farmers referred to by Deputy Carey. Payments under all the 1998 schemes have now been made in all eligible cases, in line with EU regulations and the charter of rights for famers which require that these payments be completed by 30 June 1999.</P>
      <P>The position with regard to the 1999 scheme is that, to date, £59 million has been paid to Irish farmers. These 1999 payments represent, in the main, payments of the first instalment of the 1999 ewe premium and payments under the 1999 deseasonalisation slaughter premium scheme. Over £41 million was paid to Irish sheep farmers, representing the first instalment of the 1999 ewe premium. These payments were made at the earliest possible date consistent with EU regulations and will ensure that Ireland will again rank number one among the 15 member states in terms of early payment of this scheme.</P>
      <P>There was, unfortunately, some delay earlier this year in processing REP scheme applications in County Clare. My Department has addressed this issue in recent months and considerable progress has been made, particularly in the past six weeks. The progress has been facilitated by drafting in additional staff to County Clare and these will remain in place as long as necessary.</P>
      <P>Direct payments constituted 56 per cent of farmers' income in 1998 and this proportion is set to increase in the coming years, following the successful outcome of the Agenda 2000 negotiations. It is my objective that the improvements in delivery of these payments which has been achieved in recent years are built on and that the service provided by my Department to farmers is efficient, fair, friendly and transparent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amounts paid to farmers in County Clare under 1998 headage and premia schemes are as follows: cattle headage-beef cow, £8.6 million; sheep headage, including top-up, £164,000; suck<Col N="310" /> ler cow premium, £11.490 million; equine headage, £58,000; special beef premium, £6.690 million; goat headage, £5,000; slaughter premium, £300,000; ewe premium, £1.074 million; extensification premium, £5.443 million; arable aid, £16,000; BSE-agrimonetary package, £1.009 million; winter fodder, £1.234 million; winter fodder top-up, £549,000.</P>
    <P>The total amount paid under 1998 schemes on 29 June 1999 was £35.115 million. The amounts paid in County Clare under 1999 headage and premia schemes are as follows: slaughter premium, £119,000; ewe premium, £447,000; winter fodder, £298,000. The total amount paid for 1999 schemes on 29 June 1999 was £566,000. The figures are on the record of the House and Deputy Carey may announce them on local radio in County Clare.</P>
    <P>This shows the successful service provided by the Government to agriculture in Deputy Carey's county. The results of the local elections show how successful the Government's performance is.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny)</i>
        <b>:</b> I thank the Chair for allowing me raise this important matter. I am amazed that it will be responded to by the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food, Deputy O'Keeffe, who seems to be a Minister for all seasons and who responds to debates on everything from headage payments to hanging.</P>
      <P>When Joe Connolly founded the Community Games it must have been beyond his wildest dreams that it would now cater for 500,000 children who come from every parish. He could not have envisaged the superb organisational skills of thousands of volunteers who took up the torch to help future international stars develop their potential and, more important, to help those less talented develop an interest in sporting activity which sustains them through life. That activity may not revolve around the routine sports of hurling, football and athletics but involves chess, draughts, clay modelling and choir singing. These activities have given a wonderful opportunity to people with talent.</P>
      <P>Joe Connolly could not anticipate the failure to have this fantastic work recognised and rewarded by the State. The grant of £130,000 to the Community Games organisation represents a payment of 25p per child. Does this represent the value put on the unselfish work of thousands of volunteers at parish, county and national levels at great personal cost to themselves? How much money is collected by the State in VAT alone through sales of petrol and all types of sports equipment to those involved in the games? The motto of the Community Games is <i>mens sana in corpore sano</i>. In this age of drugs and crime what could be more apt?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="311" /> It costs £53,000 to keep a prisoner in jail for one year according to figures supplied last week and £80,000 to keep a juvenile in Oberstown House. Since many re-offend, the cost to the Exchequer is great. This compares with £130,000 given to an organisation that caters for 500,000 juveniles throughout the country. There is something wrong when two juvenile offenders or three adult prisoners cost the State more than the Exchequer contributed to the Community Games.</P>
    <P>Surely it is time to accept that prevention is better and cheaper than cure. Surely it is also time to say thanks to all those volunteers who give their time and money in helping others develop interests to sustain them through life. Is anything more important than giving young people an interest and keeping them occupied? It is time the Government said thanks in a very tangible way by giving an extra financial contribution to an organisation which does so much to help so many. We offend those unselfish, unpaid and sometimes unappreciated people at the risk of bringing so much community work to a halt, a situation we must avoid at all costs.</P>
    <P>Last Sunday I attended our county Community Games finals and the press conference of the Leinster branch on Monday night, and I met people who are spending much of their own money and who are very unhappy with what is happening. I hope the Minister for all seasons will have good news for the organisation.</P>

      <P>I do not mind how the Deputy refers to me &ndash; I am doing the business I am charged with doing. I thank the Deputy for raising the funding of the Community Games organisation. The Community Games, now in its thirty second year, is an important organisation which promotes and encourages sporting activity among young people in Ireland.</P>
      <P>The games have been of great benefit to communities throughout the length and breadth of the country and provide numerous young people, both male and female, with a constructive outlet for their energies which may help them avoid becoming involved in anti-social behaviour. In fact up to 500,000 children participate in the Community Games each year. The organisation encourages participation and involvement in a wide range of different sports and cultural activities in a friendly and not excessively competitive environment.</P>
      <P>The Community Games operates on an area, county, provincial and national level. The area is the basic unit and can be a local, community, urban district, small town or village with a population up to 6,000. There are currently more than 800 areas active in Community Games.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Community Games are probably best known for their Olympic style national finals festival <Col N="312" /> which is held each autumn in Mosney Holiday Centre. There are 26 sporting and cultural activities on the national programme. Approximately 7,500 competitors reach the national finals following qualification at local and regional level.</P>
    <P>The Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation provides an annual grant to the Community Games organisation towards areas of expenditure such as administration, organisation, development and equipment. In 1999 the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation approved the allocation of a grant of £129,570 to the organisation which represents one of the largest individual grants to a governing body of sport under this scheme. This is supplemented at local level by grants from various vocational education committees under the youth and sport grant scheme administered by the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation. It is estimated that this further funding is in the order of £30,000 per annum.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that from next Thursday, 1 July 1999, the Irish Sports Council will be established on a statutory basis and that under the recently enacted sports council legislation responsibility for matters such as the funding of national governing bodies of sport will come within the council's statutory remit. I wish to assure the Deputy that I will bring the issues raised by him in relation to this organisation to the attention of the Minister, Deputy McDaid, and of the Irish Sports Council and I am confident that the council will bear these in mind when consideration is being given to the funding of governing bodies of sport in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for allowing me raise this issue. I have been a public representative since 1984 and have handled many, cases, both in the House and outside, of injustice and infringements by official bodies. I remind the House that for a long time I was involved with the Irish Commission for Justice and Peace. I was involved in the Birmingham Six and other famous cases in the UK. However, I have never witnessed a case which so sickens me as the manner in which a child's well-being has been handled by the Eastern Health Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I pay generous tribute to the Minister who has listened very carefully to me on more than one occasion. This is an extraordinary case which illustrates a major problem in child care legislation. It shows, for example, that there is a need for a family advocate to support families who find <Col N="313" /> themselves in crisis and pitted against the might of health boards.</P>
    <P>In this case a family sought help from the Eastern Health Board. They accepted there was a problem &ndash; this was never in question. However, the family ended up not getting the help it sought but losing a child they loved. The mother and father of the child went to the Eastern Health Board because they felt a problem existed. They sought counselling. Instead of getting counselling, their child has been in the &ldquo;care&rdquo; of the Eastern Health Board since Christmas Eve 1996 when officials of the board used the Garda Síochána to enter the house with force and take the child away. There are two other children in this case.</P>
    <P>There are many facts in the case which give me reason for concern, namely, the manner in which the health board dealt with the family in the first instance; the extraordinary manner in which the child was taken and the force used on that Christmas Eve; the number of movements of the child when she first came into the care of the health board; the contradictory and extraordinary versions of the story of the child given to different members of the Eastern Health Board over a period, including myself, in response to questions raised by members of the board about her welfare and the facts of the case; and the extraordinary manner in which the Eastern Health Board has been handling the fostering of the child.</P>
    <P>Last year the grandparents of the child sought to have her placed in their foster care. This was rejected on the basis they were &ldquo;too old&rdquo; and in poor health. The grandmother of the child is a very sprightly and fine woman who works in a nursing home and cares for her own family. There is no doubt but that she would make a very fine foster mother for her own grandchild. The grandfather of this child is a CE scheme supervisor, dealing on occasions with very difficult young men. He has had a heart by-pass operation but there are many people in the State who have had such operations and who go on to lead full and active lives.</P>
    <P>After my first contact with the Minister of State Deputy Fahey late last year, the question of foster care by the grandparents was reactivated, and I thank the Minister for that. However, the Eastern Health Board has behaved disgracefully ever since. Documents which were posted to the Eastern Health Board were mysteriously lost or went astray in the post. A further application form for the child's fostering was lodged earlier this year.</P>
    <P>When this issue began to come to the boil again in recent times, there was correspondence between the Minister of State and me and between the parents and other senior political figures in the State.</P>
    <P>An official from the Eastern Health Board visited the grandparents earlier this month and told them that they were wasting their time, the board <Col N="314" /> knew all about the grandfather's health and they might as well save themselves the money and withdraw from the case. The grandparents were distraught, they succumbed to this bully tactic and they gave up in despair.</P>
    <P>They have, however, reactivated their application as of last week. Professionals outside the Eastern Health Board, who have discussed the matter of the fostering of A.K. and the suitability of the grandparents in that regard with me and the grandparents, are fully convinced that the grandparents have the capacity and are suitable to deal with this child.</P>
    <P>The reality in this sad case is that the Eastern Health Board cannot and should not be allowed to continue to operate as a sole agent in the case. I do not believe the reactivated foster care application can be handled by the health board. The health board has operated in a way which prejudices its capacity to be objective. Certainly the health board will not convince me, the child's family or anybody who brings an objective view to bear on this case that it can handle the case objectively or dispassionately. I would ask the Minister of State to ensure that some outside body oversees the manner in which this foster care request is handled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that under the Child Care Act, 1991, the provision of services to individual children is a matter for the health board concerned. In particular, section 39 of the Child Care Act, 1991, and the associated foster care regulations, set out the arrangements for the assessment and approval of foster parents or relatives as foster carers by health boards.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the child in question is under a care order and the subject of ongoing judicial proceedings. All parties are therefore constrained in what they can say in the matter. However, I received a report from the Eastern Health Board regarding the grandparents' request to foster the child and I am very dissatisfied with its contents. The board informs me that the grandparents requested consideration as foster carers. They met a social worker to discuss their application on 15 June and withdrew their application at that meeting. The health board report went on to state that the grandparents have reconsidered their position. Accordingly, the Eastern Health Board has arranged to meet them on Tuesday, 6 July, to recommence the assessment procedure. I will continue to monitor the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fostering is the main service provided to children brought into the care of the State. I am concerned to ensure that the best service is provided. Accordingly, I have established the Foster Care Working Group which is reviewing all aspects of <Col N="315" /> the foster care service. That group is due to report later this year.</P>
    <P>I listened carefully to what Deputy Roche said. I have been concerned about this case for some time since it was brought to my attention by Deputy Roche and social workers who have been deeply concerned about the way the Eastern Health Board handled it. Either the information which Deputy Roche outlined, including what he said here tonight, is incorrect or the Eastern Health Board has given me incorrect information. I would be deeply concerned if the latter were the case.</P>
    <P>This case bothers me more than any other which has come to my attention in my two years as Minister of State. However, the 1991 Act precludes me from getting involved in individual cases. Despite several requests to get to the bottom of the problem in regard to the way this family has been treated, I have failed to get the information I require from the Eastern Health Board. Based on Deputy Roche's information over the past six months and a meeting I had with the family, I am deeply concerned with the way in which this family has been treated by the Eastern Health Board.</P>
    <P>I must pay attention to Deputy Roche when he says that he has not ever seen a case where there has been such an injustice and an infringement of a family's rights. I must be concerned when he compares the injustice in this case to that of the Birmingham Six. I must listen carefully when he says that this case sickens him and that it is an extraordinary case.</P>
    <P>I have known of Deputy Roche's case in regard to this family for quite some time. I sought independent advice on the way in which this family has been treated and am satisfied that there is a <Col N="316" /> very serious case to be answered by the Eastern Health Board. In its reply to the Department tonight, the Eastern Health Board sought to hide behind provisions of the Child Care Act, 1991. Either Deputy Roche put incorrect information on the record tonight in regard to the grandparents' application in this case or I am being given incorrect information by the Eastern Health Board. Deputy Roche said that there have been downright contradictions in the Eastern Health Board's handling of this case. He stated, and I want him to confirm, that the grandfather is a supervisor in a CE scheme.</P>

      <P>My information is that the family concerned withdrew its application. I am informed by Deputy Roche that this file was lost on an occasion. I am informed that in a recent court case several professionals were very concerned about the present arrangements for the foster care of this child. As Minister of State with responsibility for children, I am very concerned about the welfare of this child. I want to assure Deputy Roche that, as far as it is within my power to initiate an examination of the Eastern Health Board's dealings with this case, I will certainly have such an examination carried out. I hope to respond to the Deputy as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>The way this case was handled by the health board makes me deeply concerned about the State's response to a family which feels it has been badly treated by a statutory authority and, therefore, I will bring about fairly drastic action in the coming weeks. If the accusations about the way this family is being treated are correct, this House must look carefully at the question.</P>

      <P>The gas sector is being liberalised pursuant to both domestic and EU legislation. The new competition is expected to affect Bord Gáis Éireann's profit earning capacity in the next few years. In addition, BGE is having to use increasing amounts of natural gas at world market prices with the decline of the Kinsale Head gas field to meet the growing demand for gas. Like any competitive organisation it needs to find new ways of replacing this profit loss through diversification of its activities.</P>
      <P>My Department's strategy statement states that Bord Gáis Éireann, should continue to grow and develop its business and to exploit its assets, where profitable, making adequate returns on capital employed and to exploit new business opportunities where they are profitable and linked to BGE's core business.</P>
      <P>Any specific proposals to diversify by BGE require my approval and that of the Minister for Finance. In that connection, I would have to be satisfied that BGE have the necessary powers and that the project appeared to be commercially sound and would add to the value of the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="318" /> BGE are required to carry out their powers and functions within the parameters of their statutory authority. At present, the relevant legislation applicable to BGE is the Gas Act, 1976, as amended.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 17 and 64 together.</P>
      <P>CIE's main concerns related to the potential overall cost of the project and the possible implications that this might have for the funding of other CIE capital projects. I discussed this matter recently with the CIE chairman. I made it clear to him that the Government remains committed to the enhanced and expanded project approved in May 1998 and that I expect the company to devote all its efforts to the implementation of that project in accordance with the published indicative timetable.</P>
      <P>Under the Transport (Dublin Light Rail) Act, 1996, CIE is given responsibility for procuring the necessary legal powers to provide a light rail system. Once it is granted those powers in a light railway order, it is then responsible for arranging construction, commissioning and operation of the authorised system.</P>
      <P>The most detailed estimate has been prepared by the light rail project team in respect of the recently approved Tallaght to Abbey Street line. This estimate of £183 million is currently being evaluated by Halcrow-McCarthy who are consultants to the light rail monitoring committee. This work is expected to be completed shortly and will provide a firmer basis for future estimates of the cost of the full network.</P>
      <P>It is my intention to then seek Government approval for a firm capital budget for this line and to appraise the Government of the updated overall cost estimates for the project. The cost benefit analysis will also be updated in light of the revised estimates.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>In my reply of 15 June to Parliamentary Question No. 143, I indicated that discussions had taken place between the Department of the Taoiseach and the ICTU prior to the appointment of the directors to the board of Telecom Éireann. Those discussions related specifically to the question of employee representation on the board of Telecom Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was agreed that the general issue of employee representation on the boards of State companies will be the subject of discussion in the context of the post-Partnership 2000 scenario. Any suggestions put forward by the trade unions concerning the role of employee representations <Col N="320" /> in the evolving structure of State companies will be considered in this context.</P>
    <P>The obligations imposed by the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Acts, 1977 and 1988, are no longer appropriate to the status of Telecom Éireann as a publicly quoted company following the initial public offering. However the employees will continue to have a voice in the running of the company by virtue of the employee share ownership plan, ESOP, under which the employee trust is entitled to nominate a director to the board. Mr. Dick Spring has been appointed in this capacity. I should also point out that Mr. Bill Attley, on my nomination, was appointed to the board to fill one of the vacancies created by the resignation of the two worker directors, and their alternates, at the board meeting of 19 May 1999.</P>

      <P>When approving the implementation of the £430 million Railway Safety Programme 1999-2003, the Government also approved an annual Exchequer contribution for five years. The precise amount of that contribution will be determined as soon as an independent review of the scope for revenue generation from CIE's surplus property portfolio has been completed, and a property disposal programme has been agreed.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Exchequer and the EU together are providing a total of some £60 million in 1999 and 2000 for capital expenditure by Iarnród Éireann for improvements to suburban rail.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, my Department is currently examining non-safety related investment proposals submitted by Iarnród Éireann for the seven years up to 2006. These proposals are being considered as part of the strategic transport needs for the country as a whole, in the context of the preparation of the National Development Plan.</P>
      <P>Directive 91/440/EEC, which was transposed into Irish law in 1996, permits limited access to the rail infrastructure of Iarnród Éireann by other railway undertakings. The European Commission recently put forward proposals for further rail liberalisation measures which are currently under discussion at Council of Ministers level.</P>
      <P>However, since the transposition of Directive 91/440/EEC there has been no demand for access to the Irish railway infrastructure. The main reasons which I can suggest for this lack of demand are our physical isolation from the European rail network, technical differences in the rail gauge, our low population base and the uneconomic nature of our rail services.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, Ireland has sought an exemption from some of the more onerous administrative mechanisms under the current EU rail market liberalisation proposals, where those proposals are unlikely to have any practical effect on opening up the Irish rail market.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 24 and 59 together.</P>
      <P>The provision of adequate capacity on our public transport system to meet demand is one of the key objectives of the initiatives being taken by this Government to relieve traffic congestion in Dublin. The Government fully recognises the traffic problems being experienced in Dublin and the fact that future development within the greater Dublin area must be based around public transport. To address this problem and to encourage a shift from private to public transport requires considerable investment and other measures to provide attractive frequent and reliable public transport services.</P>
      <P>The Dublin Transportation Office's Short Term Action Plan, published in September 1998, recommended a number of measures to address the faster than projected growth in traffic and slower than anticipated implementation of key elements of the Dublin Transportation Initiative. I immediately responded to the DTO Short Term Action Plan by approving a total investment of over £80 million of investment in buses and suburban rail. These measures form part of an overall package designed to increase peak hour capacity by 37,000 trips. For the first time, the Exchequer has provided direct capital funding for bus and rail investment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy has particularly referred to quality bus corridors and the DART service. The provision of QBCs was a key recommendation of the Dublin Transportation Initiative. In all, 12 Quality Bus Corridors will be completed by the end of 2000. The need to increase the bus fleet to ensure the effective utilisation of the network of QBCs and to meet capacity requirements has been recognised and approval has already been given for the acquisition by Bus Átha Cliath of 150 <Col N="323" /> additional buses during 1999 at a total cost of approximately £25.5 million.</P>
    <P>So far this year 56 of these buses have been delivered with the remainder being delivered in phases before the end of the year. The 150 buses will provide an additional 9,500 peak hour bus trips &ndash; an increase of 20 per cent. Bus Átha Cliath is also planning to increase capacity through fleet replacement and subcontracting of school bus runs to private bus operators.</P>
    <P>In relation to the DART service I would point out that ten new DART carriages are due for delivery in October and November this year and a further 16 will be delivered by end of 2000.</P>
    <P>These 26 new carriages will be used to enhance existing services and to operate six car train sets. They will also be used to cater for the extended DART network to Malahide and Greystones. They will increase the DART fleet from 80 to 106 carriages &ndash; a 30 per cent increase in capacity.</P>
    <P>My Department is currently considering detailed public transport investment proposals from the Dublin Transportation Office and the CIE companies as part of its preparatory work for the national development plan. I envisage that the plan will set out a comprehensive strategy and investment programme for public transport in the years 2000 to 2006.</P>

      <P>The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, RPII, monitors the effect of discharges from Sellafield on the Irish environment, paying particular attention to those radionuclides which are most likely to be of significance and relevance to Ireland. The actual quantities discharged from Sellafield are measured on site and the data is published by BNFL and the UK authorities.</P>
      <P>I understand from the RPII that tritium is a radionuclide of very low radiotoxicity and is of relatively little relevance to Ireland from the health point of view. The RPII does not monitor tritium levels in air but it does test fish and shellfish samples from the Irish Sea for tritium. In all cases, the tritium levels were below the level of detection. I am advised by the RPII that as tritium is produced in the upper atmosphere due to cosmic radiation and brought to the earth's surface by rainfall, the detection of tritium in Ireland arising from Sellafield atmospheric discharges in the light of the naturally-occurring background levels would be extremely difficult.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="324" /> The RPII is aware that THORP recommenced reprocessing AGR reactor fuel recently but does not consider that the reprocessing of AGR reactor fuel is likely to give rise to incidents to a greater extent than the reprocessing of other types of fuel.</P>
    <P>I am aware that leaks have occurred at Sellafield in the past irrespective of which fuels were being reprocessed. I have expressed the Irish Government's concerns about incidents at Sellafield and have requested UK Ministers to take whatever steps are necessary to ensure the highest standards of safety.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is aware that the provision of telecommunications infrastructure is primarily a matter for operators in the newly liberalised telecommunications market.</P>
      <P>Recognising that in certain regions of the country, competition alone will not provide the required broadband telecommunications infrastructural investment, I recently sought fresh proposals for projects supporting the development of advanced communications networks and services which might be co-funded by the European Union.</P>
      <P>A number of proposals were received, evaluated by independent consultants and recommendations have been made. No proposals were received for the Cavan and Monaghan region in the latest round. Contractual details are currently being finalised with a number of companies. I hope to make an announcement on these projects shortly.</P>
      <P>In addition, my Department, together with Forfás, is currently preparing estimates of further funding requirements to ensure nation-wide broadband connectivity. All regions will be considered in this review.</P>

      <P>The £430 million Railway Safety Programme 1999-2003 is the first tranche of the 15 <Col N="325" /> year safety programme recommended by the IRMS consultants. The track renewal, signalling and other infrastructural works being undertaken in this programme will ensure a high quality railway infrastructure well beyond the 20 year horizon referred to by the Deputy. This investment, while primarily designed for safety purposes, will also provide the basis for expansion and improvements in services, as required.</P>
      <P>The Dublin Transportation Office recently completed its transportation blueprint for the period 2000 to 2006. It will now be continuing with its work on the updating of the DTI strategy to cover the period up to 2016. It expects to complete the updated strategy 2000 to 2016 in March of next year.</P>
      <P>At the request of the Government, CIE will complete a consultancy study by the end of the year on a longer term suburban rail development programme. This study will address a possible new inland rail link to Navan; possible separation of long distance and commuter rail traffic through the construction of by-pass rail lines; quadrupling of existing double lines where feasible; enhancement of rail service to the development centres identified by the strategic planning guidelines.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">

      <P>I have been advised by Aer Lingus that of the 91 TEAM staff who did not accept terms for the transfer of their employment to FLS Aerospace, 30 have licences issued by the Irish Aviation Authority, IAA, and 20 have &ldquo;approvals&rdquo; which is a craft qualification granted by the airline on the basis of satisfying company criteria.</P>
      <P>In relation to the staff who hold licences from the IAA, 22 have been placed in technical jobs matching their skills while one is on long-term sick leave and another seven have been placed in non-technical posts in the airline. The licences of those seven staff are not due to expire until next winter. I understand from Aer Lingus that they will continue their efforts to place these staff in technical positions prior to the expiry of their licences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the 20 staff holding &ldquo;approvals&rdquo; issued by Aer Lingus, four have been placed in technical posts in the airline. Of the remaining staff, 15 are in non-technical posts in the airline and one staff member is on long-term sick leave. The process for renewal of &ldquo;approvals&rdquo; is a mat<Col N="326" /> ter for Aer Lingus. However, I understand that the renewal process is a relatively straightforward one provided the employee concerned had the original qualification.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no plans to alter or amend the manner in which the Director of Telecommunications Regulation will address the issue of television deflectors.</P>
      <P>In May 1999 the director published a consultation paper in which she set out proposals for a licensing system for TV deflectors. I understand that the responses received as a result of that paper are currently being examined by the director. It would, therefore, be inappropriate for me to anticipate the outcome of the director's examination of the issue or to speculate on whether the matter will be brought to Government. I can, however, assure the Deputy that if proposals are made to me, I will give them careful consideration.</P>
      <P>While the issue of television deflectors has not been brought formally to Government since the formation of this Government, I keep my colleagues appropriately briefed on a broad range of issues relating to my Department, in line with general Government practice.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the regulation of television rebroadcasting systems is a matter for the Director of Telecommunications Regulation in accordance with functions transferred to her under the Telecommunications (Miscellan-eous Provisions) Act, 1996 and that representations in regard to the licensing of deflector systems are a matter for the director.</P>

      <P>The cost of the Moriarty tribunal to date is £2.643 million. Details are set out in the following schedule. The daily cost of the <Col N="327" /> tribunal varies, depending on whether it is a public sitting day, which would involve significant administration and other expenses, or whether it is a non-sitting day. The 1999 provision for the tribunal is £4.65 million as set out in the Revised Estimates for my Department. It is not possible to estimate the final cost of the tribunal at this stage, in view of uncertainty with regard to its duration and associated issues. The latest indications are that while there may be some savings on the 1999 estimate, there will be significant costs arising next year, when decisions on the award of costs are likely, to date, 24 parties have been granted representation by the Tribunal. My Department is currently in discussions with the Department of Finance on this matter in the context of the multi-annual budgets for the period 2000-2002.</P>

      <P>I have not received any detailed submission from the area in question. I should also point out that the Government has approved a restructuring of the employment service function under which the local employment service will be coming under the ambit of FÁS. The purpose of this reorganisation is to secure better co-ordination and complementary between the FÁS employment service and the LES; and to ensure, in the context of the further development of the employment service function, the most efficient disposition of resources. I envisage that decisions relating to the expansion of our employment services will be taken in the framework of these new organisational arrangements.</P>

      <Quest> the companies or businesses from which her Department has received most frequent requests under the Freedom of Information Act, 1997, other than requests by businesses for personal information; the general nature of the information sought; and the costs levied on the companies or businesses for the processing of these requests. </Quest>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>As of 25 June 1999 my Department had received a total of 400 requests under the Freedom of Information Act, 1997. The sources of these requests break down <Col N="334" /> as follows: business &ndash; 213, 53.25 per cent; media &ndash; 115, 28.75 per cent; public &ndash; 51, 12.75 per cent; Oireachtas &ndash; 14, 3.50 per cent; staff &ndash; 7, 1.75 per cent.</P>
      <P>By far the most frequent requester has been Acorn Associates-Mr. Michael Grange. This business entity has sought a wide range of information on a variety of topics but the majority of requests relate to prior dealings with FÁS and extensive prior correspondence with my Department and the then Department of Labour. My Department has found it necessary to refuse sixty-four requests from Acorn Associates as frivolous or vexatious.</P>
      <P>Other most frequent requesters are, as one might expect, from the national media. <i>The Irish Times</i> has made 57 requests, <i>The Sunday Times</i> 25 requests, <i>Phoenix</i> six requests, the <i>Sunday Tribune</i> five requests and <i>The Sunday Business Post</i> three requests on a range of topics relating to policy, business and consumer issues of general interest to the public.</P>
      <P>Amárach Consulting has made four requests seeking records relating to social research studies, dealings of my Department with specified companies and broader SME issues.</P>
      <P>An analysis of requests handled by my Department in 1998 suggests an average processing cost of almost £650 per request. The total amount of fees levied and paid by the most frequent requesters from 21 April 1998 and 25 June 1999 is as follows: Acorn Associates &ndash; £35.70; <i>The Irish Times</i>&ndash; £34.10; <i>The Sunday Times</i>&ndash; £39.50; <i>Phoenix</i>&ndash; nil; <i>Sunday Tribune</i>&ndash; £239.40; Amárach Consulting &ndash; nil; <i>The Sunday Business Post</i>&ndash; nil.</P>

      <P>A tripartite working group, including representatives from the social partners and from my Department, has been set up to discuss the measures necessary for the transposition of the EU Directive on Part-Time Working, which must be implemented by 20 January 2000. The working group has commenced its discussions, and further meetings are scheduled to take place shortly.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the directive is to prevent part-time workers from being treated less favourably than full-time workers and, in this regard, it aims to provide for the removal of discrimination against part-time workers and to improve the quality of part-time work generally. The directive is also intended to facilitate the development of part-time work on a voluntary basis and to contribute to the flexible organisation of working time in a manner which takes into account the needs of both employees and employers.</P>

The brown trout population in the Kings River was not apparently affected. In addition to continuing its investigations to establish whether specific contamination or disease problems are the cause of the crayfish mortalities, the fisheries board is working with the relevant agencies to tackle general eutrophication problems in the Kings River.</P>

      <P>The Government is appalled at the atrocities committed in Kosovo, of which the full extent is being increasingly shown every day as further evi<Col N="345" /> dence emerges. The planners and perpetrators of such crimes must be made to answer for them. The Government, together with our EU partners, have made clear that the International Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia will have our full support in carrying out their investigations and prosecuting those responsible. The tribunal is now actively continuing its work of investigation and compilation of evidence, both on the ground in Kosovo and by gathering evidence from refugees. Irish personnel have assisted the tribunal in this work and will continue to do so.</P>
      <P>While the tribunal is, of course, the primary mechanism through which individual responsibility for international crimes committed in Kosovo should be addressed, international law goes further and permits the exercise of universal jurisdiction by states for the most heinous of international crimes. Accordingly, if an alleged perpetrator of international crimes was present in this jurisdiction, he or she could be prosecuted and tried within the Irish justice system in appropriate circumstances, for example under the Genocide Act, 1973.</P>

      <P>Since the coming into effect of the Freedom of Information Act on 21 April 1998, the Department of Foreign Affairs has received a total of 36 requests from companies or businesses seeking records or information of a non-personal nature. Most of these requests have come from the media, with the largest single number of requests being submitted by <i>The Sunday Times,</i> which has made 16 to date. Other media companies which <Col N="346" /> have made more than one FOI request, number of requests made shown in brackets, include RTE, five, <i>Phoenix</i> magazine, three, <i>The Sunday Tribune</i>, two and <i>The Sunday Business Post</i>.</P>
      <P>The requests made by <i>The Sunday Times</i> have covered a wide range of topics, extending from current policy issues to matters relating to the administration of the Department, including official travel and expenses. <i>The Sunday Times</i> has also made requests under the FOI Act for copies of consultancy reports commissioned by the Department as well as details of other FOI requests made to the Department. A similar range of preoccupations has been evident in the requests made by other media companies with most requests focusing on current policy issues, administration and costs of the Department or else details of FOI requests made to the Department. In no case so far has the Department levied charges for the provision of information and/or records to members of the media.</P>
      <P>A number of FOI requests have also been received from consultancy firms. Two requests have been made by the firm Policy Watch while a further two have been received from the firm Amárach. In general, the requests made by these two firms have sought information on the provision of various services, such as telecommunications and computer software, to the Department. A charge of £49.86 was imposed and paid for processing one of the requests submitted by Policy Watch, fees were not levied in the other three cases.</P>

      <Quest>if the embassy in New Delhi has received a reply from the police in Chennai to its letter dated 29 March 1999 requesting a full report on the murder on 31 December 1997 of an Irish citizen (details supplied) in Madras, Chennai, India; if the victim's passport which was stolen at the time has been cancelled; the position in relation to his property; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The report requested by the embassy was received from the police in Chennai, Madras, on 22 June 1999 and the Department of Foreign Affairs has sent a copy of it to the brother of the deceased. The case is still under investigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the passport of the deceased was reported to the Department of Foreign Affairs as having been stolen, details were immediately put in the passport stoplist to prevent anybody else using it in connection with an application for <Col N="353" /> another passport. The stolen passport has not yet been found.</P>
    <P>Items of personal property found in the hotel room of the deceased are being held by the police in the event of somebody being charged with the murder. The Embassy is seeking an explanation of why a list of those items in the police report does not include three items in a list conveyed orally in January 1998.</P>
    <P>The embassy is satisfied that the police investigation is being properly conducted.</P>
    <P>The Department of Foreign Affairs, which is frequently in contact with the brother of the deceased, will continue to monitor developments and to give every appropriate assistance.</P>

For this reason, all attacks or close firings involving our troops are treated with the utmost seriousness and urgency by the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>
      <P>Since the beginning of the year there has been a number of close firing incidents, escalating in frequency and intensity, involving members of the Irish UNIFIL contingent in South Lebanon. These culminated on 31 May in the tragic death of Private William Kedian and the critical wounding of Private Ronnie Rushe.</P>
      <P>The Department of Foreign Affairs maintains close liaison with the Department of Defence in relation to all indiscriminate targeting of Irish members of the UNIFIL contingent. Close liaison is also maintained with the UN authorities both in Lebanon and New York. Whenever such incidents take place, a vigorous protest is lodged with the appropriate government involved. In cases involving armed elements in Lebanon &ndash; namely Hizbollah &ndash; the protest is lodged with the Lebanese Government. In the case of the Israeli Defence Forces and the South Lebanon Army, who are trained, equipped and paid by Israel, the protest is lodged with the Israeli Government. Reflecting the increase in the number of close firings, the number of protests lodged since the beginning of the year has also increased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 11 February, following an incident on 7 February when Israeli Defence Forces-South Lebanon Army fired into the Irish Battalion area of operations, the Department of Foreign Affairs <Col N="354" /> protested in the strongest terms to the Israeli Ambassador in Dublin. On that occasion one mortar round impacted on the roof of the Company HQ at UN position P-38 wounding two members of the Defence Forces &ndash; Corporal Roche and Private Flaherty. The Israeli Ambassador expressed his regret and denied that there had been any policy change on the part of his government towards the Irish UNIFIL contingent. He promised to bring our protest to the attention of his government.</P>
    <P>On 4 March the Department of Foreign Affairs lodged another protest about two further incidents involving the Irish troops at Rshaf on 13 and 16 February. Again the Israeli Ambassador emphasised that there was no change in the Israeli attitude to UNIFIL, but undertook to bring our protest to the attention of his authorities.</P>
    <P>On 12 March, when the Israeli Ambassador called to see the Secretary General of the Department of Foreign Affairs on a separate bilateral matter, the Secretary General took the opportunity to raise again the issue of close firings. He expressed our fears that such incidents could very easily result in loss of life.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding these protests, the incidents continued. On 31 May Private Kedian, a 22-year-old serving with UNIFIL, was killed in Barasheet in South Lebanon by a mortar fired by the pro-Israeli South Lebanon Army. Two other Irish soldiers serving with UNIFIL were wounded, one very seriously. On 1 June I summoned the Israeli Ambassador to Leinster House. I protested the incident in the strongest possible terms. I insisted that there must be an immediate cessation of such incidents and demanded that the Israeli Government take firm action to prevent such indiscriminate targeting of the UNIFIL contingent.</P>
    <P>The Israeli Ambassador expressed regret at the death of Private Kedian and the wounding of Private Rushe and undertook to bring my protest to the immediate attention of his government.</P>
    <P>More recently, on 11 June, a further vigorous protest &ndash; regarding a series of six close firing incidents on 10 June involving the Irish UNIFIL contingent position &ndash; was lodged by the Department of Foreign Affairs with the Israeli Ambassador. On that occasion, although there were no injuries, two of the Irish positions were struck during the firings. I also instructed the Irish Ambassador to Israel to lodge a protest with the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs. This was done on Tuesday 15 June. Again the Israeli authorities expressed regret and promised follow up action.</P>
    <P>All of these incidents are a cause of the greatest concern to the Government.</P>
    <P>We are all aware that there are always risks involved for the brave men and women engaged in peacekeeping. However, neither I nor the Government can accept a situation where Irish personnel working on behalf of the UN are subject to reckless and indiscriminate fire. If such a situation were to continue, we would have no option but to take steps to protect our troops, <Col N="355" /> including reconsideration of our involvement with UNIFIL.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 35 of 18 February 1999.</P>
      <P>My Department has allocated a sum of £20,000 to part fund a trial involving the use by Dublin Bus of a vehicle fuelled by Liquid Petroleum Gas, LPG. Dublin Bus is at present in negotiation with a bus manufacturer about the leasing of a suitable bus. In addition, Dublin Bus, in a joint-venture with Bord Gáis Éireann, is operating, on a trial basis, a single-decker bus using Compressed Natural Gas, CNG.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that progress on the light rail project is proceeding broadly in line with, and in some cases ahead of, the indicative timetable that I outlined in May 1998.</P>
      <P>I made a light railway order in respect of the Tallaght to Abbey Street line last March. No application for a judicial review was received within the two months specified in the legislation and CIE can now proceed with securing tenders to allow construction to commence. The target date for the commencement of construction is spring 2000 and the line is expected to be completed in winter 2002. I understand that some preliminary work will get under way within the coming months.</P>
      <P>The Government has approved funding for the purchase of the first 20 trams which will operate on the Tallaght to Abbey Street line and this contract was signed by CIE last month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last week I received the inspector's report on the public inquiry into the application by CIE for a light railway order in respect of the St. Stephen's Green to Sandyford Industrial Estate light rail line. I am now considering that report together with the other relevant documentation <Col N="356" /> and I will make my decision in relation to the order in due course.</P>
    <P>I understand that CIE expects to be in a position to submit an application to me for a light railway order for the Abbey Street to Connolly Station line in August. The public consultation process for the Broadstone to Ballymun and Dublin Airport line began last December and is continuing.</P>
    <P>CIE is on the point of selecting consultants to carry out a geotechnical study of the underground section of the project. This is later than I had expected and, while I have been advised that it will not significantly affect the overall timetable, I have asked that there be no delay in progressing this aspect of the work. I expect that these geotechnical studies will be completed by the end of the year.</P>

      <P>Any one who retired from, or left the employment of, Telecom Éireann after 1 November 1998 was included in the ESOP scheme for Telecom Éireann employees and therefore is excluded from the pensioners offer.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is referring to the SCARF training programme which was started in 1992 as a European funded programme by a consortium of airlines, universities, airport authorities and others. It was introduced into Ireland by Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta in 1995. I understand that Aer Rianta intend to adopt the SCARF programme, or a similar level of training, as a minimum standard in their implementation of the Ground Handling Directive at Dublin Airport.</P>
      <P>I very much welcome the SCARF programme because it is designed to improve ground handling work practices and to foster a professional commitment to safety among all those responsible for ground handling operations. There is always room for improvement in this area and the companies who developed this programme are to be congratulated for their initiative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the implementation of the Ground Handling Directive, my Department is holding ongoing discussions with the Irish Aviation Authority, Aer Rianta and the ground handling companies in relation to the overall position as regards safety standards to be adopted and are <Col N="366" /> examining whether any changes are required in the current practice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have indicated on a number of occasions both my own and the Government's support for the further development of the suburban rail network. This is being done in the context of addressing deficiencies in the public transport system and to provide alternatives to increasing traffic congestion in the greater Dublin area.</P>
      <P>The Exchequer has provided almost £20 million to co-finance suburban rail projects over 1999 and 2000. These projects include the acquisition of additional suburban railcars and DART carriage, track and rail signalling works and platform extensions.</P>
      <P>Last March I announced a dual initiative aimed at transforming rail transport in the coming years. This approach will place train travel at the heart of suburban commuting as well as involving largescale spending on rail and safety in the next five years. The proposals for suburban rail included both short and long-term initiatives.</P>
      <P>The focus of the short-term programme will be to make more intensive use of the existing rail corridors through possible measures such as provision of additional DART and suburban rail rolling stock and will include: increasing train sizes to eight cars to ease overcrowding; the lengthening of station platforms to accommodate longer trains; upgrading of the line between Connolly and Heuston stations; the development of new stations, Intel, Lucan North, Ashington, Lucan South, at suitable locations, linked to housing and industrial development.</P>
      <P>At the request of the Government, CIE will complete a consultancy study by the end of the year on a longer-term suburban rail development programme. This study will address the following issues: a possible new inland rail link to Navan; possible separation of long distance and commuter rail traffic through the construction of by-pass rail lines; quadrupling of existing double lines where feasible; enhancement of rail service to the development centres identified by the strategic planning guidelines.</P>
      <P>The short-term rail development programme is already included in the DTO transport blueprint.</P>

      <P>Recently, I approved a proposal from the military authorities that the military band at the Curragh should be amalgamated with the band of the Eastern Brigade, the Army No. 1 Band. The amalgamation of these two bands does not involve any reduction in the overall numbers of musicians within the school of music, as already provided for within the Defence Forces Review Implementation Plan as approved by the previous Government. Under the previous organisation of the Defence Forces, each Army command &ndash; of which there were four, namely, the Eastern, Curragh, Southern and Western Commands &ndash; had a <Col N="372" /> military band. In the new organisational structure, which came into effect on 1 November last, these four commands were replaced by three brigades. Each of these three brigades, Eastern, Southern and Western, has a band as part of its organisation, with the band of the former Curragh Command being now amalgamated with the band of the Eastern Brigade, the Army No. 1 Band.</P>
      <P>The military authorities are of the opinion that this new organisation of the school of music will allow all of the Army bands to function to their full potential.</P>

This has now been done and arrangements have been made to have payment made shortly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>EU legislation requires herdowners to keep herd registers of bovine animals and prescribes the information that the register must contain. The consolidated herd register book that my Department recently supplied to herdowners is designed to enable herdowners to record all of the required information. The details that must be recorded in respect of each animal are &ndash; date of birth &ndash; this is not required for animals tagged before the introduction of the plastic tagging system in 1996 &ndash; breed-colour; sex; in the case of an animal moved off the holding, the date of movement and the name and address, or herd number-mart number, of the new owner-keeper; and in the case of an animal that dies on the holding, the date of death and the method of disposal of the carcase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The EU regulations permit the herd register to be kept in a computer format approved by the competent authority in the member state. It is <Col N="381" /> necessary that any computerised version of the herd register should contain similar security features to those included in the herd register book. Essentially this means that there must be a full and clear audit trail of any changes that are made to entries in the register and that entries in the register cannot be deleted without trace. There is an onus on herdowners, who choose to keep their herd register records on computer, to provide a printout of the register on request for inspection purposes. In the ordinary course of events, printouts will suffice for the purpose of inspections carried out by my Department. However, situations may arise where my Department would require direct access to the computer records.</P>

      <P>During 1998, 203 herds had factory lesion TB herd tests completed in County Monaghan. A total of 96 holdings were restricted for a period greater than four months. During any period that a holding is restricted, a herdowner is entitled to apply for permission to send clear animals which have passed a TB test in the last 12 months to the factory for slaughter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of Parliamentary Question No. 55 of 13 May 1999, 39 holdings were restricted <Col N="382" /> for a period greater than four months resulting from a factory lesion. No further reactors were disclosed at the re-tests and as a result their holdings were de-restricted. Of the 39 holdings, 25 had restrictions and de-restrictions occurring outside the hardship grant eligibility period i.e. 1 November to 30 April. The balance had a factory lesion situation similar to the person named occurring within the hardship grant eligibility period.</P>

      <P>For the Deputy's further information, I refer him to my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 13 dated 24 June 1999 and to the Seanad Adjournment debate on 23 June 1999; both of which deal comprehensively with the difficulties posed by an extension of the scheme to different categories of disabled persons.</P>

      <P>The Criminal Justice Act, 1994, implements the EU Money Laundering Directive in Ireland. Section 32 of the Act provides,<i> inter alia,</i> that a financial institution &ldquo;shall take reasonable measures to establish the identity of any person for whom it proposes to provide a service .&rdquo;. It is the legal responsibility of each financial institution to ensure that it complies with this provision. The act does not state what may or may not represent <Col N="383" /> reasonable measures and does not provide for the making of regulations in this regard.</P>
      <P>In order to facilitate consistent implementation of the anti-money laundering provisions of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994 guidance notes were issued in May 1995 by the money laundering steering committee, established under the aegis of my Department and representing the various sectors of the financial services industry and the relevant regulatory authorities. These guidance notes recommend that a customer's identity be verified by reference to a document obtained from a reputable source which bears a photograph and signature. The guidance notes also recommend that permanent addresses be verified through, among other things, reference to recent utility bills, such as those of the ESB. The guidance notes state, however, that it may be reasonable to depart from recommended verification procedures in certain circumstances, for example, when the young or the elderly may not be able to provide the documentary evidence of identity which is required of other customers. It is a matter for an institution's management to determine the type of evidence which they are prepared to accept in such cases in order to meet their legal obligations under the Criminal Justice Act, 1994. The guidance notes used by financial institutions are in the process of being reviewed by the money laundering steering committee and the operation of customer identification procedures will be examined as part of this process.</P>

      <P>I am aware that any area not specifically included in the rural renewal scheme is thereby excluded from it. On the question of a possible extension of the scheme to other areas, the Deputy may be aware that I announced the commencement of the business incentives available under the scheme last week following their approval by the EU Commission. These are capital allowances for industrial and commercial development which will be available from 1 July 1999 to 31 December 2002. The rural renewal scheme is a pilot scheme. Since this major element of the scheme is only now commencing, it would be inappropriate to consider extending the scheme at this stage.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that, <Col N="385" /> according to the information available to the inspector of taxes, each of the taxpayers is entitled to the tax-free allowances appropriate to a single person.</P>
      <P>The taxpayers are not entitled to the married persons tax-free allowances because they are not married. A taxpayer who is a single parent may claim a one-parent tax-free allowance under Section 462 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997. However, eligibility for the allowance is restricted so that it can be claimed only by an individual who is not entitled to claim the married personal allowance; is not living with another individual as man and wife during the year of assessment; and has resident with him or her a qualifying child-children at any time during the year of assessment.</P>
      <P>To be eligible for the one-parent family tax-free allowance, all three conditions must be satisfied. As the taxpayers do not comply with the second condition, they are not eligible for the one-parent tax-free allowance.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy, for his information, to the reply to the Adjournment debate held on 2 March 1999 which dealt comprehensively with the matter of extending the scheme to the visually impaired. In addition, I refer the Deputy to the reply to the Adjournment debate held in the Seanad on 23 June, 1999 and my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 13 dated 24 June, 1999, both of which dealt comprehensively with the extension of the scheme in general.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="386" /> The present medical criteria for access to the scheme relate essentially to disabilities which seriously and permanently impair the physical mobility of the person concerned. This reflects the origins of the scheme as a relief for disabled persons who were confined to wheelchairs, but nevertheless, were capable of driving suitably adapted motor cars.</P>
    <P>A review of the scheme is being undertaken by an interdepartmental group chaired by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The existing medical criteria for qualification is one of the issues that have been raised with that group. I believe that the proper course of action is to complete the review and to consider the options which may then arise.</P>
    <P>However, the cost of the current scheme has been steadily increasing and opening it up to wider ranges of disabilities would significantly add to this cost. I must caution, therefore, against an expectation that any person who suffers from some form of disability will be able to benefit from the scheme following the completion of this review.</P>

      <P>The functions of the Government supplies agency, formerly known as the Stationery Office, were transferred to the Office of Public Works on 1 January 1988. My office has made a thorough search of all the personal files held in respect of former employees of the Stationery Office but regretfully there is no trace of a file for the person concerned.</P>
      <P>The Department of Public Enterprise has responsibility for the air traffic control service. That Department has advised, also, that it is unable to trace any records for the person concerned with regard to the period the person concerned worked in air traffic control, Shannon Airport.</P>
      <P>I am advised that the Department of Finance wrote to the person concerned on 21 April 1999 stating that she had no pension entitlement as she had resigned from the Civil Service prior to 1 June 1973, the date from which preservation of service was introduced, and that no retrospective provision applied. It also advised that in relation to the payment of a marriage gratuity that at the time, to qualify for such a gratuity an officer resigning before marriage had to indicate her intention of marrying and, in the normal course, must marry within two months of the date of her resignation.</P>

      <P>Under Irish legislation, a person normally resident in the State may not use, in the State, a vehicle which is not registered in the State. The only exception to this provision is in the case of small vans and commercial vehicles which can be driven in the State on behalf of foreign companies by State resident employees. Enforcement of this rule, particularly in Border areas, is necessary for the purpose of collecting vehicle registration tax which is an important source of revenue for the Exchequer.</P>

      <Col N="390" /> There is, of course, provision for temporary exemption from the registration requirement for persons normally resident outside the State, such as tourists and temporary workers.</P>

      <P>All benefits, taken by either gift or inheritance, from any source except a spouse, are liable to capital acquisitions tax. In general, a person may receive gifts or inheritances in value up to £192,900 from his/her parents free of CAT (class I threshold). Smaller thresholds apply to gifts or inheritances received from other close relatives (class II &ndash; £25,720) and from all other categories (class III &ndash; £12,860). These thresholds are indexed annually by reference to the consumer price index. Only the value of benefits received in excess of the relevant threshold gives rise to a charge to CAT.</P>
      <P>Where a beneficiary has taken previous gifts or inheritances from different sources since 2 December 1988, the value of these benefits must be added to the value of the current benefit when determining the current CAT liability. This process of adding, benefits together is known as aggregation. Any CAT that is referable to the previous gifts or inheritances will be taken into account, to arrive at the CAT that is due on the current benefit.</P>
      <P>It is important to note that the £192,900 applies to the class 1 threshold. Any unused amount cannot be availed of in respect of benefits from any other category of disponer. For example, where a person receives £100,000 from a parent, and subsequently receives £20,000 from an aunt, the threshold that applies is £100,000. In other words, the &ldquo;unused&rdquo; part of the parent-child threshold does not apply to the £20,000 received from the aunt, and CAT on the £20,000 must be paid in full.</P>
      <P>In this year's budget, I brought forward the date of aggregation from 2 June 1982 to 2 December 1988. Only the value of gifts or inheritances taken on or after 2 December 1988 will now be taken into account for such purposes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 116 and 118 together.</P>
      <P>There are three thresholds under capital acquisitions tax depending on the relationship between the disponer and the beneficiary. A person may receive up to £192,900 from his or her parents free of CAT. This exempt amount is described as the class I threshold. The class II threshold, currently £25,720, applies to transfers between certain other relatives, such as brother-sister, uncle-nephew and grandfather-grandchild. The class III threshold, currently £12,860 applies for transfers between people who do not fall into either of the other classes. Since 1990 these thresholds have been indexed annually by reference to the consumer price index.</P>
      <P>The rate of CAT on inheritances is nil up to the appropriate threshold rate, 20 per cent on the next £10,000, 30 per cent on the next £30,000 and 40 per cent on the balance. In order to encourage lifetime disposals, CAT on gifts is charged at three-quarters of the rate on inheritance. However, where the disponer dies within two years of the date of the gift, the benefit is then taken as an inheritance.</P>
      <P>In relation to inheritances between siblings, the elderly siblings relief, introduced in 1991 and which I subsequently increased in the 1998 budget takes account of the special circumstances of elderly brothers and sister who live together. The effect of this relief means that the value of an inheritance of a share or all of their family home taken from a sibling can be reduced by 80 per cent or £150,000, whichever is the lesser. Thus an individual, subject to the conditions of the relief being met, could inherit a half share in a house, with a market value of just over £257,000, before any CAT would be due.</P>
      <P>Finally, I would like to remind the Deputy that I undertook during the 1999 Finance Bill debate to review the CAT system before the next budget. However, it is necessary to remember that changes in the CAT area are costly and that they are primarily of benefit to those in receipt of a gift or inheritance and not the general body of taxpayers.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
      <Quest>if he has examined the recommendation from the consultancy on the taxi business to remove vehicle registration tax from wheelchair accessible taxis; the plans, if any, he has to introduce this change; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the recommendations of the Dublin Taxi Forum which were issued in August 1998. In <Col N="392" /> all more than 40 recommendations were issued, including the recommendation that all wheelchair</P>
      <P>accessible taxis coming on stream, under the arrangements proposed, should be zero rated for vehicle registration tax.</P>
      <P>I have no plans to remove or reduce the VRT on wheelchair accessible taxis. This matter was considered last year in the context of the preparation for the Committee Stage of the Finance Bill. At that time, it was estimated that the cost to the Exchequer of a refund of VRT on such taxis could be prohibitive if there were a full take-up of the scheme. If the proposed VRT relief were to be restricted to the additional licences issued in future for wheelchair accessible taxis, the potential costs would be correspondingly less. However, such a move could lead to pressure for extension of the relief, on competitive grounds, to all taxis and hackneys &ndash; new and old licences alike &ndash; and would be impossible to ring fence.</P>
      <P>I understand that Dublin Corporation intends to issue a total of 820 wheelchair accessible licences between now and the year 2001. I have also been informed that the demand for the initial batch of licences, which were advertised in the press recently, far outstripped the number required. It would appear that the application of VRT was not a hindering factor.</P>

      <P>The existing drug cost subsidisation and drug refund schemes will be merged into one new drug payment scheme with a threshold of £42 per month per family unit. A common list of reimbursable medicines is being introduced for the GMS scheme and the new drug payment scheme. The introduction of the common medicines list will ensure equity between the general medical services and the new drug payment scheme in relation to the range of medicines paid for by the State under both schemes. The comprehensive range of the most modern therapies required to treat all conditions, which is available on the GMS will continue to be paid for under the new scheme.</P>
      <P>The list of drugs, medicines and appliances available to GMS patients as specified in the current GMS code book, including all updates, and with some additions will form the common list of items for both the GMS and the new drugs payment scheme. This common list will be subject to ongoing review and amendment on a monthly basis as new products become available, additions and deletions will be notified on a monthly basis, as at present.</P>
      <P>In addition to the common list, a supplementary list of products including dressings and incontinence products will be reimbursable to non medical card holders. Existing arrangements for the supply of these products to medical card holders will remain in place.</P>

      <P>The information requested by the Deputy is set out in the following table, in respect of the situation as of Monday 21 June 1999. The national number of beds inappropriately occupied is 336, which represents 2.68 per cent of the total number of acute hospital beds throughout the country.</P>
      <P>The problem of inappropriately occupied beds in the acute hospital system was identified by the review group on the waiting list initiative. On the recommendation of the review group I have allocated an additional £9 million to services for older people and I am confident that this substantial investment will have a considerable impact on the development of geriatric services and therefore in that context I expect a positive effect on the problem of inappropriately occupied beds.</P>

    <P>A contamination of water, which proved not to be E-coli was discovered, in September 1989 in St. Ita's hospital, Portrane. The water supply in the affected area was shut down and a process of chemical cleansing was undertaken. Tests were carried out on the water supply which proved negative to E-coli contamination.</P>
    <P>In each case of contamination all necessary measures to protect public health were put in place where appropriate. The actions taken included the cleaning of water tanks, flushing out of water systems with chlorinated water followed by the taking of repeated water samples. There are no records of any reported illnesses among staff or patients linked to the reported incidences.</P>

      <P>The provision of funding for research into conditions such as epidermolysis bullosa is a matter for the health research board. I understand that the health research board did support research on this disease over a three year period in the early 1990's and a total of £33,000 was provided by the board for that purpose.</P>
      <P>In 1998, I provided £3,000 and the Eastern Health Board provided £1,000 by way of once-off grant assistance from lottery funds to the Debra organisation.</P>

      <P>The information requested by the Deputy is set out below.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="400" /> Adults awaiting cataract procedures: Mater hospital 324; Royal Victoria Eye and Ear hospital 289; St Vincent's hospital, Elm Park 102. As the Deputy will be aware, waiting list data is collected on a quarterly basis and this data relates to the quarter ending 31 March 1999.</P>
    <P>The average waiting time for these procedures is as follows: Mater hospital 87 weeks; Royal Victoria Eye and Ear hospital 60 weeks; St Vincent's hospital, Elm Park, 20 weeks.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the total national number of people awaiting ophthalmology procedures fell during the first quarter of this year. I have undertaken important initiatives in regard to the waiting list initiative since coming into office. These include: an allocation of £20 million to agencies for the treatment of patients on waiting lists; the provision of £9 million to services for older people; the provision of £2 million to selected accident and emergency services; the issuing of a new policy circular and guidelines to all relevant agencies regarding the way in which the waiting list should be operated.</P>
    <P>I am confident that these initiatives will continue to have a significant positive impact on waiting lists for the remainder of the year, and more importantly that waiting times for public patients will be reduced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen reports of the study referred to by the Deputy. It is of course advisable that, in their own interest, persons intending to travel to countries where certain infectious diseases are prevalent ensure that they take appropriate precautions against contracting such diseases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, it is a matter in the first place for intending travellers to familiarise themselves with the general advice on immunisation for travellers to the country concerned. Advice and information is obtainable through general practitioners, health boards, travel health centres, travel agents or the embassy or consulate of the country which it is intended to visit. In addition to the traditional immunisation advice, intending travellers should also consider seeking advice on a range of other issues, for example whether they are medically fit to travel, what medical provision <Col N="401" /> should be made for individuals with pre-existing illness and what general precautions should be taken in relation to eating, drinking and exposure to a different environment from that to which people are accustomed.</P>
    <P>It should also be noted that under the terms of sections 10(1)(<i>e</i>) and 12(1)(<i>b</i>) of the Package Holidays and Travel Trade Act, 1995, among the information which organisers of package holidays are required to make available to possible consumers is information about health formalities required by national administrations for the journey and the stay.</P>
    <P>The health boards have statutory responsibility for the control of infectious diseases. The Deputy will be aware that a free primary childhood immunisation programme is in operation so as to protect the population against a range of bacterial and viral infections which might be encountered in this country. It would be open to boards, should they consider that the non-immunisation of persons travelling to countries where certain infectious diseases are prevalent poses a significant risk to public health, to take measures to encourage intending travellers to take appropriate precautions in this regard.</P>
    <P>My Department publishes material containing general health advice for persons planning to travel abroad and this deals with the risks of infectious disease and the desirability of ensuring that intending travellers to at-risk countries obtain the appropriate vaccinations, as well as some of the other issues to which I have referred. The immunisation advisory committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland is currently reviewing its immunisation guidelines for Ireland and this included an examination of the advice to medical professionals on immunisation for persons travelling abroad. My Department will be arranging for the distribution of the revised guidelines, when completed, to a range of interested parties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 142 and 145 together.</P>
      <P>The Midland Health Board has confirmed to my Department that there is no delay in granting incremental credit to temporary nurses employed at the Longford-Westmeath General Hospital, Mullingar and that the relevant national agreements are applied. Heretofore, temporary nurses have been paid in accordance with Department of Health circular S103/196 dated 25 November 1992, which gave effect to the wholetime temporary nurses agreement (1992), as follows: two increments may be granted with effect from 1 January 1992 to those nurses with two years full-time continuous service, or the equivalent of two years aggregate service in the preceding three years in the health service; a further increment may be granted, if appropriate, not earlier than 1 January 1993; a further increment may be granted, if appropriate, not earlier than 1 January 1994.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the 1997 nurses pay agreement, incremental credit was allowed up to the seventh point with effect from June 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the issue of Labour Court recommendation No. 16094, agreement has now been reached with the alliance of nursing unions in relation to revised incremental credit arrangements for temporary nurses. The new agreement provides for the phased implementation of full <Col N="403" /> incremental credit on appointment as temporary nurses on foot of satisfactory validation of previous nursing service. The Health Service Employers Agency notified the health agencies on 18 June 1999 of the terms of the new agreement, which is effective from 1 January 1999. The Midland Health Board has confirmed that this agreement will be implemented as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>I have also been informed by the Midland Health Board that it is currently in the process of converting a large number of temporary posts to permanent positions under phase two of the conversion process outlined in the 1997 nursing pay agreement. Under this process temporary nurses will be eligible to compete in the confined competition who have: one year's continuous wholetime service with their employer at 1 June 1998 or who have worked a minimum of 4,000 hours in the six years prior to 1 June 1998 and who continue to be available for work on a full-time or part-time basis.</P>
    <P>This criteria will be strictly complied with when determining length of service of applicants. When the number of eligible applicants exceeds the number of vacancies-posts which can be filled/converted, applicants will be issued with letters of comfort and offered permanent appointments as vacancies-opportunities arise. The above process is currently well under way in the Midland Health Board area and will be completed in the immediate future.</P>

      <P>The provision of health services to children with autism in County Westmeath is primarily the responsibility of the Midland Health Board. In the first instance, a number of children with autism in the Westmeath area avail of the services provided to children with an intellectual disability in the county. In addition, a special class is currently being set up in the Presentation school, Mullingar, which will cater for up to five children with autism. As well as receiving educational services, the children attending this class will receive appropriate health-related support services.</P>
      <P>This year I was pleased to be in a position to provide additional funding of £50,000, with a full year cost of £150,000 in 2000, for the development of specific health-related support services for children with autism in the midland region. This funding will enable a range of health-related support services to be further developed, and provided, where appropriate, on an outreach basis. These services will enhance existing diagnosis, early intervention, pre-school services and services to schoolgoing children with autism. Planning for the continued development of support services for children and adults with autism is included by the Midland Health Board in their overall consideration of the needs in their region.</P>

      <P>The report of the review group on health and personal social services for people with physical and sensory disabilities, Towards an Independent Future, published in December 1996, set out the requirements for the development of these services, including speech and language therapy services. Since the report was published three new speech and language therapy posts were created in 1997 and ten in 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another recommendation of the review group is the setting up of regional co-ordinating committees for services for people with physical and sensory disabilities. These bring together health boards, voluntary sector service providers and consumers. One of the primary functions of the co-ordinating committee is to advise on priorities for the allocation of funds available for the development of services. This year £3 million &ndash; £6 million full year cost in the year 2000 &ndash; has been provided for the development of these services. The question of allocating some of this <Col N="406" /> money for the provision of additional speech and language therapy services will be considered by each board in consultation with its co-ordinating committee.</P>
    <P>I should point out that the recruitment of paramedical staff generally is presenting problems throughout the health board regions. Following a Labour Court recommendation in 1997, an expert group was established to examine and report on various issues relating to paramedical grades, including speech and language therapists. Among the issues to be examined by this group are the problems which arise in relation to the recruitment and the retention of various paramedical grades. It is anticipated that the report of this group will be completed later this year.</P>

It is not collected by place of residence and it would not therefore be possible to give the Deputy a breakdown of the number of patients from each county on the waiting list for neurosurgery at Beaumont hospital.</P>

      <P>Up to now the Eastern Health Board, which has statutory responsibility for the provision of treatment in the Dublin area has been concentrating on expanding its treatment network in order to attract as many drug users as possible into its service. By the end of May 1999 there was a total of 3,891 on the central methadone treatment list.</P>
      <P>The objective of our drug treatment programmes is to restore those addicted to drugs to a drug free lifestyle. It is recognised however that this may not be a realistic option, in the short-term at least, for some drug users. In such cases, and this is accepted internationally, methadone maintenance can play a vital role in stabilising the patient and in influencing their often chaotic behaviour. This can have very beneficial results for patients themselves, their immediate family and social circle and society in general.</P>
      <P>Methadone maintenance however, can be part of an overall treatment regime which should also include counselling and rehabilitation and which has as its aim, the reintegration of the individual, into society. The Eastern Health Board has identified the provision of increased rehabilitation facilities as part of its service plan for 1999. The board has commenced the development of a rehabilitation programme and will be engaging in a widespread consultation process over the coming months. Voluntary agencies, community groups and other statutory organisations will be involved in this process and the role to be played by such groups and organisations will be discussed.</P>
      <P>I am confident, that, arising from this process, the board will shortly have in place a comprehensive programme for all of its clients which will provide appropriate rehabilitation for those who need it.</P>

      <P>Dentists providing services for medical card holders under the dental treatment services scheme do so under contract arrangements with the health boards. Dentists providing services for insured persons under the dental treatment benefit scheme &ndash; DTBS &ndash; do so under contract arrangements with the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. The IDA has negotiated a number of special fee increases under the DTBS with the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs in return for <Col N="410" /> implementation of 1997 budget provisions for the abolition of the £35,000 income limit, relaxation of dependency conditions, the extension of dental benefit to public service workers and for dropping any claims to items which were annexed to a 1992 agreement with that Department, viz pensions, sick leave, study leave etc. These special fee increases were applicable to circumstances peculiar to that Department's agreement with the IDA for the provision of services under the DTBS.</P>
      <P>The DTSS is entirely funded by the Exchequer. Health boards must keep within budget and need to maintain adequate epidemiological information on oral health. Operational procedures under the DTSS are designed to meet these needs.</P>
      <P>A claim for a fee increase under the dental treatment services scheme has been made by the Irish Dental Association. An offer in regard to this claim has been made through the Health Service Employers Agency. A commencement date for the final phasing of the DTSS i.e. extension of routine treatment to persons in the 35-64 age group and an end to premium payments for emergency treatment are part of a package of proposals drawn up in the context of this claim. Agreement on these proposals will enable my Department in consultation with the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs to explore ways in which operational procedures under the two schemes may be further harmonised in the interest of patient and of dentist.</P>
      <P>The Health Service Employers Agency &ndash; HSEA &ndash; has sought clarification from the Irish Dental Association of the association's recent decision to ballot its members on a withdrawal from the scheme. The decision to ballot and threat to withdraw from the scheme was announced to the media before my Department or the HSEA was informed. The HSEA has also indicated its willingness to have further discussions with the association in regard to its claim.</P>

    <P>The important role played by home helps in the care of older people is widely recognised and there is growing demand for the home help service to be better organised and developed. In this regard, my Department commissioned an examination of the future organisation of the home help service in Ireland by the policy research centre of the National College of Ireland under the direction of the national council on ageing and older people. This report has been published and is being considered by the health boards and my Department with a view to early implementation. Any difficulties that have arisen in the operation of the service will be examined as part of this process.</P>
    <P>As part of the implementation of the recommendations of the report, additional funding was made available this year to enable the home help service to be improved. The additional funding provided to boards, including the Eastern Health Board, may be used for additional home helps or additional hours. Resources have also been provided in the current year to increase the minimum rate of payment for all home helps as part of a phased improvement in the rate of payment for home helps, the remaining phases of which it is hoped to implement as resources permit. It is hoped that this will help to relieve difficulties in recruiting home helps.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had inquiries made of The Children's Hospital, Temple Street, regarding this matter. The hospital has confirmed that there is a radiographer on call from 5 p.m. in the evening to 9 a.m. the following morning. She remains at the hospital until 10 p.m. and can be contacted at home after this time if needed for emergency procedures. Patients needing non urgent x-rays are asked to return the following morning.</P>
      <P>In 1999, I was pleased to be able to approve additional revenue funding of £1.240 million to meet the cost of approved service developments at the Children's Hospital, Temple Street, in areas of support staff, paediatrics, nephrology, neonatology, airways management and theatres/day wards. Included in this amount is £0.690 million in respect of commissioning of the following, the national centre for metabolic diseases, and the high dependency unit.</P>
      <P>The hospital did not prioritise the radiology services for development funding in 1999. However if this service is prioritised for additional funding by the hospital, it will be considered within the context of the hospital's overall priorities for the year 2000 and the many competing demands within the acute sector.</P>

      <Quest>the number of people who have died of CJD in each of the past five years; the different strains of CJD including the BSE linked, classical CJD; the numbers suffering and dying from each strain; the origin and difference in the various strains; if they are all linked to beef; and if a designated person will be made available to give information to a person (details supplied) in Dublin 9 whose husband, an ex meat factory worker, has died of CJD and is unhappy with the medical information being supplied to her.</Quest>

      <P>The number of persons who have died of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in each of the last five years is as follows: 1994 nil; 1995 two; 1996 three; 1997 three; 1998 six.</P>
      <P>CJD is the collective name for a group of diseases which cause progressive dementia and a loss of control of movement and balance. There are four variants of the condition, namely sporadic (classic), familial &ndash; inherited &ndash; latrogenic &ndash; caused by treatment &ndash; and the new variant CJD. Only new variant CJD has been linked to the consumption of beef. All but one of the cases which occurred in Ireland in the last five years were of the sporadic or classic variant. The other case, which occurred in 1997, was of the familial strain. In each of the cases the patient died.</P>
      <P>The clinicians treating a particular patient are best qualified to explain and discuss with the family the nature of that patient's condition and I understand that in the case referred to by the Deputy the consultant has met the family and explained the nature of the diagnosis made. Where a family is unhappy with a specific CJD diagnosis, arrangements can be made whereby tissue sections can be referred to the UK surveillance centre in Edinburgh for a second opinion. Should a family wish to discuss with one of the expert members of the national CJD surveillance committee concerns relating to any aspect of CJD or to a specific diagnosis, arrangements can also be made in this regard.</P>

The standard rate of allowance payable, effective from 1 June 1999, is £68.05 per child per week for those under 12 years of age and £75.35 per child per week for those over 12 years of age. In addition there are a number of discretionary payments made by health boards which cover such items as medical, school or clothing expenses.</P>

      <P>Persons who are unable, without undue hardship, to arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card. In determining eligibility, the local health board will have regard to the financial circumstances and medical needs of the applicant. In this regard, income guidelines are used by health boards to assist in determining a person's eligibility. These guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, the person may still be awarded a medical card if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. Medical cards may also be issued to individual family members on this basis. Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board to decide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are also schemes available which provide financial assistance towards the cost of prescribed drugs and medicines to people who do not have medical cards. For example, persons suffering from an ongoing condition can avail of the drug cost subsidisation scheme which caters for people <Col N="418" /> who are certified as having a medical condition with a regular and ongoing requirement for prescribed drugs and medicines. Persons who qualify for inclusion in this scheme do not have to pay more than £32 in any month on prescribed medication. Under the drug refund scheme, families and individuals pay the full cost of their prescription medicines and may, at the end of the quarter, claim reimbursement from their health board for expenditure over £90 in that calendar quarter.</P>
    <P>With effect from 1 July 1999, the new drug payment scheme will replace the drug cost subsidisation scheme and the drug refund scheme with a monthly threshold of £42. The new scheme will effectively merge the best elements of the two existing schemes and is designed to significantly improve the cash flow situations of families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines. Under the new scheme, no individual or family will have to pay more than £42 per month for approved prescribed drugs and medicines for use in that month. For the first time, families and individuals will be able to budget for the cost of medicines. As the scheme will operate on a monthly rather than a quarterly basis, it has advantages over the drug refund scheme. Furthermore, unlike the drug cost subsidisation scheme, there are no qualifying criteria for inclusion in the new drug payment scheme.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that appropriate and comprehensive support is being provided by the State to those with ongoing medical expenses such as people with asthma.</P>

      <P>In view of this special provision, I do not think that it is justifiable to extend an automatic entitlement to a medical card to any specific group without any reference to their means, particularly in view of the very many areas of pressing need in the health services and the limited resources available to meet them.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 175 and 176 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is evidence to suggest that the prevalence of asthma is increasing internationally. Some of this increase reflects a change in diagnostic practice while some represents a real increase in the condition. The reasons for the increase are unclear, as asthma is caused by an interplay of genetic and environmental factors. Worldwide research into the causes of asthma is ongoing and I hope that Ireland can benefit from this research. I should also explain that, in the past, precise medical diagnosis of asthma was problematic as the term was frequently used to cover a range of respiratory conditions, including bronchitis. In addition, as asthma is not a notifiable disease, there are no precise statistics available on the number of people with the condition. For the most serious asthmatic reactions requiring hospitalisation, data is available from the hospital in-patient inquiry system. The Deputy may be interested to see the data available in respect of teenagers aged 15-19 years for the years 1994 to 1997, which is set out below. These figures are based on principal diagnosis and include day cases and in-patients. It should be noted that information is not available from private hospitals and that a person attending hospital several times in a given year is counted separately in the statistics for each visit. Age 15-19;530, 1995;561, 1996;466, 1997;488. When the Deputy refers to a 3 per cent increase for teenagers suffering asthma over a three year period, I assume she is comparing a survey undertaken in 1992 of children aged four to 19 years where 11.9 per cent of those surveyed reported asthma, with the results of the first phase of the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC), undertaken in 1995, which involved children aged 13-14 years and showed prevalence values of 15.2 per cent. While any upward trend must be cause for concern, it is not possible to say with certainty whether the differences in the results reflects an increase in asthma prevalence or a difference in the administration of the surveys. As the Deputy indicates, however, the ISAAC study showed that, for asthma symptoms, the highest 12 month prevalences were from centres in the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand and this country, followed by most centres in North, Central and South America. The lowest prevalences were from centres in sev<Col N="422" /> eral Eastern European countries, Indonesia, Greece, China, Taiwan, Uzbekistan, India and Ethiopia. While not directly comparable, the Deputy may also have in mind results from the European Community Respiratory Health Survey of adults which also showed the highest asthma symptoms prevalence in the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, Ireland and the United States.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the variation in the prevalence of asthma is striking between different centres throughout the world and I understand that the findings of the ISAAC study will form the basis of further studies to investigate factors that potentially lead to these international patterns. The Health Research Board is the statutory body with responsibility for health research in Ireland. The board considers all applications for funding and allocates funding to projects on a competitive basis, subject to the board's peer review process whereby experts in the field assess the merits of each individual project. I will raise the question of follow up or further studies with the Health Research Board and communicate directly with the Deputy in the matter.</P>

      <P>The placement of a resident in a private nursing home and the fees charged is a private arrangement between the nursing home and the individual resident. Accordingly, my Department has no function in relation to the setting of private nursing home fees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principal objectives of the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, is to ensure high standards of accommodation and care in all nursing homes registered under the Act, and to provide a system of nursing home subvention so that dependent persons most in need of nursing home care will have access to such care. I am satisfied that health boards take a sympathetic view of cases where personal funds are exhausted by increasing the level of subvention where possible. Where this does not solve a problem, a health board will try to provide accommodation in one of its own extended care facilities. One of the changes made to the subvention scheme operated under the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, since its implementation permits health boards to contract beds in private nursing homes and pay more than the maximum rates of subvention in such cases. This amendment is to facilitate health boards which do not have sufficient accommodation in their hospitals and homes to meet the needs of <Col N="423" /> those requiring nursing care and which have traditionally relied on the nursing home sector to meet this need.</P>
    <P>I should point out that substantial additional funding has been provided in the current year to meet the rising costs of the scheme, including increased payment to people who are having difficulty in meeting their nursing home fees.</P>

      <P>The provision of services to persons with a mental handicap in the Ballinasloe area is the responsibility of the Western Health Board in the first instance.</P>
      <P>This year I was pleased to be in a position to allocate additional revenue funding of £1,595,000, with a full year cost of £1,965,000, to the Western Health Board for the development of new services for persons with an intellectual disability. I have also recently allocated £900,000 capital to the board to put in place facilities to support the new services. Details of the precise services to be put in place in the western region from this additional funding, the location of these services and the individuals who will benefit from them is a matter for the Western Health Board in consultation with the board's regional mental handicap co-ordinating committee, and in line with the priorities the committee has identified for the region.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 181 and 194 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Within the EU regulatory framework for the safe use of modern biotechnology, I have overall responsibility for Council Directive 90/220 EEC <Col N="425" /> which provides for the intentional release of genetically modified organisms to the environment both for research and development purposes and for placing on the market. The provisions of the directive which require implementation at national level are transposed into Irish law by the Genetically Modified Organisms Regulations, 1994 &ndash; S.I. No. 345 of 1994 &ndash; as amended by the Genetically Modified Organisms (Amendment) Regulations, 1996 and 1997 &ndash; S.I. No. 348 of 1996 and S.I. No. 332 of 1997. The Environmental Protection Agency is the competent authority in Ireland for purposes of the regulations.</P>
    <P>The proposal from the Commission to amend Directive 90/220/EEC is intended to extend and clarify the scope of the directive and to ensure procedures are commensurate with its scope; strengthen uniformity of decision-making between member states, based on common principles for risk assessment; facilitate linkage with other relevant product legislation; improve the labelling of GM products.</P>
    <P>In the course of consideration of the proposal, and especially at its meeting on 24 June 1999, the Council of Environment Ministers made significant progress, with substantial input from Ireland, in strengthening the proposal. In particular, the proposal for a fast-track approval for marketing GM products was abandoned and significant improvements were made which resulted in new common principles to ensure consistency in undertaking environmental risk assessment of product notifications; a new provision imposing a ten year time limit on consents to market GM products, in parallel with new post-release monitoring requirements; greater transparency underpinned by improved labelling requirements linked to a provision to ensure full traceability of GM products through all stages of the production process; new provisions for public participation in the regulatory procedures for the placing of GM products on the EU market; and a recognition of ethical considerations and provision for them to be addressed.</P>
    <P>On this basis the council agreed on the proposals, which will be subject to further consideration by the European Parliament and final codecision by Council and Parliament.</P>

      <P>Such persons are not excluded from the new house grant for first time purchasers but are required, as part of the Government's measures to tackle the black economy in construction, to have a contractor or contractors, registered for VAT and holding either a current form C2 or a tax clearance certificate, engaged on the construction of the house and providing labour to a value of not less than £6,000. In addition, materials having a value, including VAT, of not less than £9,000 must be used in the construction of the house. Requirements that certain details be furnished in relation to the C2 form or tax clearance certificate are now generally applied where grants are paid by public authorities.</P>
      <P>The value of the labour required to be carried out by registered contractors in the construction of a new house has not been increased since the provision was introduced in 1987 and is not considered to be an onerous imposition on persons who build their houses by direct labour. There are no proposals to remove this requirement.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 196 and 197 together.</P>
      <P>Local authorities, including Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, have been notified by my Department of the introduction next year of a multi-annual local authority housing programme and have been requested to set in train the necessary preparatory work to produce a streamlined delivery of housing output over a four year period. This includes a key requirement to identify any necessary land acquisition at an early stage and also includes, for example, considering of the need to vary existing development plans in regard to the availability of zoned residential lands to facilitate the provision of housing. Where necessary, local authorities may borrow from the Housing Finance Agency to acquire land and acquisition costs along with rolled up interest charges are recoupable as part of the cost of individual housing schemes. It is now a matter for Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council to set in train the necessary preparatory work, including any necessary land acquisition for their future housing programme.</P>

      <P>The administration of the tenant purchase scheme is a matter for each local authority. Local authorities must assess each application under the scheme on its merits, having regard, for example, to the tenants' ability to meet the repayments and other expenses involved such as insurance and ongoing maintenance.</P>
      <P>Local authorities have been advised that no particular category of tenants e.g. those on social welfare payments, should be regarded as being automatically excluded from purchase but that all such applications must be considered on their merits. A shared ownership option is also available to tenants whereby they would be required to make a minimum initial purchase of 50 per cent of the purchase price of the house with an undertaking to acquire the remaining equity within 25 years.</P>
      <P>I have no plans to make any amendments to the scheme at this stage.</P>

      <P>Refunds of motor tax can be made under the following circumstances when: the vehicle has been scrapped or destroyed or sent permanently out of the State, or the vehicle has been stolen and has not been recovered by the owner, or a vehicle in respect of which a tax disc has been taken out has not been used in a public place at any time since the issue of the disc, or the owner of the vehicle has ceased, because of illness, injury or other physical disability to use the vehicle, or the owner of the vehicle has ceased, because of the absence from the State for business or educational purposes, to use the vehicle, or the owner of the vehicle has ceased, because of service overseas with the Defence Forces, to use the vehicle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="433" /> In addition the regulations require &ndash; for administrative reasons &ndash; that not less than a three month unexpired period remains on the disc from the date of refund. The question of reducing this period to one month will be positively considered at the next revision of the regulations.</P>

The person concerned does not qualify, as his weekly means assessed at £67, are in excess of qualifying limit of £65.</P>
      <P>The means are based on the father's income as a garda, with allowances in respect of tax, PRSI, superannuation, medical insurance, union fees, mortgage and travel. The net weekly assessable income is calculated at £396.85. For unemployment assistance purposes the weekly benefit derived by an applicant from board and lodgings provided in the family home is assessed at 17 per cent of the net family weekly income. On this basis, the weekly means of the person concerned are calculated at £67.46 which is excess of the qualifying limit.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to his earlier Question No. 90 on 2 June last.</P>
      <P>Contributions paid by a person in the last year of his or her employment before reaching the age of 66 may be taken into account to satisfy one of the three qualifying conditions governing the old age (contributory) pension payment, namely that a person must have at least 156 contributions paid, or, if the yearly average is between ten and 19, at least 260 paid.</P>
      <P>However, such contributions may not be used to satisfy the qualifying condition of having a yearly average of at least ten contributions or 24 in the case of a retirement pension, registered since January 1953 when the unified system of social insurance came into effect, or the time they commenced insurable employment, if later, up to the end of the last complete contribution year before reaching pension age.</P>
      <P>As indicated in my previous reply, my Department is, at present, undertaking a detailed review of the qualifying conditions generally applying to the old age (contributory) and retirement pension schemes and in particular the operation of the yearly average condition. I will consider this issue further in the light of the outcome of this review.</P>

      <P>The person concerned applied for an old age, or non-contributory, pension in September 1998. This is a meanstested payment entitlement to which depends on the weekly value of the persons means.</P>
      <P>In assessing means for old age pension purposes, account is taken of any cash income the person may have, together with the value of any capital and the value of property owned but not personally used or enjoyed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The person concerned was awarded a pension at the weekly rate of £18.50 per week from 18 September 1998, based on a means assessment of <Col N="436" /> £59.40 a week, deriving from capital of £2,595 in the bank and an estimated value of £30,000 for property, i.e. a house owned but not personally used. He was also paid an over-80 allowance of £5.00 a week, living alone allowance of £6.00 a week and a fuel allowance of £5.00 a week, during the heating season from mid-October to mid-April. This award was made pending the valuation office valuation of the property concerned. This was received in January 1999 and estimated the value of the property at £50,000.</P>
    <P>In the light of this new information, the person concerned is no longer entitled to pension as his means, including the net yearly value of the property, exceed the current statutory limit of £82.00 per week.</P>
    <P>The person concerned was advised of this position on 13 April 1999 and invited to furnish any views or comments he had to offer before his entitlement was revised. The Deputy's reply on his behalf indicated the income being received from renting the property in question. Under the legislation, however, the capital value of the property and not the income it is producing, must be assessed.</P>
    <P>A formal decision on his entitlement to old age (non-contributory) pension will issue to the claimant shortly. He will also be advised of his right of appeal against the decision to the independent Social Welfare Appeals Office if he is dissatisfied with the decision.</P>
    <P>My Department is currently reviewing the method used to determine the value of capital and property but any change in the method of assessing the value of capital or property would require an amendment of the legislation. There would also be financial implications which would have to be considered on a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>The farm assist scheme was provided for in the Social Welfare Act, 1999 and is effective from 7 April 1999.</P>
      <P>At present there are some 7,000 claims in payment with approximately a further 1,400 claims under investigation or awaiting decision.</P>
      <P>The original estimate was that up to 14,000 farmers could benefit from farm assist. The build-up of claims has been slower than expected to date but is expected to pick up pace later in the year. The Department and the farming organisations have been publicising the scheme and will continue to do so.</P>
      <P>Farm assist represents a long-term safety net for farmers and is not simply a once-off response to a difficult situation. The scheme represents a significant improvement on previous arrangements and will provide ongoing and effective income support to farm families on low incomes.</P>

      <P>The back to work allowance, introduced in 1993, is designed to encourage the long-term unemployed to return to the active labour force. Some 28,000 persons currently avail of the scheme and are participating in employment or self-employment. A further 7,000 are participating on the back to work enterprise allowance, formerly known as the area allowance.</P>
      <P>An important feature of both schemes is that the participants are allowed to retain secondary benefits for the duration of the schemes provided that the combined gross household income is less than £250 per week. This limit has applied since 1993 and the majority of participants retain entitlement for the duration of the schemes.</P>
      <P>Differential rents is one of the secondary benefits which can be retained and local authorities were notified accordingly by the Department of the Environment and Local Government. The relevant circulars were issued by the Department of the Environment in July 1992 in relation to the area allowance and on March 1994 in relation to the back to work allowance.</P>

      <P>The person concerned does not qualify for optical benefit. To qualify, she would have needed 26 weeks reckonable contributions paid or credited in either of the two tax years prior to reaching 66 years. She has no reckonable contributions paid or credited in either of those tax years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="439" /> She does not qualify under the dependent spouses scheme based on her spouse's PRSI record as she is in receipt of an old age (contributory) pension and does not, therefore, satisfy the dependency condition of the scheme.</P>
    <P>If she is the holder of a medical card she may be entitled to some assistance towards her optical costs under the scheme administered by the health boards on behalf of the Department of Health and Children. Inquiries in this regard should be made at her local health board centre.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have recently received a number of representations on behalf of an organisation called Irish Multiple Births Association who are seeking to have the same rate of child benefit paid in respect of twins as applies to children of multiple births involving three or more children.</P>
      <P>The background to this issue is as follows. Prior to the introduction of the Social Welfare Act, 1998, child benefit was payable at double the normal rate for each child where three or more children were born together. In the case of twins, child benefit was paid at the normal rate but a grant of £500 was payable at the birth of twins and further grants of £500 were payable when the twins reached the ages of four and 12.       </P>
      <P>In fulfilment of pre-election commitments, I introduced two key additional measures in the Social Welfare Act, 1998. Firstly, the rate of child benefit payable in respect of twins was increased to 150 per cent of the normal child benefit rate. Secondly, the £500 grants, which previously were confined to families with twins, were extended to include also families with multiple births of three or more children. These measures took effect in September 1998. The estimated full-year cost of increasing the child benefit rate for twins was estimated to be £4.8 million. The cost of introducing double child benefit payments for twins would be of the same order of magnitude.</P>
      <P>The 1999 budget provides for an additional investment in the child benefit scheme of more than £40 million bringing expenditure on the scheme to £475 million in a full year. From September 1999, the basic rates of child benefit will be increased by £3 in respect of the first two children and £4 in respect of the third and subsequent children, bringing the rates up to £34.50 and £46.00 per month respectively. These improvements will benefit all families with children, including, of course, families with twins.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of providing for any further enhancement of the arrangements for twins under the child benefit scheme is a matter for <Col N="440" /> consideration in a budgetary context, in the light of the resources available and of other competing priorities.</P>

      <P>The range of child income supports provided under the social welfare system include child benefit, child dependant allowances, and the orphan's contributory allowance and orphan's (non-contributory) pension. In each case, provision exists for the award of these payments to the guardian of a child where the child's parents are not in a position to care for the child concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="441" /> Child benefit is normally paid to the child's mother or stepmother. If the child does not live with the mother or step-mother, then child benefit may be paid to the child's father or step-father who is living with and supporting the child. If the child is not living with or being maintained by the parents, then child benefit may be paid to the person who is looking after the child.</P>
    <P>A child dependant allowance is payable as an increase in the payment rate in respect of a child aged up to 18 who is living with a person who is receiving a social welfare payment. Where a person is receiving a long-term social welfare payment, the child dependant allowance is payable where the child is in full-time education up to the age of 22 years, or up to the end of the academic year after the twenty-second birthday.</P>
    <P>The orphan's contributory allowance is payable in cases where both parents are dead or where one parent is dead, unknown, has abandoned or refused or failed to the provide for the child and the other parent is unknown or has abandoned or has refused or failed to the provide for the child and the relevant PRSI insurance contribution conditions are satisfied. The payment is normally paid to the guardian of the child concerned.</P>
    <P>The orphan's (non-contributory) pension may be paid for a child who is not entitled to an orphan's (contributory) allowance. In this case, the payment is subject to a means test. Again, the payment is normally payable to the guardian of the child concerned.</P>
    <P>The conditions governing entitlement to foster care allowances are a matter for the Department of Health and Children.</P>

      <P>The law already contains directions to the court on issues concerning the upbringing of a child where parents cannot agree on such matters.</P>
      <P>Policy in the law as it stands in the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964 is that the court must, in deciding matters relating to the custody of and access to children, regard the welfare of the child as the first and paramount consideration. Subject to that important criterion, which is applicable in many other jurisdictions, the same Act empowers the court to give any direction it thinks proper in disputes concerning children and the court has powers to enforce any orders made.</P>
      <P>The Children Act, 1997 inserted new provisions in the Act of 1964 to specify that the court has discretion whether or not to order joint custody. In the course of passage of the Bill, I strengthened its provisions in this area with a provision that the court, in making decisions in relation to children, must have regard to whether the child's best interests would be served by maintaining personal relations and direct contact with both his or her father and mother on a regular basis. That provision was inspired by a provision in the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. The court must also, under a provision inserted by the Act of 1997, consider the wishes of the child in suitable cases.</P>
      <P>It is, of course, in the best interests of all concerned when parents can agree the arrangements in relation to the custody of and access to their children, rather than have the courts decide the matter. Of importance in this context is that the Act of 1997 places a new emphasis on alternative dispute resolution mechanisms involving counselling and mediation and obliges solicitors acting for the parties to bring the possibilities offered by such procedures to the attention of their clients. It is well recognised that, where couples are separating, counselling and mediation can offer lasting effects which may benefit themselves and their children. The Government has allocated substantial extra funding for the development of counselling and mediation services.</P>

      <P>The application for a certificate of naturalisation from the person referred to by the Deputy was submitted to this Department in September 1997. Having considered the application under the provisions of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Acts, 1956 and 1986 I decided in March 1999 not to grant a certificate of naturalisation. The person referred to was informed in writing of this decision at that time. The person referred to was also informed that I would be prepared to reconsider his application in February 2000, and that officials in my Department would be in touch with him prior to that time to give him an opportunity to update his application.

      <P>The various procedures involved in processing an application for a certificate of naturalisation in respect of a person of full age, coupled with the high number of applications being received, are resulting in applications taking in excess of one year to complete.

      <P>The matter referred to by the Deputy has been brought to the attention of the Garda authorities.</P>
      <P>I understand that the problem of begging at traffic junctions in the Dublin metropolitan area is an ongoing one, mainly involving non-nationals. To deal with the problem, the Garda authorities in March 1999, appointed an inspector in each district to evaluate the problem, and to develop and implement an appropriate strategy on a district basis. The strategies now in place are reviewed on a monthly basis to assess their continued effectiveness, with amendments made as and when necessary.</P>
      <P>With regard to enforcement, I am informed by the Garda authorities that in the period 1 January 1999 to 30 April 1999, a total of 79 prosecutions (all non-nationals) had been instituted and a further 46 cautions (all non-nationals) given to those involved in this activity.</P>
      <P>I have been further assured by the Garda authorities that the current proactive approach taken by the gardaí to this problem will be continued.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the content of leaving certificate and junior certificate examination papers has been the subject of much comment and analysis in the media in recent years. It is important that we view all such comment in a balanced way, having due regard for the need for validity, reliability and the maintenance of appropriate standards in our examination system.</P>
      <P>As outlined in &ldquo;Rules and Programme for Secondary Schools 1998/1999&rdquo;, &ldquo;at senior level it is recommended that geography should be taught from motives which include, but which go beyond, the narrow and traditional objectives of imparting geographical knowledge and the training of students in the recall of facts&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The syllabus goes on to note that &ldquo;the student should be taught to acquire facility in the use of the Geographer's mode of inquiry and skills, namely the reading and interpretation of aerial photographs, maps, pictures, tables and graphs and other written sources of materials as well as an involvement in the field work process of observation and recording. Thus, while imparting a body of knowledge that is useful and meaningful to the student, the Geography teacher must also be aware of his/her role in developing the students appreciation of abstract concepts and in gaining the facility in such matters as comprehension, analysis, synthesis and the application of information&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Applying the above criteria, the examination paper in geography (higher level) for 1999 falls within the given parameters of the stated aims and teaching objectives of the programme. It is also noteworthy that all topics on the examination paper have been examined on previous occasions, while many topics have been asked on numerous occasions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of calls were received from parents, students and teachers in relation to the paper in question. Concerns were expressed that the compulsory question 1 had been reduced from a three-part to a two-part question. There was also comment that, in the regional geography section, which contained four questions, of which candi<Col N="468" /> dates had to answer one, the candidates were asked to divide a country into regions using one of five given countries as an example rather than allowing them to choose one country themselves from among the fourteen countries stated in the syllabus. Callers were asked to put their complaints in writing and were told that all points made would be given full attention in the finalisation of the marking scheme at the examination conference.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware a full analysis of the examination paper is carried out by the team of markers at the examination conference with a view to finalising a marking scheme appropriate to the paper. Due allowance is made in the marking of scripts where any shortcomings in a particular paper or in a particular question are identified through this process.</P>
    <P>Apart from ensuring that this process takes place, the Deputy will, I hope, agree that it would be entirely inappropriate for me, as Minister, to intervene directly in the marking of scripts.</P>

      <P>For the purposes of the post-primary education scheme, the country has been divided into catchment areas, each of which has its own post-primary centre. Recognised post-primary pupils who live at least three miles from the post-primary centre of the catchment area in which they reside, are eligible for transport to that centre.</P>
      <P>Under the scheme, eligible pupils who wish to attend a post-primary centre other than their appropriate one may be allowed transport from within the catchment boundary of the centre attended, subject to spare accommodation being available on the service and provided that no additional State cost is incurred.</P>
      <P>The pupils from the Ballinalee area are not attending their nearest post-primary school and therefore they qualify only for catchment boundary transport to Moyne community school subject to availability of spare accommodation on the bus. Unfortunately there is no spare capacity on this service at present.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances, I regret that it is not open to my Department to provide additional seating to facilitate these catchment boundary pupils.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 264, 284, 285 and 286 together.</P>
      <P>These questions relate to the development of the Marlborough Street site at the Department of Education and Science. In my written reply to Question No. 104 on Thursday, 24 June, 1999 to Deputy Gregory, I gave details of the work involved in the development, and the duration of the contract.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the specific issues now raised, the position is that my Department has informed the board of management of Scoil Chaoimhín that in the event of an unacceptable level of air or noise pollution arising from the construction works, <Col N="471" /> double glazing windows and/or air conditioning will be provided.</P>
    <P>Similarly the board of management has been informed that it is the intention of my Department to renew the facade of Scoil Chaoimhín when the proposed building project on the site is completed.</P>
    <P>As regards the provision of car parking facilities, which is an integral part of the overall development, I am informed by the Office of Public Works that the closing date for the receipt of tenders is 30 June 1999, and that in these circumstances release of the estimated cost of the car park element of the project would be prejudicial to the tender competition. As pointed out in my earlier reply, all elements of the project are being financed in full by the Office of Public Works. Consequently the funding does not impact on the resources available to me for capital works in my Department.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will agree that the officials in my Department should no longer be required to work in sub-standard accommodation. Prior to my coming to office in June 1997 there was provision of £98 million for capital projects in the education sector whereas in the current year the allocation is £240 million.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the concerns expressed by the parents' committee of Scoil Chaoimhín in relation to the development and its impact on the school. My Department was represented at both recent meetings of the board of management. I accept that there will be inconvenience during the construction phase not only for Scoil Chaoimhín but also for the Department's staff and visitors to the Department. This is unavoidable, but the working group being set up consisting of the parents, board of management and the Office of Public Works should go a long way towards minimising any problems arising.</P>
    <P>Concern has been expressed by the parents at the lack of consultation with them. Communication with parents of pupils in the school is a matter in the first instance for the board of management. In this context, an official of my Department met with the board of management in the school over two years ago when they were given a general outline of the proposed development. Furthermore there was correspondence with the board of management in June 1997 regarding issues of concern to the school. In these circumstances it is difficult to understand why the parents were not aware of the proposed development.</P>
    <P>The physical planning of the project was carried out by a design team under the aegis of the Office of Public Works. In this regard, the Department, as tenants on the site, had no input into the design approach. This was entirely a mat<Col N="472" /> ter for the design architect and the Office of Public Works having regard to the constraints of the site including the presence of a number of listed buildings whose integrity had to be preserved in the design plan.</P>
    <P>I want to allay any fears parents or teachers may have in relation to the continued existence of Scoil Chaoimhín. This is not an issue in the proposed development. In fact, my Department has invited the board of management to submit details of any other improvement works which are considered necessary within the school. I am satisfied that on completion of the proposed project there will be a significant improvement in the environment for the children of Scoil Chaoimhín.</P>

      <P>To achieve maximum co-ordination of school transport services in relation to opening and closing of primary and post-primary schools, a calendar of school days is drawn up each year by the transport liaison officer in consultation with the schools involved.</P>
      <P>Where schools fail to agree a calendar, the transport liaison officer has instruction to draw up a calendar for the area which ensures that there is no duplication of service. All schools are given the opportunity to submit a calendar for the year before timetables are decided. The fact that a service did not operate to Scoil Mhuire Gan Smal on the dates mentioned by the Deputy was in line with the operation of a co-ordinated calendar which was drawn up earlier in the year.</P>
      <P>To sanction transport services for days outside the co-ordinated calendar would undermine the co-ordination process and would also involve significant extra costs which would not be justified. In the circumstances I cannot give the guarantee being sought by the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The link between public service pensions and pay was the subject of a Government decision which was announced on 4 November 1997. The Government decision was taken in the context of maintaining the traditional links between pensions and pay. The statement announcing the decision referred specifically to &ldquo;traditional parity&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Traditional parity in the case of teachers involves a distinction between incremental salary and allowances. In accordance with long-standing practice, the benefits of increases in salary are reflected in the pensions of all retired teachers and the benefits of allowances are reflected in the pensions of retired teachers who held those allowances during service. In accordance with this practice, teachers who retired prior to 1 August 1996 are not eligible to receive the benefit in their pensions of the long service allowance which was introduced with effect from that date.</P>
      <P>Similarly, principals and deputy principals who retired prior to 1 September 1996 are not eligible to benefit from the restructured scales of the post of responsibility allowances. The position in this case is that the amount of a principal's or deputy principal's allowance is determined by a scale which is related to the size of school involved. Any increase in the principal's or deputy principal's allowance which arises due to the restructuring of the scale is payable only to retired teachers who have received an increase in pay as a result of holding the scale point in question during service. An increase arising from the restructuring of the scale is not payable, therefore, to teachers who retired prior to 1 September 1996. This is in line with the long-standing practice that the scale of an allowance payable is determined at the date of retirement and that the retired teacher will continue to receive the benefit of the scale reached at retirement irrespective of whether enrolments in the school fall or rise after retirement.</P>

      <P>Phase two of the development of Castleknock Community College, which is scheduled for completion later this year, will increase the capacity of the school to 1,100 pupils.</P>
      <P>My Department has been in contact with County Dublin VEC and, as a result, I am satisfied that the school's enrolment policy will ensure that its increased capacity will be maximised.</P>
      <P>Generally, my policy is to ensure that all of the schools in an area can, between them, accommodate all of the pupils presenting for enrolment. This is not to say, however, that all pupils will gain admission to the school of first choice.</P>
      <P>I am conscious that there is considerable development in the Dublin 15 area and I can assure the Deputy that my Department is monitoring the position closely, in consultation with Fingal County Council.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>This question is about the arrears of pension due to some retired teachers under Partnership 2000. It is not correct to say that, on 1 April 1998, retired teachers were due an increase of 2.5 per cent under Partnership 2000 &ndash; what they were due on 1 April 1998 was the second round of the first phase of Partnership 2000.</P>
      <P>The first round of the first phase was paid to all retired teachers in autumn 1997: it amounted to the benefit in pension, with effect from 1 July 1997, of an increase corresponding to an increase of 2.5 per cent of the first £10,436 of annual pay. The second round, due on 1 April 1998, was an increase in pension of the balance due under the first phase. In order to calculate the balance due under the first phase of Partnership 2000, it is first necessary to complete the calculation of how much is due under the PCW agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The PCW Agreement is a complex one and its final elements, those concerning in-school management, were not agreed until early 1998. In <Col N="481" /> order to cope with implementation of its provisions, including paying pension arrears, my Department has taken on additional staff, both permanent and temporary. The permanent staff involved in pensions has been increased by 70 per cent, from 16 in 1997 to 27 currently. Following agreement with the staff unions, my Department also appointed ten temporary clerical officers to pensions work in June 1998.</P>
    <P>The pace of the work of payment has, however, been affected by the fact that normal retirements, which reached a record level in 1997, have continued to occur at the same high level &ndash; 50 per cent higher than in 1996. The work has also been delayed by difficulties in replacing temporary staff who have left from time to time. These difficulties have resulted from an agreement made at central level between the Department of Finance and the staff unions regarding the recruitment of temporary staff. Following discussions with the staff unions, I am glad to say that an agreement has now been reached which will facilitate the speedy replacement of temporary staff on an ongoing basis.</P>
    <P>The pace of the work of payment was also affected, throughout 1998, by the amount of queries received on a daily basis regarding one of the elements of the PCW agreement &ndash; the agreement that the secondary teachers superannuation scheme would become a compulsory scheme and that all secondary teachers would be given the opportunity of purchasing for pensions purposes all periods of service given by them prior to their admission to the scheme. The closing date for applying to purchase service was originally agreed as 31 August 1998 but it was later agreed to extend it to 30 October 1998.</P>
    <P>With effect from January 1999, the number of queries received regarding the benefits of the PCW agreement and regarding superannuation generally have been greatly reduced through the issue to all secondary teachers of a comprehensive information booklet, in a question and answer format, on the secondary teachers' superannuation scheme. Similar booklets are being prepared for issue to primary teachers and vocational teachers.</P>
    <P>The position at this stage is that all 11,000 retired teachers have received, under Partnership 2000, the benefit in pension of an increase corresponding to an increase of 2.5 per cent of the first £10,436 of annual pay. In addition, all have received, at minimum, an increase of 3 per cent in pension, backdated to 1 July 1998. With regard to outstanding arrears, the position is that a dedicated group of staff are working full-time with a view to making outstanding payments to the retired teachers involved as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>Under the terms of the third level student support schemes, maintenance grants are not payable to candidates who already hold an undergraduate degree and are pursuing a second undergraduate degree. Similarly tuition fees under the free fees initiative are not payable in respect of a second period of college attendance on a course at the same level.</P>
      <P>As the student referred to by the Deputy already holds a degree from the National University of Ireland, Galway she is ineligible for a higher education grant or to benefit under the free fees initiative in respect of the degree course she is currently pursuing at St. Patrick's College, Drumcondra, Dublin.</P>
      <P>I understand that the student in question is in receipt of the back to education allowance of £73.50 per week from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. Finally, I would mention that my Department operates a hardship fund which is administered through the third level institutions. This fund is designed to assist students who might otherwise because of financial reasons suffer hardship or be unable to continue their third level studies. In this regard, the student in question should be advised to apply to the Bursar's Office, St. Patrick's College, Drumcondra.</P>

In the case in question, the service did not meet these criteria and accordingly the application was disallowed. I am not aware of the circumstances of the Gaelscoil to which the Deputy refers.

      <P>The last general expansion of the disad<Col N="486" /> vantaged areas scheme at primary level took place in 1994. The school referred to by the Deputy applied for inclusion on that occasion but did not rank sufficiently high in terms of priority of need to secure inclusion at that time.</P>
      <P>A study of educational disadvantage conducted by the Combat Poverty Agency and the Education Research Centre in 1996 concluded that disadvantaged status should be confined to 16 per cent of the school-going population. The study noted that such status had already been granted to 17 per cent of pupils. As an alternative to extending the disadvantaged areas scheme to additional schools, the study recommended that available resources should be targeted on the most disadvantaged schools.</P>
      <P>The breaking the cycle pilot project was subsequently introduced to deliver the sort of targeted support recommended in the study. The operation of this project is being closely monitored by my Department's inspectorate and the project is being evaluated by the Education Research Centre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My immediate priority at present is to extend the home-school-community liaison service to all first and second level schools which have been designated as disadvantaged and which currently do not have access to the liaison service. Arrangements to put this extension of service in place from September next are currently being made in my Department. As the school in question does <Col N="487" /> not have disadvantaged status, it will not be included in this extension.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that the needs of the school to which he refers will be fully considered in the event of any additional initiatives being taken to address educational disadvantage.</P>
    <P>My Department has no record of an application for a resource teacher post from the school in question. The school authorities may apply for such support through their school inspector as recently notified in circular 8/99.</P>

I am anxious to preserve the approach being adopted currently within the centre where a variety of agencies contribute funds, expertise and vision towards an integrated multi-faceted response to the needs of young people at risk. I have asked the VEC to engage in discussions locally as to how this diversity can be preserved while putting the overall management and funding of activities on a more structured and transparent basis within the context of an integrated area-based approach. A meeting on this issue has been arranged to take place in the next few days.</P>

      <P>The financial allocations for vocational schools and community colleges are made to the vocational education committees as part of a block grant to cover VEC head office overheads and other activities apart from the second-level programme. Voluntary secondary schools are funded on a per capita basis based upon enrolments.</P>
      <P>The matter of equity of funding between the various sectors at second-level is currently being examined by a steering group on funding which has available to it the report of a technical working group. Under its terms of reference, the group will draw up a recommended funding framework designed to ensure equal treatment for different schools within the second-level sector while taking account of the needs of these different schools. The group's recommendations when available will inform future developments in relation to the funding of schools.</P>
